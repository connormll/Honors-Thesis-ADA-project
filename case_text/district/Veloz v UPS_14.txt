ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DKT. 46]

RULING
Before the court is Defendant United Parcel Service's1 ("Defendant" or "UPS-SCS") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"). Dkt. 46 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Maria Veloz ("Plaintiff" or "Veloz") opposes the Motion. Dkt. 49 ("Opp'n"). On January 23, 2023, the court found this matter appropriate for resolution without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for January 27, 2023. Dkt. 51; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15.
For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion.

BACKGROUND2
As a [*2]  preliminary matter, the court addresses Defendant's request to disregard Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact for failure to comply with the court's standing order. Dkt. 50 ("Reply") at 5. In support of its Motion, Defendant filed a Statement of Uncontroverted Facts with supporting evidence in compliance with the court's Standing Order and Local Rule 56-1. See Dkt. 16 at 7.d.i. In Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts, she concedes most of Defendant's proffered facts are undisputed. Plaintiff, however, deletes several rows of factual statements contained in Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and disputes the facts without any supporting evidence. Dkt. 49-5. This fails to comply with the court's Initial Standing Order requiring the opposing party to a Rule 56 Motion to submit a Statement of Genuine Dispute of Material Facts "track[ing] the movant's separate statement exactly as prepared." Dkt. 16 at 7.d.i.
Consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Central District's Local Rules, the court considers as admitted those facts Plaintiff has deleted or not disputed with supporting evidence, and deems Plaintiff to have conceded grounds for [*3]  the motion she does not expressly oppose. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(e) ("If a party... fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may . . . consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion."); Local Rule 56-3 ("the Court may assume that the material facts as claimed and adequately supported by the moving party are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are (a) included in the 'Statement of Genuine Disputes' and (b) controverted by declaration or other written evidence filed in opposition to the motion."). As a result, the following are the undisputed material facts.

A. Plaintiff's Employment at UPS-SCS
Plaintiff was hired by UPS-SCS3 as a full-time Warehouse Worker II on September 13, 2017. SUF ¶ 1-2. She was assigned to the UPS-SCS Mira Loma facility which primarily served a single customer account, Adidas. SUF ¶ 74; Dkt. 46-2, Declaration of Jaymee Smith ("Smith Decl.") ¶ 2. The employees at the Mira Loma facility organized, handled, and shipped packages containing Adidas merchandise. SUF ¶ 75; Smith Decl. ¶ 2.
A warehouse worker's essential duties consist of packing, organizing, and moving items and packages that weigh up to 60 [*4]  pounds. Smith Decl. ¶ 3; Ex. T. To execute the essential functions as a Warehouse Worker II, Plaintiff was required to make repetitive arm movements to reach and lift over her shoulders, and frequently lift packages ranging from 40-50 pounds. SUF ¶ 3.
From September 2017 to June 2018, Plaintiff was designated as a "picker." Smith Decl. ¶ 3; SUF ¶ 4. As a picker, Plaintiff's duties were to read customer orders on a handheld electronic device and "pick" the corresponding items for that order from a gravity roller line. SUF ¶ 4. Plaintiff was required to place the picked items into bins on a shelving rack to be boxed and packaged for shipping. Id. Plaintiff would then move the items from the bins into boxes and stack the boxes on the pallet for shipping. Smith Decl. ¶ 3. As customer orders, instructions, and packaging labels were in English, this role also required Plaintiff to read and speak English. SUF ¶¶ 5, 76.

B. Plaintiff's Work Injury, Work Restrictions, and Temporary Assignment
On June 13, 2018, Plaintiff met with a physical therapist and was examined by a physician's assistant who restricted her from lifting anything more than five pounds. SUF ¶ 6-7. Plaintiff was given "General [*5]  Restrictions" which included "no forceful grasping of [her] left hand/wrists and no repetitive use of [her] upper extremity." Id. ¶ 8. The following day, on June 14, 2018, Plaintiff indicated feeling a lot of pain in her left arm and reported it as a work injury from the repetitive work she was performing. Id. ¶¶ 9-10.
UPS-SCS then offered Plaintiff a Temporary Alternative Work ("TAW") assignment modifying her responsibilities to "only making boxes and [handling] housekeeping activities." SUF ¶ 11; Ex. I. In accepting the TAW assignment, Plaintiff accepted and signed the TAW status form, which acknowledges that her limited responsibilities under the TAW assignment "will allow her to work within her restrictions while still contributing to support the team" and that "Operations/Account will be accommodating restrictions." Ex. I. At this time, it was predicted the TAW assignment would last approximately four days; however, Plaintiff remained in the TAW assignment until September 2018 during which time she remained restricted to the same work conditions. SUF ¶¶ 12-13.

C. Plaintiff Stops Performing Work for UPS-SCS
On September 13, 2018, Plaintiff received instructions from her doctor ordering [*6]  "no activity" and "no repetitive work with left arm," removing her from performing duties at UPS-SCS entirely. SUF ¶¶ 14, 35. Thus, September 13, 2018 was Plaintiff's last day performing work for UPS-SCS. SUF ¶¶ 14-15. She remained under the same "no activity" and "no repetitive work" restriction until February 2019. Id.
Approximately three weeks after Plaintiff stopped performing work at UPS-SCS, on October 5, 2018, Plaintiff met with her doctor and reported suffering "sharp, aching pain" rated at a level of "10/10 pain." SUF ¶ 16. Plaintiff reported having "limitations to gripping, grasping, pushing, pulling, lifting, driving, keyboarding, mousing, typing and reaching." Id. The doctor noted Plaintiff had shoulder movements limited by pain, a provisional diagnosis of numerous problems with her left arm ranging from her hands to her shoulders, and ordered her "work status" as "[o]ff work, no[] activity until [the follow up in 2 weeks]." SUF ¶ 17; Ex. X at 3.
On February 14, 2019, Plaintiff was released to work under the conditions of "[n]o lifting, pushing or pulling over 10 pounds of force. Limited reaching above the shoulders." SUF ¶ 18; Ex. K at 4. Due to the restrictions, Plaintiff [*7]  was not qualified to return to her position as a UPS-SCS Warehouse Worker II position. SUF ¶ 18.

D. "Totally Temporarily Disabled" Status
On May 29, 2019, Plaintiff's primary treating physician, Dr. Simpson, issued her work status as "placed on temporarily totally disabled." SUF ¶ 19; Ex. E at 9. The physician opined the cause of Plaintiff's total temporary disability as "the direct result of repetitive trauma she received while performing the usual and customary work duties as a Packer while working for a year and a half for UPS. The patient was required to lift heavy boxes." SUF ¶ 20; Ex. Y. Plaintiff met with her physician monthly, and from June 2019 through December 2019, Plaintiff's work status remained as "placed on temporarily totally disabled." SUF ¶ 21. Plaintiff met with another physician, Dr. Gumbs, on October 29, 2019, who confirmed she was temporarily totally disabled because she could not perform the essential functions of her job. SUF ¶ 22.
As a result of her "totally disabled" status and her inability to work, Plaintiff received worker's compensation benefits from March 2019 to December 2019. SUF ¶ 23. As part of her worker's compensation benefits, Plaintiff was directed [*8]  to attend computer training classes at Ryan College. SUF ¶ 39; Ex. D at 92. Plaintiff, however, was unable to complete the classes because of her medical conditions affecting her wrists, elbows, shoulders, and neck. SUF ¶ 41; Ex. D. at 92.
On January 23, 2020, Plaintiff was examined by another physician, Dr. Uppal. SUF ¶ 24. Plaintiff reported she had "joint pain, muscle pain, and muscle weakness." Id. Dr. Uppal's report reiterates the same work restrictions imposed on Plaintiff since February 2019. SUF ¶ 55. Dr. Uppal's follow up report noted no signs of anxiety, depression, and mood changes, but noted signs of positive shoulder impingement. As a result, Dr. Uppal changed her treatment plan to "may work with limitations of no heavy lifting 10#. No repetitive over shoulder activity. If this work is not available, she will be on temporary total disability." SUF ¶¶ 26, 58. Even with this modified work restriction, Plaintiff did not qualify to return to her position as a UPS-SCS Warehouse Worker II because the duties of the position required her to do tasks she could not perform ̶ repetitive work with her arms, lifting over her shoulders, and lifting packages over 40 pounds. SUF ¶ 27.
 [*9] Throughout this period, Plaintiff could not perform the essential job duties of her Warehouse Worker II position or any position involving the use of a computer.4 SUF ¶ 42. During this time, Plaintiff was not medically treated for anxiety, depression, or stress. SUF ¶ 60. Each of her physicians's reports indicated she had no signs of anxiety, depression, and mood changes. Ex. E; Ex. K at 2; Ex. X at 3; Ex. Y at 20.

E. Plaintiff's Discussions with UPS-SCS Human Resources (HR)
According to Plaintiff, she followed up with UPS-SCS's Human Resources ("HR") department every month to provide doctor's notes and to check for any open positions that would meet Plaintiff's work restrictions. SUF ¶¶ 37, 100, 106. Plaintiff claims HR representative Amanda Mondragon represented each time that no positions meeting Plaintiff's work restrictions were available. SUF ¶ 38. According to Plaintiff, she was directed to go home and advised that someone would contact her. SUF ¶ 102.
In January 2020, a HR representative inquired whether Plaintiff could use a computer and Plaintiff responded she could not. SUF ¶ 39. The jobs available at the Mira Loma UPS-SCS facility consisted of management positions, [*10]  and mostly warehouse worker positions with a few administrative positions requiring the use of a computer to perform the essential job duties. Smith Decl. ¶ 4. Positions involving computers at the UPS-SCS Mira Loma facility required an ability to work with computers, English proficiency to read instructions, ability to communicate through emails, and make and run reports. SUF ¶ 78; Smith Decl. ¶ 4. According to Plaintiff, she did not submit any paperwork regarding ADA accommodations and never applied for any other job with UPS-SCS. SUF ¶¶ 46-46.

F. UPS-SCS's Twelve-Month Administrative Policy
UPS-SCS's administrative policy separates employees who are on leave for over twelve months and are unable to return to work with or without accommodation. SUF ¶ 29. This twelve-month administrative policy is set out in UPS's "The Flexible Benefits Plan Summary Plan Description," which states "if you are absent from your regular occupation for 12 months, you will be administratively separated from employment, regardless of your status on STD or LTD." Ex. B at 2. This policy is neutral regarding the reason why an employee is on leave. SUF ¶ 30. Plaintiff is not aware of any UPS-SCS employee who was [*11]  on leave for more than twelve-months without being administratively separated. SUF ¶ 33.

G. Discrimination or Harassment
Plaintiff acknowledged UPS-SCS's anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies in her application. SUF ¶ 79. According to Plaintiff, she never experienced harassment or discrimination, nor did she ever feel harassed or discriminated against during her employment at UPS-SCS. Ex. D at 32-33, 79. As such, Plaintiff never made a complaint of discrimination or harassment while employed at UPS-SCS. SUF ¶ 56; Ex. D at 32-33.

H. Plaintiff's Separation
Plaintiff remained on leave for sixteen months. SUF ¶ 31. Plaintiff received all leave she was entitled to under the law, including under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and California Family Rights Act (CFRA). SUF ¶ 28. Plaintiff also acknowledges she was not denied any legally protected leave or that UPS-SCS violated its twelve-month administrative policy. SUF ¶ 34.
In a letter dated January 29, 2020, Plaintiff was informed of her separation from UPS-SCS. SUF ¶ 32. The letter stated, in pertinent part: "Our records indicate that you have been absent from work for more than 12 months. As a result, your employment with [*12]  UPS has been administratively terminated due to the length of your absence. This administrative termination occurs regardless of your status on Short Term Disability or Long Term Disability." Ex. L.

I. Administrative Proceedings and this Action
On September 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Complaint ("DFEH Complaint") with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). SUF ¶ 61; Ex. S at 5. Plaintiff's DFEH Complaint consists of four general allegations, SUF ¶¶ 62, 69, namely, that, on January 29, 2020, UPS-SCS took adverse actions, SUF ¶ 63, and that Plaintiff suffered a work-related injury, requested accommodation and was denied, was discriminated against because of her disability, and was retaliated against and terminated. SUF ¶¶ 64-66; see generally Ex. S at 5. On September 16, 2020, DFEH notified Plaintiff by letter that her case was closed because "an immediate Right to Sue notice was requested." Ex. S at 4.
On October 19, 2021, Plaintiff filed this action for employment discrimination under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") and Government Code Section 12940, et seq. See generally Dkt. 1-1 ("Compl."). The Complaint alleges claims for (1) disability discrimination under FEHA; (2) retaliation under [*13]  FEHA; (3) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress. Dkt. 1-1 ¶¶ 14-37.

DISCUSSION

I. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each claim upon which the moving party seeks judgment. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Facts are "material" only if dispute about them may affect the outcome of the case under applicable substantive law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. Id.
If the moving party meets its initial burden, the opposing party must then set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial to defeat the motion. Id. at 247-48; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e). Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that [*14]  party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The court must decide whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in light of the facts presented by the nonmoving party, along with any undisputed facts. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 & n. 3 (9th Cir. 1987). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, "the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Id. "If the nonmoving party produces direct evidence of a material fact, the court may not assess the credibility of this evidence nor weigh against it any conflicting evidence presented by the moving party. ... Inferences from the nonmoving party's 'specific facts' as to other material facts, however, may be drawn only if they are reasonable in view of other undisputed background or contextual facts and only if such inferences are otherwise permissible under the governing substantive law." T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 631-32. "[S]ummary judgment should not be granted where contradictory inferences may reasonably be drawn from undisputed [*15]  evidentiary facts...." Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal Co. v. Turley, 622 F.2d 1324, 1335 (9th Cir. 1980). The nonmoving party, however, must not simply rely on the pleadings and must do more than make "conclusory allegations [in] an affidavit." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.
"After giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, the court may: (1) grant summary judgment for a nonmovant; (2) grant the motion on grounds not raised by a party; or (3) consider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).

II. Analysis

A. FEHA Disability Discrimination
Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims for wrongful discharge, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, and failure to engage in an interactive process. The court discusses each in turn.

1. Wrongful Termination
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of a physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). FEHA does not, however, prohibit an employer from discharging an employee with a physical disability "if the employee, because of a physical. . . disability, is unable to perform the employee's essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination [*16]  based on a physical disability under FEHA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Alamillo v. BNSF Ry. Co., 869 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th, 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007)).
California has adopted the burden-shifting test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), to analyze employment discrimination and retaliation claims under FEHA. Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 236, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841, (2016). Under the McDonnell Douglas test, plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation based on the disability. Id. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the defendant can provide such a reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show the employer's reason is "false or pretextual" or offer evidence showing the employer had a discriminatory motive. Id.
In the context of an employer-defendant's motion for summary judgment, the McDonnell-Douglas burdens are reversed because the party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden. Id. Under this framework, "[i]f the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff's [*17]  prima facie elements is lacking, or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors, the employer will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 344, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008).

a. Prima Facie Case
As an initial matter, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff was disabled for the purposes of FEHA. Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's prima facie case fails on the second element because she concedes she could not perform the essential job duties of her Warehouse Worker II position with or without accommodation. Mot at 12. The court agrees. See SUF ¶ 42.
"A qualified individual is someone who is able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). Section 12940 "specifically limits the reach of [FEHA], excluding from coverage those persons who are not qualified, even with reasonable accommodation, to perform essential job duties." Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). "'Essential functions [is defined as] the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Cal. Gov't Code §12926(f). "[The] plaintiff employee bears the burden of proving he [*18]  or she was able to perform the job's essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation." Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 262.
Plaintiff concedes that most of the facts in the case are not in dispute. Plaintiff's essential job functions as a Warehouse Worker II included repetitive work with her arms, reaching and lifting over her shoulders, and lifting packages weighing approximately 40 to 50 pounds. SUF ¶3; Ex. D at 26:9-28:10. The Warehouse Worker II job description lists the "essential job functions" in pertinent part as: "must be able to safely grasp, lift (from floor to shoulder height), lower (from shoulder height to floor), push, pull, carry and maintain control manipulating equipment, packages or parts weigh[ing] up to     pounds; perform tasks using simple hand grasping, fine hand manipulation and reach associated with assigned tasks. . . picking/packing." Ex. T at 3; See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2), (f)(2)(B) ("Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes. . . [w]ritten job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job."); see also Cal. Gov't Code §12926(f)(1), (f)(1)(A) ("A job function may be considered essential. . . because the reason the position exists is to perform that function.").
Here, Plaintiff's medical records [*19]  and testimony show Plaintiff could not perform these essential functions as she was restricted from repetitive hand, elbow, and wrist movements; reaching and lifting over her shoulders; lifting more than five pounds; and restricted to "no activity" by her physicians. At her deposition, Plaintiff acknowledged she was unable to perform her essential job functions as a Warehouse Worker II and could not return to the same position. SUF ¶36. When asked, "why do you believe your termination was unjustified?" Plaintiff responded, "[w]ell, because I wanted to work, but I couldn't. It wasn't that I didn't want to." Ex D at 83:3-9. Plaintiff was then asked, "[a]t any time were you able to perform the job that you had previously performed?" Plaintiff responds, "[n]o, I couldn't." Ex. D at 83:11-13. In the follow up question, Plaintiff was asked, "[a]nd are you aware of any jobs that you could have performed with the restrictions that you were under? Plaintiff responded, "[n]o." Ex. D at 83:14-18.
Starting from Plaintiff's first medical examination concerning her work-related pain, her physicians repeatedly verified she could not perform the essential functions of the Warehouse Worker II position. [*20]  On June 13, 2018, Plaintiff was first limited to lifting no more than five pounds and restricted from "forceful grasping [of her] left hand/wrist" and from "repetitive use [of her] upper extremity." SUF ¶¶7-8. A day after she was given her restrictions, Plaintiff injured her left arm from the repetitive work and was then offered a lighter accommodation making boxes and handling housekeeping duties. SUF ¶¶10-11. During that time, Plaintiff was unable to lift more than five pounds or make any repetitive movements with her left arm. SUF ¶13. After three months of performing lighter duties, however, Plaintiff's physician eventually ordered her to stop work completely and restricted her to "no activity" and "no repetitive work with [her] left arm." SUF ¶¶ 14, 35. In light of the "no activity" and "off work" restrictions imposed on Plaintiff, no reasonable fact finder could find that Plaintiff could physically perform the essential duties of a Warehouse Worker II or any other available position.
During the time she was off work, rather than improving, Plaintiff's condition persisted as she reported experiencing "sharp, aching pain" rated "10/10", and informed her physician she had "limitations [*21]  ... gripping, grasping, pushing, pulling, lifting, driving, keyboarding, mousing, typing and reaching." SUF ¶16; Ex. X at 1. Plaintiff's physicians continued her "off work" status and restricted her to "no activity." SUF ¶ 17; Ex. X at 3. Nothing in the physicians's notes implies Plaintiff could have worked "with reasonable accommodation." See Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 264 ("FEHA . . . limit[s] [its] protective scope to those employees with a disability who can perform the essential duties of the employment position with [or without] reasonable accommodation.").
Plaintiff asserts she could have worked in February 2019 when her physician lifted the "off work" status and modified her restrictions. Opp'n at 8. The change, however, had minimal impact in her ability to perform the functions of her job. The restrictions at that time - "[n]o lifting, pushing or pulling over 10 pounds of force[;] [l]imited reaching above the shoulders" - still prevented her from performing the duties of her position. SUF ¶ 18; Ex. K at 4. Moreover, Plaintiff admits that under the modified restrictions, she was still not qualified to return to her position because it required tasks she was physically unable to accomplish. SUF ¶ 18.
Plaintiff's [*22]  condition declined even further during her time off, and in May 2019, she was placed on temporarily "totally disabled" status. SUF ¶ 19. This precluded her from performing any work duties. From May 29, 2019, to December 2019, Plaintiff met with her physician, Dr. Simpson, monthly, and each time, Dr. Simpson ordered her work status as placed on temporarily "totally disabled." SUF ¶ 21. On October 29, 2019, a different physician, Dr. Gumbs, evaluated Plaintiff and confirmed her "temporarily totally disabled" status based on Plaintiff's inability to perform her essential job functions. SUF ¶ 22; Ex. Q at 3, 14-15. Dr. Gumbs confirmed that the essential duties of her position were the cause and exacerbation of her condition. Id. Plaintiff conceded at her deposition that from September 2018, through the date of the deposition, October 11, 2022, her physicians never stated that she could return to work without any restrictions. Ex. D, 55:12-55:16.
According to the evidence, including Plaintiff's testimony, her medical records, and the nature of her position, no dispute of material fact exists concerning Plaintiff's inability to perform the essential duties of her job with or without accommodation. [*23]  Likewise, Plaintiff cannot show she was "qualified" to be a Warehouse Worker II with or without reasonable accommodation. Defendant has met its burden to show that Plaintiff is unable to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination.

b. Separation Based on Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Even if a prima facie case was established and the burden shifted, Plaintiff cannot show the reason for her discharge was a pretext for disability discrimination. Here, Defendant has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's termination was based on UPS-SCS's administrative policy (the "policy"). The policy separates employees who are on leave for longer than twelve months regardless of the reason for leave. Ex. B at 2. The policy clearly states "if you are absent from your regular occupation for 12 months, you will be administratively separated from employment, regardless of your status on STD or LTD." Id. Plaintiff was absent from her Warehouse Worker II position for sixteen months, a period longer than twelve months. SUF ¶ 31. As a result, Plaintiff was discharged. Substantiating this reason, the letter separating plaintiff states "[o]ur [*24]  records indicate that you have been absent from work for more than 12 months. As a result, your employment with UPS has been administratively terminated due to the length of your absence." Ex. L.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's reason was not legitimate and a pretext for disability discrimination because "[Defendant] did not follow the policy according to its terms or it would have terminated [Plaintiff earlier] in September 2019." Opp'n at 13. Plaintiff, however, fails to explain how terminating Plaintiff's employment later — after sixteen months instead of twelve — shows a discriminatory motive or is pretextual for disability discrimination. See United States v. Graf, 610 F.3d 1148, 1166 (9th Cir. 2010) ("Arguments made in passing and not supported by citations to the record or to case authority are generally deemed waived.").
Here, there are no triable issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff's termination was based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Plaintiff does not raise a material issue of fact to the contrary. Plaintiff acknowledges UPS-SCS's policy is to terminate employees who are on leave for over twelve months and are unable to return to work with or without accommodation. SUF ¶ 29. Plaintiff admits UPS-SCS's policy is [*25]  neutral and that Defendant did not violate its policy. SUF ¶¶ 30, 34. Plaintiff concedes she was not denied any legally protected leave and was absent for sixteen months. SUF ¶ 34. Plaintiff also acknowledges she is not aware of any UPS-SCS employee who was on leave more than twelve months without being administratively separated. SUF ¶ 33. In sum, Plaintiff's separation was necessitated under the policy due to the length of her absence. The court finds the reason for Plaintiff's termination was legitimate and nondiscriminatory. See Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 344 (Under FEHA, an employer may terminate an employee for any reason "as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason. . . [or] pretext for illegal discrimination.").
Accordingly, the court finds summary judgment proper as to Plaintiff's claim for wrongful discharge based on disability discrimination. See Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal. App. 5th 696, 720, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017) (concluding plaintiffs failed to prove a prima facie case for FEHA discrimination claim based on injured police officer's inability to participate in physical training, which was an essential function of a police recruit, even with reasonable accommodation); Mack v. Fed. Express Corp., No. 21-CV-1705-SB-JCx, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4838, 2022 WL 2102889, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2022) (granting summary judgment on plaintiff's FEHA disability discrimination claim because [*26]  he was not qualified to be a package handler as the position required him to perform work he medically could not do with or without reasonable accommodation); Allen v. Pac. Bell, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1180, 1195 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (granting summary judgment on plaintiff's disability discrimination claim because he failed to show he was qualified to do his job with or without reasonable accommodation), aff'd, 348 F.3d 1113 (9th Cir. 2003).

2. Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claim for Failure to Accommodate
Under FEHA, an employer is required to make reasonable accommodation for the known disability of an employee unless it would produce undue hardship to its operation. Cal. Gov't Code §12940(m)(1). A reasonable accommodation is "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (quotations omitted). An employer's failure to provide reasonable accommodation to a disabled employee violates FEHA. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
The elements of a claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodation are: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 373. Plaintiff [*27]  has the burden to show she is able to perform the essential functions of the job with accommodation. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 977-78, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).

a. Elements of a Prima Facie Case
The court first addresses whether Plaintiff is required to prove she was "qualified" to perform the essential functions of her job to establish a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate under FEHA. Plaintiff argues she does not. Opp'n at 16. In support, Plaintiff relies on Bagatti v. Department of Rehabilitation, 97 Cal. App. 4th 344, 362, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002), which held that under § 12940(m), an employer must provide reasonable accommodation to an employee even if she is not "qualified" to perform the essential job functions. Bagatti, however, expressly diverges from cases decided in this district. Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1054 n.16 (C.D. Cal. 2005).
As Defendant correctly points out, Diaz expressly disagreed with Bagatti and held that "while subdivision (m) does not make reference to plaintiff's occupation qualifications, the [FEHA] statute as a whole clearly institutes a requirement that a plaintiff be 'qualified.'" Id. Other California courts have also expressly disagreed with Bagatti's holding and required a plaintiff to show he is "qualified" and able to perform the essential job functions. See Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 975, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (explaining how Bagatti's holding produces absurd results); Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 42, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021) (analyzing plaintiff's ability to perform the essential functions [*28]  with or without accommodation of her former or vacant position as a requisite element of plaintiff's prima facie case); Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10 (requiring a plaintiff to be "qualified" to perform the essential functions of the position as a requisite element to prevail on a claim for failure to make reasonable accommodation); Wilson v. Cnty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009) (same). Consistent with the majority view, this court finds that a plaintiff must show she was "qualified" to perform the essential job functions to prevail on a claim for failure to accommodate.

b. Plaintiff is not "Qualified"
The reasonable accommodation analysis to determine whether a plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job is the same as that under the disability discrimination under Section 12940(a). Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 378; see Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). As discussed above, the record shows no material issue of fact exists as to Plaintiff's inability to perform the essential functions of her Warehouse Worker II position with or without reasonable accommodation. Equally, Plaintiff cannot establish she was a "qualified" employee. Thus, Plaintiff's prima facie case for failure to provide reasonable accommodation fails. See Calderon v. Fresenius USA, Inc., No. 20-CV-7869-PSG-JEMx, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96707, 2022 WL 3012180, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2022) (granting summary judgment on failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim for plaintiff's [*29]  failure to show plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation).

c. No Vacant Positions for Which Plaintiff was "Qualified"
"Reasonable accommodation may also include 'reassignment to a 'vacant position' if the employee cannot perform the essential functions of his or her position even with accommodation." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 377 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p)(2)). Here, it is undisputed no vacant position was available for which Plaintiff could perform the essential duties, and Plaintiff has not identified any such position for which she was qualified. See Calderon, No. CV 20-7869-PSG-JEMx, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96707, 2022 WL 3012180, at *11. Plaintiff admitted at her deposition she could not return to work because no position for which she was qualified was available and confirmed that HR expressly communicated this fact to her. Ex. D at 58:10-19; SUF ¶ 38. Plaintiff further concedes she has no knowledge of such a position existing during the relevant time. Ex. D at 58:14-19.
An employer is not required to eliminate any essential job function, or promote or accommodate an employee's disability by creating a new position that allows the employee to perform only those tasks an employee is physically capable of performing. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(b); See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 374-78. Although Plaintiff argues Defendant [*30]  could have made a position available with some effort, there is no evidence Defendant could nor was it required to. See Opp'n at 18. According to Defendant, Plaintiff mistakes UPS-SCS for the "huge corporation" that is UPS with "multiple location and multiple shifts" when she argues that Defendant could have made a position available. See id.; Reply at 8-9. Unlike its corporate parent, UPS, positions at UPS-SCS are much more limited. Reply at 8-9. UPS-SCS attempted to work with Plaintiff in finding a position where Plaintiff could perform the required tasks. HR asked Plaintiff whether she could use a computer and Plaintiff responded she could not. Plaintiff's inability to work with computers eliminated virtually all but management positions available at the Mira Loma UPS-SCS facility. See Smith Decl. ¶ 4.
Plaintiff argues she could have worked with reasonable accommodation when Dr. Uppal changed her work conditions on January 23, 2020. As stated, Dr. Uppal's modification was insignificant in the context of the Warehouse Worker II position. Plaintiff's condition continued to restrict her from pushing, pulling, and lifting over ten pounds. Dr. Uppal also noted that if such work was not [*31]  available, Plaintiff would be back on temporarily total disability. Based on the undisputed facts, no vacant positions were available for which Plaintiff could perform the essential job duties. See SUF ¶ 42.

d. Reasonable Accommodation
Lastly, Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation. Here, Defendant provided reasonable accommodation by allowing Plaintiff to be absent from her job for sixteen months before her termination. "The FEHA does not have a fixed limit on the amount of leave required as reasonable accommodation." Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 42, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021). "Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (quotations omitted); see Zamora, 71 Cal. App. 5th at 43 ("A finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties."). "An employer is [further] not required to provide an indefinite leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation." Id. (citing Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(c)).
Here, Plaintiff [*32]  did not provide Defendant any reason to believe her condition was likely to change in the near future. When Plaintiff first suffered a work-related injury, Defendant accommodated her by granting her a TAW assignment with lighter duties. SUF ¶ 11. Instead of recuperating from the injury, Plaintiff's condition declined, and performing the lighter duties eventually placed her on a status of "no activity", which initiated her lengthy absence. SUF ¶ 14. The declining progression of Plaintiff's condition could lead no fact finder to believe that it was likely she would recuperate in the near term.
Based on the above, no reasonable fact finder could find Plaintiff was denied a reasonable accommodation.

3. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in violation of FEHA
An employer's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation to a disabled employee is inextricably associated with its requirement to engage in the interactive process with the employee because the two parties must engage in a dialogue to determine an effective reasonable accommodation. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 61, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee. . . to determine [*33]  effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee" with a known disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
The interactive process is "an informal process with the employee. . . to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (citation omitted). The burden is on both the employee and the employer to make efforts to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively. Id. at 1014 (citation omitted).

a. Administrative Exhaustion
As an initial matter, the court addresses whether the administrative exhaustion requirement is met on Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. Under FEHA, an employee must exhaust the administrative remedy by filing an administrative complaint with DFEH and must obtain a right to sue letter from the DFEH before an employee can file a lawsuit within one year of the date of the letter. Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12960, 12965; Blum v. Superior Ct., 141 Cal. App. 4th 418, 422, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 902 (2006).
California law requires the exhaustion requirement under FEHA to be construed liberally to accomplish its purposes. Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 819, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001); see 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 10003. The Ninth Circuit also requires courts to construe a plaintiff's DFEH complaints liberally. Oubichon v. North Am. Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973). [*34]  The purpose of filing a complaint with an administrative agency before filing a lawsuit is to provide the basis for an investigation into the claim of discrimination, "and not to limit access to the courts." Blum, 141 Cal. App. 4th at 426. "[C]ourts may adjudicate claims not specifically made in DFEH complaints so long as the new claims are 'like or reasonably related' to the allegations of the original administrative charge." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 794 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing Okoli v. Lockheed Tech. Operations Co., 36 Cal. App. 4th 1607, 1614, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57 (1995)).
In Baker v. Children's Hospital Medical Center, 209 Cal. App. 3d 1057, 1065, 257 Cal. Rptr. 768 (1989), the court allowed the plaintiff to pursue claims not included in his DFEH charge, but that were "like or reasonably related to" the claim that was brought in court. Baker concluded "the allegations of harassment and differential treatment encompass the allegations of discrimination in [plaintiff's] DFEH Complaint. . . [because] it is reasonable that an investigation of the allegations in the original DFEH complaint would lead to the investigation of subsequent discriminatory acts." Id.
Similarly, here, Plaintiff filed a DFEH Complaint alleging the FEHA disability discrimination claims without specifically including the claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. Ex. S. The DFEH Complaint alleges Plaintiff "requested" but was denied a reasonable accommodation, which implies [*35]  a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) (In response to a request for reasonable accommodation, the employer must engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations); Gelfo, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 61 (a failure to accommodate claim is inextricably linked with failure to engage in interactive process claim and are generally assessed together). Although the specific words are not in the DFEH Complaint, the allegations sufficiently encompass this claim such that an investigation into the DFEH charges would lead to it. See Baker, 209 Cal. App. 3d at 1065; Soldinger v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 51 Cal. App. 4th 345, 381, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 747 (1996) ("[C]laimants are not held to specify the charges with literary exactitude" when presenting allegations to DFEH.). The court, thus, finds that the administrative remedies were adequately exhausted. See Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 796 (holding that plaintiff's "sparsely" pled DFEH complaint sufficiently satisfied administrative exhaustion requirement under FEHA before filing lawsuit).

b. The Interactive Process
Next, the court addresses Plaintiff's three points as to this claim. First, Plaintiff argues Defendant was responsible for a breakdown in the interactive process. Next, Plaintiff argues Defendant had the obligation to initiate the interactive [*36]  process but failed to comply with its obligation. Third, Plaintiff argues she did not exhaust her leave under the California Worker's Compensation Act. Plaintiff's contentions are solely based on UPS-SCS's Human Resource's Occupational Health Supervisor Brenda Hellerud's testimony in which Ms. Hellerud stated she did not send and was unaware whether the ADA accommodation letters were sent to Plaintiff. Opp'n at 20; Opp'n Ex. D, Dkt. 49-3. In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, even in the absence of the ADA accommodation letters, this claim fails.
The evidence raises no triable issue of fact as to the essential requirement that a reasonable accommodation must have been available during the period in which the interactive process occurred. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018-19 (To prevail on the failure to engage in the interactive process claim, "an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred."). Section 12940(n) imposes liability on an employer for failing to engage in the interactive process only if a reasonable accommodation existed and was possible. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 980-81. Here, as Plaintiff concedes, a reasonable accommodation [*37]  did not exist that would have enabled Plaintiff to perform the duties of her position.
Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process fails. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1019 (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant on failure to engage in interactive process claim based on plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation); Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 379-80 (affirming summary judgment in favor of defendant based on defendant's showing that plaintiff had no evidence of reasonable accommodations available); Calderon, No. CV 20-7869-PSG-JEMx, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96707, 2022 WL 3012180, at *11-12 (granting summary judgment in favor of defendant on claim for failure to engage in the interactive process based on plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation that would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job).

4. Conclusion Regarding Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claim
Accordingly, Defendant has met its burden to prevail on summary judgment as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim. Based on the evidence in the record, the court finds there are no triable issues of fact as to this claim and GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.

B. Retaliation under FEHA
Under FEHA, an employer may not [*38]  "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). "[T]o establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she was engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). If Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, Defendant must then offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory basis for the adverse employment action. Id. If Defendant meets its burden, the burden then shifts back to Plaintiff, who must then prove intentional retaliation. Id.
Summary judgment is proper on a FEHA retaliation claim when the employee can offer no evidence of a retaliatory motive or show the employer's reasons for the termination was pretextual. See Alamillo, 869 F.3d at 920. Defendant argues Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for retaliation. The court agrees.
Here, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a causal link between the protected [*39]  activities and Defendant's adverse employment actions. Defendant presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging Plaintiff based on its administrative policy. Defendant's policy mandates the separation of an employee after twelve months of absence from his or her position, SUF ¶ 29-30, and Plaintiff was absent for sixteen months, a period longer than that permitted under Defendant's policy. SUF ¶ 31.
Plaintiff has not presented any evidence to the contrary to show the reason was pretextual. Rather, as addressed above, Plaintiff agrees the policy is neutral and that Defendant has not violated its policy. SUF ¶¶ 29, 34. Plaintiff does not know of any other employee who was out on leave for longer than twelve months without being administratively separated. SUF ¶ 33. Plaintiff testified that while employed at UPS-SCS, she never experienced harassment or discrimination. Ex. D at 32:10-33:20. Accordingly, the evidence raises no triable issue of fact that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation.
Additionally, Plaintiff fails to address Defendant's arguments concerning her FEHA retaliation claim in her opposition to Defendant's Motion. See generally Opp'n. [*40]  The court, therefore, finds that Plaintiff has abandoned this claim. See Est. of Shapiro v. United States, 634 F. 3d 1055, 1060 (9th Cir. 2011) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment because plaintiff "abandoned [the] claim by failing to raise it in opposition" to defendant's summary judgment motion); Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 892 (9th Cir. 2008) (same).
Based on the above, the court GRANTS Defendant summary judgment as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

C. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"[W]hen an employer's discharge of an employee violates fundamental principles of public policy, the discharged employee may maintain a tort action and recover damages traditionally available in such actions." Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 170, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980). Wrongful termination claims based on violations of public policy must be predicated on the violation of a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision. Green v. Ralee Eng'g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 90, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998).
"FEHA's provisions prohibiting discrimination may provide the policy basis for a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy." Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1065 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (quoting Phillips v. St. Mary Reg'l Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 227, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2002)). "If a termination in violation of public policy claim is premised on FEHA discrimination claims, the public policy claim rises or falls with the discrimination claim." Hawkins v. Swisher Int'l, Inc., No. ED 21-CV-746-PSG-SHKx, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256121, 2021 WL 7707940, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2021); Tumblin v. USA Waste of California, Inc., No. 16-CV-2902-DSF-PLAx, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94816, 2016 WL 3922044, at *8 (C.D. Cal. July 20, 2016).
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for termination in violation of public [*41]  policy because it is a derivative of the failed FEHA discrimination claims. Mot. at 21-22. Plaintiff concedes the wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim "is a derivative action of the FEHA claims and rise[s] and fall[s] with [their] success." Opp'n at 4. Indeed, Plaintiff affirms that the facts Defendant presents in its Motion are undisputed, Opp'n at 4, and, as a result, does not oppose Defendant's arguments concerning this claim. See generally Opp'n.
As the court has granted summary judgment on Plaintiff's FEHA disability discrimination claims, the court also GRANTS Defendant's summary judgment on the wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. See Sneddon v. ABF Freight Sys., 489 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1131 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("[I]f Plaintiff's [FEHA] claim fails, Plaintiff's [claim] for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails because it is a derivative of plaintiff's statutory claim under Government Code § 12940"); Cervantes v. Concentra Health Servs. Inc., No. 21-CV-2502-SB-AGRx, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 248667, 2021 WL 6496829, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2021) (same); Hawkins, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256121, 2021 WL 7707940, at *5 (Summary judgment is proper on a public policy claim based on a wrongful termination when the claim is predicated on FEHA claims that fail as a matter of law).

D. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) and Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)
The elements of an IIED claim are: "(1) extreme [*42]  and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). (internal quotation marks omitted). The outrageous conduct must be "so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized society." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
By contrast, a NIED claim "is not an independent tort but the tort of negligence to which the traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation and damages apply." Wong v. Tai Jing, 189 Cal. App. 4th 1354, 1377, 117 Cal. Rptr. 3d 747 (2010) (citation omitted). Both the IIED and NIED claims require a plaintiff to prove that he or she suffered severe emotional distress. Id. at 1377-78.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's emotional distress claims are entirely based on the same facts as her FEHA disability discrimination claims, and, thus, are preempted by California's Worker's Compensation Act ("WCA"). Mot. at 22. Defendant also argues Plaintiff cannot show it engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct to support the IIED claim, nor can she show she suffered severe or [*43]  extreme emotional distress. Mot. at 23. The court agrees.

a. California Worker's Compensation Act Precludes Claims
The California Supreme Court has explained that worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for any injury that results from alleged unlawful conduct arising in the normal course of an employer-employee relationship. Miklosy v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 44 Cal. 4th 876, 902-03, 80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 690, 188 P.3d 629 (2008); see Cal. Lab. Code § 3200 (WCA provides the exclusive means for redress of personal injuries that arise in the workplace). As the IIED and NIED claims are squarely based on the FEHA claims which arise out of the normal course of the employer-employee relationship, these claims are preempted by the WCA. See Miklosy, 44 Cal. 4th at 902-03; Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Prot. Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 160, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987) (IIED and negligence claims arising in the course of employment are barred "when the misconduct attributed to the employer [are] actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as. . . criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances.").

b. Emotional Distress Claims Fail
Plaintiff has also failed to show any extreme and outrageous conduct by Defendant, or show she suffered extreme emotional distress. The evidence of Defendant's conduct shows nothing more than ordinary management decisions. See Porter v. Delta Airlines, No. 22-CV-24-MRW, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97197, 2022 WL 1747336, at *2 (C.D. Cal. May 31, 2022); Navarro v. DHL Global Forwarding, No. 15-CV-5510-CAS-Ex, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32663, 2017 WL 901880, at *15 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2017) (Without more, ordinary management [*44]  decisions, such as administrative separation of an employee, are not extreme and outrageous as a matter of law).
Plaintiff also fails to show she suffered from severe or extreme emotional distress. In each of Plaintiff's medical examinations from June 2018 to January 2020, her physicians all noted that Plaintiff denied suffering from nervousness, anxiety, or depression. Ex. E; Ex. K at 2; Ex. R at 3; Ex. X at 3; Ex. Y at 20. In Plaintiff's deposition, she first denied suffering from depression, anxiety, and stress, and then changed her response to state she was "stressed." Ex. D at 80:8-13; SUF 57. "Stress," however, does not rise to the severity sufficient to satisfy the requisite emotional distress needed for an IIED or NIED claim. Ex. D at 87:12-23. Wong, 189 Cal. App. 4th at 1377 (To prevail on a NIED claim, in the absence of physical injury, emotional distress must be "serious"; and for an IIED claim, the emotional distress must be so severe that "no reasonable person in civilized society should be expected to endure it."); Brodish v. New Elec. Fresno, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169022, 2021 WL 3914259, at *6 (C.D. Cal. July 13, 2021); Huggins v. Longs Drug Stores Cal., Inc., 6 Cal. 4th 124, 129, 24 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587, 862 P.2d 148 (1993) (Summary judgment proper on employee's IIED and NEID claims when employee admits not suffering from severe or extreme emotional distress).
Moreover, Plaintiff, again, does not respond to [*45]  any of Defendant's arguments as to her IIED and NIED claims. See generally Opp'n. Accordingly, Plaintiff has abandoned those claims. See Est. of Shapiro, 634 F. 3d at 1060; Shakur, 514 F.3d at 892.
The court, therefore, GRANTS Defendant summary judgment as to Plaintiff's IIED and NIED claims.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, the court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 49) in its entirety.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
