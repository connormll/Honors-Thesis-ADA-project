OPINION AND ORDER
Delgado-Hernández, District Judge.
William Ríos was discharged from his employment as an armed security officer with Centerra Group, LLC ("Centerra"), after falling asleep while on duty at an entrance to a hangar of helicopters, planes, equipment, and offices of the United States Coast Guard at Air Station Borinquen in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Disagreeing with the employer's action, he, his spouse, and their legal conjugal partnership, sued Centerra under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. ("ADA") and Puerto Rico law,1 alleging that Centerra discriminated against Mr. Ríos on the basis of disability, subjected him to a hostile [*2]  work environment, impermissibly retaliated against him, and violated the Puerto Rico Constitution (Docket No. 11). Before the court is Centerra's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 24), which plaintiffs opposed (Docket No. 40). Centerra replied (Docket No. 46). For the reasons explained below, Centerra's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and the case DISMISSED.

I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party moving for summary judgment "bears the initial responsibility" of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A factual dispute is "genuine" if it could be resolved in favor of either party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). It is "material" if it potentially affects the outcome of the case in light of applicable law. Calero-Cerezo v. United States DOJ, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004).
As to issues on which the nonmovant has the burden of proof, the movant "need do no more than aver" absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Mottolo v. Fireman's Fund Insurance, 43 F.3d 723, 725 (1st Cir. 1995). All "reasonable factual [*3]  inferences" must be drawn in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought while ignoring conclusory allegations and unsupported speculation. Shafmaster v. United States, 707 F.3d. 130, 135 (1st Cir. 2013). Based on these parameters, a thorough review of the record shows no genuine factual dispute as to the facts identified in the section that follows and in Section III.

II. FINDINGS OF FACT

A. Preliminary Observations
Except otherwise noted, the facts included in this Section are drawn from the well-pleaded facts asserted in the Amended Complaint (Docket No. 11) and the parties' Local Rule 56 submissions (Docket Nos. 23, 24, 38, 40, 44 and 46). Local Rule 56 is designed to "relieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute." CMI Capital Market Inv. v. González-Toro, 520 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2008). It requires a party moving for summary judgment to accompany its motion with a brief statement of facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs and supported by specific citations to the record, that the movant contends are uncontested and material. Local Rule 56(b) and (e). The opposing party must admit, deny, or qualify those facts, with record support, paragraph by paragraph. Id. 56(c) and (e). While the district court may "forgive" a violation of Local Rule 56, litigants who ignore the rule [*4]  do so "at their peril." Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland S ec. ex rel. Chertoff, 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2007).2 Here, the court has reviewed every factual statement and counterstatement that the parties submitted plus supporting exhibits, and it has included in this Opinion and Order those facts that are material to the case and that were incorporated in statements that comport with summary judgment principles.3

B. The Parties
Centerra is a federal contractor that provides armed security-officer services for U.S. Coast Guard facilities in Aguadilla. See, SUMF ¶ 1. Mr. Ríos was employed as an armed security officer at Centerra between September 14, 2018, and March 2, 2019. See, SUMF ¶¶ 3-4. He was hired on an "as needed" basis. See, SUMF ¶ 3; "Opposing Statement of Uncontested Facts" ("OSUMF")(Docket No. 38), ¶¶ 10, 16. In the first two days of his employment he received on-the-job training for a total of eight hours, going through the different functions that were expected of him. See, Mr. Ríos' Deposition Transcript (Docket No. 23-2), pp. 38, 39, 48. Two of his supervisors were Lieutenant William López and Sergeant Gerald Ramos. See, SUMF ¶ 6. They, in turn, reported to Captain Víctor Caraballo, the Project Manager for Centerra's operations at the Coast [*5]  Guard base in Aguadilla. See, SUMF ¶ 2; OSUMF ¶ 23.

C. Job Assignments
As an armed security officer, Mr. Ríos could be assigned to various locations or "posts" within the base, including the Coast Guard Exchange —a shopping area known as the "PX" or "CGX"—the Ramey School, the teacher's parking lot gate and the aircraft hangar, among others. See, SUMF ¶¶ 8, 9, 15, 16; OSUMF ¶ 17. He could also do a "meal break" shift, where he would cover other guard's meal breaks and use his vehicle to move between the posts. See, SUMF ¶¶ 17-18; OSUMF ¶ 18. While assigned to a post, Mr. Ríos generally had to validate visitor identifications and vehicle registrations (proper identification is required to enter the Coast Guard's facilities) and patrol the assigned area. See, SUMF ¶¶ 9, 16; OSUMF ¶¶ 20, 21, 28.

D. The Rest House Incident
On or around October 19, 2018, Mr. Ríos was in a building designated for use as a rest house by Centerra personnel. See, SUMF ¶ 19. According to Mr. Ríos, he used the rest house to check his blood glucose levels, and to use the bathroom and to change. See, Docket No. 23-2, p. 73. The bathroom is on the second floor. Id. That day, as Mr. Ríos was coming out of the bathroom, [*6]  Sgt. Ramos thought that Mr. Ríos was in his underwear, and told him that he could not be in underwear in the house. See, SUMF ¶ 19; Docket No. 23-2, p. 76.4

E. Reprimand
On December 18, 2018, a civilian drove up to the Coast Guard Exchange entrance post while Mr. Ríos was assigned to the post. See, SUMF ¶¶ 20-21; Docket No. 23-2, p. 136. The civilian had a gun in the vehicle and Mr. Ríos asked him for it. Docket No. 23-2, p. 136. The civilian gave Mr. Ríos the gun and magazine. Id. at p. 137. Mr. Ríos called for assistance and did not get a response. Id. at p. 138. Then, he called another Centerra Security Officer. Id. The "CGX Armed Guard Post Order" is a document posted at the PX guard booth with a set of instructions on what the Coast Guard expects the security guards to do while at the post. See, SUMF ¶ 10. The Post Order states that "if the Guard believes the situation is developing so as to warrant a partner, the Guard should call for back up by contacting the Shift Supervisor (first choice) or Duty Security (second choice) or Security Chief (third choice.)." SUMF ¶ 23. Mr. Ríos testified that he was aware of the Post Order. See, SUMF ¶ 11. Capt. Caraballo investigated the incident, [*7]  recommending that Mr. Ríos be reprimanded. Id. at ¶ 24. On December 24, 2018, Mr. Ríos received a letter of reprimand for retrieving, handling, and unloading another person's firearm. See, SUMF ¶¶ 24-26; Docket No. 23-16.5

F. The Meal Relief Post
On December 20, 2018, Mr. Ríos was assigned to the meal relief post on which he had to cover the 20-minute meal breaks of different guards. See, SUMF ¶ 43. Going from the first post to the second post, Mr. Ríos saw Sgt. Ramos following him. Id. In the second post, Sgt. Ramos asked Mr. Ríos what was taking him so long, offered him doughnuts, which Mr. Ríos declined, and left. Id. at ¶¶ 43-44. Mr. Ríos did not see Sgt. Ramos again for the rest of the shift. Id. at ¶ 44.

G. Mr. Ríos' Complaints About Sgt. Ramos
In December 2018, Mr. Ríos wrote two letters complaining about Sgt. Ramos, one on December 20, 2018, the second on December 22, 2018. See, SUMF ¶ 41; OSUMF ¶ 54; Docket No. 23-13. In the first letter, Mr. Ríos states that Sgt. Ramos should "learn to confront situations more professionally + respectfully." Id. In the second letter, Mr. Ríos complained about his interaction with Sgt. Ramos during the meal break shift discussed above. [*8]  See, SUMF ¶ 45; OSUMF ¶ 60. Capt. Caraballo and Robert Handel, Sr. Manager of Human Resources for Centerra, investigated Mr. Ríos' complaints, concluding that there was no harassment. See, SUMF ¶ 54.

H. Meeting with Capt. Caraballo
In late December 2018 or early January 2019, Mr. Ríos met with Capt. Caraballo in connection with the alleged harassment. See, Docket No.23-2, p. 153. They both spoke with Mr. Handel over the phone. Id. Mr. Ríos mentioned his health conditions and Mr. Handel instructed Capt. Caraballo to give Mr. Ríos a form for Mr. Ríos to provide to his doctor, so that Centerra could determine whether Mr. Ríos needed any accommodation. Id. at 154-155. Capt. Caraballo left the document for Mr. Ríos in the housing main gate clipboard. See, SUMF ¶ 52. Mr. Ríos did not follow up with Capt. Caraballo about the document. See, SUMF ¶ 53.

I. Sleeping on the Job
On February 23, 2019, Mr. Ríos was assigned to the post in the hangar, where the Coast Guard had offices and kept helicopters, planes, and equipment. See, SUMF ¶¶ 28-29. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Lt. López stopped by the hangar post and asked Mr. Ríos if everything was okay and if he needed a break, to which Mr. Ríos responded [*9]  that everything was fine, that he had brought a few things to the post and was okay. See, SUMF ¶ 30; Docket No. 23-7, p. 2. At around 9:35 a.m., Lt. López drove up to the hangar entrance to relieve Mr. Ríos for his meal break and saw that Mr. Ríos had dozed off while on duty. See, SUMF ¶¶ 31-32.
Lt López saw Mr. Ríos asleep with his head down and fingers interlocked. Id. As Lt. López waited, Mr. Ríos reacted awake. See, SUMF ¶ 32. Lt. López asked Mr. Ríos if he was okay and Mr. Ríos said he was writing and then that he was reading, even though he did not have a book in front of him. See, SUMF ¶ 33. Mr. Ríos did not ask for medical care or a doctor. See, SUMF ¶ 34; Docket No. 23-2, p. 148. On the contrary, he said, "Why am I going to lie, yeah I fell asleep I got so much going on." See, Docket No. 23-7, p. 1. The day before this incident, Mr. Ríos had worked a six-hour shift, from 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. See, SUMF ¶ 35. Lt. López sent Mr. Ríos to the Main Gate and then released him from duty. Thereafter, he was not assigned additional shifts pending the outcome of the ensuing investigation. See, SUMF ¶ 36.

J. Investigation and Termination
Capt. Caraballo investigated the incident, obtaining [*10]  reports from both Lt. López and Mr. Ríos. See, SUMF ¶ 37. Upon conclusion of the investigation, Capt. Caraballo recommended that Mr. Ríos be terminated for sleeping on duty. Kristian Kluzinski, Centerra's Director of North America Operations, agreed with the recommendation. See, SUMF ¶ 38. Centerra's Administration of Discipline Standard Operating Procedure provides that sleeping on duty is conduct that merits dismissal as a first offense. See, SUMF ¶ 40.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs allege that Centerra discriminated against Mr. Ríos because of disability; failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to him; and created a hostile work environment in violation of ADA and Law 44 (Docket No. 40, pp. 11, 13, 21). Further, they assert that Centerra unlawfully retaliated against Mr. Ríos in violation of ADA and Law 115. And they aver that Centerra infringed on Article II, §§ 1, 8, and 16 of the Puerto Rico Constitution. Id. at pp. 29-30.

A. Discrimination Under the ADA and Law 44
The ADA makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." Freadman v. Metropolitan Property and Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir. 2007). For its part, Law 44 was enacted on July 22, 1985 [*11]  "to prohibit discrimination against disabled individuals by any public or private institution" receiving funds from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Arce v. ARAMARK Corp., 239 F.Supp.2d 153, 168-169 (D.P.R. 2003 (citing Statement of Motives of Law 44).
Following promulgation of the ADA, the Puerto Rico Legislature enacted Law 105 of December 20, 1991, with the express purpose of "extending Law 44's protection to persons employed by private institutions in Puerto Rico and to conform Law 44 to the ADA." Aramark, 239 F.Supp.2d at 168-169 (citing Statement of Motives of December 20, 1991). Thus, modeled after the ADA, Law 44 is "Puerto Rico's counterpart" to the ADA. Ortiz-Martinez v. Fresenius Health Partners, PR, LLC, 261 F. Supp. 3d 276, 283 (D.P.R. 2016). In this way, the statutes are "conterminous." Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d 63, 74 n. 8 (1st Cir. 2002). And that being so, Law 44 requires "no separate analysis." Ruiz Rivera v. Pfizer Pharms., LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 81 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2008); González, 304 F.3d at 74 n. 8 (affirming dismissal of conterminous claim under Law 44 upon dismissal of ADA claim).
Where, as here, a plaintiff does not have direct evidence of disability animus, he may rely on the "burden-shifting framework" set in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Mancini, 909 F.3d at 38. The goal of this framework is to progressively "sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual questions of intentional discrimination." St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). With this in mind, the plaintiff "must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Mancini, 909 F.3d at 38.
If a prima facie case is established, a rebuttable [*12]  presumption of discrimination arises, switching to the employer the burden of articulating a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the action at issue. LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir. 1993). This is a burden of production, not of persuasion, such that the employer is merely required to set forth through the introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for its action "which would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the challenged employment action." Sánchez v. Puerto Rico Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 720 (1st Cir. 1994). An articulation not admitted into evidence "will not suffice." Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255 n. 9, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).
Should the employer satisfy this burden, the inference arising from the prima facie phase "drops from the case." White v. Vathally, 570 F.Supp. 1431, 1434 (D. Mass. 1983). In that instance, the sole remaining issue "is discrimination vel non," which comes front and center. Vélez v. Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc. 585 F.3d at 441, 447 (1st Cir. 2009). To carry the devoir of persuasion on this ultimate issue, the plaintiff must identify probative evidence that the reason given by the employer for its action is pretextual, that is, not its true reason, but a pretext for discrimination. Id. As such, this last step "merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the plaintiff has been the victim of intentional discrimination," Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 430 (1st Cir. 2000), a burden that, incidentally, remains with the plaintiff "at all times." [*13]  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.
From these principles, to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show that he (1) was disabled within the meaning of the statute; (2) was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) was discharged or otherwise adversely affected, that is, suffered an adverse employment action "in whole or in part" because of his disability. López-López v. Robinson School, 958 F.3d 96, 104 (1st Cir. 2020). As to these elements, like Centerra, the court assumes that Mr. Ríos was disabled under the ADA. Unlike Centerra, however, it also assumes that Mr. Ríos was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.6
Shifting lenses to the adverse action component of the framework, plaintiffs mention that Sgt. Ramos admonished Mr. Ríos not to park his car near the rest house (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 83-85); not to walk on his underwear in that house (id., at p. 76); and not to consume snacks at his post (id., p. 71). They state that Sgt. Ramos spied on Mr. Ríos (id., at pp. 72, 80) and followed him while he was working the meal break shift (id., at p. 125). And they bring up that neither Capt. Caraballo nor Sgt. Ramos assisted [*14]  Mr. Ríos in the firing range (id., at pp. 128-131, 157); and that Mr. Ríos was reprimanded for having retrieved a loaded firearm from a civilian (id., at p. 134) and was terminated for sleeping on the job (Docket No. 38-1, p. 5). Only the termination qualifies as an adverse action.
An adverse action is one that is materially adverse in that it carries "tangible consequences." Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 452 Fed.Appx. 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2011). At bottom, it involves discrete changes in the terms of employment such as "firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits." Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 605 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2010). Whether an employment action is materially adverse is gauged by an objective standard. Id. An employee's displeasure at an action, standing alone, does not render it materially adverse. Gómez-Pérez, 452 Fed.Appx. at 8. Within this category fall the shooting range dynamics, Sgt. Ramos' admonitions to Mr. Ríos about not parking in a visitor's spot near the rest house, on not being in underwear in that house, and over not consuming snacks on working posts.7
As well, employer criticism is "an ordinary and appropriate feature of the workplace." Figueroa-Carrasquillo v. Axiscare Health Logistic, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236549, 2018 WL 8619913, *13 (D.P.R. Jul. 30, 2018). It can "prompt an employee to improve his performance, and thus lead to a more constructive [*15]  employment relationship." Reyes-Feliciano v. Marshalls, 159 F.Supp.3d 297, 305 (D.P.R. 2016). For that reason, counseling, reprimands, and warnings "are a proper instrument for management to focus employees' attention on the need to correct some workplace behavior that the employer perceives as needing correction." Fernández-Ocasio v. Walmart Puerto Rico, Inc., 94 F.Supp.3d 160, 173 (D.P.R. 2015). And they are not materially adverse unless they carry tangible consequences. See, Bhatti v. Trustees of Boston University, 659 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 2011)(explaining that critical memoranda and reprimands without tangible consequences are not considered materially adverse); Fernández-Ocasio, 94 F.Supp.3d at 173 (observing that job-related criticism unaccompanied by tangible consequences are not materially adverse). To this category belongs the reprimand that Mr. Ríos received for retrieving the loaded firearm.
In the same way, "extreme supervision and snubbing" do not satisfy the adverse action prong. Gómez-Pérez, 452 Fed.Appx. at 8; Hicks v. Rubin, 6 Fed.Appx. 70, 73 (2nd Cir. 2001)(pointing out that constant monitoring and workload reviews do not constitute materially adverse employment actions); Godoy v. Maplehurst Bakeries, Inc., 747 F. Supp. 2d 298, 314 (D.P.R. 2010)(noting that although close monitoring may cause an employee embarrassment and anxiety, "such intangible consequences are not materially adverse alterations of employment conditions"). They are not so, even if combined with an increased workload. See, Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 23-25 (1st Cir. 2002)(the fact that plaintiff was required to do more work under extreme supervision [*16]  did not rise to level of an adverse employment action).8 To this category corresponds Mr. Ríos' claim that Sgt. Ramos spied on him and followed him during a meal-break shift.
In contrast, as previously mentioned, the termination is considered an adverse employment action. To this extent, plaintiffs may be said to have established a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and Law 44. Nevertheless, Centerra has put forward a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action, namely, that Mr. Ríos slept on the job. See, Oglesby v. Hy-Vee, 214 Fed.Appx. 829, 834 (10th Cir. 2007)(sleeping on the job is a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating an employee); Reed v. Amax Coal Co., 971 F.2d 1295, 1299-1300 (7th Cir. 1992)(upholding discharge of plaintiff under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for seeping on the job).
Proceeding to the ultimate burden, plaintiffs did not establish that the reason Centerra provided for its decision is a pretext to discriminate against Mr. Ríos because of his disability. Pretext means something worse than business error. It means deceit, "a lie." Collazo-Rosado v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 765 F.3d 86, 87 (1st Cir. 2014). Its analysis is "more demanding" than the assessment of whether a prima facie case has been established. Mariani-Colón, 511 F.3d at 222. It moves the inquiry to "a new level of specificity," Kosereis v. Rhode Island, 331 F.3d 207, 213 (1st Cir. 2003), focusing the analysis on "the perception of the decisionmaker," Lahens v. AT&T, Mobility Puerto Rico, Inc., 28 F.4th 325, 335 (1st Cir. 2022).
On this [*17]  account, a plaintiff must show that the decision-maker did not believe that the reason asserted for the employer's action was real. See, Ronda-Pérez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria-Puerto Rico, 404 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2005)(applying formulation)(citing in part Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc., 98 F.3d 670, 674 (1st Cir. 1996)("[T]he issue is not whether [the employer's reasons . . . were real, but merely whether the decisionmakers . . . believed them to be real"). Correspondingly, plaintiff needs to "elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive: [prohibited] discrimination." Lahens, 28 F.4th at 335.
This may be accomplished in a number of ways, including with evidence that "similarly-situated employees outside of [plaintiff's] protected class were treated differently," Windross v. Barton Protective Services, Inc., 586 F.3d 98, 104 (1st Cir. 2009); that the employer "deviated inexplicably from one of its standard business practices," Kouvchinov v. Parametric Tech. Corp., 537 F.3d 62, 68 (1st Cir. 2008); or of "weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered reasons for termination such that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence" and infer that the employer did not act on the ground asserted for the actions, Bonefont-Igaravidez v. Int'l Shipping Corp., 659 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2011).
Plaintiffs point out that two officers —Carlos Torres and Heriberto González—fell asleep and were [*18]  not terminated (Docket Nos. 38, ¶¶ 108-109; 40, p. 11). To be probative of pretext, the difference in treatment requires "a showing that the employees were similarly situated in all relevant aspects." Woodward v. Emulex Corp., 714 F.3d 632, 639 (1st Cir. 2013). But what plaintiffs have come up with does not satisfy this requirement. To begin, plaintiffs claim that Officer Cortés told Mr. Ríos that Officer Torres had suffered an epileptic attack —from which Mr. Ríos guesses that Torres went into convulsions—and that Cortés went to aid Torres and saved his life (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 160-162).
From that description, Officer Torres was in a life-threatening condition. Nonetheless, the record is devoid of evidence that Mr. Ríos faced a similar life-threatening event when he fell asleep. Moreover, there is no timeframe for when Officer Torres suffered the epileptic attack other than that it occurred before Mr. Ríos was employed by Centerra (Docket No. 23-2, p. 161), and there is no indication of who were the decision-makers involved in determining what to do over the incident. Similarly, Mr. Ríos' allegation is that the incident took place during Officer Torres' "work shift" (Docket No. 11, ¶ 52). However, as the evidence in this case shows, a work [*19]  shift in Centerra included meal breaks as well as active work (see, SUMF ¶ 43), and there is no evidence on whether Officer Torres was working or on break. Thus, plaintiffs failed to show that Officer Torres and Mr. Ríos were similarly situated.
As for Officer González, plaintiffs state that Officer Valentín told Mr. Ríos that a few months after he was let go, González had fallen asleep at the Ramey School twice, but the first time he got a slap on the wrist and the second time was suspended (Docket No. 23-2, p. 162). Mr. Ríos does not know if Officer Valentín was present when González supposedly fell asleep. Id. at p. 164. And there is no evidence that Officer Valentín personally saw González sleeping. Overall, the record is silent on how Officer Valentín acquired knowledge of what Mr. Ríos said that he told him, which creates a problem, not of hearsay as Centerra says, but of cognizance.
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2), evidence has to be presented in a form "that would be admissible" at trial. Presumably, Officer Valentín could have testified at trial, but would have had to accredit personal knowledge to testify about this matter. See, Fed. R. Evid. 602 ("A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced [*20]  sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter"). And along the same line, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) states that "[a] declaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment] must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence and show that the . . . declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Yet, it is apparent that Officer Valentín's declaration does not satisfy these requirements. In consequence, it is not possible to show that Mr. Ríos and Officer González are similarly situated.
In relation to what Mr. Ríos has referred to as "the second time" that Officer González fell asleep (Docket No. 23-2, p. 162), the record includes an incident report, to the effect that he was inattentive to duty but not asleep (Docket No. 38-9, p. 3). Plaintiffs have not brought forth any evidence to place the report's finding in controversy, a fact that does not advance their cause, for an employee claiming differential treatment must show that those with whom he seeks to be compared "engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment [*21]  of them for it." Trajan v. Wayfair Maine, LLC, 957 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2020).
Plaintiffs contend that Centerra did not follow its own protocol in making the termination decision, for in their view, there is no evidence that Mr. Ríos' termination was approved by appropriate authorities such as the Senior Vice President or designee and coordinated through Centerra's Corporate Human Resources (Docket Nos. 38, ¶ 123; 40, p. 29;). Nevertheless, the evidence shows that Mr. Handel —Sr. Manager of Human Resources—and Mr. Kluzinski—Centerra's Director of North America Operations—were involved in the termination decision. See, Docket Nos. 23-3, ¶ 15; 44-2, Responses 4 and 10. Plaintiffs did not explain, much less show, why the involvement of these executives in the decision-making process and termination makes the decision in question pretextual.
In all, the evidence does not reflect "weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions" in the employer's offered reason for termination, that a treasonable factfinder could rationally find it unworthy of credence and hence permissibly infer "that the employer did not act" on the nondiscriminatory ground asserted for its action. Lahens, 28 F. th at 335. Nothing in the record suggests that Centerra did [*22]  not honestly believe that Mr. Ríos fell asleep while on duty and terminated his employment on that basis. See, Leibforth v. Belvidere Nat. Bank, 337 F.3d 931, 934 (7th Cir. 2003)(summary judgment dismissing discrimination action of plaintiff who failed to establish that employer did not honestly believe the proffered reason for the challenged actions). To boot, there is no discernible evidence that Mr. Ríos was disparately treated in the instances of non-adverse actions referred to earlier.9
First, plaintiffs allege that Mr. Ríos was not allowed to park his car in the visitor spots near the rest house but that other officers were allowed to do so (Docket No. 38, ¶ 40). The evidentiary support they provide for the statement is that on one occasion, Mr. Ríos saw Sgt. Ramos talking to another officer who was standing next to a car that was parked in that same visitor's spot (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 83-86). Mr. Ramos believes that the car he saw belonged to the officer because he observed him talking to people with the car door open. Id. at p. 86.10 Properly considered, though, this account does not reasonably support the inference that the car he referred to belonged to the officer or that even if it did, confirms that other officers were routinely allowed [*23]  to park in those spaces. In fact, Mr. Ríos acknowledged that at times "they" let officers park there, and sometimes they did not. Id. at p. 85.11
Second, plaintiffs allege that Lt. López prohibited Mr. Ríos from using the bedroom in the rest house but that other officers were allowed to use it (Docket No. 23-2, p. 75). Mr. Ríos said that the officers slept there overnight and between shifts. Id. But there is no indication in the record that Mr. Ríos was in the same situation, that is, that he needed to use the room to sleep overnight or between shifts and was not granted permission to use the room for those purposes.
Third, plaintiffs allege that in early December 2018, a former coworker stopped by the guard post and gave Mr. Ríos coffee and a snack (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 96, 98). Then, Corporal Méndez pulled up with Sgt. Ramos, Sgt. Ramos got out of the car, and among other things, told Mr. Ríos that he could not consume anything at the post. Id. at p. 97. Mr. Ríos expressed to have told Sgt. Ramos that he needed to consume something to control his blood glucose levels, and that Sgt. Ramos responded that Mr. Ríos only worked four hours. Id. at pp. 97-99. Plaintiffs assert that other [*24]  officers were allowed to consume snacks in their posts. Yet, Mr. Ríos admitted that he was also allowed to have snacks at his post and continued doing so without being bothered by anyone. Id. at pp. 224-225.12
Fourth, plaintiffs allege that Sgt. Ramos ignored Mr. Ríos at a shooting range during an off-duty practice (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 128-131) and that Capt. Caraballo did not assist him during a tactical shooting qualification exercise. Id. at 157-160. There is no evidence that Mr. Ríos asked for Sgt. Ramos' or Capt. Caraballo's assistance. In any event, in the off-duty practice, Mr. Ríos received assistance from another officer. Id. at pp. 128, 130. And according to Mr. Ríos, at the end of the shooting qualification exercise, the instructor told Capt. Caraballo of Ríos' health condition and Capt. Caraballo asked Mr. Ríos if he was okay (Docket No. 38-1, p. 6). Mr. Ríos approved the exercise. See, Docket No. 23-2, p. 166.
Fifth, plaintiffs allege that although Mr. Ríos was reprimanded for handling a loaded gun, another officer —Juan Arce—was not (Docket No. 40, p. 12). The record shows that on June 29, 2018, Officer Arce was assigned to the PX post when an individual drove up to the [*25]  gate requesting access to the premises. See, SUMF ¶ 56. Officer Arce observed that there was a rifle in the passenger seat and inquired if the person had a permit. Id. The person claimed to have forgotten it and left. Id. Officer Arce then contacted USCG Security Duty and Military Enforcement Officer McGuire responded. Id. The driver returned and claimed that the rifle was no longer in the car and again attempted to enter the PX area base. Id. Officer McGuire contacted the local police department, that located the armed and unattended rifle not far away from the entrance. Id. Contrary to what Mr. Ríos had done, at no time Officer Arce handled the firearm or instructed the individual to hand over the weapon.
Finally, plaintiffs allege that an employee with less seniority than Mr. Ríos received priority in shift assignments (Docket No. 23-2, p. 195). Mr. Ríos identified that employee as "Vargas." Id. No evidence was provided on whether Vargas was disabled, which precludes relying on him as comparator to support a claim under ADA and Law 44. Further, as Mr. Ríos described the issue, Mr. Vargas "is like Captain Caraballo's friend, and he comes to shifts." Id. To extrapolate a disability [*26]  animus from this setting is too great a stretch. At worse, Mr. Ríos account reflects cronyism. But that would not make it prohibited discrimination.
Employment discrimination statutes like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and Title VII do not outlaw that type of practice. See, Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1995)(taking notice that while cronyism is deplorable, Title VII does not outlaw it); López-López, 958 F.3d at 110 (observing that while perhaps unsavory, cronyism is not age-based discrimination). Even more, Mr. Ríos stated that once he said yes to a shift, the shift would be changed and given to Vargas (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 200-201). It is unclear how many times this happened and what its effect was, as it is apparent that, notwithstanding this situation, Mr. Ríos did get shifts. Bottom line, there is no allegation or expression of monetary loss. The court would have to engage in conjecture to identify tangible consequences flowing out of this event other than mere inconvenience to Mr. Ríos, and mere inconvenience is insufficient to sustain a claim. In consequence, the disparate treatment claim must be dismissed.

B. Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiffs argue that Centerra failed to provide Mr. Ríos with reasonable accommodation (Docket No. 40, p. 13). The ADA's definition [*27]  of discrimination includes an employer's failure "to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability" unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business. Delgado Echevarria v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP, 856 F.3d 119, 127 (1st Cir. 2017). To establish a claim for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that "(1) [he] made a sufficient request of accommodation, the accommodation would enable [him] to perform the essential functions of his job, and the accommodation is facially reasonable." Benson v. Wal-Mart Stores E., L.P., 14 F.4th 13, 28 (1st Cir. Sep. 15, 2021).
The record is devoid of evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Mr. Ríos requested an accommodation. During Mr. Ríos' deposition, Centerra's counsel directly inquired about whether, in the meeting that Mr. Ríos had with Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel, who participated over the phone, Mr. Ríos asked for a specific accommodation (Docket No. 23-2, p. 155).13 Mr. Ríos' unambiguous response was, "No, there was no specific accommodation." Id. Likewise, even though plaintiffs complain that Centerra should have accommodated Mr. Ríos during the tactical shooting [*28]  qualification exercise (Docket No. 39-1, p. 6), it is undisputed that Mr. Ríos did not request any accommodation (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 157-160).
An employer cannot refuse to make an accommodation "that it was never asked to make." Dooley v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 636 Fed.Appx. 16, 18 (2nd Cir. 2015). No employee can reasonably expect the employer to read his mind and know that he secretly wants an accommodation. See, Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2016)(noting that the employer has no duty to divine the need for an accommodation); Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1046-1047 (6th Cir. 1998)(pointing out that the employer is not required to speculate as to the extent of the employee's desire or need for an accommodation).
Plaintiffs maintain that Mr. Ríos told Mr. Handel and Capt. Caraballo about his medical conditions when he spoke with them in late December 2018 or early January 2019 (Docket No. 23-2, p. 154). However, just telling Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel about medical conditions does not constitute a request for accommodation. Knowing that an employee has health problems "is not the same as knowing that the employee suffers from a disability." Brown v. BKW Drywall Supply, Inc., 305 F.Supp.2d 814, 829 (S.D. Ohio 2004). And even a statement by an employee that he is disabled, without more, "is insufficient to constitute a request for accommodation." Bielich v. Johnson & Johnson, Inc., 6 F.Supp.3d 589, 617 (W.D. Pa. 2014).14 An accommodation request must be specific, direct, and linked [*29]  to a disability. Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 23 ("The request for accommodation must be sufficiently direct and specific, giving notice that [the employee] needs a special accommodation"). But that is not what the record here shows.15
Plaintiffs posit that Centerra failed to engage in an interactive process with Mr. Ríos (Docket No. 40, p. 18). The interactive process requires "both the employer and the employee to engage in a meaningful dialogue, in good faith, for the purpose of discussing alternative reasonable accommodations." Ortiz-Martinez v. Fresenius Health, PR, LLC, 853 F.3d 599, 605 (1st Cir. 2017). It is triggered by the employee's "initial request for accommodation." Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 24. Where a breakdown in the process occurs, "courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary." Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d 328, 339 (1st Cir. 2008). An employer "cannot be found to have violated the ADA when responsibility for the breakdown of the informal, interactive process is traceable to the employee and not the employer." EEOC v. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc., 774 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir. 2014).
From this perspective, assuming that the meeting between Mr. Ríos, Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel triggered Centerra's duty to engage in an interactive process, Centerra [*30]  entered into the process by asking Mr. Ríos to take a form to his physicians. As Mr. Ríos describes the interaction, Mr. Handel wanted to get the doctor's notes so they could have an open-ended conversation to determine what type of accommodation Mr. Ríos would need (Docket No. 23-2, pp. 155-156). That was a reasonable first step to determine what accommodations could be given in this setting. See, Sturm v. UAL Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13331, 2000 WL 1300396, *13 (D.N.J. Sept. 5, 2000)(reaching same conclusion under analogous circumstances).
Hence, Mr. Handel instructed Capt. Caraballo to give Mr. Ríos the document. Yet, plaintiffs observe that Capt. Caraballo never did so (Docket No. 23-2, p. 156). Indeed, he left the document for Mr. Ríos in the housing main gate clipboard. See, SUMF ¶ 52. Plaintiffs deny this fact, arguing that Mr. Hendel instructed Capt. Caraballo to give or notify the form to Mr. Ríos, and that leaving personal information documents related to Ríos' medical conditions so that other guards could see them violated the ADA and Mr. Ríos' right to privacy under the Puerto Rico Constitution (Docket No. 39, p. 11).16
The argument does not contradict the SUMF. First, an argument "is not fact." Mel Williamson, Inc. v. U.S., 1982 WL 36689, *1 (Ct. Cl. Feb. 2, 1982). Second, the quotation from the EEOC's technical assistance document has no bearing here, as the record is bereft of evidence that any of Mr. Ríos' coworkers knew he was participating in a process to evaluate accommodations. Third, in his deposition, Mr. Ríos did not invoke privacy as a reason for not having picked up the document. Rather, he said that it was Capt. Caraballo's responsibility to give it to him (Docket No. 23-2, p. 156). And that is why he never called Capt. Caraballo to inquire about the document. Id. at 156-157. However, it would not have been difficult for Mr. Ríos to follow up with Capt. Caraballo over the phone or by leaving a message for him in his office or through Lt. López.
As mentioned earlier, the ADA envisions a process that requires "participation by both parties." Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 24. The employer "may not know enough about the individual's disability or the limitations that disability would impose on the performance of the job" to suggest or implement an appropriate accommodation. Beck v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1136 (7th Cir. 1996)(cited with approval in Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 24). To fill the gap, the [*32]  employer may ask for medical input to inform its judgment. See, Ortiz-Martínez, 853 F.3d at 605 (describing as reasonable the employer's request for more specific information to help determine the type of accommodations that the employee required). That is what Centerra did when it asked Mr. Ríos to provide it with his doctors' recommendations. Correspondingly, conscious of what Mr. Handel was interested in, Mr. Ríos could have asked his physicians to confirm his alleged need for accommodations and propose accommodations for him. But he never came forward with even a doctor's note.
In contrast, on February 25, 2018, at 9:36 p.m., some weeks after his meeting with Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel, Mr. Ríos sent Capt. Caraballo a memorandum about the incident of February 23, 2018, mentioning, among other things, that Capt. Caraballo was to provide him with a form to be filled out by his doctors, and that he was never given the form (Docket No. 23-8, p. 2). Capt. Caraballo responded less than 24 hours later, on February 26, 2018, at 4:45 p.m., indicating that the document had been placed in the Housing Main Gate clip board. Id. at 1. Mr. Ríos did not, however, pursue the topic any further with questions or requests for [*33]  clarification.
On these facts, the court cannot conclude that Centerra infringed its responsibility to participate in good faith in an interactive process to identify potential accommodations for Mr. Ríos. See, Phelps v. Optima Health Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 2001)(explaining that employer was not responsible for breakdown in interactive process in part because it immediately began the interactive process, returned letters promptly and generally acted in good faith); Steffes v. Stepan Co., 144 F.3d 1070, 1073 (7th Cir. 1998)(noting that employee failed to hold up her end of the interactive process by not clarifying the extent of her medical restrictions).

C. Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiffs contend that Centerra subjected Mr. Ríos to a hostile work environment based on his disability (Docket No. 40, pp. 21-22). ADA-covered individuals "may assert hostile work environment claims premised on disability-based harassment." Castro-Medina v. Procter & Gamble Commercial Co., 565 F.Supp.2d 343, 377 (D.P.R. 2008). A hostile work environment exists "[w]hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create and abusive working environment." Kosereis, 331 F.3d at 216 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)).
Whether an environment is hostile or abusive is determined by looking at the totality of circumstances, [*34]  including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. See, Harris, 510 U.S. at 23 (examining topic). To be actionable, the conduct must be both subjectively and objectively abusive. Id. Basically, plaintiffs argue that what has been presented as non-adverse actions plus other incidents to be described below, amount to a hostile work environment. The events relate to Sgt. Ramos, Capt. Caraballo and Lt. López.17 To facilitate review, an outline of the incidents that plaintiffs base their claim on follows.

1. Sgt. Ramos.

All of these incidents are self-explanatory or have been described earlier, except for the three spelled out below.

a. First Spying Incident
Mr. Ríos testified that on October 19, 2018, he pulled up to the rest house to change and use the second-floor bathroom and heard footsteps coming up the stairs and then stop (Docket No. 23-2, p. 74). He expressed that the stairs form an L, at the [*36]  curvature of the L there is a platform and in there is the wall to the bathroom. Id. And he added that when he came out of the bathroom, he saw Sgt. Ramos with his ear against the wall. Id.
With reference to the same incident, Sgt. Ramos reported in a statement to Capt. Caraballo, that he saw Mr. Ríos arrive and enter the rest house to change and take a meal/rest break (Docket No. 23-11, p. 1). As time came closer for Sgt. Ramos to give Mr. Ríos and another officer their service weapons for the upcoming shift, Sgt. Ramos went into the house to verify if Mr. Ríos was all right. Id. The other officer told Sgt. Ramos that Mr. Ríos was upstairs and had been for a while. Id. Then, Sgt. Ramos walked halfway to the staircase and called Mr. Ríos. Id. As Sgt. Ramos waited, he did not hear anything back. Id. He was going up the stairs again when, suddenly, Mr. Ríos came out in the hallway in his underwear, wearing no uniform. Id.
Sgt. Ramos waited for Mr. Ríos in the guard shack, gave Mr. Ríos his weapon, and told him not to walk around the second floor like that (in other words, in his underwear), and if he was going to use the facilities, to keep it private because there were female cleaners [*37]  and a secretary that worked on the first floor for the janitorial team (Docket No. 23-11, p. 1). Mr. Ríos does not dispute Sgt. Ramos' narrative except for Sgt. Ramos' location when Mr. Ríos came out of the bathroom —going up the stairs, as opposed to with his ear on the wall leading to the bathroom.21 Construing that discrepancy in plaintiffs' favor, it is hard to consider this as inappropriate behavior by Sgt. Ramos, much less as spying.

b. Second Spying Incident
On November 15, 2018, Mr. Ríos was assigned to the Ramey School Second Gate, and reported that his radio was not working (Docket No. 23-11, p. 1). Sgt. Ramos searched for a battery to replace the one in Mr. Ríos' radio. Id. As Sgt. Ramos was driving through the exterior of the gate, he saw the gate closed and what appeared to be lights inside a vehicle next to the guard shack. Id. When he got close to the vehicle, he saw that it was Mr. Ríos' vehicle, and that Mr. Ríos was inside. Id. Sgt. Ramos stood there so that Mr. Ríos could see him, and it took Mr. Ríos some time to notice Sgt. Ramos.22
Mr. Ríos said he was having a family issue and in response to the question of why the gate was closed, he said that there were no cars around [*38]  and he was close by to make sure he left at the appropriate time (Docket No. 23-11, pp. 1-2). Sgt. Ramos told Ríos that if he needed time to talk or resolve any issues or use his phone, he should make sure to let the shift supervisor know. Id. Mr. Ríos expressed that Sgt. Ramos used the back entrance because there was a parking lot, the place was dark, and stood there and "watched" —or "spied"— on him (Docket No. 23-2, p. 87). Like with the first incident, Sgt. Ramos did nothing improper.

c. Meal-Period Break Shift
On December 20, 2018, Mr. Ríos was assigned to the meal-period break shift (Docket No. 23-2, p. 123). Sgt. Ramos instructed him to cover the six guard posts in 2 and a half hours. Id. As Mr. Ríos left to cover the posts, he noticed that Sgt. Ramos was following him. Id. at 124. When Mr. Ríos arrived to the second post, Sgt. Ramos asked him what was taking him so long, offered him doughnuts and left. Id. at 125-126. Mr. Ríos did not see Sgt. Ríos again that day. Id. at 126. In the main, from this factual description, Sgt. Ramos did not cross any line.

2. Capt. Caraballo; Lt. López
Mr. Ríos stated that Capt. Caraballo never made any comment that would support a claim of hostile [*39]  work environment (Docket No. 23-2, p. 186). Likewise, as it concerns Lt. López, Mr. Ríos expressed that Lt. López never made any comment about Mr. Ríos' physical condition or disabilities. Id. at p. 187. However, plaintiffs understand that the actions of Capt. Caraballo and Lt. López contributed to a hostile work environment, those actions being reprimanding Mr. Ríos for the handling of the loaded firearm in December 2018, not assisting Ríos in the firing range in February 2019, and terminating Mr. Ríos' employment in March 2019.

3. Analysis
Workplace conduct "is not measured in isolation." Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001). Actions that are not materially adverse when considered individually may "amount to hostile work environment in the aggregate." Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 74. Putting it all together, the record shows operational decisions with which Mr. Ríos did not agree and subjectively found hostile. But they were not objectively so. Conversations between an employee and his superior about his performance do "not constitute harassment simply because they cause the employee distress." Castro-Medina, 565 F.Supp.2d at 378. Even constant work criticism in itself is "not sufficient" to support a hostile work environment claim. Lucenti v. Potter, 432 F.Supp.2d 347, 362 (S.D. N.Y. 2006).
Viewed as a whole, the evidence does not come close [*40]  to meeting the severe or pervasive standard that defines a hostile work environment. See, Colón-Fontánez v. Municipality of San Juan, 660 F.3d 17, 43-45 (1st Cir. 2011)(that supervisor refused to meet with plaintiff, avoided her, yelled at her and a coworker in front of other employees, did not take action against employees who made comments about plaintiff, and followed her or asked another employee to follow her if plaintiff left her desk to go to the bathroom considered insufficient to establish a hostile work environment even coupled with allegations of temporary removal of plaintiff's telephone and computer, which required plaintiff to complete her work manually, and not inviting her to attend a workshop); Plautz, 156 Fed.Appx. at 814-815, 817-819 (that maintenance manager instructed plaintiff's supervisor to give plaintiff a reprimand for drinking coffee on the work floor; same manager saw plaintiff viewing a nonwork-related website on the office computer, printed the page that plaintiff was viewing, and showed it to plaintiff's supervisor, who, on manager's direction wrote an investigatory report about the incident; supervisor orally reprimanded plaintiff as to proper radio etiquette; when plaintiff returned to work from a stress leave, employer chastised him by telling him he had started an [*41]  epidemic of people taking stress leave; supervisor told plaintiff that employer was going through his medical records trying to find a way to discredit him and supervisor felt that maintenance manager was stalking plaintiff by hanging around plaintiff's work area and watching him, did not amount to a hostile work environment).
At most, like in Colón-Fontánez, the incidents plaintiffs complain about were "episodic, but not frequent in nature; upsetting, but not severe; mildly humiliating, but not physically threatening." Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 44-45.23 Compare this situation with the one described in Rivera-Rivera v. Medina & Medina, Inc., 898 F.3d 77 (1st Cir. 2018), where the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment, as part of which she was taunted about her age nearly every single day for over two years: she was called "vieja" (Spanish for "old"), told that she was "useless;" was chastised for supposedly lacking the skills necessary to adequately fulfill the roles of her job because her age rendered her "slow;" was told that given her age, she should seek social security benefits, with the suggestion that because she was perceived as being too old for the job, she should resign before being forcibly discharged; and was yelled and screamed at). Id. at 93. But nothing of that sort happened [*42]  here.
On top of this, there has been no showing that the incidents plaintiffs complain about negatively affected Mr. Ríos' work performance, a factor that undercuts the viability of their claim. See, Pomales v. Celulares Telefonica, Inc., 447 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir. 2006)(summary judgment dismissing hostile work environment claim in part because there was no evidence that the complained of conduct negatively affected plaintiff's ability to work); Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 74 (similar, as plaintiff "pointed to no effect whatsoever on her work performance"); Rodriguez-Cruz v. Stewart Title Puerto Rico, Inc., 209 F. Supp. 3d 427, 444 (D.P.R. 2016)(rejecting hostile work environment action in part because there was no evidence that emails in question caused any impediment to plaintiff's performance of her work duties). Contrast this scenario with the one in Marrero, where the First Circuit upheld a hostile work environment verdict in which repeated sexual harassment led to decreased performance. See, Marrero, 304 F.3d at 19-20.
With it all, what plaintiffs have presented lacks references to Mr. Ríos' alleged disability, a fatal gap in their case. Generally, disagreeable behavior and discriminatory animus "are different things." Brader v. Biogen Inc., 983 F.3d 39, 64 (1st Cir. 2020). Everyone can be in some way characterized by age, ethnicity, disability, religion, sex and other characteristics, and some bosses may be "harsh" and "rude." Richards v. Dep't of Educ. of City of New York, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19674, 2022 WL 329226, *15 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2022). So, to ensure [*43]  that federal courts do not become super personnel boards, it is important in hostile work environment cases to exclude from consideration incidents that lack a nexus with the asserted ground of discrimination. See, Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2006)(explaining that an employee claiming harassment must demonstrate that the hostile conduct was directed at him because of a protected characteristic).
By this measure, in order to sustain liability, otherwise actionable conduct must have been directed at Mr. Ríos because of his disability. But as noted above, there is no evidence to that effect. And that omission leads to dismissal. See, Brader, 983 F.3d at 63-64 (summary judgment dismissing ADA hostile work environment claim in part because the First Circuit has consistently acknowledged that toiling under a boss who is tough, insensitive, unfair, or unreasonable can be burdensome, but even to the extent that was the situation therein, plaintiff did not show that the immediate superior did not behave that way due to discriminatory animus); Medina-Rivera v. MVM, Inc., 713 F.3d 132, 138 (1st Cir. 2013)(summary judgment dismissing sex discrimination claim in part because nothing plaintiff said indicated that the phone call harassment was gender-based); Rivera v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Auth., 331 F.3d 183, 189-191 (1st Cir. 2003)(summary judgment dismissing religious harassment action, [*44]  as there was no evidence that the offending conduct was linked to religious animus); Ahern v. Shinseki, 629 F.3d 49, 52, 59 (1st Cir. 2010)(observing in dismissing claim at summary judgment that insofar as plaintiffs' allegations showed anything, it was that the officer administrator's conduct may have engendered a nerve-wracking environment, but not a nerve-wracking environment based on the protected characteristic, namely, gender).
Plaintiffs suggest that Sgt. Ramos made an improper comment along that line in the Coast Guard housing area. See, Docket No. 23-2, pp. 184-186. For context, Capt. Caraballo wanted the guards to be acquainted with the people who lived in the housing area; the Coast Guard had a running club; the officers had to start running to prepare for a physical examination; someone asked Sgt. Ramos about that; and Sgt. Ramos said, "are you ready?," "[a]re you going to run?," "are you going practice shooting?," further stating "no, people who are out of shape and fat won't make it," which Mr. Ríos found offensive because he was the only one in the area who was fat. Id.
The comment is not linked to any disability, and while it may have been insensitive, it was no more serious than what has been found insufficient to sustain [*45]  claims of hostile work environment. See, Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 43-45 (telling plaintiff on several occasions to get on social security or apply for disability so that she could receive assured checks; calling plaintiff hypochondriac; and claiming that she was "faking it" did not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness required to sustain a claim of hostile work environment); Mohammadian v. Ciba Vision of Puerto Rico, Inc., 378 F.Supp.2d 25, 28, 31-32 (D.P.R. 2005)(that supervisor reprimanded plaintiff in front of colleagues; supervised her to the point of "persecution;" did not invite her to lunches with other employees; often commended negatively on her appearance; and made inappropriate references to her mental health problems such as "that depression is killing you," "you have to laugh," and "you are crazy, it shows," did not support hostile environment claim); Rivera, 331 F.3d at 185, 191 (giving plaintiff a birthday card with a pig wearing a rosary with her birth date emblazoned at the top insufficient to support religious harassment claim).
Mr. Ríos' working relationship with Sgt. Ramos may be characterized as tense, and Mr. Ríos found Sgt. Ramos' style unprofessional. But that does not lead to a different result here. See, Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 44 (observing that while the facts indicated an uncomfortable and tense working relationship [*46]  between plaintiff and supervisor, a supervisor's unprofessional managerial approach is not the focus of discrimination laws). And the same may be said of Mr. Ríos' description of Sgt. Ramos as "rude" and "arrogant" (Docket No. 23-2, p. 195).24 Arrogance and rudeness go beyond what makes a work environment hostile under the law. See, Patton v. Indianapolis Public School Bd., 276 F.3d 334, 339 (7th Cir. 2002)(dismissing hostile work environment action predicated on allegations that immediate supervisor treated plaintiff in a rude, abrupt, and arrogant manner, as those allegations fell short of showing an actionable hostile work environment).
Antidiscrimination laws were not enacted to create or enforce a "general civility code." Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir. 2005). The workplace "is not a cocoon," and those who labor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins to survive the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely encounter in a hard, cold world. Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 45. In consequence, though Mr. Ríos' work environment may have been unpleasant and even subjectively "hostile" by some sense of the word, the hostile work environment claim must be dismissed.25

D. Retaliation
Plaintiffs assert that Centerra retaliated against Mr. Ríos under the ADA (Docket No. 40, p. 22).26 The ADA makes it illegal [*47]  for employers to retaliate against someone because he has "opposed any act or practice made unlawful" by the ADA or because such individual "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing" under the ADA. Carreras v. Sajo, García & Partners, 596 F.3d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 2010). An ADA plaintiff may assert a claim for retaliation "even if [he] fails to succeed on a disability-discrimination claim." Echevarría, 856 F. 3d at 133.
In the absence of direct evidence of retaliation, courts evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the burden-shifting framework drawn from McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 792. In line with this framework, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in protected conduct; (2) he experienced an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection exists between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action. See, Kelley v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., 707 F.3d 108, 115 (1st Cir. 2013)(identifying elements of prima facie case).
Once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of retaliation, the defendant "must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its employment decision." Kelley, 707 F.3d at 115. The employer's burden "is one of production, not persuasion." Carreras, 596 F.3d at 36. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must show that the proffered legitimate reason [*48]  is pretextual and that the job action was the result of the defendant's retaliatory animus. Id. For an employment action to be considered adverse, "a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse." Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 36. In this context, that means showing the action might have "dissuaded" a reasonable worker from engaging in the protected activity. Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 452 Fed.Appx. 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2011). To satisfy the requirement, the action must produce "a significant," not a trial harm. Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 36. This is an "objective standard." Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). Petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners are not normally considered materially adverse. Id.
First, plaintiffs direct the court to a conversation that Mr. Ríos had with Lt. López in October 2018; to the prohibition on using the parking slots close to the rest house; and to the admonition about not consuming snacks while on the guard posts, which, they say, link protected activity to adverse actions (Docket No. 40, pp. 26-27). As to the first event, on October 24, 2018, Mr. Ríos complained to Lt. López that Sgt. Ramos spied on him in the rest house on October 19, 2018; was not professional in handling the situation; and had no evidence (on presumably, that Mr. Ríos had been sleeping [*49]  in the bathroom) (Docket No. 23-2, p. 78).27 In response, Lt. López told Mr. Ríos that he could not use the bedroom to get changed. Id.28 The sequence shows neither a protected activity nor an adverse action. From what Mr. Ríos told Lt. López, he was not opposing an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or making a charge, testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under that statute. And prohibiting Mr. Ríos to use the bedroom to change was not materially adverse.
Second, plaintiffs refer to the fact that in December 2018, Mr. Ríos wrote two letters to Centerra's management, and on December 27, 2018, he was reprimanded for his handling of a loaded firearm (Docket No. 23-2, p. 27). In the first letter, Mr. Ríos essentially states that during the shift of December 19th, his primary job was to give breaks to every officer on the shift; Sgt. Ramos ordered him to park in the new employee parking lot when giving breaks at the CGX; Mr. Ríos proceeded to enter through the exit because employees entered the same way; at the end of the shift Sgt. Ramos said that Officer Cortés told him that Mr. Ríos had said that Capt. Caraballo expressed [*50]  something to the effect that he authorized Mr. Ríos' actions; Mr. Ríos told Sgt. Ramos that he was wrong because that comment did not come from Mr. Ríos' mouth; and Mr. Ríos confronted Officer Cortés, who said that Sgt. Ramos was making things up because he wanted Mr. Ríos out (Docket Nos. 23-2, pp. 107-108; 23-13).
This was not protected activity under the ADA and the reprimand was a form of targeted constructive criticism that would not have dissuaded a reasonable worker from engaging in protected activity. See, Wei v. Pennsylvania, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52613, 2019 WL 1403458, *3 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 28, 2019)(two reprimand letters that did not result in any change to plaintiff's duties, assignments, compensation or any other terms or conditions of employment did not qualify as adverse action sufficient to support retaliation claim); Butler v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 838 F. Supp. 2d 473, 496 (M.D. La. Jan. 20, 2012)(workplace criticism not adverse employment action for purposes of retaliation).29 In the same way, chastisement by superiors does not rise to level of material adversity but instead falls into the category of "petty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners" that the Supreme Court has recognized are not actionable retaliatory conduct. Stewart v. Mississippi Transp. Comm'n, 586 F.3d 321, 332 (5th Cir. 2009).
In the second letter, Mr. Ríos states that Sgt. Ramos described him to Sup. Méndez as [*51]  a "problematic person;" over a month earlier Mr. Ríos had taken the problem to his superiors thinking that they would talk to Sgt. Ramos and put a stop to it; on December 20th, Sgt. Ramos told Mr. Ríos to cover the six meal-break posts in 2 and a half hours and followed him, asked him why he was running late and offered him doughnuts, an action that Mr. Ríos found funny because Sgt. Ramos had once scolded him saying that there was to be no consumption of anything at the post even though at times Mr. Ríos needed a bite because he was diabetic and his sugar levels varied (Docket No. 23-14).
In addition, the letter expressed that Sgt. Ramos should answer the radio when called upon for assistance in a timely manner, and that even though sometimes the problem could be a radio malfunction or connection, there was a pattern of not answering, especially if the subject was not liked, which was unprofessional and created a safety issue. Id. at p. 3. As the letter mentions that Mr. Ríos was diabetic and his glucose levels varied as part of the description of Sgt. Ramos' prohibiting him from having a snack on the guard post, the court will construe the letter as protected activity. But Centerra [*52]  articulated a legitimate reason for the reprimand, which plaintiffs could not discount as pretextual. Besides, that reprimand does not rise to the category of a material adverse action in this context.
Third, plaintiffs argue that Mr. Ríos engaged in protected activity when in late December 2018 or early January 2019 he met with Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel, shortly thereafter, less than two months after the meeting he was terminated from his employment, and when an adverse personnel action occurs so close in time to the employer's knowledge of the protected activity, a jury may infer causation purely from this temporal proximity (Docket No. 40, pp. 27-28). The First Circuit has acknowledged that timing "may bear on the question of causation in a retaliation claim but has warned that a narrow focus on the timing, may ignore "the larger sequence of events and also the larger truth." Freadman v. Metropolitan Property and Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 100-101 (1st Cir. 2007).
Pointedly, the larger truth is that, like under Title VII, ADA retaliation claims are subject to but-for causation. See, E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 767(6th Cir. 2013)(applying but-for causation standard to retaliation claim under the ADA); T.B. v. San Diego Unified School District, 806 F.3d 451, 472-473 (9th Cir. 2015)(similar); Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1999)(same).30 The standard is drawn from tort law, under which an action "is not regarded as a cause of [*53]  an event if the particular event would have occurred without it." Univ. of Texas v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 347, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013).
As relevant, the protected activity would be the but-for cause for termination if the employee "would have remained in [his] position" had no protected activity occurred. Finnie v. Lee County, 541 Fed.Appx. 368, 371-372 (5th Cir. 2013); Gallagher v. San Diego Unified Port Dist., 14 F. Supp. 3d 1380, 1387 (S.D. Cal. 2014)(explaining concept). Yet, this standard is not satisfied "by temporal proximity alone." Staley v. Gruenberg, 575 Fed.Appx. 153, 156 (4th Cir. 2014); Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 670 F.3d 644, 660 (5th Cir. 2012)(similar); Ford Motor Co., 782 F. d at 767 (same). As the First Circuit has recognized, although "close temporal proximity may suffice for prima facie case of retaliation, it does not, standing alone, satisfy [plaintiff's] ultimate burden to establish that the true explanation for [his] firing was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct rather than the reasons articulated by [the employer]." Echevarría, 856 F.3d at 138 (quotation marks and brackets omitted).
Viewed through this prism, plaintiffs fall short of demonstrating pretext for retaliation. During his meeting with Capt. Caraballo and Mr. Handel, Mr. Ríos did not ask for a specific accommodation. He spoke about his medical conditions and, upon Mr. Handel's instructions, Capt. Caraballo would provide to Mr. Ríos a document to be filled by Mr. Ríos' doctors. That being the case, participation in the meeting may be considered protected activity. [*54]  But the record does not sustain the thesis that Mr. Ríos' termination would not have occurred in the absence of that activity. The evidence points us far from it, given that in February 2019, Lt. López found Mr. Ríos sleeping on the job, and it was that incident, not the meeting, that resulted in his termination.
In this light, there is no bridge —no nexus— linking the meeting with the termination as when, say, decision-makers conspire to fire an employee by creating a paper trail of "trumped up" disciplinary charges. Staley, 575 Fed.Appx. at 156. Along that axis, see, Velázquez-Pérez v. Developers Diversified Realty Corp., 753 F.3d 265, 271 (1st Cir. 2014)(supervisor's actions served as a proximate cause of plaintiff's discharge because she gathered information on plaintiff's performance; threatened him that if he did not engage in a romantic and sexual relationship with her she would manage to undercut him at work and get him fired; and when plaintiff rebuffed her, the supervisor set to carry out her threat). However, that is not what happened in this case. Nothing in the record unveils any ulterior retaliatory motive. Thus, the ADA retaliation claim must be dismissed. See, Alvarado v. Donahoe, 687 F.3d 453, 464-465 (1st Cir. 2012)(summary judgment dismissing retaliation claim because even though an interval of approximately one week between protected [*55]  conduct and suspension was sufficiently close temporal proximity to warrant a prima facie inference of a causal connection between the two events, plaintiff could not overcome the defendant's asserted non-retaliatory reason for the suspension); Echevarría, 856 F.3d at 138 (summary judgment dismissing retaliation claim predicated on close temporal proximity of one day between protected activity and termination, as the proximity did not establish that the true explanation for termination was retaliation for engaging in protected conduct rather than the reasons that the employer set forth).31

E. Law 115
Plaintiffs allege that Centerra retaliated against Mr. Ríos in violation of Law No. 115 (Docket No. 40, pp. 29-30). Law 115 makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge, threaten, or discriminate against an employee who has: (1) offered or attempted to offer testimony, expression or information before a legislative, administrative or judicial forum in Puerto Rico; or (2) provided or attempted to provide testimony, expression or information in internal procedures the company has established or before any employee or representative in a position of authority, provided the expression is not of a defamatory [*56]  character or constitutes disclosure of privileged information established by law. See, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a(a) (so providing). The second proviso was inserted in the statute by way of Law No. 169 of September 29, 2014. Prior to the enactment, "it did not enter into the retaliation calculus under Law 115." González-Santiago v. Baxter Healthcare S.A., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61512, 2021 WL 1208207, *39 (D.P.R. Mar. 29, 2021).
In its application, absent direct evidence of retaliation —and there is none here— to set out a prima facie case under Law 115, a plaintiff must show that he: (1) participated in an activity protected by the statute; and (2) was subsequently discharged or otherwise discriminated against. See, Collazo v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Mfg., Inc., 617 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2010)(articulating test). If the plaintiff succeeds in this showing, the employer must articulate a "legitimate reason" for the challenged action. Rodriguez v. Sears Roebuck De P.R., Inc., 367 F. Supp. 2d 216, 230 (D.P.R. 2005). Should the employer do so, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the reason asserted for the action is a pretext for retaliation. Id.
In this way, claims under Law 115 related to the ADA are analyzed as "ADA retaliation claims." Caez-Fermaint v. State Ins. Fund Corporation, 286 F.Supp.3d 302, 320 (D.P.R. 2017). In fact, plaintiffs direct the court to their ADA retaliation claim analysis, incorporating it as part of their Law 115 argument (Docket No. 40, pp. 29-30). That being so, based on the analysis of plaintiffs' ADA retaliation claim, [*57]  the Law 115 claim must be similarly dismissed. See, Caez-Fermaint, 286 F.Supp.3d at 320 (disposing of Law 115 claim on this basis); Rivera-Rodríguez, 367 F.Supp.2d at 230 (similar).32

F. Puerto Rico Constitution
Plaintiffs allege that Centerra violated Article II, Sections 1, 8 and 16, of the Puerto Rico Constitution (Docket No. 40, p. 30). As relevant, Section 1 states that the dignity of the human is inviolable; all men are equal before the law; no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color, sex, birth, social origin or condition, or pollical or religious ideas; and both the laws and the system of public education shall embody these principles of essential human equality. See, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, Bill of Rights, Art. II, § 1. Section 8 provides that every person has the right to the protection of law against abusive attacks on his honor, reputation and private or family life. Id., § 8. Section 16 recognizes in part the employees' right to protection against risks to their health in their work or employment. Id., § 16.
The Puerto Rico Legislature has enacted legislation to implement the equality and non-discrimination principles embodied in Section 1, and the safe-workplace provision set in Section 16. As for Section 1, without being exhaustive, pertinent enactments include Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146 et seq., which prohibits employment discrimination because of age; race; color; [*58]  sex; sexual orientation; gender identity; social or national origin; social condition; political affiliation; political or religious beliefs; for being a victim or being perceived as a victim or domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; or for being a servicemember, ex-servicemember, serving or having served in the United States Armed Forces, or holding veteran status; Law 17 of April 22, 1988, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 155 et seq., which prohibits sexual harassment in employment; Law 69 of July 6, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 1321 et. seq., which prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex or gender; Law 44 of July 2, 1989, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 501 et. seq., which as noted above, prohibits disability discrimination; and Law 115, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194 et. seq., which as discussed earlier, prohibits retaliation against employees for engaging in protected activity.33 See, Erazo-Vázquez v. State Indus. Products Corp., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165306, 2021 WL 3910248, *24 (D.P.R. Aug. 31, 2021)(explaining that the Puerto Rico Legislature enacted antidiscrimination statutes to implement the principle of human equality set in Section 1 of Article II of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution) (citing in part Meléndez Rivera v. Asociación Hosp. Del Maestro, 156 D.P.R. 828, 864-865, 2002 TSPR No. 60, 2002 Juris P.R. No. 66 (2002)). Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that Centerra infringed upon any of these provisions.
In connection with Section 16, without being exhaustive, the Legislature enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Law No. 16 of August 5, 1975, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 29, § 361, et. seq., requiring employers to provide a workplace free of risks to the employee's health; and the Temporary Disability Benefit Act, Law 139 of June 26, 1968, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, § 201, et. seq., which provides benefits to employees [*59]  temporarily disabled to perform the duties of their job on account of non-occupational injury or illness. See, Erazo-Vázquez, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165306, 2021 WL 3910248, at *24 (so recognizing). In addition, the Legislature maintained in effect, with amendments, the pre-constitution Workers Accident Compensation Act, Law 45 of April 18, 1935, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11, § 1, et. seq., which provides worker compensation benefits to employees who suffer an occupational injury or illness. See, Erazo-Vázquez, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165306, 2021 WL 3910248, at *24 (citing García Benavente v. Aljoma Lumber, Inc., 162 D.P.R. 572, 584, 2004 TSPR No. 125, 2004 Juris P.R. No. 131 (2004)(noting that Law 16, Law 45 and Law 139 implement constitutional provisions embedded in Bill of Rights) and Cuevas v. Ethicon Div. of J&J Prof. Co., 99 TSPR 107, 1999 TSPR 107, 148 D.P.R. 839, 845, 1999 Juris P.R. 111 (1999)(observing that Law 45 implements rights included in Section 16 of Article I)).
Plaintiffs did not show the employer violated any of these statutes. Nonetheless, they allege that Centerra violated Section 16 by denying Mr. Ríos of the opportunity to consume food on post, and by depriving him of a place where he could check his blood glucose levels (Docket No. 40, p. 32). Assuming the "free-of-risk" workplace provision plaintiffs rely on applies in absence of legislation, it was not infringed upon, for Mr. Ríos consumed snacks while working, and he was not prevented from using the bathroom in the safe house to check glucose levels. In fact, plaintiffs admit that Mr. Ríos was in the bathroom checking his blood sugar levels when Sgt. [*60]  Ramos allegedly spied on him (Docket No. 40, p. 22)("Ramos further spied on Ríos while he was in the bathroom checking his blood sugar levels"). And there is no evidence that Lt. López or anybody else denied Mr. Ríos permission to use the room to check on his blood glucose levels either.
With regard to Section 8, this Section operates ex proprio vigore, such that protection against abusive attacks against a person's honor, reputation and private and family life may be enforced between private parties, not only against the State. Rivera-Cartagena v. Wal-Mart P.R., Inc., 767 F. Supp. 2d 310, 322 (D.P.R. 2011). In the employment scenario, the right to privacy may be infringed upon when the employer places limitations on an employee's ability to make decisions about his private or family life; engages in indiscriminate dissemination of private or personal information; indiscriminately disseminates false or slanderous information; or unreasonably impinges upon the employee's personal or family tranquility. See, Rivera-Rosa v. Citibank, N.A., 567 F.Supp.2d 289, 302 (D.P.R. 2008). Plaintiffs have not shown that the employer transgressed any of these boundaries. While they assert that Centerra violated Mr. Ríos' constitutional right to privacy and dignity when Mr. Ramos "spied" on Mr. Ríos, as discussed above, Mr. Ríos was not spied on.34

G. Article 1802 of the Civil Code
Mr. Ríos' spouse —Lynne M. Sheridan— has brought a claim under Puerto Rico's general tort statute, Article 1802 of the Commonwealth's Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141, alleging to have suffered damages as a result of Centerra's actions toward her husband (Docket No. 40, p. 32). Article 1802 provides that "[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obligated to repair the damage so done." Id. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has held that in certain circumstances, "relatives of a person who has been the victim of workplace discrimination may bring claims under Article 1802 to be compensated for any harm to them resulting from the discrimination." Pagán-Colón v. Walgreens of San Patricio, Inc., 697 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2012).
Yet, those claims are "derivative of the principal plaintiff's claim" in that they are premised on some harm to the principal plaintiff, and if the principal plaintiff's claim fails, "so too does the relative's derivative claim." Pagán-Colón, 697 F.3d at 15. As Ms. Sheridan's claim derives from and hinges on Mr. Ríos' claims and those claims do not survive, Ms. Sheridan's derivative claim under Article 1802 must be dismissed. See, Quiñones-Irizarry v. TLD de Puerto Rico, 217 F.Supp.2d 194, 199 (D.P.R. 2002)(dismissing spouse's Art. 1802 derivative claim upon dismissal of principal plaintiff's discrimination claim); Rivera-Rodríguez, 367 F.Supp.2d at 230 (similar).

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons [*62]  stated, Centerra's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 24) is GRANTED and the case DISMISSED. Judgment shall be entered accordingly.

No. CE-94-499 Certiorari
JUSTICE HERNÁNDEZ DENTON delivered the opinion of the Court.
San Juan, Puerto Rico, April 1, 1998
Here we have an opportunity to address the relationship existing between the exclusiveness of the financial remedy granted by Act No, 80 of May 30, 19715 (29 L.P.R.A. §§ 185(a) et seq.) to employees retained under an employment-at-will contract who are [*63]  wrongfully discharged; the employer immunity granted by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, Act No. 45 of April 18, 1935, as amended, 11 L.P.R.A, § 1 et seq.; and damage actions for infringement of the right of privacy and the right to the protection against abusive attacks on the honor, reputation, and private or family life enshrined in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. P.R. Const, art. II, §§ 1 and 8, L.P.R.A., vol. 1.
I
Norma Segarra Hernández worked for twenty-four years in the Collections Department of Banco de Ponce, in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, In 1987, while she worked for Banco de Ponce, the Executive Vice President of Royal Bank of Puerto Rico (hereinafter, Royal Bank), Jimmy Sotomayor, contacted Segarra Hernández to offer her the position of Manager of Royal Bank's Centralized Collection Department.
The parties met several times to discuss the details of the [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Eventually, the then Vice President of Royal Bank, Ismael [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] document with the final terms of the offer to Segarra [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] accepted the offer, and on June 1, 1987, she began to work for that institution in the position offered with an annual salary of $24,500.
When she arrived at her new job, the Bank [*64]  asked Segarra Hernández to sign a probationary service contract. Although at the negotiation stage she was not warned about the probationary character of her position, Segarra Hernández decided to sign the document, Joint Exhibit II.
The probationary period ran from June 1, 1987, to September 1, 1987. At the end of that period, Segarra Hernández received a favorable evaluation, See "Staff Report-Probationary Period." Exhibit IV, On that occasion, the following areas were appraised: responsibility, attitude, accuracy, ability to grasp the procedures, mental alertness, capacity, customer relations, initiative, judgment, and organization skills, among others. In most of these, Segarra Hernández received a "good" rating. In "personal neatness," she received a "very good" rating. She received a lower rating ("improvement required") only in the areas of judgment and organization.1 Her overall performance, however, was rated "good." Ismael Rodríguez sent the report to the Bank's Human Resources Department recommending that she be offered the permanent position.
We must point out that by the end of August of that year, even during Segarra Hernández's probationary period, Royal Bank's Audit Division [*65]  rendered a report on the work of the Bank's Collections Department. The report contained an assessment of that department's operations for the period between November 25, 1985, and August 18, 1987, and, thus, included an evaluation of Segarra Hernández's first month and a half in her job. The report revealed several deficiencies that, in the opinion of the trial judge, were entirely attributable to the former Collections Manager, not to Segarra Hernández.
Thus, by the end of August 1987, before the end of the probationary period, Segarra Hernández was relieved of her responsibility to oversee the Legal Collections section, a. Bank division that handled written-off cases that were referred for legal collection, Subsequently, on September 25, 1987, Rolando Cardona, Royal Bank's Assistant to the Vice President, sent Segarra Hernández a memorandum stating that during the past three months the Bank's delinquent loans had increased. Joint Exhibit VI. Segarra Hernández disputed the contents of the memorandum and expressed her position in writing.
In October 1987, Ismael Rodríguez sent Segarra Hernández another memorandum, informing her that he had noticed that the work plan for October was [*66]  not being implemented as agreed. Exhibit VB. In another memorandum, dated January 28, 1988, he required her to submit the January work plan of the Collections Department.
In February 1988, Segarra Hernández was evaluated again by Rodríguez. On this occasion, she received a 3.65 score on a 1 to 7 scale. According to the [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] the trial judge, the Bank rounded off that score to 4, which was the employees' expected rating.2
In April 1988, Segarra Hernández was removed from the Bank's Collections Department and relocated to the Auto Department. On that occasion, Fernando Urrego, Senior Vice President of Royal Bank, informed her that said decision was made by recommendation of Rodríguez. Segarra Hernández objected to her relocation arguing that she was not qualified to perform the new functions assigned to her. She said that her new position required her to visit auto dealers, but that she did not have a car and neither could she drive a ear, and, she did not have a driver's license. According to the transcript of evidence, the Director of Royal Bank's Auto Department agreed with her in that she was not qualified for the position. We must point out that when she was relocated to the Auto Department, she had the same salary and the same benefits she received as Collections Department Manager.
In May 1988, approximately one month after Segarra Hernández's relocation to the Auto Department, Rodríguez asked Urrego to discharge Segarra Hernández and recommended Rolando Cardona for the Collections Department Manager position. [*68]  He also suggested that the latter be given the title of Assistant Vice President. Despite this recommendation, Segarra Hernández was again relocated, this time to the Bank's Revolving Credit Department. She worked there for five months.
In view of this situation, Segarra Hernández met with Gloria Fuxá, the Bank's Human Resources Manager. Segarra Hernández informed Fuxá what she believed were irregularities committed in Royal Bank by her superiors, and which she had detected while she worked for the Bank. She stated that she had mentioned these irregularities to Ismael Rodríguez himself, unaware that he was implicated. She also pointed out such irregularities to Fernando Urrego.3
In November 1988, Segarra Hernández was evaluated again, and she received a 3-point score. According to the performance rating scale, she was within the Bank's expectations. Segarra Hernández objected to this appraisal by indicating on the very document that it was based on "lies and tricks that sought to cover up irregularities committed by (her) superiors."
In March 1989, Segarra Hernández reported to the State Insurance Fund, and by decision of June 12, 1989, the Manager of the Fund concluded that Segarra Hernández [*69]  had suffered a work-related accident, At the end of the twelve-month period of job reservation prescribed by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, since Segarra Hernández did not seek reinstatement, Royal Bank terminated the employment relationship.
Based on these facts, on March 9, 1990, Segarra Hernández brought an action for breach of contract and damages against Royal Bank of Puerto Rico, its parent company, Royal Bank of Canada, their respective insurance companies, and against several executives of the Puerto Rico affiliate, Segarra Hernández essentially alleged that there was an employment-at-will contract between the parties which was breached by Royal Bank when she was demoted without her consent. Complaint at 2; Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari at 34. She also pointed out that the alleged breach of contract caused plaintiff a "nervous breakdown brought about by the harassment and improper pressures to which she had been submitted by her superiors." Id. at 35.
After multiple procedural incidents, the parties agreed that the Court would initially rule on the issue of defendant's liability, leaving the damages award for subsequent determination, To those ends, the court [*70]  heard the evidence between November 1993 and January 1994.
Finally, the trial court (Hon. Melvin Padilla Feliciano, J.) rendered a partial judgment ruling that:
The preponderance of the evidence in plaintiff's personnel file disproves defendants' theory that her work was poor, that she was breaching her employment contract, or that she deserved to be dismissed, to have her responsibilities reduced, or to be totally relieved [of her functions] as Collections Department Manager.
Judgment at 8.
Thus, the trial court held Royal Bank liable for the actions of its employees. In the opinion of the court below: "the evidence showed that Mrs. Segarra was a victim of harassment, pressure, and belittling by Mr. Rodríguez, who wanted her dismissed because she had discovered the irregular actions of Mr. Rodríguez himself." Judgment at 8. Also, the court a quo held that co-defendants Royal Bank of Canada and Antilles Insurance Company had been obstinate "in defending themselves in the case at bar." Partial Judgment at 9.
Feeling aggrieved by the partial judgment, co-defendants Royal Bank of Puerto Rico, Royal Bank of Canada, and Antilles Insurance Company petitioned this Court for certiorari assigning [*71]  five errors that essentially consist of the following:
1. Whether the trial court erred in weighing the evidence by ruling that Segarra Hernández was the object of evaluations, pressures, and [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] abusive and unjustified attacks against her human dignity.
2. Whether the that court erred in ruling that there is [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] from the Constitution of the Commonwealth of [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] employee to seek redress for the actions—,such as [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Segarra Hernández—of a private employer or its agents.
3. Whether the acts alleged by Mrs. Segarra solely establish a right to claim the pecuniary relief for wrongful tacit dismissal established by Act 80.
4. Whether the employer immunity granted to Royal Bank by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act bars Mrs. Segarra Hernández from claiming compensation for the alleged mental anguish and health conditions caused by her work assessments and demotion.
5. Whether defendants were obstinate in pursuing this action.
After carefully examining the parties' briefs, the record of the case, and the transcript of the in-trial testimony, we will jointly analyze the first four assignments, We will eventually examine the rest.
II
Royal Bank [*72]  contends that the trial court erred in holding it liable for the damage alleged by Segarra Hernández. In Royal Bank's opinion, such decision was based on a misinterpretation of Arroyo v. Rattan Specialties, Inc., 117 D.P.R. 35 [17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 43] (1986), in which we reaffirmed that the right of privacy enshrined in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico operates ex proprio vigore and that it may be enforced even between private individuals. Royal Bank also points out that the trial court decision in the case at bar is an impermissible expansion of the rule laid down in Arroyo, which "is not only legally unacceptable, but which will also turn the field of management, administration, and discipline of human resources into an unmanageable battlefield of constitutional litigation, with the ominous financial implications this would entail," Petition for Certiorari at 12.
On the other hand, Royal Bank alleges that, even assuming that those rights had been violated, at the most, Segarra Hernández would only be entitled to claim the remedy granted by Act No, 80 of May 30, 1976, commonly known as "Wrongful Dismissal Compensation Act." 29 L.P.R.A. 185 et seq. In the alternative, Royal Bank contends that the employer immunity granted by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act precludes [*73]  a lawsuit against the Bank.
A
In Arroyo v. Rattan Specialties, Inc., 117 D.P.R. 35 [17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 43], we analyzed the right of privacy, the inviolability of the dignity of the human being, and the right to be protected against risks to the personal integrity enshrined in Art. II, Secs. 1 and 8 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in the context of a labor-management relationship.4 In so doing, a balance was struck between these individual rights and the employer's right to fully enjoy his property, also warranted by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. P.R. Const. art. II, § 7.5 Finally, we concluded that:
Absent special circumstances constituting a compelling state interest, our society demands that we tip the balance in favor of protecting the worker's right of privacy, the inviolability of his dignity, and his right to be protected against risks to his integrity in his work, vis-à-vis the employer's right to enjoy his private property.
Arroyo v. Rattan Specialties, Inc., 117 D.P.R. at 63 [17 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 74].
Based on prior pronouncements, we reaffirmed that when the privacy and personal dignity of citizens are violated by private persons, all citizens have the right to seek a court injunction to order the [*74]  employer to cease and desist from pursuing any practice that may impinge upon those rights. This remedy constitutes a mechanism of an extraordinary nature that allows every employee to "protect his constitutional right of privacy and... his personal integrity in his work." Id. at 64 [id. at 75].
In Arroyo, we also held that all employees or workers may seek redress in court for injuries attributable to the employer. Thus, in addition to the injunction, a worker may seek redress in court for the damage sustained as a result of the violation of his constitutional rights, such as: the right of privacy and the right to be protected against attacks on the honor and personal reputation. See: Acevedo v. Western Digital Caribe, Inc., 140 D.P.R. 452, 1996 Juris P.R. No. 42 [40 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1996); Mildred Siurano v. Bentley P.R., Inc., 132 D.P.R. 331, 1992 Juris P.R. No. 175 [32 P.R. Offic, Trans.    ] (1992).
Now then, regarding the exclusiveness of the Act No. 80 remedy, we affirmed that though, ordinarily, a worker or employee retained under an employment-at-will contract who is wrongfully dismissed is only entitled to that remedy: "a dismissal that has the purpose and effect of thwarting or defeating a clear public policy, is an exception to that rule." Arroyo v. Rattan Specialties, Inc., 117 D.P.R, at 65 [17 P.R. Offic, Trans. at 76].
In Rivera v. Security Nat. Life Ins. Co., 106 D.P.R. 517 [6 P.R. Offic. Trans, 727] (1977), we had already intimated this possibility by expressly affirming that the exclusiveness of remedies of labor laws "do[es] not exclude [*75]  the civil liability of an employer for tortious conduct other than the mere violation of a labor law provision." 106 D.P.R. at 527 [6 P.R. Offic, Trans. at 738]. Thus, the exclusiveness of the Act No. 80 remedy, as compensation for the damage caused by the discharge: subsists with respect to the mere dismissal without just cause, "if other independent tortious actions concur with the discharge, the employer may be held liable for said conduct." Mildred Siurano v. Bentley P.R. Inc., 132 D.P.R. at 342 [32 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (in which we clearly stated that the claim under sec. 1802 of the Civil Code, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141, at issue there, was by virtue of certain defamatory accusations leveled at the [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] employer in discharging him). See also: Acevedo v, Western [ILLEGIBLE TEXT], 140 D.P.R. 452, 1996 Juris P.R. No. 42 [40 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ]; Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Int. Med. Avanzada, 137 D.P.R. 643, 1994 Juris P.R. No. 149 [37 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1994).
By virtue of the above, it is clear that when a worker retained under an employment-at-will contract is dismissed without just cause, and has also been the object of actions that violate his right of privacy or that constitute an attack on his personal integrity, then such worker may claim the Act 80 pecuniary compensation and may also file an action to claim damages. In that case, the damage claim stems from the illegal actions, not linked to the dismissal, [*76]  that may be indemnified under our body of laws. Of course, if after the dismissed worker presents all the evidence it is established that there was but a mere wrongful dismissal and that he was not the object of compensable illegal actions under sec. 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, the worker may only seek redress under Act 80.
B
The Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, 11 L.P.R.A. § 1 et seq., on the other hand, is another remedial statute that seeks to offer workers certain protections and benefits, particularly in the context of work-related accidents.6
This law establishes a compulsory insurance scheme directed at "provid[ing] those workers who suffer an injury or disease arising in the course and as a consequence of employment with a fast and effective remedy free from the complexities of an ordinary damage suit." Pacheco Pietri y otros v. y otros, 133 D.P.R. 907, 914, 1993 Juris P.R. No. 117 [33 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ,    ] (1993). However, while the worker obtains prompt financial support and medical treatment when he suffers an injury during the course and as a consequence of his employment without having to prove that the injury was the result of the employer's negligence, the latter acquires immunity against any action in damages that the worker could normally bring against the employer regarding the incidents and circumstances that gave rise to the injury. Alonso García v. Flores Hermanos Cement Prods., 107 D.P.R. 789, 792 [7 P.R. Offic. Trans. 860, 861] (1978). This scheme establishes art objective [*77]  social responsibility that seeks to prevent that workers be left in a situation of forsakenness by having to show the employer's negligence in court In order to obtain some kind of compensation, Santiago Hodge v. Parke Davis Co., 126 D.P.R. 1, 9, 1990 Juris P.R. No. 42 [26 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1990).
Thus, while Act 80 provides a pecuniary remedy for a wrongful dismissal, the Workmen's Compensation Act provides a financial and medical remedy for injuries suffered in the course and as a consequence of employment. These two statutes have different scopes of applicability, It may happen that an employee who reports to the State Insurance Fund and who is subsequently reinstated in his work may be discharged without just cause. In the appropriate cases, the worker may be entitled to the Act 80 compensation even if he has previously reported to the State Insurance Fund.7
Regarding the immunity conferred by the Workmen's Compensation Act to insured employers, we have emphasized that it is absolute in nature. Alonso García v. Flores Hermanos Cement Prods., 107 D.P.R. at 792 [7 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 861]. We have also clearly established that there is no cause of action against an insured employer for an injury suffered in the course and as consequence of the employment, regardless of the employer's degree of negligence. Torres Solís et al. v. A.E.E. et als., 136 D.P.R.     [36 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1994); Santiago Hodge v. Parke Davis, 126 D.P.R. at 8 [26 P.R. Offic. Trans, at    ]; De Andino v. De Las Fuentes Fluviales De P.R., 93 P.R.R. 168, 179, 93 D.P.R. 170 (1966). Thus, the worker's only remedy in a work-related [*78]  accident when his employer is insured, is the remedy provided by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act.
Under this scheme, however, them are exceptions, One exception is established by the very Act, which allows a worker who suffers an accident at work to bring a damage action when the employer is not insured. See, secs. 13 and 20; 11 L.P.R.A §§ 16 and 21. See also: Díaz Medina v. Santiago del Toro, 110 D.P.R. 139 [10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 174] (1980); Velez Sanchez v. Indus. Comm'n of P.R., 107 D.P.R. 797 [7 P.R. Offic. Trans. 867] (1978). Likewise, the employer immunity conferred by law does not extend to injuries caused intentionally by the employer. Odriozola v. S. Cosmetic Dist. Corp., 116 D.P.R. 485, 501 [16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 595, 614] (1985). In these cases, the possible illegal conduct and—in some contexts—the possible criminal conduct, is not exempt from an ordinary damage claim because such conduct may not be reasonably linked to the normal work performance.
A compensable injury under the Workmen's Compensation Act usually triggers the employer immunity. However, the fact that the injury is noncompensable does not necessarily imply that the employer immunity does not operate. In Pacheco Pietri y otros v. E.L.A. y otros, 133 D.P.R, at 919 [33 P.R. Offic. Trans. at    ], we summed up the applicable rule in that regard as follows:
A worker who suffers an injury during the course and as a result of hisiher employment is covered by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act. The fact that the injury does not result in disability, [*79]  and is therefore noncompensable, does not affect the coverage of the Act. If the injury is the result of a work-related accident, the exclusive remedy applies. That is, the employer is covered by employer immunity and the worker is entitled to receive the medical assistance benefits and financial support that the Act provides.
To decide whether an employer is covered by the immunity conferred by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, we need only determine whether the accident sustained by the worker lies within the scope of the statutory coverage. To such ends, it must be determined whether the injury Is the result of a work-related [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] or is aggravated during the course thereof." Alonso García v. [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] 102 D.P.R. 689, 699 [2 P.R. Offic. Trans. 891, 902] (1974). That is, in order for the employer to successfully invoke the employer immunity, it is only necessary to evaluate whether or not there is a causal nexus or relation between the worker's injury and his work.
Bearing the above discussion in mind, we will now address the controversies raised in this case.
III
Royal Bank points out that Segarra Hernández is solely entitled to the Act 80 compensation because the [*80]  actions for which she claims compensation, had they occurred, would only constitute a tacit dismissal or constructive abandonment —as defined in sec. 5 of Act 80 (29 L.P.R.A, § 185(e))— and, therefore, this would be the only applicable legal provision.
Segarra Hernández, on the other hand, points out that her resignation was not triggered by any of the circumstances contemplated M sec. 5 of Act 80, but that she "stopped working when she developed a disability caused by the actions of her superiors." Opposition to Issuance of a Writ of Certiorari at 12. In the alternative, she states that even assuming that her circumstances constitute a tacit dismissal, there is a clear public policy in our legal system to protect the constitutional rights of employees that cannot yield to situations such as the one described by her.
The record shows that Segarra Hernández went regularly to her work at Royal Bank until the middle of March 1989 when she began to skip work because of illness. On March 15, 1989, she reported to the State Insurance Fund. Eventually, on June 12, 1989, the Fund decided that Segarra Hernández "had suffered a work-related accident while she performed inherent functions in the course and as a consequence of employment" and ruled [*81]  that she was entitled to the protection of the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act, Joint Exhibit XVIII. Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari at 281.
Segarra Hernández did not request reinstatement in her position within the twelve-month period prescribed by the Workmen's Compensation Act. Act No. 48 of April 18, 1950, sec. 5(a); 11 L.P.R.A. § 7. See also, Velez Rodríguez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 135 D.P.R. 500, 1994 Juris P.R. No. 37 [35 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1994), Thus, Royal Bank opted to dispense with her services.
According to Royal Bank, the described facts constitute a dismissal under the terms of Act 80. We do not agree.
Section 5 of Act 80 provides:
For the purposen of this act, discharge shall be understood to be, besides the employee's layoff, his suspension indefinitely or for a term (of) over three (3) months, except in the case of employees of seasonal industries or businesses or the resignation of the employee caused by the actions of the employer directed to induce or compel him to resign, such as imposing or trying to impose on him more onerous working conditions reducing his salary, lowering his category or submitting him [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] criticisms or humiliations by deed or word.
1976 P.R. Laws 251, 254. [29 L.P.R.A. 185e.]
At least three possible dismissal situations arise from [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] employee's layoff; [*82]  (2) the employee's indefinite suspension for [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] months; and (3) the resignation of the employee caused by the actions of the employer, such as imposition of onerous working conditions, salary reduction, and demotion, among others.
The first dismissal situation contemplated by Act 80 is the layoff. That is precisely the situation under our consideration, The employer-employee relationship between the parties formally ended when Royal Bank notified Segarra Hernández that they were dispensing with her services. The fact that Segarra Hernández had reported to the State Insurance Fund does not alter the conclusion that she stopped working for Royal Bank when she was laid off once the Bank was able to exercise that faculty under the law.
However, to be compensable under Act 80, a dismissal requires something more: it must be without just cause.
As we indicated, Segarra Hernández did not seek reinstatement in her position within the twelve-month period established in the Workmen's Compensation Act. As we well know, this is a "lapse" term that starts to run on the date that the work-related accident or illness occurred, Alvira v. SK & F Laboratories Co., 142 D.P.R. 803, 1997 Juris P.R. No. 40 [42 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1997).
The legislature deemed that this was a reasonable period for protecting [*83]  the right of the employee to retain his job, thus establishing a balance between the rights of the employer and those of the injured employee. The legislature did not have the intention of placing on the employer the obligation to reserve the worker's employment indefinitely. Torres v. Star Kist Caribe, Inc., 134 D.P.R. 1024, 1033, 1994 Juris P.R. 5 [34 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ,    ] (1994).
At the end of this period, the employer may dismiss the employee if the latter has not been discharged from treatment by the Fund. An employee's layoff in these circumstances does not constitute a wrongful dismissal since the very Workmen's Compensation Act sees the layoff as a prerogative of the employer, absent a timely reinstatement application by the Injured worker. Thus, we are compelled to conclude that, in this case, Segarra Hernández is not entitled to the Act 80 benefits and, therefore, the trial court did not err in denying these benefits.
We will now examine the other assignments made by Royal Bank.
IV
Royal Bank contends that since Segarra Hernández is receiving benefits from the State Insurance Fund, the Bank is covered by the employer immunity conferred by the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act.
Certainly, the Manager of the State Insurance Fund concluded that Segarra Hernández had suffered a work-related [*84]  accident under the terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act, In light of this decision, Segarra Hernández received [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] contemplated by law.
The existence of an injury compensable under the Workmen's [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] usually triggers the employer's immunity. However, it is a well-known [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] exceptions to this general rule, for instance: intentional action [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] discriminatory actions by the employer that violate a clear public policy. Segarra Hentandez's allegations contained in the complaint fail within these exceptions. Therefore, we must see whether Royal Bank actually violated the alleged constitutional rights thus triggering one of the exceptions that would exclude this case from the applicability of the employer immunity conferred by the Workmen's Compensation Act.
V
The rights of privacy and the right to be protected against abusive attacks on the honor and personal reputation enshrined in sections 1 and 8 of our Bill of Rights have special preeminence under our constitutional scheme.8 Both constitutional provisions impose a dual function on the State: the State must refrain from acting in a form that violates the scope of individual freedom and privacy, and it must take [*85]  positive action on behalf of the individual. See, [III] José Trías Mange, Historia Constitutional de Puerto Rico 200, Rio Piedras, Ed. U.P.R. (1982).
In describing these rights within the constitutional scheme of the United States, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the interests protected by the right of privacy are essentially two: "[o]ne is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions." Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1977).
In our jurisdiction, we have asserted that the right to a private and family life "imposes on every person the duty to refrain from interfering with the private or family life of the other human beings," Colon v. Romero Barceló, 112 D.P.R. 573, 576 [12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 718, 723] (1982). (Emphasis added.) Given its importance, we have recognized that this right operates ex proprio vigore and that the state action requirement to invoke it between private individuals is not necessary. Also, this right may be [*86]  asserted through a damage action under sec. 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code whereby the aggrieved person may obtain redress for the "damages caused by a violation [of] the duty of not Interfering with somebody else's privacy." Id. at 576-577 [id. at 723].9
An examination of our previous rulings and of the federal caselaw reveals that this right is injured when, among other things, limitations are placed on an individual's faculty to make personal, family, or private decisions, Pueblo v. Duarte Mendoza, 109 D.P.R. 596 [9 P.R. Offic. Trans. 797] (1980); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973); when a couple's private life must be publicly exposed in order to obtain a divorce, Morales Morales v. Commonwealth, 107 D.P.R. 250 [7 P.R. Offic. Trans. 278] (1978); or when limitations are placed on the faculty to decide whether to use contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1972).
Also, the right of privacy and the right to be protected against abusive attacks on the honor and personal reputation are injured when the tranquility of the home is shattered, La De Vict. v. De Dios Pentecostal, 102 D.P.R. 20 [2 P.R. Offic. Trans. 28] (1974); E.L.A. v. Hermandad de Empleados, 104 D.P.R. 436 [4 P.R. Offic. Trans. 605] (1975); when a person is harassed through the telephone system, P.R. Tel. Co. v. De Rodríguez, 114 D.P.R. 328 [14 P.R. Offic. Trans. 420] (1983); or when the constant presence of a photograph in the media constitutes an undue invasion of the family life, Colon v. Romero Barceló, 112 D.P.R. 573 [12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 718].
Since [*87]  this is a right that may be invoked between private persons, an employer is obliged to not infringe its employees' zone of individual autonomy that the right of privacy protects. Thus, a violation of the constitutionally protected individual ambit imposes on the employer the legal obligation to repair the damage caused. However, to prove the allegations of a cause of action for violation of the right of privacy arising in the context of a labor-management relationship, the plaintiff must present evidence of the employer's concrete actions that impinge upon the plaintiff's private or family life.
This case does not present any of the situations that we have in the past considered detrimental to these constitutional rights. This case does not deal with an action that involves the indiscriminate dissemination of private or personal information of Segarra Hernández or that unreasonably impinges on her personal or family tranquility. Neither are we dealing with the dissemination of false or slanderous information, or with actions that limit Segarra Hernández's faculty to make decisions about her private or family life.
The evidence presented by Segarra Hernández shows that the aspects mentioned [*88]  in support of her claim are essentially: (1) that Ismael Rodríguez and Rolando Cardona sent her certain memorandums that she considered offensive and that were meant to harass her; (2) that she was removed from her position of Centralized Collections Department Manager and relocated to other Bank divisions; and (3) that she was the object of certain humiliations and insults by her supervisors.
Regarding the memorandums sent to Segarra Hernández, we must point out that these were five, which were sent between June 1987 and March 1989, when she reported to the State Insurance Fund. In all of them, Segarra Hernández is required to prepare certain reports or to provide a specific information. The memorandums do not contain any language that may be considered offensive or harassing.10 We do not think that the number of memorandums mentioned by Segarra Hernández in her complaint—five in a period of almost two years working for Royal Bank, and one of which was not addressed to her—could be deemed as constituting harassment.
Royal Bank presented evidence supporting the increase in [*92]  delinquency cases and the fact that the work performed by the Collections Department was not optimal. Most of this is documentary evidence, and, as we well know, this Court is in the some position as the trial court when examining and weighing the same. Torres Arzola v. Policía de P.R., 117 D.P.R. 204 [17 P.R. Offic. Trans. 245] (1986).
Our analysis of the documentary evidence reveals that the department directed by Segarra Hernández was having problems since before she came to work there. However, these problems were not resolved after her arrival. The memoranda sent to Segarra Hernández were framed within this context and they look more like legitimate actions of an employer to improve the operations of one of its departments, than like abusive attacks on the personal integrity of an employee.
On the other hand, the circumstances that led to plaintiff's separation from the Collections Department—following a cut-down in her responsibilities as Collections Department Manager—and to her relocation to the Auto Department and, eventually, to the Revolving Credit Department, do not seem to have the scope claimed by plaintiff. More so, considering that plaintiff's salary was not reduced and she continued having the same perks she had as managerial employee. The evidence [*93]  also shows that at the end of 1988, she received a $500 annual salary increase from the Bank. T.E. at 122.
Also, the evaluations of Segarra Hernández's work reveal that even though her performance was satisfactory and, according to the rating scale, she met the expectation of the institution, her overall performance was below average—she scored 3 on a l to 7 scale. The fact that her evaluation reflected that she barely met the institution's expectations did not preclude the Bank from restructuring its department and from transferring personnel in light of the institution's legitimate needs, as long as in doing so it did not violate statutory provisions or constitutional rights of the employees.
Finally, a reading of the transcript of evidence does not reveal specific instances that may be regarded as insults or humiliations violating her constitutional rights, as alleged by plaintiff in her complaint. Only the testimony of one of plaintiff's witnesses shows that, on several occasions, Rolando Cardona had in private conversations referred to Segarra Hernández as "the fat one." Although this expression, along with other facts, may constitute a pattern of humiliations that violate the right [*94]  of privacy of an employee, here, the evidence reveals that such action merely reflects Cardona's nonprofessional and morally reprehensible conduct and does not necessarily mean that he transgressed constitutionally protected limits.
The evidence clearly shows that there was some degree of tension between the parties. But, the transcript of Segarra Hernández's statement does not show a picture of hostility and belittling towards her. For example, when asked about her relationship with one of her supervisors—Ismael Rodríguez—Segarra Hernández testified the following:
Q. At this time, how is your relationship with Mr. Ismael Rodríguez, around March 1988?
A. Well, Mr. Rodríguez always has a smile on his... face....
Q. Your relationship with him, how was it? You told me at the beginning that it was good....
A. Well—as I also told you at the beginning, I get along well with everybody. I felt somewhat uneasy. Of course, but I was doing my job and I did my best to show him that I knew my job and that I would be able to do it and come through, and thus is stated in the April memo.
T.E. at 127.
A mere feeling of uneasiness in the workplace due to some labor-management situation does not constitute a violation [*95]  of the right of privacy by the employer. Therefore, we do not ratify the trial court ruling.
Segarra Hernández alleges that her supervisors harassed her because she discovered certain irregularities committed by them. We observed, however, that the evidence contradicts this assertion, since those irregularities were known [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] plaintiff after she was transferred from the Collections Department [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Also, the documentary evidence shows that the Bank inquired [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] determined that, though Ismael Rodríguez had indeed committed [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] irregularities, the gravity of the same only warranted a written [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] XIV.
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Segarra Hernández has not stated a cause of action and, thus, that the trial court erred in deciding that with its actions Royal Bank injured her constitutional rights of privacy and her right to be protected against abusive attacks on her honor and reputation. In this context, the findings of fact of the trial court are not supported by the evidence and are clearly unreasonable.
Before closing this opinion, there is a point we must clarify. As a general rule, the transfer of an employee to [*96]  a lower-tier position will generate friction between those who make the decision and the transferred employee. From the transferred employee's point of view, such action would ordinarily be perceived as an offensive action. However, this individual perception does not necessarily injure the employee's right of privacy and neither does it constitute an abusive attack against an employee's honor and personal reputation, compensable under our legal system.
We are not denying the possibility that a pattern of transfers and internal communications in the workplace may, in appropriate cases, create a climate of harassment and persecution that could violate a worker's right of privacy, and, thus, could make the employer liable for the damages regardless of any other kind of remedy conferred to the employee by the labor protection laws. To such ends, however, the claimant must show that the employer's actions are not related to the normal workplace performance and that they constitute harmful attacks on plaintiff's dignity and personal or family integrity.
Mere transfers of positions or the sending of memoranda evaluating work performance do not constitute per se a violation of the constitutional [*97]  right of privacy. Such transfers or internal communications must be arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious; they must create a hostile environment for the employee which precludes him from feeling safe at work; they must be triggered by a motive not related to the employer's legitimate interest to safeguard an effective work performance, or must contain expressions that are clearly defamatory or injurious. In so deciding, trial courts must analyze the evidence presented by an employee to determine if the alleged constitutional violation was committed or if the actions reported by the employee constitute mere legitimate administrative functions.
We deem that this is the situation in this case. Although Segarra Hernández developed a disabling work-related condition for which she was treated by the State Insurance Fund, in our opinion, the employer's actions described in the complaint did not injure her constitutional right of privacy and her right to be protected against abusive attacks on her honor and personal reputation. The trial court erred in deciding otherwise.

We must still consider the obstinacy ruling made by the trial [ILLEGIBLE TEXT]
The issues raised in this case are clear [*98]  novel issues [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] exclusiveness of the diverse labor-law remedies and the [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] never been considered by this Court. Litigation under these [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] constitute obstinacy, Elba A.B.M. v. U.P.R., 125 D.P.R., 294, 1990 Juris P.R. 13 [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] (1990); Santos Bermúdez v. Texaco P.R., Inc., 123 D.P.R. 351, 1989 Juris P.R. No. 23 [23 P.R. Offic. Trans. 324] (1989); M. Quilichini Sucrs., Inc. v. Villa Inv. Corp., 112 D.P.R. 322 [12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 401] (1982); Morales Garay v. Roldán Coss, 110 D.P.R. 701 [10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 9091 (1981); Rodriguez v. Bigay Ramirez, 110 D.P.R. 1 [10 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1] (1980).
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in deciding that co-defendants Royal Bank of Puerto Rico and Royal Bank of Canada were obstinate in pursuing this action brought against them.
The judgment of the trial court is reversed.
Justice Negrón García rendered a dissenting opinion, Justice Faster Berlingeri dissented without a written opinion. Justice Rebollo López took no part in this decision. Justice Corrada del Rfo disqualified himself.

JUSTICE NEGRÓN GARCÍA, dissenting.
San Juan, Puerto Rico, April 1, 1998
Unlike in the conclusion of the majority, we are dealing here with the (unjustified) constructive discharge of Norma Segarra Hernández resulting from a pattern of in-house transfers, persecution, and harassment concerted by some of Royal Bank of Puerto Rico's managerial staff. This was in retaliation for some irregularities she detected and informed with regard to Vice President Ismael Rodríguez, who unduly authorized and granted [*99]  some loans to a relative, in excess of the latter's loan margin.
The oral and documentary evidence, as weighed by the learned trial court (Hon. Melvin A. Padilla Feliciano, Judge), defeats the defense raised by defendants Royal Bank of Puerto Rico, Royal Bank of Canada, and their insurance company Antilles Ins. Co., in the sense that Segarra Hernández's work was poor, and that she should be relieved of her position in the Collections Department, have her responsibilities out down, and, eventually, be discharged, had she not quit for health reasons. Let us see.
Segarra Hernández, with 24 years of experience in the Collections Department of Banco de Ponce, in Ponce, received in April 1987 an offer from Jimmy Sotomayor, Executive Vice President of Royal Bank, to occupy the position of [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Centralized Collections Department. He knew about her [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] and her ability to adapt to any work environment.
After several meetings, Segura Hernández accepted the [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Vice President of Royal Bank, Ismael Rodríguez. Upon [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] required to sign a probationary service contract, even though this had not been previously negotiated. She decided to sign it, and [*100]  on June 1, 1987, she began to work with an annual salary of $24,500.
The probationary period ended on September 1. Segarra Hernández received a favorable ("good") evaluation from Rodríguez in the areas of responsibility, attitude, accuracy, ability to grasp the procedures, mental alertness, capacity, customer relations, initiative, judgment, and organization skills. For "personal neatness," she received a "very good," and only in the areas of judgment and organization she received an "improvement required" rating. Given this evaluation, Rodríguez recommended her for tenure.
Between August 18 and 25, the Bank's own Audit Division conducted an evaluation of the Collections Department. This audit covered from November 25, 1985, to August 18, 1987, that is, one year and nine months, Since Segarra Hernández had taken on her job on June 1, 1987 (two and a half months before the audit report was rendered), the deficiencies found obviously were ascribable to former Manager Rolando Cardona, who was in charge of that Department for most of the audited period. Nevertheless, by the end of August, without further possible justification, she was relieved of her responsibility of overseeing the Legal [*101]  Collections Section, which dealt with written-off cases that had been referred to an attorney.
On September 25, Cardona, then Rodríguez's assistant, sent her a memorandum pointing out an increase in loan delinquency. She brought her objections to Rodríguez and clarified that the increase was closely related to the deficiencies in the origin of the loans; that is, that it was a direct consequence of a faulty loan-screening process. In addition, on several occasions she pointed out the shortcomings in equipment and other areas of the Collections Department and the inconveniences she had to put up with in order to perform her functions better.1
On February 8, 1988, Rodríguez evaluated her and gave her a 3.65 score on a 1 to 7 scale. The Bank rounded off that score to 4.00, which is what is expected of each employee. Two months later, in April, Rodríguez and his supervisor Fernando Urrego, decided to remove her from the Collections Department. Urrego informed her that the relocation was made by Rodríguez's recommendation. She was relocated to the Automobile Department and, as of that moment, she was denied access to the loan and write-off flies. She objected to this relocation stating that [*102]  she was not qualified to perform the functions assigned her, which required her to visit automobile dealers to promote Royal Bank's car loans. She clarified that all her experience was in the collections areas—for which she had been retained—that she could not drive a car and neither did she have a driver's license, and that she was not familiar [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] metropolitan area.
William Natal Fuster, Director of the mentioned Automobile Department, was informed of the relocation, On several occasions, he indicated that she was not suitable for this job because she did not know how to drive and neither was she authorized to do so. Rodríguez would tell him to deal with her as well as he could. Natal Fuster testified that she always showed a good disposition and that, despite the working conditions, she did an excellent job. However, in view of all the circumstances, he noticed that at times she was nervous, out of control, and stressed. When Rodríguez asked Natal how was Segarra Hernández doing, he referred to her as "the fat one." Natal Faster was surprised by such attitude and thought that it was in bad taste; a lack of respect for Segarra Hernández's integrity and honor.
Two months [*103]  later, on May 19, Rodríguez sent a memorandum to Urrego requesting Segarra Hernández's dismissal. He recommended his assistant Cardona—whom he trusted—to replace her as Collections Department Manager with the title of Assistant Vice President. Oddly enough, this recommendation was made notwithstanding the fact that Cardona was the one responsible for the past deficiencies mentioned In the Collections Department's audit report, before Segarra Hernández took on her work there. Rodríguez's recommendation was made one month after she had been allegedly, temporarily, relocated to the Automobile Department.
There, Segarra Hernández still held the title of Collections Manager, even though she was assigned to the Automobile Department. Though she was not in the Collections Department, the Royal Bank issued false employment certifications, when it certified on June 15 and August 23, 1988, that she was their manager. At the time, she was actually doing office work, unrelated to the collections area, in the Automobile Department. In fact, she was denied access to documents, to which she was entitled as Collections Manager, such as the 1988 losses.
Notwithstanding the serious inconveniences that [*104]  she faced—caused by the irregularities that she discovered and Rodríguez and Cardona's personal campaign against her to cover up those irregularities—Segarra Hernández obtained positive results and improvements in the administrative phase.
From the Automobile Department, she was relocated, for the second time, to the Revolving Credit Department under the supervision of Nitza Garland. She was given instructions, without a title, that supposedly described her duties in the new position. She had to sign them as evidence of the relocation. Aida Roig, Official of the Human Resources Department, Instructed her not to sign the document if she did not agree with it. She stayed in the Revolving Credit Department for five months.
In September 1988, in a meeting with Gloria Pita, Human Resources Manager, Segarra Hernández informed her about the irregularities committed by [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] had previously discovered. She complained that she had [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] Rodríguez himself, as her immediate supervisor, unaware at [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] involved in the same. She also informed Fuxá that she was a [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] and persecution campaign.
In November 1988, Segarra Hernández was evaluated again and she [*105]  was given a score that met the Bank's expectations. On that occasion, she objected and wrote down, in the very document, that her evaluation was based on "lies and tricks that sought to cover up irregularities committed by my superiors." Rodríguez, Urrego, and Cardona ignored such objections.
Segarra Hernández suffered mental anguish and she developed a nervous condition, as a result of which she was absent from the Bank on March 13, 1989. She reported to the State Insurance Fund, which determined that she had a disability related to the sufferings she had to endure as a result of the treatment received at the hands of the mentioned sank officials. She did not return to the Bank, and neither did she request reinstatement. Rodríguez was eventually reprimanded for the irregularities committed and, in time, he quit working for the Bank.
II
This, we repeat, was an unjustified constructive dismissal, which, from its face, perfectly fits the Legislative Assembly's point of view; that is, "the resignation of the employee caused by the actions of the employer directed to induce or compel him to resign, such as imposing or trying to impose on him more onerous working conditions, reducing his salary, [*106]  lowering his category or submitting him to derogatory criticisms or humiliations by deed or word." 29 L.P.R.A. § 185(c). The mentioned factual background certainly entitles Segarra Hernández to a compensation under the Wrongful Dismissal Compensation Act—Act No. 80 of May 30, 1976. Although she did not formally tendered her resignation, she was absent from work due to her supervisors' conduct.
However, the majority opinion holds that the compensation does not lie because the dismissal was not unlawful. The majority opinion is based on the thesis that Segarra Hernández did not request reinstatement within the twelve-month period from the occurrence of the "accident," after reporting to the State Insurance Fund for treatment. The majority invokes Alvira v. SK & F Laboratories Co., 142 D.P.R. 803, 1997 Juris P.R. No. 40 [42 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1997).
How can the majority of the Court oblige the employee to return to such an environment of hostility, relocations, and humiliations? Or to request reinstatement? In which position? We are not dealing here with a typical or ordinary accident involving a physical wound or injury; we are dealing hero with an intangible injury that transcends the physical bounds and has an impact on the emotions, morale, and spirit.
In these circumstances, asking Segarra Hernández to [*107]  request reinstatement is a highly onerous imposition; above all, unfair, especially when her absenteeism was due to a physical and emotional state which was the direct result of the unfair treatment and harassment of her supervisors. It is absurd to allow employers to [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] such intensity that she is forced to be absent for more than twelve [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] then allege employer Immunity and a health condition as defense.
This case triggers the doctrine laid down in Rivera v. [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] 106 D.P.R. 517, 527 [6 P.R. Offic. Trans. 727, 738] (1977), [ILLEGIBLE TEXT] v. Bentley P.R., Inc., 132 D.P.R. 331, 1992 Juris P.R. No. 175 [32 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ] (1992); Alvira v. SK & F Laboratories Co., 142 D.P.R. 803 [42 P.R. Offic. Trans.    ]. By exception, a cause of action in damages accrued. Rodríguez—with the knowledge of other officials—took part in a tortious conduct unrelated to the mere violation of a labor statute. Rivera v, Security Nat. Life Ins. Co., 106 D.P.R. at 527 [6 P.R. Offic. Trans. at 738].
Precisely, the intensity of the unlawful behavior and of the injuries, and the manifest intent involved (general concerted actions executed over a span of several months), also rules out the application of the exclusive remedy and employer immunity, resulting from the Fund treatment and compensation. Cf., Odriozola v. S. Cosmetic Dist. Corp., 116 D.P.R. 485 [16 P.R. Offic. Trans. 595] (1985).
