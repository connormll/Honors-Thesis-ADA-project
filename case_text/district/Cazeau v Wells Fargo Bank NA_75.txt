Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Pierre R. Cazeau filed the above-styled employment discrimination action against Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., on January 24, 2013. [Docs. 1, 9]. In his complaint, Plaintiff asserts federal claims of retaliation, discriminatory pay, and discrimination based on national origin, gender, and perceived disability. [Doc. 9 at 16-17]. Plaintiff's claims are brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the Equal Pay Act ("EPA"), 29 U.S.C. § 206, et seq. [Doc. 9 at 1-2, 16-19]. Plaintiff has also asserted a state law claim for libel. [Doc. 9 at 17]. Defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on Plaintiff's claims based upon the pleadings, statements of material facts, exhibits, and discovery materials submitted to the court. [Doc. 42].

I. Preliminary Issues
Plaintiff has attached numerous documents to his response brief. [Docs. 44-47]. Defendant [*2]  argues that the documents should not be considered by the court in evaluating the summary judgment motion because they lack authentication. [Doc. 50 at 1-3]. "Before the 2010 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 56 arguably required that all documents submitted to support or oppose a summary judgment be authenticated." In re Gregg, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 3285, 2013 WL 3989061, at *2 (M.D. Ga. Bankr. July 2, 2013) (citations omitted). The prior version of Rule 56(e) stated, "If a paper or part of a paper is referred to in an affidavit, a sworn or certified copy must be attached to or served with the affidavit." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(1) (2009 version). This provision was omitted in the amended Rule 56, which now allows parties to cite to "particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). The 2010 amendment to Rule 56 also provides, "A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). The 2010 Advisory Committee Notes state, "The burden is on the proponent to show that the material is admissible as presented or to explain the admissible [*3]  form that is anticipated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2), 2010 Advisory Committee Notes.
The documents attached to Plaintiff's response brief are inadmissible as presented, and Plaintiff has failed to explain the anticipated admissible form. Moreover, although Plaintiff attached the hundreds of pages of documents to a declaration, he did not identify any of the documents in the declaration. Plaintiff's entire declaration consists of three sentences, the final one containing the conclusory assertion that all of the attached exhibits "are true and correct copies of what they appear to be." [Plaintiff's Declaration ("Pla. Dec.") ¶ 2]. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), a document is not admissible unless it is properly authenticated by "evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is." Fed. R. Evid. 901(a) (as amended 2011). Plaintiff has not made any claims in his declaration about what the documents are. As a result, the unauthenticated documents attached to Plaintiff's response brief will not be considered by the court.
Plaintiff has also submitted a tape recording in support of his response to Defendant's summary judgment motion. [Doc. 47, Ex. 1]. "[A] district court 'properly admits a sound recording into evidence only [*4]  when the party introducing it carries its burden of going forward with foundation evidence demonstrating that the recording as played is an accurate reproduction of relevant sounds previously audited by a witness.'" United States v. Harris, 338 Fed. Appx. 892, 895 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Biggins, 551 F.2d 64, 66 (5th Cir. 1977)). "The proponent bears the burden of establishing: (1) the competency of the operator; (2) the fidelity of the recording equipment; (3) the absence of material deletions, additions, or alterations in the relevant portions of the recording; and (4) the identification of the relevant speakers." Id. As noted supra, Plaintiff has only made a conclusory assertion that all of the exhibits attached to his declaration are "what they appear to be." [Pla. Dec. ¶ 2]. Plaintiff has not presented, or even attempted to present, any foundation evidence demonstrating the accuracy of the recording. As a result, it will not be considered by the court in evaluating Defendant's summary judgment motion.
The court also notes that Plaintiff's complaint is a typical "shotgun" pleading which the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals admonishes litigants for filing. See Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., 288 Fed. Appx. 597, 602-03 (11th Cir. 2008); United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, 470 F.3d 1350, 1354 n.6 (11th Cir. 2006) (Noting that the complaint was "a typical shotgun pleading" with numerous introductory paragraphs which were incorporated [*5]  into the first count and which were subsequently incorporated into succeeding counts, along with the paragraphs for each prior count, the court stated, "We have condemned this sort of pleading on several occasions."). Plaintiff's complaint contains numerous factual allegations followed by vague legal assertions such as, "On information and belief Defendant has engaged in a pattern of intentional gender, national origin, disability, equal pay discrimination and retaliation for opposing unlawful business practice." [Doc. 9 ¶ 57]. Plaintiff's brief filed in response to Defendant's summary judgment motion does not provide much clarity as Plaintiff often does not identify the factual allegations that support each of his claims. His response brief is filled with vague and conclusory allegations with few supporting citations, and as discussed infra, many of the cited documents are not even included in the record. Plaintiff also has not responded to many of Defendant's arguments. Instead, he has frequently asserted new theories of recovery. All of this has made "the Court's job extremely difficult and tedious." Church of Scientology of Georgia, Inc. v. City of Sandy Springs, Georgia, 843 F. Supp. 2d 1328, 1367 n.39 (N.D. Ga. 2012). While the court has attempted to decipher Plaintiff's legal claims and their [*6]  corresponding arguments, the court will not cull through the record searching for Plaintiff's evidence. See Dickson v. Amoco Performance Products, Inc., 845 F. Supp. 1565, 1570 (N.D. Ga. 1994) ("It should be a party's responsibility to direct the Court's attention separately to each portion of the record which supports each of the party's distinct arguments.").

II. Facts
When evaluating the merits of a motion for summary judgment, the court must "view the evidence and all factual inferences raised by it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party." Comer v. City of Palm Bay, Florida, 265 F.3d 1186, 1192 (11th Cir. 2001). However, mere conclusions and unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). Therefore, the evidence presented by the parties having been evaluated in accordance with the foregoing principles, the following facts are deemed to be true for the limited purpose of evaluating Defendant's motion [Doc. 42] for summary judgment.
Plaintiff Pierre Cazeau began working for Wachovia, a predecessor company to Defendant Wells Fargo, on June 7, 2004, as a Teller in one of its branches in Miami, Florida. [Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 10]. After working [*7]  at a couple of bank locations in Florida, Plaintiff transferred to the Highway 138 branch in Conyers, Georgia, as a Teller on January 3, 2006. [DSMF ¶ 11]. Initially, Plaintiff reported to Melanie Hamby, the Teller Manager at the Conyers Branch. [DSMF ¶ 12]. In December 2009, Chris Williams replaced Ms. Hamby at the Conyers Branch as a Service Manager, and Plaintiff began reporting to Ms. Williams. [DSMF ¶ 13]. Ms. Williams reported to Mike Peoples, the Store Manager. [DSMF ¶ 14].
When Plaintiff first began reporting to Ms. Williams, he was earning $11.09 per hour. [DSMF ¶ 15; Peoples Dec. ¶ 5]. Plaintiff testified that in January 2010, the Conyers Branch was burglarized while he was working. [Plaintiff's Deposition ("Pla. Dep.") at 82-85; Plaintiff's Response ("Pla. Resp.") to DSMF ¶ 17]. Plaintiff stated, "I had to go to counseling after that robbery, that's how bad it was." [Pla. Dep. at 84]. In April 2011, Ms. Williams promoted Plaintiff to Lead Teller. [DSMF ¶ 19]. As part of his promotion, Wells Fargo increased Plaintiff's hourly rate to $12.50 per hour. [DSMF ¶ 20].
Wells Fargo has a written policy which prohibits harassment based on, among other things, an individual's race, [*8]  color, gender, national origin, and physical or mental disability. [DSMF ¶ 2; Pla. Dep. at 61-63, Ex. 9 at 23]. Wells Fargo employees have various avenues by which they can complain or express concerns about their employment, including: (1) reporting the issue to their supervisor; and (2) bringing the issue to Human Resources' attention. [DSMF ¶ 3]. The Wells Fargo written policy prohibits retaliation against any team member who in good faith reports or provides information about an incident of harassment in the workplace. [DSMF ¶ 4; Pla. Dep. at 61-63, Ex. 9 at 23]. On a yearly basis, Plaintiff Cazeau reviewed Wells Fargo's Team Member Handbook and received training on the company's anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-retaliation policies. [DSMF ¶ 5].
On January 10, 2012, Plaintiff sent identical letters to Store Manager Mike Peoples, Market Support Consultant Buretta Shealey, and District Manager Derrick Tyler. [Pla. Dep. at 220-22, Exs. 22, 23; DSMF ¶ 21]. The letter stated in part:
I would like to take this opportunity to report bullying and threats that I'm currently facing by Chris Williams the Service Manager . . . . [W]hen Lois Bygrave a teller at the Conyers Main store [*9]  was one thousand dollars short in her cash draw [sic] . . . Ms. Williams accused me of stealing the money . . . .
She continues to make remarks about thieves in the workplace taunting me looking for a negative reaction. She talks to me like I'm a child and constantly belittles me . . . . On January 11, 2010 I was a victim of an aggressive bank robbery which left me traumatized and emotionally distress [sic]. I had to undergo one week of counseling as well as medication . . . which Ms. Williams is very aware of . . . . Till this day she's making comments saying "if people take their anxiety medication before coming to work they wouldn't act like that." I have a right to privacy, and making fun of someone [sic] medical condition is no laughing matter . . . . She constantly pushes my buttons in order to get a negative reaction so she can say I have a temper problem saying things like "Pierre do you need one of my feminine pills[?] [Y]ou act like you on [sic] your period."
She has turn [sic] two tellers against me Ms. Deandrea Youngblood and Mr. Wayne Pettaway Jr. . . . Mr. Pettaway have call [sic] me a thief . . . . Mr. Pettaway have [sic] made homosexual remarks about me and another male teller [*10]  Angelo Alvear saying "is there something you guys want to tell me. I will accept you guys either way just tell me." . . . Ms. Youngblood has made smart comments saying "if we all take our happy medicine we'll be fine." She has also threatening [sic] to report me for being inappropriate and flirtatious with the female employees . . . . So if I'm nice to the female employees I'm called a flirt, if I'm nice to the male employees I'm called a homosexual and if I be [sic] quiet and stay to myself I'm called crazy and need to take my happy medication . . . .
On January 6, 2012, Ms. Williams said to me "Pierre I don't care about you or anything you do, I have decided that it's either you or me[.] [O]ne of us have [sic] to leave this store." . . . She said "it's just like in a marriage when the wife is tired of the husband she asks for a divorce." I find that to be very unprofessional and inappropriate. I have never had or thought about having any relationship with Ms. Williams outside of work. She continued on telling customers and the afternoon courier . . . that she asked me for a divorce making everyone think that we had a relationship that went sour and that's the reason she wants me gone. [*11]  It is clear that she wants me fired base [sic] on her personal feelings towards me and not because of my work performance or ethics . . . .
[Pla. Dep. at 220-22, Exs. 22, 23]. After sending the letter on January 10, 2012, Plaintiff called Erika Henning, a Human Resources representative, that same day. [DSMF ¶ 27]. Plaintiff spoke to Ms. Henning about the allegations in the letter and raised some additional concerns. [Pla. Dep. at 222-24; DSMF ¶ 28]. When Plaintiff was asked what he told Ms. Henning, he testified:
Basically how I was being discriminated against or mistreated at that branch, how I was denied promotions, although I was qualified, how other employees with less qualifications were getting the promotions over me . . . . I told her how much stress and depression that I had from all of this, and I broke down and cried, which is not something I normally do often.
[Pla. Dep. at 224].
In response to Plaintiff's complaint letter, Store Manager Mike Peoples met with Plaintiff on January 12, 2012, and on several other occasions to discuss his concerns. [DSMF ¶ 29]. Mr. Peoples stated in his declaration that he interviewed Ms. Williams and other store employees, but he was unable to [*12]  corroborate the allegations contained in Plaintiff's complaint letter. [DSMF ¶ 30; Peoples Dec. ¶¶ 9-10]. Mr. Peoples also stated that he verbally counseled Ms. Williams, Deandrea Youngblood, and Wayne Pettaway regarding the importance of maintaining professionalism at all times during workplace conversations. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 10; DSMF ¶ 31]. At the end of January 2012, Mr. Peoples met with Plaintiff Cazeau and Ms. Williams to discuss the situation involving Plaintiff's concerns. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 11; DSMF ¶ 32].
On or around January 17, 2012, Plaintiff applied online for Wells Fargo Job Requisition No. 3555550, which was a posting for a Service Manager position at a different branch.1 [DSMF ¶ 33]. Jason Robinson, a Wells Fargo Recruiter, stated that he was tasked with evaluating the applications for the Service Manager position. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 3; DSMF ¶ 35]. Mr. Robinson testified that he did not select Plaintiff to be interviewed for the Service Manager opening because Plaintiff had not worked at least twelve months in his current position as Lead Teller and was ineligible pursuant to the company's Internal Job Opportunities policy. [Robinson Dec. ¶¶ 5, 6; DSMF ¶¶ 9, 36]. Mr. Robinson [*13]  stated that another employee, Matthew Mills, was similarly disqualified for the position for that same reason. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 7; DSMF ¶ 37]. Renee Urban was selected for the Service Manager position by Deborah Morris, the Hiring Manager, on or about February 20, 2012. [DSMF ¶ 38]. Mr. Robinson stated that Ms. Urban had worked for Wells Fargo since June 2000, had thirteen years of prior experience in the banking industry, and had been a Lead Teller since September 2010. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 9].
Plaintiff testified that on March 11, 2012, Wells Fargo increased his hourly pay rate from $12.50 to $12.79. [Pla. Dep. at 58; DSMF ¶ 40]. On or around March 16, 2012, Service Manager Chris Williams called a meeting with Plaintiff and Tellers Deandrea Youngblood and Wayne Pettaway to discuss Plaintiff's earlier concerns raised in the complaint letter. [Pla. Dep. at 190-93; DSMF ¶ 42]. Plaintiff testified that he believed that the meeting was inappropriate: "I don't see how the same three people I complained about are going to resolve the [*14]  issue I complained about." [Pla. Dep. at 192-93].
In April 2012, Plaintiff filed a claim for short-term disability benefits which was approved by Liberty Mutual. [DSMF ¶ 43]. On or about April 14, 2012, Plaintiff went on an approved paid short-term disability leave. [Pla. Dep. at 95-97; DSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Resp. at DSMF ¶ 44]. When Plaintiff's paid short-term disability leave expired, Wells Fargo placed him on an extended leave of absence that was unpaid. [Pla. Dep. at 97-99].
On April 16, 2012, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Exhibit ("Ex.") 17; DSMF ¶ 64]. Plaintiff alleged that he had been subjected to retaliation and discrimination based on his national origin (Haitian) and his perceived disability. [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff asserted in the narrative portion of the charge that he had been subjected to harassment from Chris Williams, Deandrea Youngblood, and Wayne Pettaway. [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff also alleged that he was denied a promotion to Service Manager on or around January 24, 2012. [Id.]. In connection with Plaintiff's April 2012 charge, Wells Fargo submitted [*15]  a position statement to the EEOC on May 7, 2012. [DSMF ¶ 68]. The position statement was prepared by Wells Fargo's in-house attorney Harley Jones. [DSMF ¶ 69].
In August 2012, while Plaintiff was still on leave, his position as a Lead Teller in the Conyers Branch was backfilled. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 16; DSMF ¶ 51]. Plaintiff had been on leave for more than three months, and District Manager Mary Hamilton allegedly made the decision to backfill Plaintiff's Lead Teller position because the branch was busy and could not continue to operate with the Lead Teller vacancy. [Peoples Dec. ¶¶ 14-16]. On August 16, 2012, Wells Fargo's Leave Management Department sent a letter to Plaintiff, which he received, informing him that he had exhausted his twelve weeks of job-protected leave. [DSMF ¶ 52]. On September 8, 2012, the company's Leave Management Department informed Plaintiff that based on the information that it had received from Plaintiff and his medical provider, including a medical certification form, it had approved and placed him on an unpaid medical leave of absence beginning August 11, 2012. The letter also notified Plaintiff that his expected return-to-work date was October 15, 2012. [Pla. [*16]  Dep. at 101-03; Pla. Resp. to DSMF ¶ 53].
Plaintiff testified that around the end of September 2012, he called Store Manager Mike Peoples to inform him of his possible return to work on October 15. [Pla. Dep. at 102-03]. Plaintiff stated that during the conversation, Mr. Peoples informed him that his position had been filled. [Id.]. Mr. Peoples told Plaintiff to call Human Resources to determine what to do next. [DSMF ¶ 55].
Plaintiff called Wells Fargo's Leave Management Department on or around October 10, 2012. Plaintiff spoke to Janet Sammarco, who told him that she could not do anything about his position being filled but that she would look into the situation further. [DSMF ¶ 56]. On October 12, 2012, Plaintiff received a letter from Wells Fargo's Leave Management Department informing him that it had placed him on a Job Search Leave effective October 15, 2012.2 [DSMF ¶ 57]. The letter noted that the Job Search Leave would last through January 13, 2013, or until Plaintiff secured a new position at Wells Fargo. [DSMF ¶ 58]. The letter also provided information on how to register for and access Wells Fargo's employee portal for use in viewing available positions and other information. [*17]  [DSMF ¶ 59].
On or around October 15, 2012, Plaintiff's doctor released him to return to work. Plaintiff was fully capable of doing his job at that time. [DSMF ¶ 60]. Plaintiff testified that he did not apply for any positions with Wells Fargo between October 15, 2012, and January 13, 2013, the day his Job Search Leave expired. [Pla. Dep. at 106-10]. Plaintiff stated that during this time he was waiting to receive a call from Janet Sammarco in the Leave Management Department, who told him that she would find out who was authorized to place him into a new position. [Id.]. Plaintiff did not receive a phone call from Ms. Sammarco, and he did not follow-up with her. [Id.].
On December 4, 2012, Plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC, which he later amended on January 16, 2013. [DSMF ¶ 66; Pla. Dep. at 127-29, [*18]  Exs. 19, 20]. In the charge, Plaintiff checked the boxes marked "Race," "Sex," "National Origin," "Retaliation," and "Disability" and alleged that: (1) a white female Lead Teller was paid more than he was paid; and (2) after the expiration of his medical leave, Wells Fargo failed to make a reasonable accommodation to place him in an equivalent position at a different location. [DSMF ¶ 67; Pla. Dep. at 127-29, Exs. 19, 20]. Plaintiff testified that in a letter from Chris Williams dated January 23, 2013, he was informed that his employment with Wells Fargo was terminated effective January 15, 2013. [Pla. Dep. at 111-12].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

III. Summary Judgment Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides, "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (amended 2010). Rule 56(a) "mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which [*19]  that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the directed verdict standard under Rule 50(a), which requires the court to grant a directed verdict where there can be but one reasonable conclusion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The movant bears the initial burden of asserting the basis of his motion, and that burden is a light one. See Celotex, 106 S. Ct. at 2553. The movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. See id. Rather, the movant may discharge this burden merely by "'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 2554.
When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)).
The court will apply these standards in ruling on the motion for summary judgment.

IV. Discussion
Plaintiff Pierre Cazeau alleges that Defendant Wells Fargo [*20]  subjected him to retaliation, discriminatory pay, and discrimination based on national origin, gender, and perceived disability. [Doc. 9]. Plaintiff's claims are brought pursuant to Title VII, the ADA, and the EPA. [Id.]. Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII also prohibits an employer from retaliating against employees for certain protected practices. Specifically, the statute provides, in pertinent part:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, [*21]  employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The EPA states in pertinent part:
(1) No employer . . . shall discriminate . . . between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees . . . at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex . . . for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions . . . .
29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1). Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to promote him to six positions, paid him less than two female employees who were performing substantially equal work, subjected him to harassment, refused to provide him with reasonable accommodations, and terminated his employment.3 [Doc. 9 ¶¶ 13-16, 19-28, 36, 37, 43-46, 55]. Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted on all of Plaintiff's claims.

A. Plaintiff's EEOC Charges
Defendant first argues that a number of Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. "Timely filing a charge of discrimination is a prerequisite to bringing suit under both Title VII and the ADA." Maynard v. Pneumatic Products Corp., 256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); see also Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U.S. 522, 92 S. Ct. 616, 617, 30 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1972); Zillyette v. Capital One Fin. Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) ("It is settled [*23]  law that, under the ADA, plaintiffs must comply with the same procedural requirements to sue as exist under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.")). The reason for this rule is that under the statutory scheme of both Title VII and the ADA, the EEOC is given the first opportunity to investigate the alleged discrimination and attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. See Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970). "Only if the EEOC fails to achieve voluntary compliance will the matter ever become the subject of court action." Id. It is also critical to the process that the employer receive timely notice of the basis of the claims of discrimination. See Manning v. Chevron Chem. Co., LLC, 332 F.3d 874, 878 (5th Cir. 2003) ("One of the central purposes of the employment discrimination charge is to put employers on notice of 'the existence and nature of the charges against them.'") (quoting EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.S. 54, 104 S. Ct. 1621, 1635, 80 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1984)). As noted, "[f]or a charge to be timely in a non-deferral state such as Georgia, it must be filed within 180 days of the last discriminatory act." Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001). Thus, filing a timely charge with the EEOC is a condition precedent to an employment discrimination suit. See Myers v. Central Florida Investments, Inc., 592 F.3d 1201, 1223-24 (11th Cir. 2010). The Eleventh Circuit has held that a "plaintiff's judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected [*24]  to grow out of the charge of discrimination." Gregory v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected him to discrimination on the basis of national origin and gender when it denied him promotions to the following positions: (1) Lead Teller in April 2010; (2) Lead Teller in October 2010; (3) Personal Banker in August 2011; (4) a second Personal Banker position in August 2011; (5) Customer Sales and Customer Service Representative in December 2011; and (6) Service Manager in January 2012. [Doc. 9 ¶¶ 13-16, 19-22; Pla. Dep. at 134-53; Doc. 44-1 at 7]. Plaintiff filed EEOC charges in April 2012, December 2012, and January 2013, but only the first charge made any reference to being denied a promotion. [Pla. Dep. at 116-17, 127-29, Exs. 17, 19, 20]. Plaintiff asserted in the first EEOC charge that he had been denied a promotion to Service Manager on January 24, 2012. [Id.]. Despite Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary, the other five promotion denials asserted in his complaint are not properly before the court.
In National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2073, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002), the Supreme Court noted that "[d]iscrete acts such as . . . failure to promote . . . are easy to identify. Each incident of discrimination and each [*25]  retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a separate actionable 'unlawful employment practice.'" The five promotion denials which occurred between April 2010 and December 2011 were discrete acts that were not mentioned in any of Plaintiff's EEOC charges. The Eleventh Circuit "has noted that judicial claims are allowed if they amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus the allegations in the EEOC complaint, but has cautioned that allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate." Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1279-80 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff argues that he exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to all failure to promote claims because he "check[ed] the appropriate boxes on the intake, verbally discussed the details of the charge and requested mediation . . . ." [Doc. 44-1 at 8].4 This argument is unpersuasive. Intake questionnaires and discussions with the EEOC are not intended to satisfy the requirements of a charge of discrimination. See Pijnenburg, 255 F.3d at 1305 ("On this issue of first impression in this Court, we follow the circuits that have held that intake questionnaires do not satisfy the statutory requirements of an administrative charge."). Moreover, Plaintiff "clearly understood [*26]  that the intake questionnaire was not a charge because he later filed a timely charge." Bost v. Federal Express Corp., 372 F.3d 1233, 1241 (11th Cir. 2004). Plaintiff has failed to show that he exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to the promotion denials which occurred between April 2010 and December 2011. The only promotion denial alleged in any of Plaintiff's EEOC charges was the Service Manager position in January 2012, and no other employment action is properly before the court in support of Plaintiff's failure to promote claims.5 S e e Thomas v. Miami Dade Public Health Trust, 369 Fed. Appx. 19, 22-23 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that because the plaintiff's EEOC charge only described two acts of retaliation, "any other acts of retaliation . . . that were not included in the charge were not exhausted and could not be considered by the district court").
Although Plaintiff has asserted that his January 2012 promotion denial was based on gender, he made no such allegation in his EEOC charges. In the first charge dated April 16, 2012, which is the only charge that referenced promotion denials, Plaintiff alleged that he had been subjected to discrimination based on his national origin (Haitian) and his perceived disability. [Pla. Dep. at 116-17, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff's EEOC charge, however, did not include an allegation that the January 2012, promotion denial was based on gender/sex. The court finds that Plaintiff's sexually discriminatory failure to promote claim is barred because it was not administratively exhausted. See Thomas, 369 Fed. Appx. at 22 (holding that because the plaintiff's "EEOC charge asserted the failure [*28]  to promote her was only a result of retaliation . . . her race and sex discrimination allegations were not exhausted administratively and were thus barred").
In light of Plaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on: Plaintiff's failure to promote claim for gender discrimination; and his failure to promote claims based on the following promotion denials: (1) Lead Teller in April 2010; (2) Lead Teller in October 2010; (3) Personal Banker in August 2011; (4) a second Personal Banker in August 2011; and (5) Customer Sales and Customer Service Representative in December 2011. [Doc. 9 ¶¶ 13-16, 19-22; Pla. Dep. at 134-53; Doc. 44-1 at 7]. Plaintiff's only remaining failure to promote claim is for discrimination based on national origin with regard to Defendant's January 2012 decision not to promote him to a Service Manager position.

B. Failure to Promote Claim
In a disparate treatment action, the plaintiff carries the burden of demonstrating that the defendant has unlawfully discriminated against him. See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093-95, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). "A plaintiff may prove a claim of intentional discrimination through direct evidence, [*29]  circumstantial evidence, or through statistical proof." Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Georgia, 520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008). In the present case, Plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to support all of his employment discrimination claims, including his failure to promote claim for national origin discrimination based on the January 2012 Service Manager position. The court, therefore, will use the framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), to evaluate his claim. Under this framework, the allocation of burdens and order of presentation and proof are as follows: (1) the plaintiff has the burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden (of production) shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken against the employee; and (3) should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must have an opportunity to prove that the legitimate reason offered by defendant was a pretext for discrimination. See id.
To establish a prima facie case of failure to promote, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) that he sought and was qualified for the position that the employer was attempting to fill; (3) that despite [*30]  his qualifications he was rejected; and (4) that the position was filled with a person outside of the plaintiff's protected group. See Vessels v. Atlanta Independent School System, 408 F.3d 763, 768 (11th Cir. 2005); Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1185-93 (11th Cir. 1998). Defendant Wells Fargo does not dispute that Plaintiff, who is Haitian, is able to establish the first, third, and fourth prima facie elements in support of his national origin discrimination claim for failure to promote. [Doc. 42 at 5]. However, Defendant contends that Plaintiff was not qualified for the January 2012 promotion to Service Manager.
Defendant's "qualifications" argument is based on Plaintiff's lack of experience in his job at the time that he applied for the promotion. In January 2012, when Plaintiff applied for the Service Manager position, he had only been in his Lead Teller position for nine months. The company's Internal Job Opportunities policy requires that an employee work at least twelve months in his current position before applying for a different position.6 [Doc. 42 at 6; DSMF ¶ 33]. The reason offered by Defendant in support of its argument that Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case is also the company's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Plaintiff to the Service Manager position. [*31] 
The court finds that Defendant's explanation is more appropriately addressed at the next stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework. As discussed supra, at the prima facie stage, the burden of production is on the plaintiff, not the defendant. And as the Supreme Court has [*32]  held, "The burden of establishing a prima facie case . . . is not onerous." Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094; accord Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997) ("Demonstrating a prima facie case is not onerous; it requires only that the plaintiff establish facts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination."). The relevant inquiry at the prima facie stage is whether the plaintiff has shown that he was minimally qualified for the coveted position. See Walker, 158 F.3d at 1193.
Defendant acknowledges that Renee Urban, the person selected for the Service Manager position, held the same Lead Teller position that Plaintiff held at the time that the promotion decision was made. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 9]. Given this fact, the court finds that Plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that he was at least minimally qualified for the promotion. Therefore, Plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of failure to promote based on his national origin with regard to the January 2012 promotion to Service Manager.
The burden of production then shifts to Defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying Plaintiff the promotion. See Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F. 3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1824; Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094). "'[T]o satisfy this intermediate burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence [*33]  which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1096) (emphasis in original). A "'defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094). The defendant's burden in the rebuttal stage is "'exceedingly light.'" Walker v. NationsBank of Florida N.A., 53 F.3d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., Inc., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)).
Defendant Wells Fargo asserts that it did not select Plaintiff Cazeau for the Service Manager position because he had not served in his role as Lead Teller for at least twelve months. [Doc. 42 at 7]. Wells Fargo's Internal Job Opportunities policy provides that an employee must have been in his current position "for at least twelve months to post for a new job, unless [his] manager or HR waives the requirement." [Robinson Dec. ¶¶ 5, 6; Pla. Dep. at 61-62, Ex. 9 at 10]. Jason Robinson, a Wells Fargo Recruiter, stated that he was tasked with evaluating the applications for the Service Manager position. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 3; DSMF ¶ 35]. Mr. Robinson testified that he did not select Plaintiff [*34]  to be interviewed for the Service Manager opening because Plaintiff had not worked at least twelve months in his current position as Lead Teller and was ineligible pursuant to the company's Internal Job Opportunities policy. [Robinson Dec. ¶¶ 5, 6; DSMF ¶ 36]. Renee Urban, who was selected for the Service Manager position by Hiring Manager Deborah Morris, had worked for Wells Fargo since June 2000, had thirteen years of prior experience in the banking industry, and had been a Lead Teller for more than sixteen months at the time she was promoted. [DSMF ¶ 38; Robinson Dec. ¶ 9]. The court finds that Defendant has easily satisfied its light burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Plaintiff to Service Manager.
Once a defendant meets its burden of production, "the presumption of discrimination created by the McDonnell Douglas framework 'drops from the case,' and 'the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1528 (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094-95 & n.10). The plaintiff then "has the opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565 (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1825). Plaintiff's demonstration of [*35]  pretext merges with his "ultimate burden of showing that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). This task is a highly focused one.
The court "must, in view of all the evidence, determine whether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer's proffered 'legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct[.]'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1538 (quoting Cooper-Houston v. Southern Ry. Co., 37 F.3d 603, 605 (11th Cir. 1994)). Plaintiff "'may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Jackson v. State of Alabama State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1095). In order to establish pretext through the indirect method, the plaintiff "must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). "A plaintiff is not allowed to recast an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business [*36]  judgment for that of the employer. Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's reasons are pretexts for unlawful discrimination. In support of this argument, Plaintiff cites to evidence showing that "Defendant's denial e-mails for Plaintiff's job applications are all the same even when Plaintiff had been in his current position for twelve months and met all the qualifications as listed on the job posting." [Doc. 44-1 at 10]. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's emails informing him that he was not selected for promotion all state that "there are other candidates whose qualifications more closely match the requirements for this position . . . ." [Id.]. Plaintiff argues that pretext can be found because the denial emails did not mention the fact that he had not been in his current position for twelve months. [Doc. 44-1 at 10-11]. Plaintiff also contends, "The fact that Plaintiff was never given an interview is a clear indication of discrimination." [Id. at 11]. Plaintiff's arguments [*37]  are unpersuasive.
Plaintiff has failed to explain how being sent a form email denying his application for a position establishes pretext. Assuming arguendo that the email informing Plaintiff that he was not selected for the Service Manager position did not mention his failure to meet the "time-in-job" requirement, this would not permit a reasonable factfinder to doubt Wells Fargo's proffered nondiscriminatory reason. Furthermore, the alleged statement in the email saying that the company had found "other candidates whose qualifications more closely match the requirements for this position" is entirely consistent with Wells Fargo Recruiter Jason Robinson's assertion that Plaintiff did not meet the eligibility requirements for the Service Manager job. [Robinson Dec. ¶¶ 5, 6]. Finally, despite Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary, the fact that he was not interviewed for the position is not an indication of discrimination. [Doc. 44-1 at 10-11].
Plaintiff also contends that he "had permission from Mr. Peoples and Ms. Williams to apply for new position [sic]" and cites to "Ex. 2 WF-C-001229 to WF-C-001230" in support thereof. [Doc. 44-1 at 10]. The court, however, is unable to locate the [*38]  documents cited by Plaintiff or any other documents in the record showing that Plaintiff had permission to apply for the Service Manager position despite not being in his Lead Teller position for twelve months. Even if Plaintiff were able to establish that Store Manager Mike Peoples and/or Service Manager Chris Williams told him that he had permission to apply for the position, this fact would not assist Plaintiff in his pretext argument. As noted supra, Mr. Robinson stated that he determined that Plaintiff was ineligible for the position because he had not been in his current job for twelve months and because Mr. Robinson had not been contacted by a member of management giving Plaintiff permission to apply. [Robinson Dec. ¶¶ 3, 6]. Mr. Robinson stated that another employee, Matthew Mills, was similarly disqualified for the position for the same reason. [Robinson Dec. ¶ 7; DSMF ¶ 37]. There is no evidence before the court which would allow a factfinder to doubt the honesty of Mr. Robinson's explanation. "The pretext inquiry focuses on the honesty of the employer's explanation; raising a question about the correctness of the facts underlying that explanation without impugning the employer's [*39]  honest belief, fails to create a triable pretext issue." Dawson v. Henry County Police Dep't, 238 Fed. Appx. 545, 549 (11th Cir. 2007).
For these reasons, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to point to any evidence which would permit a reasonable jury to find that Defendant's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting him to Service Manager are pretexts for national origin discrimination.7 The undersigned, therefore, RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's failure to promote claim.

C. Equal Pay Act Claim
Plaintiff Cazeau alleges that Defendant Wells Fargo violated the Equal Pay Act ("EPA") because female employees Miranda Chavez and Kathy Hill earned more than he earned while each worked as a Teller. [Doc. 9 ¶¶ 43, 44; Pla. Dep. at 247-53; Doc. 44-1 at 18-19]. "To establish a prima facie case under the Equal Pay Act, an employee must show that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions." Arrington v. Cobb County, 139 F.3d 865, 876 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 94 S. Ct. 2223, 2228, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1974); 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted). At this stage, "a plaintiff need only demonstrate that the jobs at issue are substantially similar; a plaintiff does not have to show that the skills or qualifications of the actual male and female employees holding the positions are also substantially equivalent." Id.
The statute of limitations under the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to claims brought pursuant to the EPA. See 29 U.S.C. § 255; Alvarez Perez v. Sanford—Orlando Kennel Club, Inc., 515 F.3d 1150, 1164 (11th Cir. 2008) ("[T]he FLSA's statute of limitations [*41]  . . . appl[ies] to EPA claims."). Thus, an EPA action is time-barred "unless commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued . . . ."8 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). "Because each violation gives rise to a new cause of action, each [unequal paycheck] begins a new statute of limitations period as to that particular event." Knight v. Columbus, Georgia, 19 F.3d 579, 582 (11th Cir. 1994). "[A]n Equal Pay Act claimant may only recover for the discriminatory pay received within the statute of limitations period." Slattery v. Precision Response Corp., 167 Fed. Appx. 139, 142 n.1 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 421 F.3d 1169, 1180 n.15 (11th Cir. 2005)).
With regard to Miranda Chavez, the evidence does not support Plaintiff's assertion that he was paid less than her. Plaintiff originally testified that Ms. Chavez "was getting higher pay than [him] as a teller." [Pla. Dep. at 247]. According to Plaintiff's deposition testimony, Ms. Chavez told him that she was making between $12.00 and $12.50 per hour as a Teller at the Conyers Branch. [Id. at 247-48]. However, Store Manager Mike Peoples testified that [*42]  Ms. Chavez earned $11.00 per hour as a Teller, which was less than Plaintiff's pay. [Peoples Dec. ¶¶ 5, 19]. Plaintiff contends in his response brief that "Mr. Peoples did not disclose any pay increase Ms. Chavez received in April 2010, April 2011 and April 2012 which is clear indication that it is more than likely Ms. Chavez [sic] pay was higher than the Plaintiff's pay." [Doc. 44-1 at 18]. Plaintiff has cited to no evidence indicating that Ms. Chavez was given pay increases in April 2010, April 2011, April 2012, or at any other time, and his speculations that "it is more than likely" that Chavez was paid more while working in the same position are insufficient to establish a prima facie case.9
Even assuming that Ms. Chavez was paid more than Plaintiff while working as a Teller, as Plaintiff originally testified during his deposition, [*43]  the court finds that Defendant would be entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff's EPA claim is time-barred. When Plaintiff was asked about the time period when Ms. Chavez worked as a Teller, he responded that he did not remember. [Pla. Dep. at 248]. However, Plaintiff testified that he trained Ms. Chavez as a Teller in 2009 and that during the bank robbery in January 2010, "she hadn't even been a teller long enough to really be alone." [Id.]. Mr. Peoples testified that Ms. Chavez "worked as a Teller until October 10, 2010, when she was promoted to Lead Teller." [Peoples Dec. ¶ 19]. There is no evidence in the record contradicting this assertion. Thus, in order for Plaintiff's EPA claim based on Ms. Chavez's pay as a Teller to be timely, Plaintiff was required to file an action prior to October 10, 2012. Plaintiff, however, filed his complaint in this court on January 24, 2013, more than three months after the statute of limitations had expired. [Doc. 1]. Based on these facts, the court finds that even if Plaintiff were able to show that Ms. Chavez earned more as a Teller, Plaintiff's EPA claim would be time-barred.
Plaintiff Cazeau also alleges that Wells Fargo paid Kathy Hill [*44]  more than Plaintiff while each worked as a Teller. [Pla. Dep. at 250-52; Doc. 44-1 at 18-19]. Plaintiff testified that he believed that Ms. Hill's pay was higher than his because she informed him that she made more money than Ms. Chavez. [Pla. Dep. at 250-52]. Defendant does not dispute that Ms. Hill was paid a higher wage than Plaintiff in their jobs as Tellers. As a result, the court finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case under the EPA. See Arrington, 139 F.3d at 876.
Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "to avoid liability[,] the employer must prove by a preponderance of the evidence . . . that the differential is justified by one of four exceptions set forth in the EPA[.]" Irby v. Bittick, 44 F.3d 949, 954 (11th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). The exceptions are: "(I) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex." 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1). If one of the four exceptions is not established, judgment is entered for the plaintiff. If the defendant does meet its burden, the "plaintiff must rebut the explanation by showing with affirmative evidence that it is pretextual or offered as a post-event justification for a gender-based [*45]  differential." Irby, 44 F.3d at 954.
Defendant asserts that Ms. Hill's higher pay was based on the fact that she had more experience than Plaintiff. [Doc. 42 at 28]. Store Manager Mike Peoples testified that Ms. Hill began her employment with Wells Fargo in July 1999. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 20]. Ms. Hill transferred to the Conyers Branch as a Teller in November 2003. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 20]. Mr. Peoples stated that Ms. Hill's hourly rate reflected the fact that she had already been working as a Teller for four years. [Id.]. In contrast, Plaintiff was hired as a Teller by Wachovia, a predecessor company to Wells Fargo, in June 2004, approximately five years after Ms. Hill had been hired. [DSMF ¶ 10]. Plaintiff transferred to the Conyers Branch from a bank location in Miami as a Teller in January 2006, more than two years after Ms. Hill's transfer to the Conyers location. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 20; DSMF ¶ 11]. Given Ms. Hill's greater experience, the court finds that Defendant has carried its burden of showing that any alleged pay differential was based on a factor other than sex. 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1).
To survive Defendant's summary judgment motion, Plaintiff must offer evidence that would allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendant's [*46]  explanation for paying Ms. Hill a higher wage "is pretextual or offered as a post-event justification for a gender-based differential." Irby, 44 F.3d at 954. Plaintiff has not offered any such evidence. [Doc. 44-1 at 18-19]. In fact, Plaintiff has not even attempted to offer a response to Defendant's explanation that Ms. Hill was paid more due to her greater experience. [Id.]. Defendant's explanation stands unrebutted.
Plaintiff has failed to cite to evidence which would permit a reasonable jury to find that Defendant violated the EPA. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant Wells Fargo's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on all of Plaintiff's EPA claims.

D. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff Cazeau has asserted Title VII claims for retaliation.10 [Doc. 9 at 17]. As noted supra, Title VII acts to shield employees from retaliation for certain protected practices. In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff bringing a Title VII retaliation claim "must establish that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer." The Eleventh Circuit recently held that the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas continues to apply after Nassar. See [*47]  Mealing v. Georgia Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 564 Fed. Appx. 421, 2014 WL 1613206, at *5 n.9 (11th Cir. 2014).
"To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that [he] engaged in an activity protected under Title VII; (2) [he] suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action." Kidd v. Mando American Corp., 731 F.3d 1196, 1211 (11th Cir. 2013); accord Mealing, 564 Fed. Appx. at 427, 2014 WL 1613206, at *5. The plaintiff "'need not prove the underlying claim of discrimination which led to [his] protest;' however, the plaintiff must have had a reasonable good faith belief that the discrimination existed." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1566 (quoting Tipton v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 872 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir. 1989)). "To establish causation for purposes of a Title VII retaliation claim, the plaintiff must prove that 'the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.'" Taylor v. Cardiovascular Specialists, P.C., 4 F. Supp. 3d 1374, 2014 WL 1004118, at *7 (N.D. Ga. March 17, 2014) (quoting Nassar, 133 S. Ct. at 2533).
The court finds that Plaintiff is able to establish the first prima facie element because he engaged in statutorily protected activity when he filed an EEOC charge of discrimination on April 16, 2012. [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Ex. 17; DSMF ¶ 64]. This was the first time that Plaintiff complained to Defendant about activity made unlawful by Title VII. On January 10, [*48]  2012, Plaintiff sent a letter to Wells Fargo management, including Store Manager Mike Peoples, making complaints about how he was being treated in the workplace. [Pla. Dep. at 220-22, Exs. 22, 23; DSMF ¶ 21]. However, neither Plaintiff's letter nor the subsequent conversation with Human Resources constitute protected expression.
Plaintiff stated in the January 2012 letter that he was facing "bullying and threats" from Service Manager Chris Williams and that Ms. Williams accused him of stealing money. [Pla. Dep. at 220-22, Exs. 22, 23]. Plaintiff reported that Ms. Williams taunted him with "remarks about thieves in the workplace," talked to him like a child, suggested that he needed to take his "anxiety medication before coming to work," and made other mean-spirited statements. [Id.]. Plaintiff also alleged that co-workers Wayne Pettaway and Deandrea Youngblood made sarcastic remarks to Plaintiff such as saying that he needed to take his "happy medication," implying that he was having a relationship with a male Teller, and threatening to report him for being flirtatious with female employees. [Id.]. After sending the letter on January 10, 2012, Plaintiff called Human Resources representative [*49]  Erika Henning and spoke to her about the allegations in the letter and raised some additional concerns. [Pla. Dep. at 222-24; DSMF ¶ 28]. When asked what he told Ms. Henning, Plaintiff testified:
Basically how I was being discriminated against or mistreated at that branch, how I was denied promotions, although I was qualified, how other employees with less qualifications were getting the promotions over me . . . . I told her how much stress and depression that I had from all of this, and I broke down and cried, which is not something I normally do often.
[Pla. Dep. at 224].
Plaintiff's January 2012 letter made no allegation of unlawful discrimination. And although Plaintiff allegedly told Ms. Henning that he "was being discriminated against," his testimony reveals that he equated this with being "mistreated." [Id.]. As noted supra, Plaintiff's retaliation claims are brought pursuant to Title VII, and there is no evidence that Plaintiff complained that Defendant had subjected him to discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or national origin or otherwise took any action against him prohibited by Title VII. Plaintiff's complaints in the January 2012 letter and the subsequent conversation [*50]  with a Human Resources representative do not constitute protected expression under Title VII.11 See Mikell v. Marriott Intern., Inc., 789 F. Supp. 2d 607, 619 (E.D. Pa. 2011) (finding that, although the plaintiff's attorney used the word "discrimination" in a letter to defendant and the plaintiff stated that he was "being discriminated against," there was no Title VII protected activity because inter alia there was "no mention of the protected class in question, and no allegation of race-based discrimination"). "Unfair treatment, absent discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, is not an unlawful employment practice under Title VII." Coutu v. Martin County Board of County Commissioners, 47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff first engaged in statutorily protected activity when he filed an EEOC charge in April 2012 alleging that he had been subjected to retaliation and discrimination based on his national origin (Haitian) and his perceived disability. [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff also engaged in protected expression on December 4, 2012, when he filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC. [DSMF ¶ 66; Pla. Dep. at 127-29, Exs. 19, 20].
The second element in a prima facie case of retaliation requires Plaintiff to show that he suffered an adverse employment action. "[T]he 'adverse action' test applied to retaliation claims is distinct from that applied to disparate treatment claims." Sharpe v. Global Sec. Intern., 766 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1291 (S.D. Ala. 2011). The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim "must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This standard for determining adverse actions in retaliation claims is "decidedly more relaxed" than that used in discrimination claims. Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 973 (11th Cir. 2008).
Plaintiff has not made it clear which adverse actions allegedly taken by Defendant form the basis of his retaliation claims. Plaintiff went on leave shortly before filing his EEOC charge and never returned to work. As a result, the [*52]  only adverse employment actions which occurred after Plaintiff's April 2012 EEOC charge were the backfilling of his position and his termination. In August 2012, four months after Plaintiff went on disability leave, his position as a Lead Teller in the Conyers Branch was backfilled. [Peoples Decl. ¶ 16; DSMF ¶ 51]. Plaintiff's employment with Wells Fargo was terminated approximately five months later on January 15, 2013. [Pla. Dep. at 111-12]. Because these actions might have dissuaded a reasonable employee from making a charge of discrimination, they are adverse actions supporting Plaintiff's retaliation claims.
To establish the final element of a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must point to evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there was a causal connection between Plaintiff's protected activity and the complained-of adverse actions. If an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee shortly after becoming aware of the employee's protected expression, then the close temporal proximity between the two events "is generally sufficient for a plaintiff to establish but-for causation." Abernathy v. Science Applications Intern. Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181579, 2013 WL 6904089, at *1 (N.D. Ala. December 31, 2013) (citing Raspanti v. Four Amigos Travel, Inc., 266 Fed. Appx. 820, 823 (11th Cir. 2008) (noting that at summary judgment [*53]  the plaintiff bringing an FLSA retaliation claim can satisfy the but-for causal relation element "if she can prove a 'close temporal proximity' between the time her employer learned about her protected activity and her discharge")). In Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001), the Supreme Court stated that "mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action . . . must be 'very close[.]'"
In the present case, Defendant first learned of Plaintiff's protected activity shortly after he filed his EEOC charge on April 16, 2012. [Pla. Dep. at 115-16, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff's position was backfilled four months later in August 2012. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 16; DSMF ¶ 51]. His employment was terminated in January 2013, nine months after he filed his EEOC charge. [Pla. Dep. at 111-12]. The court finds that the delays are not sufficiently close to establish a causal connection. As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, in Breeden, 121 S. Ct. at 1511, the Supreme Court "cited with approval decisions in which a three to four month disparity was found to be insufficient to show causal connection." Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004); accord Raspanti, 266 Fed. Appx. at 823 (noting that a delay of three or four months is not sufficiently proximate to establish the but-for causal relation [*54]  element in an FLSA retaliation claim) (citation omitted).
Even using in the analysis Plaintiff's second charge of discrimination, the court would find that no causal connection could be inferred. Plaintiff's second EEOC charge was filed on December 4, 2012, and Plaintiff's termination date was approximately six weeks later, on January 15, 2013. [DSMF ¶ 66; Pla. Dep. at 111-12, 127-29, Exs. 19, 20]. Normally, causation could be inferred in situations where the temporal proximity was approximately six weeks. See Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (finding causation where seven weeks passed between the time when the defendant-employer learned of the employee's filing an EEOC charge and the employee's termination). However, the Eleventh Circuit has held that an inference of causation created by close temporal proximity may be negated by intervening events. See Hankins v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 237 Fed. Appx. 513, 520-21 (11th Cir. 2007). In the present case, as discussed infra, there are intervening events that eliminate any causal connection that might otherwise be inferred.
In support of his retaliation claim, Plaintiff alleges that after he accused Mr. Peoples and Ms. Williams of discrimination in the EEOC charge, Mr. Peoples allegedly stated that he did not think it would be possible to work [*55]  with Plaintiff again. [Doc. 44-1 at 14]. Plaintiff also alleges that Mr. Peoples and Ms. Williams stated that they wanted to change the locks at the branch to prevent Plaintiff from reentering. [Id.]. Plaintiff cites to "Ex. 2 WF-C-001253; WF-C-001258" as evidence supporting this assertion, but the court is unable to locate any such documents.12 [Doc. 44-1 at 14]. Given this lack of evidence, the court finds that Plaintiff's arguments based on the alleged statements of Mr. Peoples and Ms. Williams are unpersuasive.
Assuming arguendo that Plaintiff had offered evidence showing that Mr. Peoples and Ms. Williams made the alleged statements, the court would nevertheless find that Plaintiff was unable to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. The comments reveal that Mr. Peoples and Ms. [*56]  Williams were upset with Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination. However, this does not create a reasonable inference that they took action against Plaintiff in retaliation for his protected activity. As Defendant notes, one court in the Eleventh Circuit has explained:
Human nature being what it is, it is difficult to envision any supervisor not being hurt or upset when a subordinate levels allegations of unlawful discrimination against her. What matters is not whether the alleged discriminator had an emotional response to the accusation, but whether there are genuine issues of fact as to whether that person acted on those emotions in a retaliatory manner. There is no evidence of the latter here.
King v. Alabama Dep't of Public Health, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91524, 2010 WL 3522381, at *12 n.26 (S.D. Ala. September 2, 2010). While the alleged statements from Ms. Williams and Mr. Peoples show that they had an emotional reaction to Plaintiff's accusations of discrimination, there is no evidence that they took retaliatory action against him.
In addition, the expiration of Plaintiff's disability leave and Job Search Leave and his failure to apply for any position with Wells Fargo constitute intervening events that eliminate any causal connection that might be inferred. Plaintiff went on approved paid short-term [*57]  disability leave on April 14, 2012. [Pla. Dep. at 95-97; DSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Resp. at DSMF ¶ 44]. When Plaintiff's paid short-term disability leave expired, Wells Fargo placed him on an extended leave of absence that was unpaid. [Pla. Dep. at 97-99]. In August 2012, Plaintiff's position as a Lead Teller in the Conyers Branch was backfilled. [Peoples Decl. ¶ 16; DSMF ¶ 51]. At that time, Plaintiff had been on leave for more than three months, and District Manager Mary Hamilton allegedly made the decision to backfill Plaintiff's Lead Teller position because the branch was busy and could not continue to operate with the Lead Teller vacancy. [Peoples Dec. ¶¶ 14-16].
Plaintiff remained on leave into October 2012 and was placed on a Job Search Leave effective October 15, 2012. [DSMF ¶ 57]. Plaintiff was notified via letter from Wells Fargo's Leave Management Department that the Job Search Leave would last through January 13, 2013, or until Plaintiff secured a new position at Wells Fargo. [DSMF ¶¶ 57, 58]. The letter also provided information on how to register for and access Wells Fargo's employee portal for use in viewing available positions and other information. [DSMF ¶ 59]. On or around October [*58]  15, 2012, Plaintiff's doctor released him to return to work. Plaintiff was fully capable of doing his job at that time. [DSMF ¶ 60]. However, Plaintiff testified that he did not apply for any positions with Wells Fargo between October 15, 2012, and January 13, 2013, the day his Job Search Leave expired. [Pla. Dep. at 106-10]. Shortly after his Job Search Leave expired in mid-January 2013, Plaintiff's employment with Wells Fargo was terminated. [Pla. Dep. at 111-12].
The court finds that the expiration of Plaintiff's disability leave and Job Search Leave and his failure to apply for any position with Wells Fargo were intervening events that severed any possible causal connection between his protected activity and either the backfilling of his position or his termination. See Hankins, 237 Fed. Appx. at 520-21 (finding that the plaintiff's "intervening act of misconduct . . . severed the causal connection (if any) between Hankins' initial complaint of discrimination and AirTran's decision to terminate her employment"). "Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action." Nassar, 133 S. Ct. at 2528. A reasonable jury could not examine the evidence in the record and [*59]  conclude that there was a but-for causal connection between Plaintiff's protected activity and the complained-of adverse employment actions. Because the court finds that Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's retaliation claims.13

E. Backfilling Plaintiff's Position and Termination
Plaintiff Cazeau next asserts that Defendant backfilled his position and terminated his employment on the basis of his gender and national origin. To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, Plaintiff must prove that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to an adverse job action; (3) he was qualified to do the job; and (4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his classification more favorably. See Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562. The Eleventh Circuit has held, "The comparator must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Silvera v. Orange County School Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir. 2001)). Plaintiff is unable to make the requisite showing. Plaintiff has also failed to offer any other evidence which would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendant took adverse actions against him on the basis of his national origin or gender. As a result, he is unable to establish a prima facie case.
Even if Plaintiff were able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, summary judgment would be warranted on his claims. Defendant has offered legitimate, [*61]  nondiscriminatory reasons for backfilling his position and terminating his employment, and Plaintiff has failed to create a triable pretext issue. Plaintiff went on approved paid short-term disability leave in April 2012, and after this leave expired, Wells Fargo placed him on an extended unpaid leave of absence. [Pla. Dep. at 95-97; DSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Resp. at DSMF ¶ 44; Pla. Dep. at 97-99]. The company backfilled Plaintiff's Lead Teller position at the Conyers Branch in August 2012. [Peoples Decl. ¶ 16; DSMF ¶ 51]. Store Manager Mike Peoples stated that District Manager Mary Hamilton made the decision to backfill Plaintiff's position because the branch was busy and could not continue to operate with the Lead Teller vacancy. [Peoples Dec. ¶¶ 14-16]. Plaintiff alleges that Wells Fargo violated its own policy by posting the Lead Teller position. [Doc. 44-1 at 14]. According to Plaintiff, it was the responsibility of Store Manager Peoples and Service Manager Chris Williams, and not District Manager Hamilton, to make hiring decisions. [Id.]. But the materials cited by Plaintiff do not support this assertion. [Id.]. The document cited by Plaintiff provides that "hiring managers are required [*62]  to post open jobs and search for job seekers from within our company." [Doc. 47, Ex. 2, WELLSFARGO-CAZEAU-000905]. But nowhere in the document does it state that District Managers are not permitted to make hiring decisions. [Id.].
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's employment was terminated because he did not secure a position with Wells Fargo before his Job Search Leave ended. [Peoples Dec. ¶ 18]. As noted supra, Wells Fargo's Leave Management Department notified Plaintiff in October 2012 that his Job Search Leave would last through January 13, 2013, or until Plaintiff secured a new position at Wells Fargo. [DSMF ¶¶ 57, 58]. Although Plaintiff's doctor released him to return to work on or around October 15, 2012, Plaintiff never applied for a position while he was on Job Search Leave. [DSMF ¶ 60; Pla. Dep. at 106-10]. At his deposition, Plaintiff was asked what he did to search for a job with Wells Fargo while he was on Job Search Leave, and he responded: "I did not do anything." [R. at 109]. Plaintiff's employment was terminated after his Job Search Leave expired in mid-January 2013. [Pla. Dep. at 111-12]. Plaintiff has offered no evidence to the contrary.
In summary, Plaintiff is unable to [*63]  establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination or national origin discrimination with regard to Defendant's decision to backfill his position and terminate his employment. Even if Plaintiff were able to establish a prima facie case, his claims could not survive summary judgment. Defendant has offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the actions taken against Plaintiff, and he has not pointed to any evidence which would "permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer's proffered 'legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct[.]'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1538 (quoting Cooper-Houston, 37 F.3d at 605). The undersigned, therefore, RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's claims that Defendant backfilled his position and terminated his employment on the basis of his gender and national origin.

F. Harassment Claim
Plaintiff Cazeau asserts that Defendant subjected him to unlawful harassment. [Doc. 9 ¶¶ 23-28, 36, 37]. The only EEOC charge filed by Plaintiff that made reference to harassment was the first charge dated April 16, 2012. [Pla. Dep. at 116-17, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff alleged in the charge that he had been harassed by his supervisor, Chris Williams, [*64]  since December 2009. [Id.]. Plaintiff alleged that co-workers Deandrea Youngblood and Wayne Pettaway had subjected him to harassment since December 2011. [Id.]. According to Plaintiff's charge, the harassment constituted discrimination based on his national origin (Haitian) and his perceived disability. [Pla. Dep. at 116-17, Ex. 17]. Plaintiff never alleged in an EEOC charge that Defendant subjected him to harassment based on gender. Although it does not appear that Plaintiff is asserting a sexual harassment claim, even assuming he were seeking to bring such a claim, the court finds that summary judgment would be justified because Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
Summary judgment is also warranted on Plaintiff's ADA claim for harassment. The undersigned "has been unable to find any precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States or the Eleventh Circuit holding that the ADA provides for a disability-harassment cause of action." Freeman v. Koch Foods of Alabama, 777 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1277 (M.D. Ala. 2011). The Eleventh Circuit has noted that it "has never held in a published opinion that a claim for harassment or a hostile work environment is available under the ADA." Palmer v. Albertson's LLC, 418 Fed. Appx. 885, 889 n.2 (11th Cir. 2011). "Given the lack of precedent in this circuit as to the existence [*65]  of a disability-harassment claim under the ADA, this Court declines to recognize it today." Freeman, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 1277 n.5. The court turns next to Plaintiff's Title VII hostile work environment based on his national origin.14
To establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment, Plaintiff must show that (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based upon a protected characteristic of the employee, in this case, national origin; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and to create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) the defendant is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability. See Walton v. Johnson & Johnson Servs., Inc., 347 F.3d 1272, 1279-80 (11th Cir. 2003). Plaintiff has established the first two elements of the prima facie case. Plaintiff alleges that he is of Haitian national origin and that he was subjected to unwelcome harassment by [*66]  supervisor Chris Williams and co-workers Deandrea Youngblood and Wayne Pettaway.
The next prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that the harassment was based upon his national origin. Although Plaintiff has cited to a number of comments made by Ms. Williams, Ms. Youngblood, and Mr. Pettaway in support of his hostile work environment claim, most of the comments had no relation to his Haitian national origin. Plaintiff, for example, testified that the three employees "picked on [him] about taking medication" and made statements such as, "If people take their medication, they wouldn't have attitude." [Pla. Dep. at 180-87]. Plaintiff also stated that Williams accused him of stealing, that Mr. Pettaway implied that he was having a relationship with a male coworker, and that Ms. Youngblood accused him of being flirtatious with female employees. [Pla. Dep. at 180-87, 206-13, 220-22, Exs. 22, 23]. There is no question that these statements were sarcastic and mean-spirited, but they were not related in any way to his national origin. The Eleventh Circuit has emphasized that Title VII "does not prohibit harassment alone, however severe and pervasive. Instead, Title VII prohibits discrimination, [*67]  including harassment that discriminates based on a protected category" such as national origin. Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Alabama, 480 F.3d 1287, 1301-02 (11th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff has failed to point to evidence which would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that these comments were made to Plaintiff based on his Haitian national origin. As a result, they will not be considered in evaluating his hostile work environment claim. See Reeves v. DSI Sec. Services, Inc., 395 Fed. Appx. 544, 546 (11th Cir. 2010) ("We do not consider statements or conduct that are unrelated to the defendant's race.").
There are a few alleged comments made by Ms. Williams that were based on Plaintiff's national origin. According to Plaintiff's testimony, after Ms. Williams overheard him speaking Creole to his wife, Williams said, "This is America, you need to speak English, we can't understand what you're saying." [Pla. Dep. at 160-61]. When Plaintiff was speaking Creole while helping a customer who was Haitian, Ms. Williams acted "as if something funny is happening." [Pla. Dep. at 161-62]. She also asked Plaintiff if he was born in America, asked if he married his wife to get his "papers," and "asked to see the documents to make sure what [he] was saying was true." [Pla. Dep. at 161]. Plaintiff testified that Williams made these comments more [*68]  than once. [Pla. Dep. at 162-63]. In his response brief, Plaintiff has not cited to any other comments that related to his national origin. [Doc. 44 at 15-17].
Because Plaintiff has established that he was subjected to harassment based upon his national origin, the next issue to be addressed is whether the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect Plaintiff's terms and conditions of employment. An employer violates Title VII by "creating or condoning an environment at the workplace which significantly and adversely affects an employee because of his race or ethnicity [or national origin], regardless of any other tangible job detriment to the protected employee." Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 901 (11th Cir. 1982). Factors courts should consider in deciding whether a hostile environment was created include the frequency and severity of the discriminatory conduct, whether the conduct is threatening or humiliating, and whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's work performance. See Edwards v. Wallace Community College, 49 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir. 1995). "Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII's purview." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993).
In the [*69]  present case, Plaintiff has failed to show that he was subjected to a discriminatorily abusive working environment. Plaintiff's testimony reveals that on a few occasions, Ms. Williams made some comments to him about speaking Creole, told him that he needed to speak English, and asked whether he was born in America. [Pla. Dep. at 160-62]. These actions do not approach the level of severity or pervasiveness necessary to bring a federal harassment claim. Even if the other statements allegedly made by bank employees that had nothing to do with Plaintiff's national origin were considered, this would not change the court's finding. Plaintiff's allegations, as noted supra, show that he was occasionally "picked on" about taking medication, accused of stealing, accused of being flirtatious with female employees, and accused of having a relationship with a male coworker. [Pla. Dep. at 180-87, 206-13, 220-22, Exs. 22, 23]. Plaintiff is unable to establish that the alleged conduct was particularly frequent, severe, intimidating, or threatening, and there is no evidence that it unreasonably interfered with his work performance. A reasonable jury could not find that the comments made by Ms. Williams, [*70]  Mr. Pettaway, and Ms. Youngblood created an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.
Title VII is not a "general civility code." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1002-03, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998). The Supreme Court has made it clear that Title VII is violated when "the workplace is permeated with 'discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,' . . . that is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment[.]'" Harris, 114 S. Ct. at 370 (quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2405, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)). Because the statements about which Plaintiff complains did not constitute severe or pervasive harassment, he is unable to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment. See Barrow v. Georgia Pacific Corp., 144 Fed. Appx. 54, 57-58 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiffs had failed to establish a racially hostile work environment even though racial slurs were sporadically directed at one of the plaintiffs); Edwards, 49 F.3d at 1521 (holding that "racial slurs allegedly spoken by co-workers had to be so 'commonplace, overt and denigrating that they created an atmosphere charged with racial hostility'") (quoting EEOC v. Beverage Canners, Inc., 897 F.2d 1067, 1068 (11th Cir. 1990)). Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's harassment claim.

G. Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff Cazeau alleges that Defendant Wells Fargo violated [*71]  the ADA because the company perceived that he had a disability and failed to provide him with reasonable accommodations. [Doc. 44-1 at 17-18]. "In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he was a 'qualified individual' at the relevant time, meaning he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). "As to the third element needed to establish a prima facie case, a qualified individual is unlawfully discriminated against if the employer does not make reasonable accommodations for the disability, unless such an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer." Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). The ADA provides, in part: "The term 'disability' means, with respect to an individual—(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (amended 2008).
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant regarded him as having a disability caused by anxiety [*72]  and stress. According to Plaintiff, evidence supporting this assertion is found in the fact that the company "had enough medical documents including a completed medical certification to know that Plaintiff had a disability." [Doc. 9 ¶ 61; Doc. 44-1 at 18]. This is the entirety of Plaintiff's argument in support of his ADA claim, and it is woefully insufficient. "In order to overcome summary judgment on a 'regarded as' theory of disability Plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Defendant perceived him, however erroneously, as having an impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities." Carper v. TWC Services, Inc., 820 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1355 (S.D. Fla. 2011). The fact that Plaintiff went on short-term disability for anxiety and stress and that Defendant possessed documents related to that leave does not establish that Defendant perceived Plaintiff as substantially limited in any major life activity. "[I]t is not enough for Plaintiff to show that Defendant perceived him as temporarily disabled or unable to perform a single particular job. Rather, Plaintiff has the burden of proving that his perceived impairment extended beyond his one particular job to a class of jobs or a broad [*73]  range of jobs in various classes and that it extended long-term into the future." Id. (citations omitted). Because Plaintiff has offered no evidence that Defendant ever regarded him as substantially limited in any major life activity, summary judgment is warranted on his ADA claim.
In addition, Plaintiff has failed to show that Defendant discriminated against him based on his disability by not providing him with a reasonable accommodation. "The regulations governing the ADA provide that, to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation, it may be necessary for an employer 'to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of an accommodation' to identify the person's limitations and possible accommodations." Knowles, 460 Fed. Appx. at 835 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). But "an employer cannot be liable for failure to accommodate if a breakdown in that process is attributable to the employee." Williamson v. Clarke County Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1319 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (citations omitted). Defendant argues that Plaintiff is responsible for any breakdown in the interactive process because he failed to take any action during his Job Search Leave to obtain another position with Wells Fargo. [Doc. 42 at 27]. Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant's argument [*74]  on this issue. [Doc.44-1 at 18]. Furthermore, the "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless the plaintiff makes a specific demand for an accommodation." Knowles, 460 Fed. Appx. at 835. There is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff provided Defendant with a specific demand for an accommodation.
For all these reasons, the court finds that Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADA claims.

H. State Law Claim
In addition to Plaintiff's numerous federal claims, he also asserts a claim for libel based on state law. Twenty-eight U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) provides, in pertinent part, "The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction . . . ." Because summary judgment has been recommended on all of Plaintiff's federal claims, the court RECOMMENDS that supplemental jurisdiction not be exercised over Plaintiff's remaining state law claim for libel and that it be dismissed without prejudice. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966) ("Certainly, if the federal claims are [*75]  dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as well.").

V. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant Wells Fargo's summary judgment motion [Doc. 42] be GRANTED on all of Plaintiff Pierre Cazeau's federal claims and that these claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The court further RECOMMENDS that supplemental jurisdiction not be exercised over Plaintiff's state law claim and that it be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
All pretrial matters have been concluded with the issuance of this Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), this Court's Local Rule 72.1, and Standing Order 08-01 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2008). The Clerk, therefore, is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED this 29th day of May, 2014.
