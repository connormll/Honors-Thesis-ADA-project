Opinion



ORDER
This matter comes before the Court pursuant to Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s Motion for Summary Judgment, filed January 24, 2020. [Dkt. No. 28]. Plaintiff Scott Batcher responded in opposition on February 14, 2020. [Dkt. No. 30]. Defendant replied on February 28, 2020. [Dkt. No. 36].
For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.

I. Background
Plaintiff Scott Batcher has been working at Wells Fargo since 2006. In the summer of 2016, Scott Batcher began working for a new manager. Over time, Batcher's relationship with his new manager, and with her successor, soured. When his managers presented him with a particularly negative performance review in June 2017, Batcher had an anxiety attack. He left work and took medical leave. While on leave for almost eleven months, [*2]  Batcher submitted a complaint alleging that his manager discriminated against him because of his age while on leave. He requested to be reassigned to a different manager. Wells Fargo did not transfer the managers or move Batcher to a different position. But when a reorganization within the company moved the managers to different roles, Batcher returned to his old position, where he remains today.
Batcher brought this lawsuit against Wells Fargo, alleging that the company failed to accommodate his alleged disability by moving him to a new position, hiring him elsewhere, or transferring his managers. Batcher alleges that this conduct is discrimination against him for his disability and retaliation against him for his complaint of age discrimination. Wells Fargo alleges that it had non-discriminatory motives for its inaction.

II. Statement of Undisputed Material Facts1

Wells Fargo hires Batcher, and he remains with the company for more than a decade.
Plaintiff Scott Batcher works for Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as a Business Initiatives Consultant 2.2 He has been employed by Wells Fargo since 2006. He began as a Business Process Analyst 3 and moved to an Operational Risk Consultant 4 [*3]  position in February 2014. Operational Risk Consultants identify risks posed to Wells Fargo by third-party vendors, such as the risk of an outside computer server going down or of a private connection to Wells Fargo being compromised by hackers. On July 1, 2016, following a reorganization, Batcher's job title changed to Business Initiatives Consultant 2, though his duties did not change substantially. His manager changed, however. When he was an Operational Risk Consultant, he reported to Renae Pekas. After the reorganization, he reported to JoAnn West. At the time he began reporting to West, Batcher was 60 years old, and West was 57.

Batcher's performance at Wells Fargo is regularly reviewed by his managers.
Wells Fargo regularly conducts mid-year reviews of its employees' performance. Batcher's 2016 mid-year review, conducted by Pekas, contains some criticism of Batcher's ability to plan and to deliver work in a timely manner. In August 2016, West contacted Wells Fargo's Human Resources department, seeking to place Batcher on a Level Setting Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). Human Resources approved the request, and West delivered the PIP to Batcher in late September. Batcher disagreed [*4]  with West's complaints, arguing that he was "very effective . . . in getting things done" and that West did not understand his job.
In February 2017, West contacted Human Resources with more complaints about Batcher's performance and demeanor. She sought to prepare an Informal Warning and PIP for Batcher. HR approved the request again, but before West delivered the Informal Warning and PIP to Batcher, she met with him to go over his Annual Performance Evaluation for 2016. On February 17, one day after West delivered Batcher's annual evaluation, Batcher contacted Human Resources to dispute the evaluation. He claimed that he was being "harassed" by West. Batcher told Human Resources that West thought he was "too much of an expert" and was "threatened by [his] knowledge." Human Resources encouraged Batcher to prepare a written rebuttal to the evaluation.
That March, West delivered the Informal Warning and PIP to Batcher. Batcher again contacted Human Resources to dispute an example of his shortcomings in the document. West revised the document. In April, Batcher added a comment to his annual evaluation, stating that West was "harass[ing] and attack[ing]" him. He did not claim that it was [*5]  done because of any protected class. Human Resources conducted an internal investigation, taking no action.
In late April 2017, Christopher Quinn began supervising Batcher's team. West became Quinn's supervisor. On May 19, 2017, Quinn, West, and Batcher met to discuss the deadlines contained in the Informal Warning and PIP. They came to a resolution with deadlines to be extended as needed.
But by late May 2017, Quinn contacted Human Resources and began drafting a Formal Warning and PIP for Batcher.

After a bad review, Batcher develops anxiety and depression, and he takes medical leave.
On June 19, 2017, Quinn sent the written Formal Warning and PIP to Batcher by email and scheduled a meeting to discuss it. Batcher responded negatively, telling Quinn he could not speak about the Formal Warning until he had spoken to his doctor. He then left work. Batcher then applied for medical leave. Batcher took paid time off until his medical leave was approved. Wells Fargo's third-party leave administrator, Liberty Mutual, approved his medical leave after a review of his medical documentation on June 26, 2017.
The Formal Warning and PIP was never implemented because Quinn and Batcher never met to discuss [*6]  its contents.

Batcher remains on leave for eleven months, receiving medical treatment.
While on leave, Batcher was seen by Dr. Thomas Koithan, a psychiatrist. Dr. Koithan noted that Batcher "believe[d] he has been harassed by his employer" and diagnosed Batcher with (1) adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and (2) Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 107]. Dr. Koithan characterized Batcher's general functioning as "60% on a scale of 0-100%," and "progressing in his treatment." [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 108]. Dr. Koithan saw Batcher again seven times, describing his condition similarly in the first four visits. Despite Dr. Koithan's initial indication that Batcher was progressing in his treatment, the doctor rated Batcher's functioning as only 30% in early February, March, and April 2018. [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 111-25].
Batcher was also seen by Dr. Sarah Garner, his treating physician. Dr. Garner, who served as Batcher's doctor of the purposes of all contacts with Wells Fargo and Liberty Mutual, described Batcher's primary diagnosis as anxiety and that his condition was a "Class 5" mental impairment—the highest on Dr. Garner's scale. Dr. Garner [*7]  noted that she did "not think [Batcher would] be able to return to [his] current job. If [he] has new job, [down arrow] anxiety[;] I do think [he] will return to full capacity of work with time." [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 149]. Over the coming months, Dr. Garner continued to certify that Batcher's condition justified his absence from work, describing him on February 16, 2018, as "in such instability right now that he cannot function." [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 151]. In June 2018, Dr. Garner cleared Batcher to return to work.

Batcher takes medical leave.
Liberty Mutual handled Wells Fargo's disability benefit program. It approved short-term disability (STD) leave and Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave. Batcher's FMLA leave began on June 26, 2017 and ended September 15, 2017. At that point, he began Certified Medical Leave (CML), which was extended through June 30, 2018. Batcher's paid STD leave began on July 3, 2017, and was extended four times by Liberty Mutual after a review of his medical records. On November 30, 2017, Liberty Mutual declined to extend Batcher's STD leave a fifth time. In a letter to Batcher explaining its decision to deny a fifth extension, Liberty Mutual stated that it [*8]  had consulted with Drs. Koithan and Garner, as well as with an independent psychiatrist, to determine if Batcher still met the definition of disability. The insurer's review concluded that Batcher did not, as his anxiety was "more likely related to an occupational problem rather than a primary anxiety disorder." [Dkt. No. 28-40, at 19]. Because, in Liberty Mutual's opinion, Batcher was capable of performing the normal duties of his position—and was, in fact, applying for other jobs in the field—he was no longer disabled and was therefore ineligible for a fifth extension of his STD leave.

While on leave, Batcher applies for internal and external jobs.
As Liberty Mutual indicated in its denial letter, Batcher had been applying for other jobs, both within Wells Fargo and with other companies such as Principal Insurance, while on leave. Batcher applied for fifteen Wells Fargo positions, and an unspecified number of outside positions, between June 2017 and the end of that year. Batcher estimates that he sent out 150 resumes. Wells Fargo's internal records indicate that Batcher did not meet the qualifications for at least two of the fifteen positions. For other positions, according to a confidential [*9]  email sent by a Wells Fargo recruiting manager, Batcher was "applying for jobs where the candidate pools are extremely competitive" and "really truly was beat out by the competition." [Dkt. No. 30-3, at 63]. Batcher does not set forth facts about these applications that would show how he could establish a prima facie case for discrimination for refusal to hire him. As best the Court can determine from the summary judgment record, Batcher received no interviews, with Wells Fargo or otherwise.

Batcher speaks with Wells Fargo's Accommodations Management team and complains of age discrimination for the first time.
On November 20, 2017, while on medical leave and while still receiving paid STD leave, Batcher contacted Wells Fargo's Ethics line and claimed for the first time that West had discriminated against him because of his age. He also, for the first time, requested that Wells Fargo transfer him to a vacant position or change his reporting structure as a "reasonable accommodation."
In his complaint and accommodation request, which he subsequently sent by email to Human Resources and Accommodations Management, Batcher alleged that West had made the following comments in 2016:
"Through all [*10]  the years of your experience you should be able to find a way to make all of this work."
"You're old enough and experienced enough to be able to handle your situations like this. Please review your process and attempt again."
"With your vast experience, you should be able to handle all the items under your control."
He also alleged that he received unwarranted criticism that his younger colleagues did not receive. Wells Fargo responded to Batcher's complaint by having an Employee Relations Senior Consultant interview both Batcher and West and review Batcher's performance documentation, among other files. The consultant concluded that Batcher's complaint lacked merit and closed the investigation.
Batcher's request for a transfer as an accommodation, made in November 2017 when his doctors still reported he was suffering from anxiety, includes an assertion that he would "return to work immediately if [he was] not required to report to Mr. Quinn and Ms. West."
Over the coming months, Batcher worked with Stacey Milbern, an Accommodation Management Consultant, to attempt to resolve the situation. At her deposition, Milbern testified that it was unusual to open up a job search case for an employee [*11]  on medical leave until it was certain what restrictions or accommodations would be put in place for the employee. Nonetheless, Milbern testified that "we were kind of making an exception" for Batcher, and they began having regular contact. Similarly, a Wells Fargo employee testified that she offered Batcher help with his resume, despite this being different from the usual procedure.
According to Wells Fargo, from June 2017 to June 2018, "there were no vacant positions on the team that West reported up to for which Batcher's skills and experience would have been needed" that did not report to West or Quinn. Without disputing this fact, Batcher asserts that Wells Fargo did not provide him with the accommodation of moving him to a vacant position for which he was qualified.
Milbern testified that Wells Fargo's typical procedure when an employee is ready to return to work is to transition them to (unpaid) "job search leave," a ninety-day period in which the accommodations team provided an employee with support. Milbern informed Batcher of this procedure, and he declined to transition to job search leave multiple times, citing financial concerns. According to Milbern, she had no reason to [*12]  believe in November 2017 that Batcher would have any difficulty returning to full-time work with supervisors other than West and Quinn.
By February, Batcher had been on leave since June 2017, and his STD leave had ended November 30, 2017, without an extension. Despite Batcher's objections to being placed on job search leave, Milbern moved him to 90-day job search leave on February 12, 2017.

The reporting structure of Batcher's position changes, and he returns to work.
In the late spring of 2018—before the 90 days had expired—a reorganization caused a change in the reporting structure of Batcher's position, which had not been filled. Due to the reorganization, Jon Hayes took over West's position, while Brian Hill took over Quinn's. On May 11, 2018, Hayes contacted Batcher to ask about his return-to-work date and telling Batcher that Wells Fargo would hold his position open until May 25. After discussion of the reorganization with Batcher and a further delay so that Dr. Garner could clear Batcher to return to work, Batcher returned to his old position, reporting to Hayes and Hill instead of West of Quinn. Batcher was paid the same salary upon his return that he was earning when he took [*13]  medical leave, and he received a bonus in March 2019. Batcher now describes his performance as "glowing," "surpassing everyone on [his] team."

Procedural History
Before he returned to work, Batcher had filed a complaint with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission on February 28, 2018. [Dkt. No. 1-3, at 5]. The Commission issued a right-to-sue letter on November 7, 2018. [Dkt. No 1-3, at 1]. On January 31, 2019, Batcher filed suit in the Iowa District Court for Polk County against Wells Fargo, West, and Quinn. [Dkt. No. 1-3]. In his Complaint, Batcher accused the defendants of violating the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA) in five counts. [Dkt. No. 1-3]. Invoking this Court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a)3 and 1441, Wells Fargo filed a Notice of Removal in this Court on March 4, 2019.4 [Dkt. No. 1]. The next day, Wells Fargo filed a partial Motion to Dismiss, seeking to dismiss West and Quinn as defendants and to dismiss Count I. [Dkt. No. 4]. Batcher amended his complaint, dropping West and Quinn as defendants, on March 21. [Dkt. No. 8]. After full briefing, this Court granted Wells Fargo's Motion to Dismiss Count I on April 29, 2019. [Dkt. No. 9]. Discovery commenced, concluding on December 21, 2019. [Dkt. Nos. [*14]  17, 18]. Wells Fargo now moves for summary judgment on the remaining four counts. [Dkt. No. 28].

III. Legal Standard for Summary Judgment
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that a "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Med. Liab. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Alan Curtis L.L.C., 519 F.3d 466, 471 (8th Cir. 2008); Kountze ex rel. Hitchcock Found. v. Gaines, 536 F.3d 813, 817 (8th Cir. 2008) ("[S]ummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, discovery materials, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law."). In making this determination, the Court must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See HDC Med., Inc. v. Minntech Corp., 474 F.3d 543, 546 (8th Cir. 2007). Put differently, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
To survive a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must "set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). "[A]n issue of material fact is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury verdict for the nonmoving party." Great Plains Real Estate Dev., L.L.C. v. Union Cent. Life Ins. et al., 536 F.3d 939, 944 (8th Cir. 2008) (internal citation omitted). "A genuine issue of fact is material if it 'might affect the outcome of the suit under the [*15]  governing law.'" Saffels v. Rice, 40 F.3d 1546, 1550 (8th Cir. 1994) (internal citation omitted). "'[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material.'" Guinan v. Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., 803 F. Supp. 2d 984, 993 (N.D. Iowa 2011) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
"There is no 'discrimination case exception' to the application of summary judgment." Torgerson, 643 F.3d 1041, 1043 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc) ((abrogating, among others, Bell v. Conopco, Inc., 186 F.3d 1099, 1101 (8th Cir. 1999) (requiring "particular deferen[ce]" by a court to the party opposing summary judgment when liability depends on inferences)). Thus, a court uses the same tools in a discrimination case that it would use on any other case at summary judgment, entering summary judgment if and only if the non-moving party has failed to make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).

IV. Substantive Law
Batcher alleges five claims for relief. On Wells Fargo's pre-Answer motion, this Court dismissed Count I on April 29, 2019. [Dkt. No. 12]. Four counts remain, charging Wells Fargo with unlawful retaliation for his age discrimination complaint (Count II); and disability discrimination for failure to engage in the interactive process (Count [*16]  III), failure to make a reasonable accommodation (Count IV), and failure to hire (Count V).

A. Age Discrimination (Count II)
In Count II, Batcher claims that Wells Fargo unlawfully retaliated against him in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA), which makes it illegal for "[a]ny person to . . . retaliate against another person in any of the rights protected against discrimination by this chapter because such person has lawfully opposed any practice forbidden under this chapter." Iowa Code § 216.11(2). While Batcher does not bring a retaliation claim under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, the language of the ICRA's retaliation provision "mirrors almost exactly" that of its federal counterpart, and the Court will therefore use the same framework for Batcher's ICRA claim that it would for a claim brought under federal law. Haskenhoff v. Homeland Energy Sol. LLC, 897 N.W.2d 553, 584 (Iowa 2017). The sole difference between the two frameworks, as discussed below, is the ICRA's less stringent requirement for causation. See Goodman v. Performance Contractors, Inc., 363 F. Supp. 3d 946, 956-57 (N.D. Iowa 2019).
When, as here, there is no direct evidence of unlawful motive, retaliation claims are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Clark v. Johanns, 460 F.3d 1064, 1067 (8th Cir. 2006). Then, [*17]  the burden of production shifts to the defendant, who must offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Id. Last, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who must show that the offered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. Id.
In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must present evidence to support three elements: (1) that he engaged in a protected activity; (2) that an adverse employment action was taken against him; and (3) that a causal connection exists between the two. Barker v. Missouri Dep't of Corr., 513 F.3d 831, 834 (8th Cir. 2008); Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 582. An adverse employment action is "an action that detrimentally affects the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," including but not limited to ""disciplinary demotion, termination, unjustified evaluations and reports, loss of normal work assignments, and extension of probationary period." Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 587. To establish a causal connection under the ICRA, the protected activity need only be a "motivating factor" in the employer's decision. Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 635-37; see also Johnson v. Mental Health Inst., 912 N.W.2d 855, No. 16-1447, 2018 Iowa App. LEXIS 7, 2018 WL 351601, at *7-8 (Iowa Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2018). This is a lower causation standard than is required by Title VII, under which a plaintiff must provide evidence that "the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action." Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 352, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013) (cited in [*18]  Wright v. St. Vincent Health Sys., 730 F.3d 732, 737-38 (8th Cir. 2013)).
Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Barker, 513 F.3d at 834; Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 582. "This is a burden of production, not persuasion, and no credibility assessment is involved." Johnson, 912 N.W.2d 855, 2018 WL 351601, at *6 (quoting Woodbury Cty. v. Iowa Civ. Rts. Comm'n, 335 N.W.2d 161, 165, 166 (Iowa 1983). "It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff." Id. (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).
At the third step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, the burden returns to the plaintiff, who must produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's proffered reason is mere pretext for retaliation. Smidt v. Porter, 695 N.W.2d 9, 15 (Iowa 2005). The fighting issue at the pretext stage is, essentially, whether the plaintiff can prove the defendant actions were unlawful retaliation. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (noting at that the final step of a court's discrimination analysis, "the McDonnell Douglas framework—with its presumptions and burdens—disappeared, and the sole remaining issue [is] discrimination vel non"). (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

B. Disability Discrimination (Counts III, IV, and V)
In Counts III, IV, and V, Batcher alleges that Wells Fargo violated the ICRA's [*19]  prohibition against disability discrimination in three ways: by failing to engage in a good-faith interactive process with regard to his disability (Count III), by not making a reasonable accommodation for his disability (Count IV), and by failing to hire him due to his disability (Count V). Each claim requires a threshold showing that Batcher was disabled under the meaning of the ICRA. See, e.g., Minnihan v. Mediacom Commc'ns. Corp., 779 F.3d 803, 813 (8th Cir. 2015) (portraying interactive process claims as being brought by "an employee with a disability"); Kallail v. Alliant Energy Corp. Servs., Inc., 691 F.3d 925, 930 (8th Cir. 2012) (stating, in a reasonable accommodation context: "To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the [Americans with Disabilities Act], an employee must show that she (1) is disabled within the meaning of the ADA . . . .) (quoting Chalfant v. Titan Distrib. Inc., 475 F.3d 982, 988 (8th Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted)); Tusing v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 639 F.3d 507, 518 (8th Cir. 2012) (quoting the same language from Chalfant in a failure to hire context).
The ICRA defines "disability," in relevant part, as "the physical or mental condition of a person which constitutes a substantial disability." Iowa Code § 216.2(5). Iowa courts traditionally look to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),5 which defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or major life activities of [an] [*20]  individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); Minnihan, 779 F.3d at 814 n.4. "Major life activities" include "walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working." Iowa Admin. Code r. 161-8.26(3). For conditions that occur episodically or intermittently, courts determine if the condition "substantially impair[s] one or more major life activities during episodes or flare-ups, even if it d[oes] not impair life activities at all when in remission." Goodpaster v. Schwan's Home Service, Inc., 849 N.W.2d 1, 10 (Iowa 2013).
In Counts III and IV, Batcher alleges that Wells Fargo failed to participate in an interactive process and offer him a reasonable accommodation. For a disabled plaintiff to survive summary judgment in a claim that his employer failed to make a reasonable accommodation,6 he must show the following elements:
(1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; (2) the employee requested accommodation or assistance for his or her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodation; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.
Minnihan, 779 F.3d at 813 (quoting Cravens v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, 214 F.3d 1011, 1021 (8th Cir. 2000). While there is no independent liability for failure to engage in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable [*21]  accommodation is possible, this failure "is prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith." Id. Accordingly, the Court will discuss Counts III and IV together, noting that evidence offered by Batcher to prove his interactive process claim is better considered as evidence of the third element of his reasonable accommodation claim. While an employer is required to make a good-faith effort to find a reasonable accommodation for a disabled employee, "a disabled individual is not entitled to an accommodation of his choice." Rehrs v. Iams Co., 486 F.3d 353, 359 (8th Cir. 2007).
In Count V, Batcher alleges that while he was on leave, Wells Fargo did not hire him for other positions because of his disability. To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show "(1) that [he] has a disability within the meaning of the [ICRA]; (2) that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that he suffered an adverse employment action due to a disability." Tusing, 639 F.3d at 519 (quoting Chalfant, 475 F.3d at 988 (internal quotations and citation omitted)).

V. Arguments of the Parties

A. Age Discrimination
The parties do not dispute that Batcher's November 20, 2017, complaint [*22]  of age discrimination constitutes protected activity under the ICRA. In arguing that Wells Fargo retaliated against him for this complaint, Batcher first argues that he suffered an adverse employment action in the form of Wells Fargo's "refusal to assist [him] with an accommodation" or preferentially place him in another position. [Dkt. No. 33, at 25-26]. Batcher observes that Wells Fargo was certainly aware of his complaint of age discrimination, as he included a "report that [his] manager discriminated against [him] because of [his] age" in the same sentence in which he requested an accommodation from Wells Fargo's Human Resources Department and Accommodations Management team. [Dkt. No. 33, at 27; Dkt. No. 30-3, at 18-19]. Additionally, Batcher argues that Wells Fargo's failure to transfer him to a new position constitutes adverse employment action because much of the time he spent on leave was unpaid.
To establish a causal nexus between his complaint and the alleged adverse employment action(s), Batcher notes that his status changed from paid leave to unpaid leave on November 30, 2017, only ten days after his November 20 complaint. [Dkt. No. 33, at 27]. Close temporal proximity between [*23]  protected activity and an adverse employment action may be sufficient to raise a jury question as to the causal nexus between the two. Springer v. Weeks & Leo Co., 429 N.W.2d 558, 562 (Iowa 1988); but see, e.g., Garang v. Smithfield Farmland Corp., No. C18-4082-LTS, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24427, 2020 WL 701986, at *19 (N.D. Iowa Feb. 12, 2020) ("Absent other evidence suggesting a retaliatory motive, however, [temporal proximity] is not enough to raise a genuine issue of material fact.").
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, Wells Fargo argues that its inaction cannot be construed as an adverse action: "Batcher was on medical leave and upset with Wells Fargo for not placing him in a different job before he complained of age discrimination. After he complained of age discrimination, Batcher remained on medical leave and remained upset with Wells Fargo for not placing him in a different job." [Dkt. No. 36, at 2]. Because Batcher's circumstances did not change after he complained of discrimination, Wells Fargo argues, he cannot possibly claim that the company took some adverse action against him. See Fisher v. Elec. Data Sys., 278 F. Supp. 2d 980, 993 (S.D. Iowa 2003) (describing the typical "adverse employment action" as "some tangible change in duties or work conditions) (citing Manning v. Metropolitan Life, 127 F.3d 686, 692 (8th Cir. 1997) (abrogated on other grounds)).
To the extent that Batcher's move from paid leave to unpaid leave qualifies [*24]  as an adverse action, Wells Fargo observes that Batcher moved to unpaid leave only because his paid leave ran out on November 30, 2017. [Dkt. No. 36, at 5]. The decision not to extend his paid STD leave was legitimate and nondiscriminatory, Wells Fargo argues, because the company was under no duty whatsoever to extend the leave again, and Liberty Mutual had concluded that Batcher was no longer eligible for disability leave. [Dkt. No. 36, at 5 n.3]. And Batcher offers no evidence other than the temporary proximity of his complaint to his move to unpaid leave to suggest that Wells Fargo's actions (or inactions) were motivated by discriminatory intent. See Garang, 439 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 2020 WL 701986, at *19. Wells Fargo also argues that it did not move Batcher to another position because he repeatedly refused to move to "job search leave," which Wells Fargo's accommodations team took as an indication that Batcher wished to remain on medical leave and was not medically ready to return to work [Dkt. 28-1, at 10]. Additionally, his doctor stated in February 2018 that Batcher was not capable of returning to work.
Batcher, in opposition to the Motion, argues that Wells Fargo's justification for its actions must be mere pretext because it is [*25]  "unworthy of credence." [Dkt. No. 33, at 26]; Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). To Batcher, only discriminatory intent or "nonsensical and slavish devotion to the nomenclature of [his] unpaid leave" could have kept Wells Fargo from fully assisting him with a job search despite his refusal to go on "job search leave." [Dkt. No. 33, at 27]. Lastly, Batcher argues that Wells Fargo has proffered no explanation for not returning him to his position immediately on April 28, 2018, when his previous managers no longer supervised the position. [Dkt. No. 33, 27-28]. Wells Fargo admits that it did not contact Batcher about returning to his position until May 11, 2018, but argues that this delay is too small to possibly count as actionable, and that Batcher responded to the contact by requesting more time to consult with his doctor. [Dkt. No. 36, at 4].
Wells Fargo also argues that Batcher abandoned his retaliation claim when he stated at his deposition that he "[didn't] know for a fact that they retaliated against [him]." [Dkt. No. 28-4, at 41-42]. When asked directly at his deposition whether any of the alleged negative actions were taken against him because of his complaint, Batcher responded, "No, I don't think that was—it [*26]  was done—I think they're probably independent from one another. That would be my guess. I mean, I would hope that Wells Fargo wouldn't do that." [Dkt. No. 28-4, at 42]. And to the question, "Is there anything you believe was done to you because you filed an age discrimination complaint?," Batcher replied, "Not that I can attest to. I mean, I—I don't know what goes on behind the scenes, so I'm not aware of that at this time." [Dkt. No. 28-4, at 42]. Batcher portrays these statements not as an abandonment of his retaliation claim, but as an admission that he has no personal, direct knowledge of Wells Fargo's reasoning or intent. [Dkt. No. 33, at 24].

B. Disability Discrimination
Because the adverse employment action at the center of Batcher's age discrimination claim is essentially comprised of Wells Fargo's alleged failure to find Batch a reasonable accommodation and failure to hire him for other positions, the Court need not rehash the parties' arguments about those actions in detail. Of particular relevance to the reasonable accommodation claim in Count IV are the parties' arguments as to whether Wells Fargo made a good-faith effort to engage in an interactive process with Batcher during [*27]  the months he was on leave. Wells Fargo argues that Batcher did not receive the full job search assistance program because he repeatedly refused to transition to "job search leave" which was ordinarily required for Wells Fargo employees. [Dkt. 28-1, at 10]. Nonetheless, the company argues, it provided Batcher with resume-writing assistance that it would usually not provide for employees on medical leave. In resistance, Batcher argues that Wells Fargo could have provided him with the full extent of its job search and preferential placement programs, regardless of what type of leave he was currently taking. What's more, Batcher claims, the company had the power to move him onto job search leave without his permission, as evidenced by the fact that Wells Fargo did just that on February 12, 2018. [Dkt. No. 33, at 20].
At the center of the parties' arguments over Batcher's disability discrimination claims, however, is an argument over whether Batcher is disabled under Iowa law. Compare [Dkt. No. 28-1, at 15-16], and [Dkt. No. 36], with [Dkt. No. 33, 5-11]. Wells Fargo cites to McCrea v. City of Dubuque, a recent Iowa Court of Appeals case, for the proposition that an inability to work for [*28]  a particular supervisor does not render one "disabled" under the ICRA. No. 16-0183, 899 N.W.2d 739, 2017 WL 936096, at *11-12 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2017). In McCrea, the appellate court affirmed a finding that in order to be disabling, an impairment must affect one's "ability to work in general," not one's "ability to work . . . one job." 899 N.W.2d 739, [WL] at *12; see also, e.g., Alsup v. U.S. Bancorp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, 2015 WL 224748, at *4-5 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2015) (collecting post-2008 ADA cases in other jurisdictions).
Wells Fargo points to numerous instances—in his conduct while on leave, in his deposition, and in his briefing in this litigation—where Batcher has asserted that he is fully capable of performing his job, without accommodation, under any supervisor but West or Quinn. [Dkt. No. 36, at 2]. Because Batcher only alleges an inability to work at one job, rather than an inability to work at a class of jobs, Wells Fargo argues that he was not disabled under the ICRA.
In resistance, Batcher argues that Wells Fargo minimizes the severity of his impairments and the degree to which his anxiety and depression affected his major life activities. [Dkt. No. 33, at 5-12]. Citing to his extensive treatment records, Batcher details how, beginning in June 2017, he suffered from anxiety and depression that his treating physicians described as "severe," with Batcher sometimes "unable [*29]  to function." [Dkt. No. 33, at 9-10]. Citing to Goodpaster, Batcher argues that he may have been disabled under the ICRA even if he was able to work other jobs, even similar ones. 849 N.W.2d at 7.
Batcher's resistance to summary judgment makes no mention of McCrea. Nor does it address the line of other cases stating that an inability to work a specific job does not constitute a disability under the ICRA.

VI. Analysis

A. Even if Batcher has established a prima facie case of age discrimination, he has not produced evidence sufficient to convince a jury that Wells Fargo's actions were a pretext for age discrimination.
At the first stage of the Court's McDonnell Douglas analysis,7 Batcher must establish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing that (1) that he engaged in a protected activity; (2) that an adverse employment action was taken against him; and (3) that a causal connection exists between the two. Barker, 513 F.3d at 834; Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 582. There is no dispute that Batcher's complaint of age discrimination is protected by the ICRA.
A reasonable jury could find that Wells Fargo took adverse employment action against Batcher after his November 20, 2017, complaint. Batcher alleges that Wells Fargo did not extend his paid leave [*30]  when it expired, did not move him into a different position, and did not hire him to any of the positions to which he applied. Batcher offers no evidence that Wells Fargo was required to extend his paid leave after Liberty Mutual decided he was not disabled, and so this inaction by Wells Fargo did not "detrimentally affect[] the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Haskenhoff, 897 N.W.2d at 587. Similarly, Batcher does not point to any available, equivalent positions under a different manager to which he could have been moved, and so it is unclear how Wells Fargo's inaction could be cast as an adverse employment action. But Batcher did apply for jobs at Wells Fargo and was not hired for them, and this alleged failure to hire is enough to sustain the second element of a prima facie case.
Batcher provides no evidence that Wells Fargo ended his paid leave, or did not move to him a different job,8 or did not hire him to another position for pretextual reasons. Batcher does point to the fact that Wells Fargo has improved their job-finding policies since 2018, but he does not point to a single younger colleague who received more job-finding support than him at the time he was on leave. It was Liberty Mutual [*31]  that declined to approve a fifth extension of Batcher's short-term disability benefits. He does not point to similarly situated but unprotected workers who received paid leave from Wells Fargo despite a denial by the insurer. And he produced no evidence to suggest that Liberty Mutual knew of his protected status or had discriminatory animus in this decision.
Because Batcher has failed to establish every element of a prima facie case, summary judgment in favor of Wells Fargo on Count II is appropriate. But even had Batcher's case not failed to meet his initial burden, the Court finds that he has not established a dispute of fact sufficient to show that Wells Fargo's stated reasons for its actions are pretextual. See, e.g., Montgomery v. John Deere & Co., 169 F.3d 556, 559 (8th Cir. 1999) (conducting full McDonnell Douglas analysis despite "skeptic[ism]" over prima facie case).
Were Batcher to establish his prima facie case, the burden would then shift to Wells Fargo to produce a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its inaction. This burden is "not onerous and the explanation need not be demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence." Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1047 (quoting Floyd v. State of Mo. Dep't of Soc. Servs., Div of Family Servs., 188 F.3d 932, 936 (8th Cir. 1999)). Here, Wells Fargo has met its minimal burden by offering an explanation for each of its decisions: [*32]  Batcher was taken off paid leave because Liberty Mutual found that he was not disabled; he was not given in-depth job-finding assistance because he refused to move to "job search leave"; and he was not hired because, for each position, he was not qualified or was beaten out by a superior applicant. These explanations are enough for Wells Fargo to meet its burden, and the burden shifts back to Batcher to show that the explanations are pretext for retaliation.
Batcher argues that Wells Fargo could have provided him with more support than it did: the Accommodation Management Consultant who hesitated to move Batcher to job search leave without his permission eventually did so, and she admitted in her deposition that Wells Fargo now has a more robust program for employees returning from medical leave than it once did. But this in no way connects what Wells Fargo did to Batcher's complaint of age discrimination. Similarly, Batcher offers nothing more than conclusory allegations in claiming Wells Fargo's explanation for its failure to hire him to other positions—that he was unqualified for some positions and beaten out by a superior candidate for others—is pretextual.
Considering the failure [*33]  of Batcher's prima facie case and his lack of evidence of pretext, the Court holds that no reasonable jury could find that Wells Fargo retaliated against Batcher for his complaint of age discrimination. Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to Count II.

B. Batcher was not disabled under the ICRA.
For a plaintiff to succeed in a claim of disability discrimination, it follows from both logic and controlling precedent that the plaintiff must be disabled. See, e.g., Minnihan, 779 F.3d at 813 (interactive process); Kallail, 691 F.3d at 930 (reasonable accommodation); Tusing, 639 F.3d at 518. A plaintiff is disabled if his condition "substantially impair[s] one or more major life activities . . . ." Goodpaster, 849 N.W.2d at 10. A medical condition need not be active at all times in order to be disabling: for episodic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, anxiety, or alcoholism, a condition is disabling if it impairs major life activities during episodes or flare-ups. Id. Thus, disability claims are available even for plaintiffs who are fully functioning most of the time.
At the same time, a condition that prevents a person from performing a particular job does not render an individual "disabled" under the ADA or ICRA. McCrea, 899 N.W.2d 739, 2017 WL 936096, at *11-12. In McCrea, the Iowa Court of Appeals found that anxiety [*34]  caused by a "negative work environment" in one particular job did not render an individual disabled under Iowa law. Id. Faced with a similar set of facts to those the Court faces here, the Iowa court found that McCrea had failed to "name any major life activities—other than her specific workplace—that were affected by her anxiety." 899 N.W.2d 739, [WL] at *12. This case is not distinguishable from McCrea.
With every legitimate inference made in Batcher's favor, the evidence shows that Batcher has anxiety and depression, but that these conditions are inextricably linked with one particular job: his position working for West and Quinn. Even since the 2008 amendments to the ADA expanded the definition of "disability," a plaintiff must show that his impairment "limits [his] ability to perform a class of jobs or broad range of jobs.'" Tinsley v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs., Corp., No. 18-5303, 766 F. App'x 337, 342, 2019 WL 1302189, at *5 (6th Cir. Mar. 20, 2019) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. (2016)). Federal courts across the country have routinely and uniformly held that a condition affecting one particular job is not a disability. See, e.g., Alsup, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5100, 2015 WL 224748, at *4-5 (collecting cases); see also Booth v. Nissan North America, Inc., 927 F.3d 387, 395 (6th Cir. 2019); Mancini v. City of Providence, 909 F.3d 32, 42 n.6 (1st Cir. 2018); Carothers v. County of Cook, 808 F.3d 1140, 1147 (7th Cir. 2015); Allen v. SouthCrest Hosp., 455 F. App'x 827, 835 (10th Cir. 2011). While the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has not explicitly addressed this issue since the ADA was amended, pre-ADAAA precedent similarly denies the label of "disabled" to employees [*35]  who are "unable to perform one specific job." Chalfant, 475 F.3d at 989.
Accordingly, the Court applies the long line of cases explaining that a condition only affecting one particular job is not a disability, and holds that Batcher's conditions, job-specific as they were, were not a disability. Because a reasonable jury could not find for Batcher on any of his disability claims, Wells Fargo's Motion for Summary Judgment is accordingly GRANTED as to Counts III, IV, and V.

VII. Conclusion
Batcher has failed to generate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Wells Fargo retaliated against him for his complaint of age discrimination. While Batcher believes the company's choice not to indefinitely extend his paid leave, and not to expend every possible effort putting him into a different position as soon as possible, are due to his complaint of age discrimination, he offers no evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that discriminatory motives were at play.
Batcher's disability discrimination claims also fail as a matter of law, as his "disability" was not a disability at all under Iowa law. A condition whose impairing effect is limited to a single job, rather than a class of jobs, is not a disabling [*36]  one. Here, Batcher firmly maintains that his condition was not only limited to, but caused by, a single job. This is fatal to his claim.
As no genuine issues of material fact exist to prevent summary judgment, the Court may dismiss Batcher's claims without weighing the evidence or making determinations of credibility, as it is forbidden to do. See Bell, 186 F.3d at 1101. Summary judgment is appropriately entered against a plaintiff who has failed to establish a genuine dispute as to the existence of every element upon which he will bear the burden of proof at trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Batcher is one such plaintiff.
Upon the foregoing,
IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, [Dkt. No. 28], is GRANTED in its entirety. The Clerk shall enter judgment in favor of Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
DATED this 26th day of May, 2020.
