REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
TO: THE HONORABLE DAVID A. EZRA
SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Before the Court are the Defendant Pflugerville Independent School District's Second Amended Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 22); Plaintiff's Response to Pflugerville Independent School District's Second Amended Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 26); and Defendant Pflugerville Independent School District's Reply to Plaintiff's Response (Dkt. No. 27). The District Court referred these Motions to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for report and recommendation.

I. Factual Background
Plaintiff Lieu Tran ("Tran") was employed as a teacher at Connally High School in the Pfugerville Independent School District ("PISD") beginning [*2]  in the fall of 2006. Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint at 6. Tran alleges he is an individual with a disability as he has been diagnosed with bipolar and panic disorders. Id. at 5. In his Second Amended Complaint, Tran alleges that he requires certain accommodations in order to function in the classroom because of his disorders. These accommodations include a need classroom walls that are a light or bright color such as yellow; his own printer in order to decrease stress; not teaching more than three hours at a time consecutively; and a room to himself in which to take his breaks. Id. at 5-7.
The principal at Connally High School from 2006 through the relevant period was Daniel Garcia. Id. at 8. Tran alleges that he informed Garcia of his bipolar disorder and his need for accommodations in the first couple of weeks of the 2006-2007 school year. Id. Tran alleges that at this meeting, Garcia told him medical documentation of the disorders was not necessary. Id. at 9. Tran received these requested accommodations from 2006 until 2010. Tran alleges that at the beginning of the 2010-11 school year, three days prior to students arriving for the first day of classes, Garcia required Tran to move to a new classroom—a classroom [*3]  not painted yellow and lacking its own printer. Id. at 9-10. Additionally, Tran was required to give up his room during his conference period. Id. at 11. Tran asserts that he had notified Human Resources about his bipolar disorder and need for accommodation. Id. at 8. He also asserts that at the beginning of the 2010-11 school year, he notified the Human Resources department and Superintendent Charles Dupre of his need to re-obtain his previous accommodations, and about the worsening symptoms of his bipolar disorder. Id. at 9-10. Tran asserts that, despite his requests, Garcia refused to grant him the same accommodations he had received the previous four years. Id. at 8-11. Tran also alleges that whenever the subject of accommodations had arisen in the past, Garcia had threatened to make Tran a "floater" or make him teach "repeater classes." Id. at 9.
Tran pleads that in September of 2010 he spoke to Human Resources again about having his own printer installed in his classroom. Id. at 10. On September 16, 2010, Tran provided a letter to the school from his doctor stating that Tran would benefit from having a printer in his classroom. Id. Eventually, Tran's attorney sent the school a demand letter, and PISD agreed to install a printer in Tran's classroom. [*4]  Id. On November 24, 2010, Tran's psychiatrist sent another letter to PISD requesting that the school paint Tran's classroom with brighter colors and requesting that Tran have his room to himself for his conference periods. Id. at 11. Tran's attorney sent another demand letter on December 9, 2010. Id. PISD ultimately retained a private consulting firm to address Tran's requests for accommodation. Id. In January of 2011, Tran met with George Frias, who worked in PISD's Human Resources Department. Id. at 12. Tran alleges that at this meeting Frias agreed to grant Tran all of his requested accommodations, and on January 24, 2011, PISD approved Tran's request to have his walls painted. Id. at 11-12. However, in March of 2011, Frias informed Tran that Garcia wanted to wait until the next year to implement the accommodations and was uncertain whether the requested accommodations would be implemented. Id.
Tran alleges that he experienced heightened stress because of the lack of accommodations, leading to incidents of stress, anger, panic attacks and stuttering. Id. He also contends that vice principal Sheila Reed harassed him by threatening that his contract would not be renewed and by setting up meetings with him, only [*5]  to make him wait, and then cancelling. Id. at p. 13. Tran alleges Reed sent him e-mails calling him a liar and a cheat and that in March of 2011 Reed changed Tran's PDAS evaluation scores. Id. PISD documented the incidents of stress and anger, and they led to Tran receiving a poor performance evaluation, and eventually to the non-renewal of his contract for the 2011-2012 school year. Id.
Shortly thereafter, on April 14, 2011, Tran met with a friend for coffee, and expressed that he was having suicidal thoughts and thoughts of harming Garcia and Reed. Id. at 13. Tran voluntary sought treatment at Shoal Creek Hospital. Id. at 14. As part of the commitment process, a nurse called Austin Police Department and a mental health officer interviewed Tran. Id. They completed the necessary paperwork for an emergency commitment, and Tran was committed into Shoal Creek. Id. On April 19, 2011, as Tran was being discharged from Shoal Creek, he was arrested based upon complaints made by Garcia and Reed that Tran had threatened to shoot them. Id. at 14. Tran was later released on bail. Id. On May 31, 2011, based upon the testimony of Garcia and Reed, a Travis County Grand Jury indicted Tran. Id. The case was eventually dismissed, however. [*6]  Id. at 3.
Tran filed a charge with the EEOC asserting disability discrimination, and it found cause to believe that the school district had denied Tran reasonable accommodations. Id. at 3, 15. He also pursued having his contract non-renewal reversed based upon errors in the procedure, while the school continued to pursue termination based on Tran's threatening statements made while at the mental health facility. Id. On July 6, 2011, the parties reached an agreement by which Tran voluntary separated from PISD, released certain claims, but retained the ability to bring a cause of action "related to accommodations under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act." The agreement does not specify whether those could be brought under Title I or Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA ("ADA"). Id. at 17.

II. Procedural Background
This case was filed on February 19, 2013. On May 8, 2013, PISD filed a Motion to Dismiss, and in response Tran filed an Amended Complaint on May 28, 2013. PISD then filed an Amended Motion to Dismiss, which Judge Yeakel referred to the undersigned. The Amended Complaint purported to state claim for disability discrimination under Title II of the ADA. The Report and Recommendation [*7]  this Court issued suggested that the district judge dismiss Tran's suit for failure to state a claim pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as that title is focused on making public facilities accessible, while Title I focuses on disability discrimination in an employment setting. Tran filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation contending that his claims were properly brought pursuant to Title II, and alternatively requesting leave of court to file his claims pursuant to Title I of the ADA. On January 29, 2014, the Judge Yeakel rejected the Report and Recommendation, dismissed Tran's objections, and granted Tran's request to file a Second Amended Complaint. In the Second Amended Complaint, Tran asserts that PISD "failed and refused to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff in violation of Title I and in addition and in the alternative Title II of the ADA." Second Amended Complaint at 17. Tran also alleges that PISD failed to modify its services in violation of both Title I and additionally and alternatively, Title II of the ADA. Id. PISD again moves to dismiss Tran's claims.

III. Standard
Defendants move to dismiss based upon Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).1 Rule 12(b)(6) allows for dismissal of an action [*8]  "for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not need detailed factual allegations in order to avoid dismissal, the plaintiff's factual allegations "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); see also, Cuvillier v. Sullivan, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). A plaintiff's obligation "requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id. The Supreme Court recently expounded on the Twombly standard, explaining that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. In evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court must construe the complaint liberally and accept all of the plaintiff's factual allegations in the complaint as true. See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2009).

IV. Analysis
In his Second Amended Complaint, Tran asserts that PISD (1) failed to make reasonable accommodations for him in violation of Title I and II of the ADA; and (2) failed to modify its services and environment for him in violation of Title I and II of the ADA. PISD moves to dismiss Tran's Title I claims asserting that Tran has failed to plead that: (1) he is a qualified [*10]  individual with a disability; (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; or (3) any causal connection between the alleged adverse employment action and Tran's disability. PISD also moved to dismiss the Title II claim (which the undersigned recommended be dismissed as a matter of law in the prior R&R). In his response Tran abandons that claim (Dkt. No. 26 at n.1), and the Court need not address it further.
Title I of the ADA provides that no employer shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to "the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Title I also provides that an employer discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Tran claims that PISD's actions constitute both a failure to accommodate and disability discrimination, both in violation of Title I of the ADA.

A. Disparate Treatment Claim
In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, plaintiff [*11]  must show that: (1) he suffered from a disability or was regarded as disabled; (2) he was qualified for the job that he held; (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action based on his disability or perceived disability; and (4) he was replaced by a non-disabled person or was treated less favorably than non-disabled employees. E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 615 (5th Cir. 2009). PISD asserts that Tran has failed to adequately plead any of these four elements.
Tran asserts that he is not complaining about any discharge, but about his treatment while employed at PISD. Tran alleges that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting approach is inapplicable in this case, as he has pled direct evidence of a prima facie case, and he thus need not show he was replaced by a non-disabled individual. Response at p. 13. While McDonnell Douglas is not applicable to a failure to accommodate claim, it does apply to straightforward disability discrimination claims. Although Tran seems unsure what he is pleading, because he alleges he can make out the first three elements of an ADA discrimination claim, which differ from a failure to accommodate claim, the Court addresses the elements below.
As a threshold requirement, Tran must establish that he has [*12]  a disability within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). The ADA defines "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 499-500 (5th Cir. 2011). "Major life activities" include "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). The ADA Amendments Act, which amended the ADA effective January 1, 2009, substantially changed this threshold requirement. See ADAAA of 2008, Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). As amended, the ADA now states that "[t]he definition of disability in this Act shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). The EEOC regulations interpreting the ADA provide that:
[a]n impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly [*13]  or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii).
PISD asserts that Tran has failed to adequately plead that his condition substantially limits any major life activity and that his Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed on this basis. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011). Additionally, PISD argues that Tran has failed to adequately plead that he has "a record of injury or impairment" or that any such injury or impairment "limited a major life activity." Dupre v. Charter Behavioral Health Sys. of Lafayette, Inc., 242 F.3d 610, 615 (5th Cir. 2001). PISD also asserts that Tran has failed to plead that, although not actually disabled, he was "regarded as having such an impairment." Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 237 (5th Cir. 2010).
Despite having many opportunities to amend his pleadings, Tran has never specifically pled that his bipolar and anxiety disorders limit any of his major life activities. Nevertheless, when read as a whole, the Second Amended Complaint effectively asserts that Tran's condition substantially limits his major life activity of working. In the factual section of the Second Amended Complaint, Tran alleges in quite a bit of detail how his bipolar and anxiety disorders [*14]  limit his ability to work. Id. at ¶¶ 14, 18-22. Additionally, Tran pleads that he spoke to the superintendent of PISD, Principal Garcia, and human resources representatives on various occasions, making it known that he suffered from bipolar and panic disorders and requesting accommodations for his disorders. Although he could have done better, Tran has adequately pled that he has a disability as defined by the ADA. For the purposes of this motion, the Court will assume without deciding that Tran is disabled under the statute.2
PISD argues that, as a matter of law, Tran's mental instability rendered him unqualified to work as a teacher. The Act protects only "qualified" employees, that is, employees qualified to do the job for which they were hired. PISD contends that threatening other employees makes Tran unqualified to be a teacher. See EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135 (1st Cir. 1997); Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2001) ("The ADA is not a license for insubordination in the workplace").3 It is undisputed that [*15]  Tran expressed a desire to shoot his supervising principal and vice principal. Second Amended Complaint at 14. Based on the case law just cited, once he threatened his supervisors, Tran was no longer qualified to work as a teacher at PISD. This does not end the analysis, however, because Tran has pled that he was qualified prior to that time.
PISD asserts as an additional basis for the dismissal that Tran failed to plead he suffered any "adverse employment action" as a result of the discrimination. PISD asserts that Tran suffered no adverse action in his employment, because he voluntarily resigned as part of a "separation agreement." Tran responds that the [*16]  denial of the prior accommodations, including the yellow wall, printer, and private classroom, qualify as adverse employment actions. "For discrimination claims under . . . the ADA, only 'ultimate employment decisions,' such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, or compensating, constitute adverse employment action." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006); McKay v. Johanns, 265 F. App'x 267, 268-69 (5th Cir. 2008); McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)); Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, 277 F.3d 757, 769 (5th Cir. 2001)). The only ultimate employment action Tran has identified in his Second Amended Complaint is his termination. Since Tran's pleadings admit that his termination was voluntary, occurring after he threatened his supervisors, the Second Amended Complaint fails to plead that Tran suffered an actionable "adverse employment action."
Additionally, Tran has failed to plead that he was replaced by a non-disabled person or treated less favorably than non-disabled employees. Thus, the failure to accommodate Title I ADA discrimination claim fails as a matter of law.

B. Failure to Accommodate Claim
Tran also brings a failure to accommodate claim. "[A] failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA is distinct from a claim of disparate treatment" and is analyzed separately under the law. Windhauser v. Bd. of Supervisors, 360 Fed. Appx. 562, 565 (5th Cir. 2010). In failure to accommodate cases, a plaintiff need not prove an adverse employment action. [*17]  Hardin v. CHRISTUS Health Southeast Tex. St. Elizabeth, No. 1:10—CV—596, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31444, 2012 WL 760642 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 6, 2012) (citing Bridges v. Dep't of Social Servs., 254 F.3d 71 (5th Cir. 2001)). In addition, the McDonnell Douglas framework is inapplicable to a failure to such claims. Keel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112070, 2012 WL 3263575, at *13 (E.D. Tex. July 17, 2012), adopted by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111934, 2012 WL 3262882 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 9, 2012), aff'd, 544 Fed. Appx. 468, 2013 WL 5615712 (5th Cir. Oct. 15, 2013).
In order to avoid dismissal on his Title I accommodation claim, Tran must plead the following: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability;4 (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were "known" by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make "reasonable accommodations" to address the known limitations. Feist v. Louisiana, 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013); see Bridges v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 254 F.3d 71 (5th Cir. 2001); Mzyk v. Ne. Indep. Sch. Dist., 397 F. App'x 13, 16 n. 3 (5th Cir. 2010). Tran has pled that his employer provided him with various accommodations for several years, and then removed those accommodations. Tran alleges he re-requested the accommodations and PISD agreed to re-instate them, but failed to do so as of the date of his breakdown and ultimate separation from PISD. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for failure to accommodate under Title I. See Sepúlveda-Villarini v. Dep't of Educ. of P.R., 628 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2010) (teachers' claims that accommodations were provided then later removed were sufficient to state a claim for failure to accommodate). Tran has pled that he performed his job adequately with the prior accommodations. In his Second Amended Complaint, [*18]  he has identified accommodations that he requested that were not implemented. This is adequate to state a claim for failure to accommodate.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
For the reasons set forth above, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant Pflugerville Independent School District's Amended Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 22) be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART and that all of Plaintiff's claims with the exception of his Title I failure to accommodate claim be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

VI. WARNINGS
The parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party filing objections must specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which objections are being made. The District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or general objections. See Battle v. United States Parole Comm'n, 834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987).
A party's failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this Report within fourteen (14) days after the party is served with a copy of the Report shall bar that party from de novo review by the District Court of the proposed findings and recommendations in [*19]  the Report and, except upon grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from appellate review of unobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District Court.
