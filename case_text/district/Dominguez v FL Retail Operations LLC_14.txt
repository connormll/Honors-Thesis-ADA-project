Opinion



ORDER
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:
On March 2, 2020, defendant FL Retail Operations LLC ("Florida Retail") moved to dismiss plaintiff Yovanny Dominguez's initial complaint in this case. Dkt. 16. On March 3, 2020, the Court referred the motion to the Honorable Sarah L. Cave, Magistrate Judge, for a report and recommendation. Dkt. 18. On March 16, 2020, Dominguez filed an amended complaint. Dkt. 19. On April 6, 2020, Florida Retail moved to dismiss Dominguez's amended complaint. Dkt. 21.
The amended complaint alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act for the failure of Florida Retail to accommodate legally blind individuals in the purveyance of gift cards. Similar motions to dismiss raising the same arguments are currently pending on appeal before the Second Circuit in Dominguez v. Banana Republic, LLC [*2] , No. 20-1559, and five related cases. These cases are on the Second Circuit's expedited appellate calendar. See, e.g., No. 20-1559, Dkt. 26.
The Banana Republic decision will almost certainly occasion significant re-briefing of Florida Retail's pending motion, if not the resolution of this litigation. Accordingly, the Court administratively terminates Florida Retail's motion to dismiss, without prejudice to its ability to refile its motion subsequent to the Circuit's decision in Banana Republic or its related cases.1 The Court further stays all proceedings in this case pending a decision in Banana Republic or the related cases.
The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motions pending at dockets 16 and 21.
SO ORDERED.
