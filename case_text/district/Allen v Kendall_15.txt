Opinion



ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 57)
Before the Court is a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Frank Kendall, in his official capacity as Secretary, Department of the Air Force. (Mot., Doc. 57.) Plaintiff William Allen opposed, and Defendant replied. (Opp., Doc. 66; Reply, Doc. 68.) Having considered the parties' briefs and held oral argument, the Court now DENIES Defendant's Motion for the reasons stated below.

BACKGROUND
The facts herein are undisputed unless otherwise stated. On or around March 3, 2019, Plaintiff, a black male, accepted a position as a Medical Standards Management Specialist ("MSME") with the 61st Medical Squadron. (Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact ("D's Reply to Plaintiff's [*2]  Statement") ¶¶ 1, 5, Doc. 68-2.) The 61st Medical Squadron, colloquially known as "the clinic," constituted a portion of the Los Angeles Air Force Base ("LA AFB") that provided healthcare services to active-duty military personnel and others stationed at LA AFB. (Id. ¶ 1.) The clinic was headed by Colonel Mark Pomerinke, who served as the clinic commander. (Id.) As a MSME at the clinic, Plaintiff's primary responsibility was to review medical records and profiles of active-duty military personnel at LA AFB to determine whether they met current medical standards. (Id. ¶ 5.)
Three individuals at the clinic served as Plaintiff's primary supervisors in 2019. Lieutenant Colonel Jaime Okamura served as Plaintiff's third-level supervisor. Okamura served as Flight Commander of the Aerospace and Operational Medicine Flight of the clinic, and she reported directly to Colonel Pomerinke. (Id. ¶ 2.) Captain Rosemond Reimmer served as Plaintiff's second-level supervisor. (Id. ¶ 3.) Reimmer headed the Flight Medicine Section of the Aerospace and Operational Medicine Flight of the clinic, and she directly reported to Okamura. (Id.) Lastly, Sergeant Jeremy McDonnell served as Plaintiff's direct supervisor. [*3]  (Id. ¶ 4.) McDonnell reported directly to Reimmer. (Id.)
On April 1, 2019, Plaintiff reported for his first day at LA AFB. (Id. ¶ 8.) At the time, Plaintiff's supervisors did not know that Plaintiff was disabled or black. (Id. ¶ 157.) Plaintiff testified that he went to Okamura's office on his first day to introduce himself. (Ex. B (Plaintiff Depo. Vol. II) at 170:6-11, Doc. 57-4.) Upon entering her office and introducing himself, Okamura purportedly told Plaintiff to keep the door open as she did not know who he was. (Id. at 176:16-17.) Plaintiff testified that he did not say anything else to her because he was "offended" by her comment. (Id. at 176:21-22.) Defendant concedes that Okamura did ask Plaintiff to leave the door open, but contends she did not ask him to do so on the first day. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 9, Doc. 68-2.) Instead, Defendant contends that Okamura asked Plaintiff to leave the door open a month or so into his position because Plaintiff allegedly made certain threatening gestures toward her during a particular conversation. (Id.; Ex. II (Dec. 3, 2021 Okamura Depo.) at 20:20-21:9, Doc. 68-12.) Plaintiff contends that Okamura's comments demonstrated racial [*4]  animus toward him since "[s]he had no reason to fear [him] or to be surprised by him reporting to her as a new employee." (Ex. B (Plaintiff Depo. Vol. II) at 170:6-11, Doc. 57-4; Opp. at 19-20, Doc. 66.) Based on his interactions with Okamura that day, Plaintiff believed that she wanted to get rid of him.
Plaintiff's supervisors began noting numerous issues with his behavior at work, many of which were brought to his attention and documented in his file. For example, within the first two weeks, Okamura noticed that Plaintiff became "very agitated" when his supervisors asked him a question or gave him direction, including when Okamura needed to speak with Plaintiff about plugging his personal iPad into his government-provided computer. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 16, Doc. 68-2; Ex. II (Dec. 3, 2021 Okamura Depo.) at 20:20-21:9, Doc. 68-12.) During this time, Okamura also noted an instance where Plaintiff failed to follow her instruction for obtaining advanced leave. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 16, Doc. 68-2.) Plaintiff's other supervisors also noted issues with Plaintiff's behavior including instances where Plaintiff was not following his set lunch time, was wearing [*5]  headphones in his office, was allegedly eating a meal in the form of a "buffet spread" at his desk when he should have been working, and was not keeping his cubicle door open. (Id. ¶¶ 18-19.) On May 6, 2019, Plaintiff's supervisors, specifically, McDonnell, made the first entry in Plaintiff's AF 971 folder1 documenting issues with Plaintiff's behavior at work. (Id. ¶ 29.) Additional entries were made in Plaintiff's 971 folder throughout May 2019. (See, e.g., ¶ 37.)
Plaintiff takes issue with his supervisor's characterizations of his behavior in some entries in his 971 folder, and he notes that some entries are not true. For example, Plaintiff disputes that he ate a meal in the form of a "buffet spread" at his desk, as the meal only consisted of a small lunch comprised of a sandwich and potato chips. (Id. ¶ 19.) Plaintiff notes that he had to eat at his desk during his first two weeks because he was allotted only thirty minutes for lunch despite purportedly notifying his supervisors that he needed more than thirty minutes to accommodate his diabetic condition. (Id.; Ex. B (Allen Depo. Vol. 1) at 191:12-20, Doc. 67-1.) Plaintiff also notes that while he wore headphones on occasion, [*6]  other employees also wore headphones in the office including supervisors Okamura and McDonald. (Id. at 224:19-25.) Plaintiff further testified that wearing headphones was a prevalent practice within the office. (Id.) As to entries made on May 21, 2019, Plaintiff contends that those entries are simply false. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶¶ 37, 38, Doc. 68-2.) And he states that there is no policy in the union bargaining agreement that an employee must have their cubicle door open. (Id. ¶ 34.) According to Plaintiff, his supervisors were attempting to stack complaints against him to get rid of him. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 25, 36.)
Plaintiff notes that he attempted to visit the Equal Employment Office (the "EEO") regarding his supervisors' behavior but was told by his supervisors he needed their permission, and that he was prevented from doing so on other later occasions. (Id. ¶ 76.) On May 22, 2019, a meeting was held between Plaintiff, McDonnell, Kiska Cureton and Peter Gold from LA AFB's Labor Relations department, and Plaintiff's union representative Roslyn Austin Stewart. (Id. ¶ 39.) At the meeting, McDonnell and Okamura, discussed among other things, their expectations regarding [*7]  Plaintiff's professionalism, Plaintiff's use of headphones at his desk, and the need for him to keep his cubicle door open. (Id. ¶ 41.) Plaintiff's union representative, Stewart, described the meeting as heated, and testified that in response to her questions regarding Plaintiff's treatment, Okamura and McDonnell would laugh, snicker, and whisper to one another. (Ex. E (August 31, 2021 Roslyn Austin Stewart Depo.) at 80:12-81:17, Doc. 67-4.) For example, Stewart recalled that Okamura and McDonnell would laugh when Plaintiff brought up his concerns that Okamura wanted him to leave her door open. (Id at 81:11-17.) Nonetheless, by the end of the meeting, Stewart was under the impression that Plaintiff would receive a "reset," and that Plaintiff's major issues had been worked out. (Id. ¶ 166.) Stewart further testified that his supervisors agreed to remove the entries from Plaintiff's 971 folder. (Ex. E (August 31, 2021 Roslyn Austin Stewart Depo.) at 71:18-24 (A: "And then we said, "Okay. Let's start fresh,' and we reset, and everybody was fine with that. They were supposed to remove all of that stuff out of his 971: all the little comments that they'd made, from all the different people [*8]  that were writing in there, because we couldn't identify half the people that were writing in the folder, we didn't understand half the entries."), Doc. 67-4.)
Additional issues arising with Plaintiff's employment continued, however, after the May meeting. From May 23, 2019 through June 2019, for example, Plaintiff's supervisors made additional entries in Plaintiff's 971 folder, and had discussions with Plaintiff regarding his purported offending behavior. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶¶ 51-53, Doc. 68-2.) The entries included notations that Plaintiff would throw his hands up when McDonnell wanted to speak with Plaintiff about something adverse, and reminders about maintaining a one-hour lunch period. (Id. ¶ 53.) In response, Plaintiff visited the union office four times between May 22, 2019 and June 9, 2019 to complain that he continued to be harassed by his supervisors. (Id. ¶ 54.)
There were additional complaints made in Plaintiff's 971 folder in July 2019. (See, e.g., ¶¶ 64, 65.) On July 1, 2019, an entry was made in Plaintiff's 971 folder that he did not show up to work or notify his supervisors of his absence. (Id. ¶ 64.) Another entry on July 2, 2019 noted that Plaintiff [*9]  again did not adhere to his established lunch time. (Id. ¶ 66.) Plaintiff contends that he did not adhere to his established lunch schedule on some occasions because his work-related tasks would spill into his lunch hour. (Ex. B (Oct. 27, 2021 William Allen Depo.) at 195:23-196:3), Doc. 57-4.) Plaintiff recalled raising with his supervisors that he needed a more flexible lunch hour but was denied that accommodation. (Id. 194:12-196:16.) Other entries made in Plaintiff's 971 folder during July 2019 included a notation made by McDonnell that Plaintiff took at least two personal phone calls during mandatory meetings. (Id. ¶ 80.) Plaintiff, however, testified that he took the calls because he thought they were regarding an emergency, and that McDonnell too took emergency phone calls during meetings. (Ex. D (December 20, 2021 William Allen Depo.) at 316:17-317:25, Doc. 67-3.) On July 23, 2019, McDonnell emailed Employee Relations Specialist Kristin Cureton regarding how to suspend Plaintiff. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶¶ 83-84, Doc. 68-2.)
On July 24, 2019, Plaintiff went to the EEO to execute a Record of Initial Contact. (Id. ¶ 87.) In the "Record of Initial Contact" form, Plaintiff [*10]  checked, as alleged "bases" for his complaints, "race," "color," "age," and "sex." (Id.; Ex. A (Record of Initial Contact) at PDF Page 2, Doc. 57-30.) On August 5, 2019, an entry was made in Plaintiff's 971 folder regarding sexual harassment of a coworker, which Plaintiff disputes and argues was placed into his file in retaliation against him. (Id. ¶ 93.) On August 8, 2019, EEO Specialist Joanna Ellerbe met with Plaintiff and Janella Rivers, Plaintiff's union representative, for the purpose of confirming the claims that Plaintiff wished to pursue through the informal EEO complaint process. (Id. ¶ 118.) After the meeting, Ellerbe emailed Plaintiff a draft the "Confirmation of Allegations" that included the claims Plaintiff and his union representative wanted to pursue. (Id. ¶ 122.) The Confirmation of Allegations summarized Allen's informal complaint as follows:
• From May 6, 2019-July 13, 2019, numerous negative entries were made in Allen's personnel file;
• On or about May 16, 2019, Allen was required to sign in/sign out and was given a fixed lunch hour which he was told could not be changed even to accommodate work-related meetings;
• On or about May 16, 2019, Allen was told he could [*11]  not listen to headphones or close his door;
• On or about May 23, 2019, Okamura called Allen a liar in front of other employees;
• On or about June 25, 2019, Allen was written up for utilizing a USB port on the computer; and
• On or about August 2, 2019, and August 8, 2019, Allen was told to take leave to speak with the Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") office.
(Ex. X (email regarding "Confirmation of Allegations for Docket Number 9D1S1901216) at PDF Page 2, Doc. 57-26.)
On August 12, 2019, a Notice of Termination During Probationary Period, signed by McDonnell, was issued to Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 96.) On August 15, 2019, Plaintiff was permitted to resign in lieu of termination, and Plaintiff submitted his resignation. (Id. ¶ 101.) Several months later, on October 7, 2019, Plaintiff's attorney submitted his formal EEO complaint on his behalf. (Id. ¶ 133.)
On February 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") in this Court alleging: (1) a hostile work environment claim in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act on the basis of race; (2) retaliation in violation of Title VII of VII of the Civil Rights Act for his attempts to report the Air Force's violations to the EEO; and (3) violation of the Rehabilitation Act for [*12]  failure to accommodate his diabetes disability. (FAC ¶¶ 38-60, Doc. 62.)
As support for his hostile work environment claim, Plaintiff offers several instances of alleged discrimination. For example, Plaintiff notes that he was not permitted to eat lunch with Kemella Sillah, a fellow black employee. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 148, Doc. 68-2.) Plaintiff also contends that "[s]tacking" of infractions in a minority employee's 971 folder "is a common way that supervisors at the Clinic move to discipline and terminate minority employees and other employees whom they do not like." (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 150, Doc. 68-2.) As support, Plaintiff cites to the deposition of Janella Anne Rivers, a union representative. (Id. (citing "Rivers Dep. 253:14-23).) In the cited testimony, Rivers testified: "Yes. The point of stacking is to create a case on an employee on every little thing that they allegedly do so that you can start a case to move for termination — not just termination, disciplinary action." (Doc. 67-5 at 253:19-23.) Moreover, Plaintiff's union representative, Stewart, testified that in her experience with the grievance process as president of American Federation [*13]  of Government Employees Local Union 2429, a disproportionate number of the probationary employees that are terminated at LA AFB within a few months of employment are black, and that they are subject to unnecessary disciplinary actions to force them out. (See, e.g., Ex. E (Aug. 31, 2021 Roslyn Austin Stewart Depo.) at 116:4-117:25, 127:17-22, Doc. 67-4.)
Defendant now seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's claims. (Mot., Doc. 57.)

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Fortyune v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1079-80 (9th Cir. 2004) ("Summary judgment is appropriate 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'" (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). "A dispute about a material fact is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Freecycle Sunnyvale v. Freecycle Network, 626 F.3d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 2010). A fact is "material" when its resolution "'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'" George v. Morris, 736 F.3d 829, 834 (9th Cir. 2013).
"Where [*14]  the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, that party 'has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case.'" Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., 365 F. Supp. 3d 980, 984 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (quoting C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000)). By contrast, when the moving party would not bear the burden of proof at trial, that party "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000).
"If the moving party satisfies its initial burden of production, the nonmoving party must produce admissible evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists." Bernstein, 365 F. Supp. 3d at 984 (citing Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1102). "If the nonmoving party fails to make this showing, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment." Bernstein, 365 F. Supp. 3d at 984 (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). The non-moving party does not meet this burden by showing "some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Genuine factual issues must exist that "can be resolved only by [*15]  a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Id. at 250.
When ruling on a summary judgment motion, the Court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Lastly, the Court cannot engage in credibility determinations, weighing of evidence, or drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts; these functions are for the jury. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Without specific facts to support the conclusion, a bald assertion of the "ultimate fact" is insufficient. See Schneider v. TRW, Inc., 938 F.2d 986, 990-91 (9th Cir. 1991).

DISCUSSION
Defendant seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiffs' claims asserted in the First Amended Complaint. (Mot., Doc. 57.) The Court addresses Defendant's arguments below.

A. First Cause of Action (Hostile Work Environment)
First, Defendant argues that summary judgment should be entered in its favor because Plaintiff's race-based hostile work environment claim is unexhausted. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, "an employee is required to exhaust his or her administrative remedies by filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." Henry v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 644 F. App'x 787, 788 (9th Cir. 2016). "'Incidents of discrimination not included in an EEOC charge may not be considered by a federal court unless the new claims are like or reasonably [*16]  related to the allegations contained in the EEOC charge.'" Id. (quoting Green v. L.A. Cty. Superintendent of Schs., 883 F.2d 1472, 1475-76 (9th Cir. 1989)). "Title VII does not require that the plaintiff separately exhaust additional claims that are so closely related [to the allegations made in the charge] that agency action would be redundant.'" B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep't, 276 F.3d 1091, 1102 (9th Cir. 2002).
Here, the Court previously rejected Defendant's argument in its June 28, 2021 Order. (Order, Doc. 33.) The Court noted that "Allen's informal complaint indicated he was alleging discrimination based on race, even though his Formal EEO Complaint did not" and that "where the alleged discriminatory remarks possibly indicated animus based on race and gender the disparate treatment Allen complains of here could be plausibly attributed to race, age, and/or disability discrimination." (Id. at 14.) As a result, the Court held that "the question of whether Allen faced race-based discrimination turns on the same facts as the age-and disability-discrimination claims and it is reasonable to expect that an EEOC investigation would have encompassed race-based discrimination." (Id.) None of the evidence that Defendant has proffered changes the Court's conclusion. See B.K.B., 276 F.3d at 1102. Accordingly, the Court declines to grant summary judgment on Plaintiff's [*17]  hostile work environment claim on exhaustion grounds.
Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish that he was subjected to a hostile work environment claim. "To prevail on a hostile work environment claim, [Plaintiff] must establish a pattern of ongoing and persistent harassment severe enough to alter the conditions of employment." Terrell v. Contra Costa Cnty., 232 F. App'x 626, 627 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff must show that his "workplace was both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find offensive or abusive, and one that the victim did perceive to be so." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, where a plaintiff bases the hostile work environment claim on race, as is the case here, Plaintiff must show that the harassment occurred because of race. Id.
Here, "[a]fter reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, [Plaintiff's] hostile work environment evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact that []he was subject to a pattern of ongoing and persistent harassment severe enough to alter the conditions" of his employment at LA AFB and that such harassment was because of his race. Id. On his first day, Plaintiff testified [*18]  that when he attempted to introduce himself to Okamura, who at the time did not know the new MSME was black, told him to keep her door open as she felt safer with it open. See supra p. 3. Plaintiff further alleges that within the first few months of his employment, his non-black supervisors engaged in stacking whereby supervisors at the clinic make numerous entries in a minority employee's 971 folder to build a case for that employee's termination. See supra pp. 5-9. As support, Plaintiff contends that from the very beginning of his employment, his supervisors made complaint entries in his 971 folder that were simply untrue, and often subjected him to meetings regarding those entries. Id. Indeed, Plaintiff contends, based on record evidence, that when he met with his supervisors in May 2019 to address their alleged harassing conduct, they agreed to remove the 971 entries. See supra p. 4. Moreover, Plaintiff has alleged other evidence in support of his hostile work environment claim. For example, Plaintiff alleges that many of the 971 entries were based on restrictions that other non-black employees were not subject to, such as the headphone restrictions or had no basis in policy.  [*19] See supra pp. 4-5. And Plaintiff has provided testimony that his supervisors prevented him from eating with the only other black employee, Ms. Sillah, at the clinic. (Ex. GG (Sept. 8, 2021 Kemella Sillah Depo.) at 147:14-15, Doc. 68-10.)
Based on the evidence in the record, a jury could find, from the perspective of a reasonable person of Plaintiff's race, that Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment based on race especially where other non-white employees were purportedly not subject to similar treatment. See McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1118 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating "that allegations of a racially hostile workplace must be assessed from the perspective of a reasonable person belonging to the racial or ethnic group of the plaintiff"); Reynaga v. Roseburg Forest Prod., 847 F.3d 678, 688 (9th Cir. 2017) (hostile work environment claim based on race sufficiently alleged where, among other things, "the harassing conduct interfered with Efrain's work performance to the extent that it resulted in confrontations with [his supervisor] and led Efrain to register verbal and written complaints with management"). Accordingly, the Court declines to grant summary judgment in favor of Defendant as to the hostile work environment claim.

B. Second Cause of Action (Retaliation)
Defendant also argues that [*20]  Plaintiff's retaliation fails. (See, e.g., Mot. at 20, Doc. 57.) Title VII "prohibits retaliation against an employee engaging in an activity protected by Title VII, such as filing [EEO] complaints or participating in a Title VII proceeding." Lombardi v. Castro, 675 F. App'x 690, 691 (9th Cir. 2017). The Ninth Circuit has held that "[t]here is a three-step burden-shifting framework for considering a grant of summary judgment in an employment retaliation case." Id. "To establish a triable issue, the plaintiff first must prove a prima facie case by showing (1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action[,] and (3) a causal link between the two." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The third factor requires Plaintiff to show "but-for causation." Id. Second, if the plaintiff proves their prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the defendant to present a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action." Id. "Third, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to 'demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason advanced by the employer was a pretext.'" Id. "'Only then does the case proceed beyond the summary judgment stage." Id.
As an initial matter, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a prima [*21]  facie case of retaliation. Plaintiff alleged that he engaged in numerous protected activities, such as his communication to his supervisors that he wished to visit the EEO office regarding their alleged harassment prior to May 22, 2019, his informal complaints to his supervisors during the May 22, 2019 meeting, his pursuit of EEO remedies prior to July 24, 2019, and his visit to the EEO office to execute a Record of Initial Contact on July 24, 2019. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶¶ 83-84, Doc. 68-2); see, e.g., Trent v. Valley Elec. Ass'n Inc., 41 F.3d 524, 526 (9th Cir. 1994) ("We have held that when an employee protests the actions of a supervisor such opposition is a 'protected activity.'"). Plaintiff has also cited to evidence in the record establishing, among other things, Defendant's knowledge of Plaintiff's pursuit of EEO remedies and his visit to the EEO Office during the week of July 24, 2019. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 76, 84.) Indeed, in a July 23, 2019 email, McDonnell illustrated that he was aware that Plaintiff intended to visit the EEO Office that week. (Ex. C to the Declaration of Kiska Cureton at PDF Page 3, Doc. 57-62.) And four days after Plaintiff submitted his informal complaint on August 8, 2019 to the EEO, he received a notice [*22]  of termination signed by McDonnell. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶¶ 118, 120, Doc. 68-2.) Based on the above evidence, Plaintiff has sufficiently proffered evicence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.
Moreover, although Defendant has provided legitimate reasons for termination, Plaintiff has demonstrated material issues of fact as to whether those reasons are mere pretext. Lombardi, 675 F. App'x at 691. For example, Defendant contends that his supervisors had legitimate reasons for terminating him, as evidenced by the 971 entries made in his folder regarding the wearing of headphones, not keeping his cubicle door open, and the alleged sexual harassment that occurred. However, Plaintiff has proffered evidence that other employees are not subject to similar complaints, did not have similar restrictions, and that some of the alleged citations in his 971 folder did not occur at all. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that the conduct underlying the sexual harassment charge did not occur, and was brought against him in retaliation for his harassment complaints. Given these disputed issues of material fact, Plaintiff has sufficiently proffered that Defendant's reasons were mere pretext and thus summary judgment [*23]  is improper.

C. Third Cause of Action (Rehabilitation Act Failure to Accommodate Claim)
Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act fails. (See, e.g., Mot. at 22-23, Doc. 57.) In determining whether an employee has stated a claim for failure to accommodate under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, courts look to the "substantive standards of liability under the ADA." Blanchard v. LaHood, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166057, 2010 WL 11508016, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2010), aff'd, 461 F. App'x 542 (9th Cir. 2011). "Under the ADA, an employer 'discriminates' against an employee by 'not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.'" Id. If "an employee requests accommodation . . . , the employer must engage in an interactive process to find a reasonable accommodation." Id. The interactive process for finding an accommodation may also "be triggered by the employer's recognition of the need for such an accommodation, even if the employee does not specifically make the request." Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001). However, this exception applies "only when the employer '(1) knows that the employee [*24]  has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation.'" Id.
Here, Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact as to whether Defendant failed to accommodate his disability. There is no dispute that Plaintiff suffers from diabetes, or that Plaintiff needed enough time to eat lunch to regulate his blood sugar because of his medical disability. Although heavily disputed by Defendant, Plaintiff testified that he informed his supervisors of his disability during the first few weeks of his employment when he requested that he needed a full lunch hour to accommodate his disability. (D's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement ¶ 19, Doc. 68-2; Ex. B (Allen Depo. Vol. 1) at 191:12-20, Doc. 67-1.) Plaintiff testified that even though he eventually received a full lunch hour after union involvement, his work-related tasks caused him to have a shortened lunch hour. (Ex. B (Oct. 27, 2021 William Allen Depo.) at 195:23-196:3), Doc. 57-4.) Plaintiff further contends that he raised the issue with his supervisors [*25]  on more than one occasion but was denied a flexible lunch hour accommodation on the grounds that the office needed to be covered. (Id. 194:12-196:16.) Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could find that Defendant failed to accommodate Plaintiff's disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion.
DATED: August 18, 2022
