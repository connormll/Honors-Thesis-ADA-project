Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This matter was referred by United States District Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore, for full pre-trial management, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and (B). (Docket Entry #48). In this action, Plaintiff Kevin Gordon ("Plaintiff," "Gordon"), an inmate in the Texas prison system, brings civil rights and discrimination claims alleging inadequate and discriminatory medical treatment during his incarceration. Defendants are the Texas Department of Criminal Justice ("TDCJ"); Brad Livingston ("Livingston"), in his official capacity as Executive Director of the TDCJ; the University of Texas Medical Branch ("UTMB"); and Owen Murray ("Murray"), in his official capacity as Executive Director of UTMB (collectively, "Defendants").
Pending before the court are two motions for summary judgment, one filed by TDCJ and Livingston, and the other by UTMB and Murray. (TDCJ's Motion for Summary Judgment ["TDCJ's Motion"], Docket Entry #119; UTMB's Motion for Summary Judgment ["UTMB's Motion"], Docket Entry #121). Plaintiff filed a response to these motions, [*3]  and Defendants replied. (Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment ["Plaintiff's Response"], Docket Entry #129; TDCJ's Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Motions for Summary Judgment ["TDCJ's Reply"], Docket Entry #130; UTMB and Murray's Reply to Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment ["UTMB's Reply"], Docket Entry #132). Recently, Defendants filed a supplement to their summary judgment motions, and Plaintiff responded. (Defendants' Joint Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment ["Defendants' Supplement"], Docket Entry #142; Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motion for Leave to File Summary Judgment Motion ["Plaintiff's Response to Supplement"], Docket Entry #145). After considering the pleadings, the evidence submitted, and the applicable law, it is RECOMMENDED that TDCJ's motion for summary judgment and UTMB's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, as set out in this memorandum.

Background
Plaintiff Kevin Gordon is a 25-year-old man who suffers from an array of mental health impairments, including mental retardation, bi-polar disorder, and a personality disorder. (Second Amended Complaint [*4]  ["Complaint"], Docket Entry #95, at 1-3; TDCJ's Motion at 1-2; UTMB's Motion at 3-5). Medical records reveal that he has been treated for these disorders from the age of 8 years old. (UTMB's Motion at Exhibit ["Ex."] B; Ex. H, p. 405). His symptoms include suicidal tendencies, self-mutilation, auditory hallucinations, and violent and destructive behavior. (Id. at Ex. B; Ex. F, pp. 55-112; Ex. H, p. 405). On April 22, 2005, Gordon was sentenced to serve a seven-year term in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice following a conviction for attempted sexual assault. (TDCJ's Reply at Ex. M). Gordon began his sentence on April 27, 2005, at the Byrd Unit in Huntsville, Texas. (UTMB's Motion at 3 and Ex. B). Two days later, however, he was moved to the Skyview Unit ("Skyview"), after he threatened to kill himself with a razor. (Id.). Skyview, which is located in Rusk, Texas, is a psychiatric treatment facility. (UTMB's Reply at 3 and n.2; Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 9). On May 6, 2005, Gordon was released from Skyview and sent to the Hodge Unit ("Hodge"), which is adjacent to Skyview. At Hodge, Gordon was evaluated and then placed in the Mentally Retarded Offender Program ("MROP"), which [*5]  is specifically designed for mentally retarded prisoners. (TDCJ's Motion at 6 and Ex. B; UTMB's Motion at 3 and Ex. B; Plaintiff's Response at 4; UTMB's Reply at 5).
Following his arrival at Hodge, Gordon was disciplined on several occasions for what TDCJ officials term "antisocial behavior," such as propositioning female employees, making lewd sexual gestures and comments, refusing to obey orders, damaging and destroying TDCJ property, and acting in an aggressive or violent manner. (UTMB's Motion at Ex. B; see, e.g., Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 9, pp. 892-96, 898, 902-06, 912-13, 985-1003, 1028-29, 1079-98). As a result of these behaviors, Gordon was soon placed in the MROP Structured Program, a program purportedly designed "to teach and encourage clients with severe and/or lengthy disciplinary problems to function within the TDCJ rules and regulations." (TDCJ's Motion at 8 and Ex. C; UTMB's Motion at Ex. B; Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 4). However, Gordon continued to engage in undesirable behavior, as detailed in the following quote from the affidavit of Val Bass ("Bass"), Director of the MROP:
Refusing to obey an order, sexual misconduct, threatening an officer, threatening UTMB staff [*6]  members, [being] out of place, creating a disturbance, assaulting an officer, flooding his cell [by intentionally clogging the toilet], possession of unauthorized drugs, damaging/destroying state property, possession of contraband, and defeating mechanical restraints.
(UTMB's Motion at Ex. B; see id. at Ex. I-K; Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 9). As a result of his consistent harmful and threatening behavior, Gordon was placed in administrative segregation, where he remains, to date. (Plaintiff's Response at 11 and Ex. 3 and 7). He is, however, periodically admitted into Skyview for psychiatric treatment, usually because of threats or attempts at suicide. (See, e.g., UTMB's Motion at Ex. F, pp. 148; Ex. H, pp. 390-92, 403-05, 737-40; Ex. I).
Throughout his incarceration, Gordon's mental health treatment, including his medication regimen, has been managed by a division of UTMB. (Complaint at 3-5; TDCJ's Motion at 1-2 and n.1; UTMB's Motion at 3-5). From the outset, Defendants have received complaints about the quality of care Plaintiff is receiving. (UTMB's Motion at Ex. A-C, F-G). These complaints are typically generated by Gordon's mother, Rhonda Taylor ("Taylor"). (Id.). In 2004, Taylor [*7]  was named as the guardian of Gordon's person, and, in that capacity, she is authorized to make decisions regarding his medical care. (Id.; Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 1). Taylor's complaints range from comments about her son's medication to protests about the therapeutic opportunities available in the prison system. (UTMB's Motion at Ex. A-C, F-G). Taylor consistently claims that Gordon would not present such a discipline problem if he were receiving proper medical care. (Id.). In addition to Taylor's allegations, Gordon himself has filed grievances with TDCJ, some of which refer to his medical treatment and some of which challenge his medication regimen. (See TDCJ's Motion at 15 [citing Docket Entry #77, at Ex. C]).
On August 30, 2006, Taylor, proceeding pro se on behalf of her son, filed an action against Brad Livingston, as Executive Director of the TDCJ. (Original Complaint, Docket #1, at 1-2). While it is unclear, it appears from the language of the complaint that she also intended to name TDCJ and UTMB as defendants to that action. (See id.; Original Answer, Docket Entry #10, at 1). In her complaint, Taylor sought compensatory damages for "discriminatory treatment" under the Rehabilitation [*8]  Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Original Complaint at 1-2). On April 4, 2007, attorney John Hall ("Hall") was appointed to represent Plaintiff in "the interests of justice." (Order Appointing Counsel, Docket Entry #38). But, on September 18, 2007, the court dismissed the action because, as guardian of Gordon's person, rather than guardian of his estate, Taylor lacks standing to litigate on his behalf. (Memorandum and Recommendation, Docket Entry #69, at 5-10; Order Adopting Memorandum and Recommendation, Docket Entry #70). On December 3, 2007, Hall filed an amended complaint, with Gordon as Plaintiff, and, on April 30, 2008, he amended that filing. (Plaintiff's First Amended and Second Amended Complaints, Docket Entries #76, #95).
In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory damages, for violations of federal law. (Complaint at 2, 9-10). In his first cause of action, Gordon claims that Defendants are liable to him under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 ("§ 1983"), for the violation of his right "to be free from cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution." (Complaint at 7). He contends that he and other [*9]  mentally ill prisoners do not receive "adequate mental health treatment and therapeutic housing options necessary to treat and to prevent worsening of their mental illness." (Id.). The Complaint also alleges that Defendants "impose periods of prolonged isolated confinement" on him and other mentally ill prisoners "which lead[s] to the deterioration of their mental health." (Id.). In his second cause of action, Gordon claims that Defendants have discriminated against him because of his mental disability in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. (Id. at 7-9). In particular, he complains that Defendants discriminate against mentally ill prisoners in the following conduct: (i) failing to provide alternatives to disciplinary actions that tend to exacerbate their illnesses; (ii) failing to provide "intermediate and long-term in-patient facilities suitable for treatment and housing of persons with mental disabilities"; (iii) failing to dispense the medication best suited to the individual; (iv) punishing mentally ill prisoners for conduct that is merely a product of their illness; and (v) limiting or excluding mentally ill prisoners [*10]  from therapeutic programs because of their disability, rather than making reasonable accommodations. (Id. at 8). Plaintiff argues, as well, that some or all of this allegedly discriminatory conduct also violates his Eighth Amendment rights. (See Plaintiff's Response at 14-16).
In their motions for summary judgment, Defendants argue that, under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, they are immune from suit on some or all of Gordon's claims. (TDCJ's Motion at 4-6; UTMB's Motion at 6-14). In the alternative, they argue that none of Plaintiff's constitutional rights has been violated, and that there has been no discrimination against Gordon because of his disability. (TDCJ's Motion at 3; UTMB's Motion at 14-17). Further, they claim that the current Complaint does not satisfy the Prison Litigation Reform Act (the "PLRA"), because (i) Gordon has neither pleaded nor proved that he suffered any physical injuries as a result of Defendants' actions, and (ii) because he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (TDCJ's Motion at 3, 15; UTMB's Motion at 17-24). UTMB and Murray also contend that Plaintiff has abandoned his § 1983 claims. (UTMB's Reply at 6). Finally, Defendants argue that they recently offered, as an accommodation, to transfer Gordon [*11]  to another facility, but Rhonda Taylor refused this offer on her son's behalf, rendering any remaining issues moot. (Defendants' Supplement at 3-4).
Having reviewed the pleadings, the evidence submitted, and the applicable law, the court recommends that TDCJ's motion for summary judgment and UTMB's motion for summary judgment be granted, in part, and denied, in part. It is recommended that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's § 1983 claims, on the ground that they have been abandoned. It is also recommended that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's claims against TDCJ and UTMB for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act, on Eleventh Amendment grounds. However, it is recommended that summary judgment be denied on the following remaining claims, because there are genuine issues of material fact: (i) Plaintiff's claims against any defendant for any type of relief under the Rehabilitation Act; (ii) Plaintiff's claims against Livingston and Murray for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA; and (iii) Plaintiff's claims against any defendant for monetary damages under the ADA, which he may recover if he proves a violation of his constitutional rights.

Standard [*12]  of Review
Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists, and the moving parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Under Rule 56(c), the moving parties "bear[] the initial burden of 'informing the district court of the basis for [their] motion[s], and identifying those portions of [the record] which [they] believe[] demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.'" Taita Chem. Co. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., 246 F.3d 377, 385 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)); see Malacara v. Garber, 353 F.3d 393, 404 (5th Cir. 2003). The parties moving for summary judgment "'must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,' but 'need not negate the elements of the non movant's case.'" Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)); see Wallace v. Texas Tech Univ., 80 F.3d 1042, 1047 (5th Cir. 1996). If the moving parties fail to meet their initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied, regardless of the non-movant's response. See Kee v. City of Rowlett, 247 F.3d 206, 210 (5th Cir. 2001); Little, 37 F.3d at 1075.
When the moving parties have met their Rule 56 burden, the non-moving party cannot survive a motion for summary judgment merely by resting on the allegations in his pleadings. See Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, 401 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir. 2005); McCallum Highlands, Ltd. v. Washington Capital Dus, Inc., 66 F.3d 89, 92 (5th Cir. 1995). Instead, he "must 'go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075); see Izen v. Catalina, 398 F.3d 363, 366 (5th Cir. 2005); Taita Chem. Co., 246 F.3d at 385. Further, he "'must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.'" [*13]  Id. (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 87 (1986)); see Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540. To meet its burden, the non-moving party must present "significant probative" evidence indicating that there are issues of fact remaining for trial. See Hamilton v. Segue Software Inc., 232 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2000); Conkling v. Turner, 18 F.3d 1285, 1295 (5th Cir. 1994). In deciding a summary judgment motion, "[t]he evidence of the non movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [his] favor." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see Taita Chem. Co., 246 F.3d at 385.

Discussion

Claims under § 1983
Before reaching the substance of the parties' arguments, it is easy to see that some of Plaintiff's claims are quickly disposed of, particularly, those under § 1983. Plaintiff alleges, under § 1983, that Defendants have violated his constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. (Complaint at 7 [citing U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV]). He claims specifically that these rights have been violated because Defendants have failed to provide "adequate mental health treatment and therapeutic housing options," and because they use administrative segregation as a disciplinary tool, even though that placement contributes to the deterioration of his mental health. (Id.). In the motions for summary judgment, Defendants make extensive arguments to refute Gordon's § 1983 claims as a matter of law. (TDCJ's Motion at 4; UTMB's Motion at 6-8). In his response to these [*14]  motions, however, Plaintiff does not address these arguments at all. (See Plaintiff's Response at 5-22). In fact, Plaintiff does not raise any evidence or make any argument in support of his § 1983 claims. (See id.). In their reply, UTMB and Murray point out this neglect. (UTMB's Reply at 6). Again, however, Plaintiff made no attempt to address his civil rights claims. Instead, he addresses only the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. A party responding to a competent motion for summary judgment cannot rest on his pleadings, but must attempt to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact. See Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075); Reyna, 401 F.3d at 349-50. If he does not, any claims that are not briefed are generally deemed abandoned. See United States v. Charles, 469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir. 2006); Brazos Valley Coalition for Life, Inc. v. City of Bryan, 421 F.3d 314, 322 n.8 (5th Cir. 2005); DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, 420 F.3d 521, 525-26 (5th Cir. 2005). In this case, it appears that Plaintiff has abandoned his first cause of action in its entirety. See Brazos Valley Coalition for Life, Inc., 421 F.3d at 322 n.8. As a consequence, Plaintiff should be considered to be proceeding solely on his claim for violations of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. (See Complaint at 7-9).

Claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Gordon claims that Defendants' actions have violated his rights as a disabled prisoner under § 504 of the [*15]  Rehabilitation Act and under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Plaintiff's Response at 5-16). In relevant part, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides, as follows:
No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.
29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Similarly, Title II of the ADA provides, in pertinent part:
Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
42 U.S.C. § 12132. As a threshold matter, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that "the plain text of Title II of the ADA unambiguously extends to state prison inmates" and to conditions in "state prisons." See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 154; Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 213, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998). For that reason, the substance [*16]  of Plaintiff's claim is ripe for scrutiny. But before reaching the merits of Gordon's disability discrimination claims, the court must consider Defendants' contention that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.

Eleventh Amendment Immunity
The Eleventh Amendment states, as follows:
The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.
U.S. Const. amend. XI. Unless expressly waived, then, the Eleventh Amendment does bar an action by a citizen of a state against his own state and state agencies. See Nelson v. University of Tex. at Dallas, 535 F.3d 318, 320 (5th Cir. 2008); Martinez v. Texas Dep't of Crim. Justice, 300 F.3d 567, 574 (5th Cir. 2002). Generally, the Eleventh Amendment also precludes recovery from any state employee who is sued in his official capacity alone. See Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir. 2001); Turner v. Houston Mun. Fire & Police Civil Serv. Bd., 229 F.3d 478, 482 n.14 (5th Cir. 2000); Aguilar v. Texas Dep't of Crim. Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1054 (5th Cir. 1998). If these were the only governing principles, Defendants would indeed be immune from all of Plaintiff's claims. See Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996); Vogt v. Board of Comm'rs, Orleans Levee Dist., 294 F.3d 684, 688 (5th Cir. 2002).
There are, however, exceptions to the rule of immunity, and those exceptions will allow Gordon to proceed on a few of his allegations. See id. (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1980)). For instance, the Fifth Circuit has held that a state implicitly waives immunity from suit under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, for any activity for which it accepts federal funds.1 See Hurst v. Texas Dep't of Assistive & Rehab. Servs., 482 F.3d 809, 810-14 (5th Cir. 2007); Miller v. Texas Tech Univ. Health Sci. Ctr., 421 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir. 2005). It is undisputed [*17]  that both TDCJ and UTMB are agents of the state, and that they accept federal funds. (Complaint at 8; TDCJ's Motion at 6; UTMB's Motion at 10). For these reasons, those agencies, as well as Livingston and Murray in their official capacities, have implicitly waived immunity from claims brought under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Hurst, 482 F.3d at 810-14; Miller, 421 F.3d at 347; see also McIntosh v. Partridge, 540 F.3d 315, 321 n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (for Eleventh Amendment purposes, state agencies, and their officers sued in their official capacities, are considered to be the "state"). Also, in this case, all of the defendants have explicitly waived immunity to Plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act, by declaring that they "do[] not dispute this Court's jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act." (TDCJ's Motion at 6; UTMB's Motion at 10). Here, then, none of the defendants is immune from any of Plaintiff's claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Hurst, 482 F.3d at 810-14; Miller, 421 F.3d at 347.
In another exception to the rule of immunity, the Fifth Circuit has recognized that state employees who are being sued in their official capacities can be liable for relief that is "declaratory or injunctive in nature and prospective in effect." Aguilar, 160 F.3d at 1054 (citing Saltz v. Tennessee Dep't of Employment Sec., 976 F.2d 966, 968 (5th Cir. 1992)). Here, Gordon seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from Livingston [*18]  and Murray, whom he has sued as officers of TDCJ and UTMB, respectively. (Complaint at 1, 9-11). Because those individual Defendants have been sued solely in their official capacities, they are not immune from Gordon's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under either the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA. See Aguilar, 160 F.3d at 1054 (citing Saltz, 976 F.2d at 968). It is clear, then, that Plaintiff can proceed on any of his claims against Livingston and Murray for declaratory and injunctive relief.
A third exception permits the recovery of monetary damages from a state, or a state actor, under Title II of the ADA so long as the challenged conduct violated an individual's constitutional rights. See United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157-59, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006). Although Plaintiff has abandoned his cause of action under § 1983, he may still show that the actions that are violative of the ADA also rise to the level of constitutional violations. See id. If he is successful in making that showing, he can avoid the Eleventh Amendment bar and seek monetary damages from all Defendants under the ADA. See id. at 158.
Put simply, because of three distinct exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity, Gordon may proceed on the following claims: (i) those claims against any defendant for any type of relief under the Rehabilitation Act; (ii) those claims [*19]  against Livingston and Murray for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA; and (iii) those claims against any defendant for compensatory relief under the ADA, provided he can show that the challenged conduct also violated his constitutional rights. See Georgia, 546 U.S. at 158; Hurst, 482 F.3d at 810-14; Miller, 421 F.3d at 347; Aguilar, 160 F.3d at 1054. On the other hand, because there is no applicable exception, Plaintiff cannot proceed on his claims against TDCJ and UTMB for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA. See Nelson, 535 F.3d at 320; Martinez, 300 F.3d at 574. For these reasons, on the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity, judgment is warranted only on Gordon's claims against TDCJ and UTMB for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA.

The Prison Litigation Reform Act
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because he did not comply with the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The PLRA, which governs claims filed by prisoners and involving prison conditions, provides, in part:
No Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.
42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). As a general rule, "the application of this provision turns on the relief sought by a prisoner, and . . [*20]  . prevents prisoners from seeking compensatory damages for violations of federal law where no physical injury is alleged." Mayfield v. Texas Dep't of Crim. Justice, 529 F.3d 599, 605 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Geiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir. 2005)). For purposes of the PLRA, a "physical injury" must be "'more than de minimus [sic], but need not be significant.'" Harper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997)). On the other hand, the Fifth Circuit has recognized that a prisoner who has not alleged a physical injury may, nevertheless, "pursue punitive or nominal damages based upon a violation of his constitutional rights." Mayfield, 529 F.3d at 606 (citing Hutchins v. McDaniels, 512 F.3d 193, 197-98 (5th Cir. 2007)); accord Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 327 n.24 (5th Cir. 2009). In this case, Gordon claims to have suffered from a variety of physical injuries, as follows:
The poor treatment and insufficient facilities provided by Defendants have resulted in the exacerbation of his mental conditions and their symptoms. These symptoms include conduct which puts Plaintiff in conflict with the people around him . . . resulting in physical confrontations and physical restraints which have caused multiple physical injuries to Plaintiff, including bruises, cuts, and [injuries due to the] application of chemical agents by security officers.
(Complaint at 6). In addition, he alleges that Defendants' "improper" and "inadequate" treatment,
has physically affected the chemical balance [*21]  in Plaintiff's brain, causing the exacerbation of his illness and constituting physical injury.
(Id.). While there is scant evidence that Gordon has been physically injured while in prison,2 the Fifth Circuit has consistently deemed the PLRA satisfied by allegations of physical injury, rather than proof. See Mayfield, 529 F.3d at 605; Geiger, 404 F.3d at 375. And, in this instance, the physical injuries Gordon alleges are arguably more than de minimis. See Harper, 174 F.3d at 719; Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193. Further, Fifth Circuit precedent allows a plaintiff to recover nominal or punitive damages, even absent a physical injury, if he shows that his constitutional rights were violated. See Sossamon, 560 F.3d at 327 n.24; Mayfield, 529 F.3d at 606. Consequently, the court is persuaded that Plaintiff's claims are sufficient under the provision of the PLRA that requires the showing of a physical injury.
But TDCJ also argues that the PLRA precludes Gordon's claim because he has not exhausted his administrative remedies. It is true that the relevant portion of the PLRA provides that:
No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
42 U.S.C. § 1997(e) [*22] . However, the Fifth Circuit has recognized exceptions to this exhaustion requirement in certain instances in which a prisoner is unable to access the grievance procedure appropriately. See Days v. Johnson, 322 F.3d 863, 867 (5th Cir. 2003); Underwood v. Wilson, 151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 1998). In this case, it is undisputed that Gordon suffers from multiple mental impairments, including mental retardation. (Complaint at 3-5; TDCJ's Motion at 1-2; UTMB's Motion at 3-5). As TDCJ has conceded, there is evidence that Gordon followed the prison grievance procedure to some extent, because he filed Step 1 grievances. (See TDCJ's Motion at 15 [citing Docket Entry #77, Ex. C]). There is also evidence that, while attempts were made by TDCJ officials to "encourage" Gordon to complete its procedures by filing Step 2 grievances, they were unsuccessful because Plaintiff was arguably unable to understand the procedure beyond the initial grievance step. (See Plaintiff's Response at 21-22 [citing Docket Entry #96, Ex. A, B]). Given these circumstances, even though he did not complete the prison grievance procedure, Gordon may proceed under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. See Days, 322 F.3d at 867; Underwood, 151 F.3d at 295.

The Discrimination Claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA
As a general rule, the standards used to analyze claims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those used to analyze claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. See Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Trans., 391 F.3d 669, 676 (5th Cir. 2004); Delano-Pyle v. Victoria County, Tex., 302 F.3d 567, 574 (5th Cir. 2002); Hainze v. Richards, 207 F.3d 795, 799 (5th Cir. 2000); Lottinger v. Shell Oil Co., 143 F. Supp. 2d 743, 752 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (Crone, J.). In particular, both Acts require a showing that a party has suffered discrimination because of a disability. See Melton, 391 F.3d at 671. To state a claim under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must show (i) that he is a qualified individual; (ii) who was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities of a public entity; and (iii) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of his disability. See Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 428 (5th Cir. 1997). In a similar manner, to state a claim under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show (i) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (ii) that the program or facility received federal funding; and (iii) that he was adversely treated solely as a result of the [*23]  disability. See Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1390. Both Acts define the word "disability" as a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual." 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). However, "[m]erely having an impairment does not make one disabled." Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 194, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002). Instead, a claimant must also show that "[his] impairment limits a major life activity." Id. Major life activities include caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2. Whether a person is substantially limited in a major life activity must be determined on a case-by-case basis. See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 481, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999). "If a person is taking measures to correct for, or mitigate, a physical or mental impairment, the effects of those measures-both positive and negative-must be taken into account when judging whether that person is 'substantially limited' in a major life activity and thus 'disabled'" Id. at 482.
In this case, there is no genuine dispute that Gordon is a qualified individual who suffers from a disability. (See TDCJ's Motion at 7; Plaintiff's Response at 8). He has serious mental impairments, including mental retardation and bi-polar disorder, that consistently affect his ability to care for [*24]  himself and to conduct himself in a proper manner. (Complaint at 3-5; TDCJ's Motion at 1-2; UTMB's Motion at 3-5). The record is replete, for example, with evidence of Gordon's aggressive and destructive conduct, his refusal to take, or "hoarding" his medication, self-mutilation, and attempts at suicide. (See UTMB's Motion at Ex. F, pp. 148, 183, 189, 192; Ex. H, pp. 390-92, 403-05, 737-40; Ex. I). It is also undisputed that TDCJ and UTMB receive federal funding. (See Complaint at 8; TDCJ's Motion at 6; UTMB's Motion at 10). Under these circumstances, to establish a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA, Gordon need only show that Defendants discriminated against him, because of his disability, by failing to afford him the same level of care that is given to prisoners who are not similarly disabled. See Lighthorn, 118 F.3d at 428, Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1390. On this issue, the Supreme Court has recognized the following:
it is quite plausible that the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate [a prisoner's] disability-related needs in such fundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and virtually all other prison programs [may constitute] "'exclu[sion] from participation in or . . . den[ial [*25]  of] the benefits of' the prison's 'services, programs, or activities.'"
Georgia, 546 U.S. at 157 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12132). Further, Gordon may show that the same actions that violate his rights under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA also rise to the level of a violation of his constitutional rights. See Easter v. Powell, 467 F.3d 459, 463 (5th Cir. 2006). It is well settled that the denial of medical or mental health care needs in the prison context may be actionable under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See id. In Easter, the Fifth Circuit held that, "[a]lthough the Eighth Amendment 'does not, by its precise words, mandate a certain level of medical care for prisoners[,]' the Supreme Court has interpreted it as imposing a duty on prison officials to 'ensure that inmates receive adequate . . . medical care.'" Id. (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)).
In their motions for summary judgment, Defendants make the following arguments:
[S]ince his incarceration, Plaintiff has been under the constant care and supervision of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and other health care professionals. He has participated in individual and group therapies. Plaintiff has also been prescribed numerous psychotropic and other medications. [Plaintiff] is often non-compliant with his physicians' orders regarding his medications. Despite the care [*26]  and medications, Plaintiff continues to act out behaviorally, and because of the security risk he poses to himself and others at the prison unit, he has been moved to the MROP [Mentally Retarded Offender Program] Structured Program, and has been classified as administrative segregation.
(TDCJ's Motion at 2-3; accord UTMB's Motion at 4-5). In addition to that characterization, UTMB makes the following claim:
Furthermore, it is clear from the extensive medical records and affidavits of UTMB staff that Ms. Taylor, Gordon's mother, has contributed tremendously to the poor behavior exhibited by Gordon. Ms. Taylor has a history of threatening Gordon's medical providers, interfering with his treatment, and wreaking havoc wherever Gordon is located.
(UTMB's Motion at 4-5). To that, UTMB adds, "[d]espite Ms. Taylor's continued interference, professionals in numerous settings have and continue to try and help Gordon." (Id. at 5). Further, UTMB points out that, to the extent Plaintiff is suggesting that "adequate" medication would help him maintain self-discipline, "it is not ethical or within the sound medical treatment duties for doctors to prescribe medication to control prisoner conduct." (Id.). To [*27]  support their arguments, Defendants have submitted evidence that Gordon is offered the proper treatment for his mental disabilities, and that any alleged inadequacies are the direct result of his behavior. (See, e.g., TDCJ's Motion at Ex. H; UTMB's Motion at Ex. S, I, and K; Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 4, 9). For example, there is evidence that Gordon sometimes refuses to take his prescribed medication, and that he has "hoarded" his medication, only to have it discovered days later piled in his cell. (UTMB's Motion at Ex. F, pp. 183, 189, 192). There is also evidence that Gordon's placement in administrative segregation results because his conduct leaves the prison with no alternative. (See TDCJ's Motion at 9-10 and Ex. D, E). Defendants have also shown that Gordon receives regular evaluations by mental health professionals, and that he is provided with regular medication, counseling, and other treatment, despite being housed in administrative segregation. (See, e.g., UTMB's Motion at Ex. A-C, H-J). Further, there is no dispute that Gordon is in the MROP program, which is specifically designed for mentally retarded individuals. (TDCJ's Motion at 8 and Ex. B). Within the MROP, Gordon [*28]  belongs to the MROP's Structured Program. (Id. at 8). According to the UTMB MROP Manual, "the purpose of the Structured Program is to teach clients with severe and/or lengthy disciplinary problems to function within the TDCJ rules and regulations." (Id. at Ex. C). The manual further explains that "[t]he final goal of the Structured Program is to re-integrate clients back into the less restrictive environment of the general MROP population." (Id.).
Clearly, there is evidence that Gordon receives significant mental health care within the prison system. Plaintiff argues, however, that the treatment he receives is wholly insufficient. For example, he claims that he is prescribed the wrong medications, and that, at the least, he should be supervised to ensure that he takes the medicine that has been prescribed for him. (Complaint at 9-10). He also claims that his placement in administrative segregation only serves to exacerbate his illness, and does nothing to help him because his behavior is the result of inadequate medical treatment. (Id. at 2-7). He contends that he should be removed from administrative segregation, and placed, instead, in "long-term in-patient care at a psychiatric hospital" or other [*29]  therapeutic setting. (Id. at 5). He alleges specifically that placement in the Medically Recommended Intensive Supervision ("MRIS") program would enable him to receive treatment and "long-term care in a mental health facility." (Id. at 6). Overall, Gordon accuses Defendants of "continually and persistently ignor[ing] his serious mental health needs" and of being deliberately indifferent "to those needs." (Id. at 1-2; see Plaintiff's Response at 7-16).
To support his claims, Plaintiff presents evidence that, while in administrative segregation, he is unable to fully participate in the MROP program. (Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 3, 4). In particular, he points to the deposition testimony of Val Bass, Director of the MROP:
Q I think you testified earlier that the MROP programs that are available are the educational program, the case management/MHL [mental health liason] meetings, vocational programs, group counseling, individual counseling, occupational therapy, chaplain visits, school and work, . . . and psychiatric care. Do you remember that testimony?
A Yes.
(Id. at Ex. 3, pp. 122-23). Gordon also points to Bass's testimony that "his continued behavior, destructive -- self destructive behavior, threatening behavior [*30]  toward others," prevents him from fully participating in the MROP. (Id. at Ex. 3, pp. 125-26). Gordon contends that, because he is held in administrative segregation due to behavior that is symptomatic of his mental disabilities, his disabilities are the reason that he is denied access to the level of care to which he is entitled. (Id. at 7-8 and Ex. 2).
As further support for his claims, Gordon points to evidence that he requires a different type of treatment from that which he currently receives. (Id. at 9-10). In particular, he quotes from the deposition testimony given by Gerald Vallejo, the Clinical Director of the Skyview Unit:
[I]n order to have a chance of significantly improving Mr. Gordon's behavior he needs to engage long term in behavioral modification and counseling/psychotherapy. . . . The generally accepted standard of care for such long term treatment is that it be provided in the least restrictive appropriate setting.
(UTMB's Motion at Ex. A [emphasis added]). Gordon presents evidence that, by definition, the MROP Structured Program is not the "least restrictive . . . setting," but rather "a highly controlled environment." (Plaintiff's Response at Ex. 4; UTMB's Motion at Ex. E). Gordon also [*31]  points to the fact that he continues to exhibit aggressive and harmful behavior as proof that his current treatment is not effective. (Plaintiff's Response at 10 and Ex. 7; UTMB's Motion at Ex. B).
In reply, UTMB and Murray argue simply that "PLAINTIFF IS THE PROBLEM." (UTMB's Reply at 1 [emphasis in original]). Indeed, the recurring theme of Defendants' arguments is that if Gordon is getting less treatment than he needs, it is due to his noncompliant behavior. (TDCJ's Motion at 2-3; UTMB's Motion at 4-5). Although some evidence supports this claim, other evidence supports Plaintiff's contention that, because of his disability, Defendants are not affording him the level of care that is given to other prisoners. (Plaintiff's Response at 6-7). Plaintiff has satisfied his prima facie burden to show that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether Defendants' conduct violates the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. See Lightbourn, 118 F.3d at 428; Chandler, 2 F.3d at 1390. These issues extend to whether any actionable conduct violates the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments, because the failure to provide adequate medical care and, in particular, psychiatric care, can constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. (Plaintiff's Response at 14-16). See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976); Partridge v. Two Unknown Police Officers of the City of Houston, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir. 1986). For these reasons, summary [*32]  judgment is not warranted on Plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.
Recently, Defendants supplemented their motions, advising the court that they offered to transfer Gordon to another facility as an "accommodation." (Defendants' Supplement at 3-4 and Ex. N and O). Defendants offered to place Gordon in the Program for the Aggressive Mentally Ill Offender ("PAMIO"), which they describe as an in-patient treatment facility located in Amarillo, Texas, that is designed specifically for:
offenders with personality disorders with a history of assaultive, predatory, exploitive, or self-directed aggression, as evidenced by their disciplinary records.
(Id. at 3). An alternative offer is to relocate Gordon to the Hughes Unit in Gatesville, Texas, which allows him the opportunity to be closer to his mother, with "the hope that increased visits with his mother might encourage Plaintiff to more actively participate in" his treatment.3 (Id. at 4). Defendants show that, within days of their offer, they received a letter from Taylor purporting to decline the offer for the following reasons:
1. Defendants fail to provide written instructions included in with [their] offer as it reflects the type of [*33]  psychiatric care/services that TDCJ/UTMB would provide to Kevin Gordon upon transfer.
2. Kevin only fits the criteria for aggressive behavior due to the neglect of TDCJ/UTMB. Failure to provide appropriate diagnosis and medications.
3. Fail[ure] to provide a mental health treatment plan to ensure Kevin will receive Kevin will receive the appropriate mental health service/care through TDCJ and UTMB Staff.
(Id. at Ex. O). In response to Defendants' supplement, Plaintiff similarly argues, among other things, that the offer lacks significant details, such as the nature and expected length of the placement, and any showing of how it differs from the care that he is currently receiving. (Plaintiff's Response to Supplement at 1-3). While it is clear that the offer lacks such details, to date, Defendants have not made any clarifications. Further, Defendants do not support their claim that the fact of their offer, which Taylor rejected, renders Plaintiff's claims moot. Under these circumstances, nothing in the supplement leads the court to a different conclusion. In this case, then, genuine issues of material fact remain on whether Defendants are liable for any claim under § 504 of the Rehabilitation [*34]  Act or for monetary damages under Title II of the ADA, as well as whether Livingston and Murray are liable for declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA.
In sum, the court recommends that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's § 1983 claims, on the ground that they have been abandoned. The court also recommends that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's claims against TDCJ and UTMB for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act, on the ground that these agencies are immune from suit. However, because there are issues of material fact, the court recommends that summary judgment be denied on the following claims: (i) Plaintiff's claims against any defendant for any type of relief under the Rehabilitation Act; (ii) Plaintiff's claims against Livingston and Murray for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (iii) Plaintiff's claims against any defendant for monetary damages under the ADA, which he may recover if he proves a violation of his constitutional rights.4

Conclusion
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that TDCJ and Livingston's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, as set [*35]  out in this memorandum.
It is also RECOMMENDED that UTMB and Murray's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, as set out in this memorandum.
The Clerk of the Court shall send copies of the Memorandum and Recommendation to the respective parties, who will then have ten business days to file written objections, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c), General Order 02-13, S.D. Texas. Failure to file written objections within the time period provided will bar an aggrieved party from attacking the factual findings and legal conclusions on appeal.
The original of any written objections shall be filed with the United States District Clerk, P.O. Box 61010, Houston, Texas, 77208; copies of any such objections shall be delivered to the chambers of Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore, Room 9513, and to the chambers of the undersigned, Room 7007.
SIGNED at Houston, Texas, this 18th day of August, 2009.
