Opinion



OPINION AND ORDER
Karen Morey, individually and on behalf of a putative class, filed suit against McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's USA, LLC (collectively, McDonald's), alleging violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq. and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (the Unruh Act), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51 et seq. McDonald's moves to dismiss Morey's complaint for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim for relief. (Dkt. 18.) For the reasons stated herein, McDonald's motion to dismiss is denied.1

BACKGROUND2
McDonald's restaurants offer two types of service—counter service and "drive-thru" service. (Dkt. 1 ¶ 22.) Counter service is available to [*2]  patrons who physically enter the restaurants and place their orders with McDonald's representatives who process payments and serve food. (Id. ¶ 23.) Counter service is available only when the interior of the restaurant is open. (Id. ¶ 24.) Drive-thru service is provided via automobile driveway lanes. (Id. ¶ 25.) Customers remain in their vehicles while relaying their food orders to a McDonald's representative by microphone and receive their food at a series of windows further down the drive-thru lane. (Id.) Unlike counter service, drive-thru service is available during periods of time when the interior of a given restaurant is closed to the public, generally late at night and early in the morning (the late-night hours). (Id. ¶ 26.) McDonald's company policy is to refuse service to any pedestrian who walks up to the drive-thru attempting to order food. (Id. ¶ 35.) Thus, the only way to obtain food during late-night hours is by driving a vehicle through the drive-thru.
Karen Morey suffers from a condition known as macular degeneration, which renders her unable to drive at night. (Id. ¶ 9.) Morey alleges that because "the blind are unable to drive or walk up to the drive-thru, and because [*3]  McDonald's interiors are closed during late-night operating times, the blind are totally barred from independently using or enjoying the goods and services provided by McDonald's late-night drive-thru restaurants." (Id. ¶ 38.)
Specifically, in late 2017, Morey wanted to buy food from the McDonald's restaurant located at 2401 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, which is located approximately three miles from her home. (Id. ¶ 41.) She approached the restaurant and realized the lobby doors were locked. (Id. ¶ 42.) Based on her personal experience living in the area, and her contemporaneous observations at the restaurant, she was aware that the North Tustin McDonald's continued to serve customers through the drive-thru while the counter service in the lobby remained closed. (Id. ¶ 43.) She is also familiar with McDonald's late-night policy, and thus sometimes avoids going to McDonald's during its late-night hours. (Id. ¶ 46.) Further, she has visited the North Tustin McDonald's restaurant multiple times and reasonably expects to visit there again in the future. (Id. ¶ 44.) Morey has felt and continues to feel disappointed and frustrated with her inability to access McDonald's services. [*4]  (Id. ¶ 45.) She contends that McDonald's could make modest accommodations which would allow blind people access to its late-night restaurant services. (Id. ¶ 39.)
Morey seeks declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, as well as certification of two classes—a nationwide and a California class of "all individuals who are unable to drive at nighttime due to visual disability and who have been and/or are being denied access to McDonald's restaurants . . . where McDonald's restaurants' products and services are only offered via drive-thru." (Id. ¶ 48.)

LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) challenges a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff's complaint and draws all reasonable inferences from those facts in the plaintiff's favor. Active Disposal, Inc. v. City of Darien, 635 F.3d 883, 886 (7th Cir. 2011); Dixon v. Page, 291 F.3d 485, 486 (7th Cir. 2002). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint must not only provide the defendant with fair notice of a claim's basis but must also establish that the requested relief is plausible on its face. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The allegations in the complaint must be "enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. At the same time, the plaintiff [*5]  need not plead legal theories; it is the facts that count. Hatmaker v. Mem'l Med. Ctr., 619 F.3d 741, 743 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346, 190 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2014) (per curiam) ("Federal pleading rules call for a short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief; they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.").
The standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is essentially the same as under Rule 12(b)(6): "In considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court must accept the complaint's well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw reasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff's favor." Transit Exp., Inc. v. Ettinger, 246 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2001).

ANALYSIS

I. Standing
Article III standing requires the plaintiff to meet three requirements: "(1) injury in fact, which must be concrete and particularized, and actual and imminent; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct; and (3) redressability." Scherr v. Marriott Intern., Inc., 703 F.3d 1069, 1074 (7th Cir. 2013) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992)). Only the first element is at issue in this case. "[T]o establish injury in fact when seeking prospective injunctive relief, a plaintiff must allege a 'real and immediate' threat of future violations of [her] rights." Id. In the context of the ADA, [*6]  this means that a litigant must "allege past injury under the ADA; show it is reasonable to infer from her complaint that this discriminatory treatment will continue; and show that it is also reasonable to infer, based on the past frequency of her visits and the proximity of the public accommodation to her home, that she intends to return to the public accommodation in the future." Id.
McDonald's argues that Morey lacks standing because she has not alleged that she attempted to obtain service at the drive-thru, so there is no past injury. True, Morey has not alleged that she attempted to obtain service at the drive-thru. She has, however, alleged that she "approached the restaurant and realized the lobby doors were locked" and that, based on her "personal experience" and "observations," she is "familiar[] with McDonald's late-night policy," which allows for service to people in cars, but not those on foot. Morey need not engage in the futile and potentially dangerous gesture of attempting to obtain food, on foot, from the drive-thru when she knows McDonald's policy does not allow it. See Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 892 (8th Cir. 2000) ("[P]laintiffs need not engage in the 'futile gesture' of visiting a building containing known [*7]  barriers that the owner has no intention of remedying[.]"); Access 4 All, Inc. v. Chicago Grande, Inc., No. 06 C 5250, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35304, 2007 WL 1438167, at *6 (N.D. Ill. May 10, 2007) ("[T]he 'futility' doctrine under the ADA potentially permits a disabled plaintiff to sue where he or she actually would use or return to an inaccessible facility if alleged barriers were removed[.]").3 Morey's allegations that she traveled to the North Tustin McDonald's, found the doors locked, and knew she would be refused service if she attempted to walk through the drive-thru are enough to show past injury for purposes of standing under Title III.4
McDonald's also contends that because Morey has not alleged past injury, there is no allegation that past discriminatory treatment will continue unless enjoined. Morey has alleged past injury, so this argument fails.
McDonald's next argues that Morey has not alleged that she intends to return to the North Tustin McDonald's. Although "some day intentions" that a plaintiff intends to return to a public accommodation are insufficient to show injury in fact, a plaintiff's statement that she would visit a place but for ongoing violations is enough. Scherr, 703 F.3d 1074 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 184, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000)). Morey alleges that she has visited the North Tustin McDonald's restaurant multiple times [*8]  and expects to visit there again, that she is familiar with McDonald's late-night policy and sometimes avoids going to McDonald's during its late-night hours, and that she feels disappointed and frustrated because of her inability to access McDonald's services. This is sufficient to establish an intent to return in the ADA context.
In addition to challenging Morey's standing with respect to the North Tustin restaurant, McDonald's also asserts that Morey does not have standing with respect to other McDonald's-brand restaurants. Morey has sued on behalf of two classes, a nationwide class and a California class. Morey agrees that she does not have standing as to all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. But she has standing as to the North Tustin McDonald's, and "[w]hether a plaintiff with standing will be permitted to present not only her own individual claims but also those of a class is not properly a question of standing doctrine but of class action law." Newberg on Class Actions § 2.1 (5th ed.); see also Equal Rights Ctr. v. Kohl's Corp., No. 14 C 8259, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71529, 2015 WL 3505179 (N.D. Ill. June 3, 2015) (finding that where each plaintiff had standing to sue Kohl's with respect to the stores they visited, whether plaintiffs could obtain nationwide prospective relief against all [*9]  Kohl's stores on behalf of a class would be decided at the class certification stage). The court thus defers the question of whether Morey is an appropriate class representative until the class certification stage of this litigation.
Finally, McDonald's asserts that Morey lacks standing under the Unruh Act because she did not allege an actual denial of service and thus cannot seek damages under the Act. As discussed above, Morey has alleged a past injury and has sufficiently alleged standing otherwise.

II. Failure to State a Claim
To prevail on a Title III disability discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show "(1) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) defendant discriminated against her by denying her the full and equal opportunity to enjoy the services defendant provides." Thomas v. Kohl's Corp., No. 17 C 5857, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18218, 2018 WL 704691, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 5, 2018) (citing Kohler v. Bed Bath & Beyond of Ca., LLC, 780 F.3d 1260, 1263 (9th Cir. 2015)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). McDonald's challenges the third element, arguing that Morey has not satisfied the but-for causation test. Specifically, Morey has not shown that she would have been treated differently if she did not have a disability and everything else remained the same. See A.H. by Holzmueller v. Ill. High Sch. Ass'n, 881 F.3d 587, 593 (7th Cir. 2018) (stating that under [*10]  the ADA a plaintiff must "prove that but-for his disability, he would have been able to access the services or benefits desired").5 Applying this standard, McDonald's argues that its policy of not serving pedestrians in the drive-thru excludes abled and disabled pedestrians alike, so the alleged policy is a neutral one that applies to all pedestrians.
The mere fact that the policy is neutral is a nonstarter. The ADA is violated when a public accommodation fails "to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). Thus, "preferences will sometimes prove necessary to achieve the [ADA's] basic equal opportunity goal." US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002); see also Magee v. McDonald's Corp., No. 16-CV-05652, at 10 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 15, 2017) ("The ADA is not necessarily complied with when disabled and abled people are treated the same. Rather, the ADA stands for the principle that sometimes differently situated people must be treated differently if equality is to be achieved."); Anderson v. Franklin Institute, 185 F. Supp. 3d 628, 645 (E.D. Pa. 2016) ("Because disabled people are [*11]  not similarly situated to the able-bodied, a facially neutral policy can still result in discrimination.").
More importantly, McDonald's misconstrues the appropriate causation test: but for her disability, would Morey be able to access the drive-thru like any other sighted person—in other words, someone who can drive, not someone on foot.6 McDonald's counters that there are plenty of sighted people who cannot drive at night (e.g., those who do not own a car and rely on taxis or ride-share services, are too young to drive, or are restricted by state graduated license laws from driving during the late-night hours). But these individuals fall plainly outside the protections of the ADA. McDonald's also argues that Morey is not precluded from accessing its late-night menu because she could take a taxi or drive with a friend. McDonald's argument equating visually impaired people to children or those without cars or proposing that Morey can get food by asking a friend or car service to drive her runs counter to the goals of the ADA. See, e.g., Barnett, 535 U.S. at 391 ("The statute seeks to diminish or eliminate the stereotypical thought process, the thoughtless actions and the hostile reactions that far too often [*12]  bar those with disabilities from participating in the Nation's life . . .").7
Finally, McDonald's contends that Morey fails to state a claim for discrimination under the Unruh Act. Under section 51(f) of the Act, a violation of an individual's rights under the ADA "shall also constitute a violation of [the Act]." Because Morey had made out a claim under the ADA, her Unruh Act claim survives, as well.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, McDonald's motion to dismiss is denied. The case is set for a status hearing on December 4, 2018 at 11:00 a.m.
