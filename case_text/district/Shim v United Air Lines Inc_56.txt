ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

I. INTRODUCTION
On March 9, 2009, Defendant United Air Lines, Inc. ("Defendant" or "United") terminated Plaintiff Daniel W. Shim ("Plaintiff" or "Shim"), a flight attendant, after Plaintiff had been on a medical leave (or leaves) of absence for over three years. See Doc. No. 70-6, Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 4. Just four days earlier, however, United authorized extending his medical leave of absence until March 31, 2009. See Pl.'s Ex. 3 (letter dated March 5, 2009, stating that "United . . . has authorized your medical incapacity to work based on the medical information provided by your treating physician until 3/31/2009").
Plaintiff filed suit, asserting that United (1) terminated him in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) ("ADA");  [*2] (2) committed intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (3) violated its "employment policies and procedures." Doc. No. 1, Compl. at 7. United moves for summary judgment on all three counts, arguing that the claims are preempted by the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. ("RLA"), or that it is otherwise entitled to summary judgment. Based on the following, the Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background

1. United's Provisions Regarding a Medical Leave of Absence for Flight Attendants
Plaintiff began working for United as a flight attendant on January 28, 1996. Doc. No. 48, Def.'s Concise Statement of Facts ("CSF") ¶ 1. 1 His employment was subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between United and the Association of Flight Attendants - CWA. Id. According to the CBA, there are two kinds of medical leave: "occupational" and "non-occupational." Doc. No. 48-14, Sakae Decl. Ex. J at 6 (P00232). Specifically, the CBA has the following provision regarding "Medical Leave of Absence:"
Upon request, the Company shall grant the following medical leaves of absence: occupational and non-occupational. When leaves of absence  [*3] are granted due to occupational or non-occupational illness or injury, a Flight Attendant shall retain and accrue seniority for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
(Note: A Flight Attendant is automatically placed on leave of absence for illness or injury on the seventeenth (17th) day after exhaustion of all applicable sick leave credits.)
Id.
Between 2006 and 2009, when flight attendants took a Leave of Absence ("LOA"), United gave them a "Leaves of Absence Packet" that explained United's policies applicable to LOAs. Doc. No. 48, Def.'s CSF ¶ 4; Doc. No. 48-6, Hovanesian Decl. Ex. D. 2 The packet provides in a section regarding "Non-Occupational Medical Leave of Absence" as follows: 3

Qualifications and Conditions for Leave of Absence
You  [*4] will automatically be placed on a Medical Leave for illness or injury on the 17th day after exhaustion of all applicable sick leave hours. . . . Except where it is not consistent with the FML policy, an "Absence Certificate" . . . must be provided to Company Medical (OPCMD) at your expense. Information must include medical facts, general treatment plan, office visits and work status. OPCMD will review the medical information and either approve or deny the continuation of the LOA. . . .

Length of Leave of Absence
Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement the maximum time allowed for a Non-Occupational Medical LOA is three (3) years.
. . . .

Availability of Reasonable Accommodation Process (RAP)
If you are suffering from a disability that is long-term (90 days or longer) and would like to pursue the possibility of reasonable accommodation any time prior to the expiration of the three (3) year period, you should contact the FASC [(Flight Attendant Service Center)]. You will be required to submit an updated Absence Certificate to OPCMD. After OPCMD has a clear understanding of your limitations or restrictions an Assessment of Functional Capabilities (AFC) will be completed and the FASC will contact  [*5] you to set up an appointment with HR to discuss any possible accommodations.
Doc. No. 48-6, Hovanesian Decl. Ex. D at 5. Regarding separation, the Leaves of Absence Packet provides:

Failure to Return from Leave of Absence
Failure to return to active duty before the termination of your three (3) year Non-Occupational Medical Leave of Absence will result in your administrative separation from the Company.
You are expected to return to work at the end of any approved Leave of Absence. Failure to return may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
Id. at 17.

2. Plaintiff's Medical Leaves of Absence
In March of 2006, Plaintiff injured his right shoulder at work and was unable to work due to the injury. Doc. No. 70-1, Shim Decl. ¶ 3. He took an "occupational"  [*6] medical LOA. Id. ¶ 4. He remained on that LOA until 2007, when Plaintiff attests that he was prepared to return to work. Id. ¶ 5. Rather than returning, however, on May 23, 2007 Plaintiff began a second, non-occupational, medical LOA due to "severe depression not related to work." Id.
Specifically, on June 4, 2007, "United Medical [(United's Medical Department)] received a Medical Certificate from Plaintiff's psychiatrist, Dr. Vijaya Vellanki [("Vellanki")], indicating the Plaintiff had been under her care and was unable to perform his usual duties beginning on May 23, 2007." Doc. No. 48-1, Dzeipak Decl. ¶ 4. "Based on the medical documentation it received, on or about June 8, 2007, United Medical authorized Plaintiff's absence as a non- occupational medical leave of absence from May 23, 2007 to June 15, 2007." Id. ¶ 5. Thus, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there are two distinct LOAs at issue — an occupational LOA due to Plaintiff's shoulder injury, and a non-occupational LOA due to his depression.
Thereafter, Vellanki treated Plaintiff for depression until 2009. According to Vellanki, Plaintiff's symptoms included "depressed mood, fatigue, poor appetite, social isolation,  [*7] excessive sleepiness, poor concentration," and "anxiety." Doc. No. 48-3, Dzeipak Decl. Ex. B at 7, 9. Plaintiff was diagnosed on June 4, 2007 with "bipolar disorder," "major depressive disorder," and/or "adjustment disorder, depressed mood." Doc. No. 70-8, Pl.'s Ex. 6 (Vellanki Dep. Sept. 26, 2012) at 17, 20. Vellanki explains that bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can present with depressive episodes or manic episodes, with such episodes lasting from a few days to several weeks. Id. at 12. She treated Plaintiff at various times with antidepressant medications Wellbutrin and Zoloft; a sleeping medication, Ambien; and an antianxiety medication, Xanax. Id. at 16, 17, 26. According to Vellanki, Plaintiff improved by June 1, 2009, when his symptoms of depression and anxiety were lessened and he was able to attend a real estate class. Id. at 48. Plaintiff last contacted Vellanki in September of 2009. Id. at 49.
Given Plaintiff's condition, Vellanki continued to provide absence certificates to United, indicating Plaintiff was unable to work due to depression and anxiety. Doc. No. 48, Def.'s CSF ¶ 19. Between June 21, 2007 and February 28, 2009, United granted Plaintiff sixteen additional  [*8] extensions of his non-occupational medical LOA based on Vellanki's absence certificates. Id. ¶ 20; Doc. No. 48-1, Dzeipak Decl. Ex. B. During that time, however, Plaintiff did not seek to invoke United's Reasonable Accommodation Process, which provided in part that one who is "suffering from a disability that is long-term (90 days or longer) and [who] would like to pursue the possibility of reasonable accommodation any time prior to the expiration of the three (3) year period . . . should contact the FASC." Doc. No. 48-6, Hovanesian Decl. Ex. D at 5.

3. Plaintiff's Use of Flight Privileges During his LOAs
United flight attendants have travel benefits, and they retain certain flying benefits while on an LOA. Doc. No. 48-15, Sakae Decl. Ex. K at 3. During his second LOA, Plaintiff utilized these benefits, taking numerous pleasure trips. Doc. No. 48, Def.'s CSF ¶ 22. He went to Tahiti to visit friends and go snorkeling and surfing. Id. He went to Florida for a trade show on surfing equipment; to Las Vegas in 2008 to watch the Super Bowl; to San Francisco, San Diego, and Las Vegas in September 2007; and to New Orleans and Florida to watch University of Hawaii football games in January and  [*9] September of 2008. Id. ¶¶ 23-28.
Although the details are disputed, during a flight from Honolulu to San Francisco on September 7, 2007, Plaintiff was involved in three incidents of allegedly disruptive behavior. Doc. No. 48-9, Love Decl. ¶ 2. United conducted an investigation, and eventually charged him with "violating several Articles of Conduct, Series 30-Flight Attendant Operations Manual." Id. ¶¶ 3, 5. A hearing was originally set for January 5, 2009 to determine whether Plaintiff's conduct during the September 7, 2007 incident was grounds for dismissal. Id. ¶ 5. The hearing was postponed several times, and ultimately did not occur because Plaintiff was terminated in the meantime in March 2009, as explained next. 4

4. Plaintiff's Last Non-Occupational Medical Extension, and His Termination
On March 2, 2009, Vellanki submitted another absence certificate to United, again indicating Plaintiff was unable to work due to depression and anxiety. Doc. No. 48-4, Dzeipak Decl. Ex. C. The certificate referenced office visits in December of 2008, and January and February of 2009. Id. Vellanki wrote that Plaintiff was unable to work from March 1, 2009 to March 31, 2009, but indicated he would be able to perform regular duties beginning April 1, 2009. Id.
Accordingly, United informed Plaintiff in a March 5, 2009 letter from "Aurelio Garcia, Supervisor — Flight Attendant Service Center," that "United Medical . . . has authorized your medical incapacity to work based on the medical information provided by your treating physician until 3/31/2009." Doc. No. 48-8, Hovanesian Decl. Ex. F. That is, the letter stated that if Plaintiff's physician would complete "the enclosed Absence Certificate," then his medical non-occupational LOA was extended until March 31, 2009. Id.
But on March 9, 2009, United terminated Plaintiff's employment  [*11] —United issued a Notification of Separation, effective on that date, giving the reason "[f]ailure to return from LOA." Doc. No. 70-6, Pl.'s Ex. 4. The notification also stated that Plaintiff was not recommended for rehire due to "[v]iolation of company rules." Id. The notification was "authorized" and "submitted by"Aurelio Garcia" — the same supervisor who wrote the letter four days earlier that authorized extending Plaintiff's non-occupational medical LOA to March 31, 2009. Id. (This separation occurred three years from Plaintiff's occupational LOA for his shoulder injury, but not three years from May 23, 2007, when his non-occupational LOA began based on Vellanki's certification.) Plaintiff received the discharge notice on March 12, 2009. Doc. No. 70-1, Shim Decl. ¶ 15.

B. Procedural Background
Plaintiff filed suit on March 11, 2011. Doc. No. 1, Compl. As indicated above, the Complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) Disability Discrimination (violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act); (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress ("IIED"); and (3) "Violation of Defendant's Employment Policies and Procedures." Id. at 5-7. The suit seeks reinstatement, general and special  [*12] damages, back and front pay, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, costs and interest. Id. at 8.
Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on August 27, 2012. Doc. No. 47. Plaintiff filed his Opposition on November 20, 2012, Doc. No. 71, and Defendant filed a corresponding Reply on November 28, 2012. Doc. No. 74. The court heard the Motion on December 10, 2012.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Rule 56(a) mandates summary judgment "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Broussard v. Univ. of Cal. at Berkeley, 192 F.3d 1252, 1258 (9th Cir. 1999).
"A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007)  [*13] (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323); see also Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co., 392 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2004). "When the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56[(a)] its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts [and] come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation and internal quotation signals omitted); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (stating that a party cannot "rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading" in opposing summary judgment).
"An issue is 'genuine' only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable fact finder could find for the nonmoving party, and a dispute is 'material' only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." In re Barboza, 545 F.3d 702, 707 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). When considering the evidence on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all reasonable inferences on behalf of the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 587;  [*14] see also Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. No. 84, 546 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir. 2008) (stating that "the evidence of [the nonmovant] is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor" (citations omitted)).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Counts Two and Three Are Preempted by the RLA (and Plaintiff Has Not Opposed Dismissal)
Defendant first argues that Counts Two (IIED) and Three ("Violation of Defendant's Employment Policies and Procedures") are preempted by the RLA, or otherwise fail on the merits. In his Opposition, Plaintiff does not respond at all to these arguments as to Counts Two and Three, essentially conceding that summary judgment should be granted as to those Counts. The court agrees, and grants the Motion as to both Counts.
The RLA governs "disputes between [airlines and] . . . their employees, growing out of . . . the interpretation or application of [CBAs] between [airlines and] their employees, covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions[.]" 45 U.S.C. § 185. "Congress enacted the RLA to 'promote stability in labor-management relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes.'" Saridakis v. United Airlines, 166 F.3d 1272, 1276 (9th Cir. 1999)  [*15] (quoting Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 253, 114 S. Ct. 2239, 129 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1994)). "This framework includes 'a mandatory arbitral mechanism for "minor" [and major] disputes.'" Id. (square brackets in original). "[M]inor disputes 'involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.'" Id. (quoting Hawaiian Airlines, 512 U.S. at 253). The RLA thus preempts state-law causes of action dependent on an interpretation of the governing CBA. That is, "state law causes of action that depend upon the interpretation of CBAs are preempted because the interpretation or application of existing labor agreements are the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitrational bodies created by the RLA. Claims or causes of action involving rights and obligations that are independent of the CBA are not preempted." Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. City & Cnty. of S.F., 266 F.3d 1064, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).
The RLA preempts Counts Two and Three because they necessarily depend upon an interpretation of the CBA (specifically, the CBA's provisions regarding medical LOAs), and neither Count is "independent of the CBA." The primary question underlying  [*16] Counts Two and Three is whether it was proper for United to terminate a flight attendant for exceeding three years of a combined occupational and non-occupational medical LOA. Thus, both Counts depend upon an interpretation of United's LOA policies, which are grounded in, and dependent upon an interpretation of, the CBA.
For instance, Count Two (IIED) requires determining (among other elements) whether United's intentional acts were "extreme and outrageous." Hac v. Univ. of Haw., 102 Haw. 92, 107, 73 P.3d 46, 61 (2003). And the Ninth Circuit has "repeatedly held that determining whether an employer's conduct is outrageous [for purposes of an emotional distress claim] requires an interpretation of the terms of the CBA[.]" Saridakis, 166 F.3d at 1278. Here, Plaintiff's IIED claim is based on United terminating him in violation of its LOA policy that apparently allows up to a three-year non-occupational medical LOA — a right established by the CBA. See Humble v. Boeing Co., 305 F.3d 1004, 1012-13 (9th Cir. 2002) ("If . . . the plaintiff's outrage claim attempts to enforce rights or duties established by the CBA while sidestepping the CBA's dispute resolution processes, it is preempted.").  [*17] 5
Likewise, Count Three, alleging a "violation of Defendant's Employment Policies and Procedures" also depends squarely on rights or obligations grounded in the CBA — the nature of the three-year LOA period in United's Leaves of Absence Packet regarding "non-occupational medical" LOAs. Although the Leaves of Absence Packet does not speak to "occupational" medical LOA's, the CBA does. See Doc. No. 48-14, Sakae Decl. Ex. J at 6 (P00232). Thus, whether Count Three is construed as a breach of contract claim, a public policy-type claim, or an equitable claim such as promissory estoppel, Count Three depends directly on an interpretation of the CBA. It is preempted by the RLA.

B. Count One Alleging Disability  [*18] Discrimination Under the ADA
United next seeks summary judgment on Count One, arguing that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case under the ADA. 6

1. Framework Under the ADA
Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), prohibits an employer from discriminating "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees." The court applies the familiar burden-shifting analysis derived from McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), to claims of discrimination on account of a disability. 7 See, e.g., Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49-50, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (applying McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework to ADA disability discrimination claim); Thorn v. BAE Sys. Haw. Shipyards, Inc., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1218-19 (D. Haw. 2008).
Under this burden-shifting analysis, Plaintiff must first establish a prima facie disability discrimination claim. See, e.g., Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 49 n.3. The plaintiff must put forth evidence that: (1) he is "disabled" within the meaning of the statute; (2) he is a "qualified individual" (that is, he is able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodations); and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action "because of" his disability. See, e.g., Hutton v. Elf Atochem North Am., Inc., 273 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir. 2001). "At the summary judgment stage, the 'requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case  [*21] . . . is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence.'" Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1112 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)).
If Plaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the burden then shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action. Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 49 n.3. If Defendant proffers such a reason, "the presumption of intentional discrimination disappears, but the plaintiff can still prove disparate treatment by, for instance, offering evidence demonstrating that the employer's explanation is pretextual." Id. (citation omitted).

2. Prima Facie Case — Disputed Evidence as to Plaintiff's Disability
The ADA defines disability with respect to an individual as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff was "disabled" for purposes  [*22] of the ADA between 2007 and 2009. There is ample evidence that Plaintiff had a "mental impairment." See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(2) (2009) (defining "mental impairment" as including "[a]ny mental or psychological disorder, such as . . . emotional or mental illness"). Vellanki diagnosed Plaintiff at various times with a bipolar disorder and severe depression. See, e.g., Doc. No. 70-8, Pl.'s Ex.6 (Vellanki Dep. Sept. 26, 2012) at 17, 20. "Applying the statutory definition and the EEOC's guidance, every appellate court which has considered the question has held or assumed that 'bipolar disorder' is a mental disability covered under the ADA, at least if it is sufficiently severe[.]" Den Hartog v. Wasatch Academy, 129 F.3d 1076, 1081 (10th Cir. 1997) (citing cases); see also, e.g., Reed v. Winwood Farm Home for Children, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83253, 2011 WL 2971824, at *2 (D.S.C. June 7, 2011) ("Mental impairments, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, stress disorder, and emotional or mental illness can constitute a disability under the ADA.") (citing numerous cases).
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Vellanki also provided evidence that Plaintiff's condition substantially  [*23] affected his sleeping, concentration, thinking, and his ability to work. Doc. No. 70-8, Pl.'s Ex. 6 (Vellanki Dep. Sept. 26, 2012) at 51-52. These are all major life activities within the meaning of the ADA. See, e.g., Head v. Glacier Nw. Inc., 413 F.3d 1053, 1060, 1061 (9th Cir. 2005) ("Sleeping is a major life activity.") ("Thinking is a major life activity."); 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A) ("major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working").
On the other hand, there is also ample evidence — such as his extensive pleasure travel — that might tend to contradict Plaintiff's diagnosis as bipolar, or that his condition substantially affected major life activities. But such disputed evidence simply creates a genuine issue of material fact. Indeed, at times, Vellanki indicated that excessive travel and Plaintiff's September 7, 2007 altercation on a flight to California while utilizing his flight privileges could be explained as a manifestation of his bipolar disorder. Doc. No. 70-8,  [*24] Pl.'s Ex. 6 at 29-32.
In short, summary judgment is inappropriate as to the question whether Plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA.

3. Prima Facie Case — Disputed Evidence Whether Plaintiff was a "Qualified Individual"
"The ADA [] defines . . . 'qualified individual with a disability,' as an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). See Nunes v. Wal-Mart, Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 1999) (applying § 12111(8)). Under that definition, United argues that Plaintiff was unable to "perform the essential functions" of his job because, as a most basic requirement, he was unable to be present at work. See Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012) ("Both before and since the passage of the ADA, a majority of circuits have endorsed the proposition that in those jobs where performance requires attendance at the job, irregular attendance compromises essential job functions.").
The ADA, however, requires that Plaintiff be able to perform the essential functions of his job  [*25] "with or without reasonable accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). And Nunes has recognized that "[u]npaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." 164 F.3d at 1247 (citing 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, App. (1999) (discussing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o))). 8 Thus, "[i]n cases where a leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation, the question is not whether the employee can perform the essential functions of the job during the leave period. Rather, the question is whether the leave of absence is likely to enable the employee, upon his return from leave, to resume performing the essential functions of the job." Jadwin v. Cnty. of Kern, 610 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1176 n.20 (E.D. Cal. 2009) (citations omitted). See also, e.g., Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001) (analyzing whether plaintiff's inability to show up for work renders her not otherwise qualified under the ADA where "regular and predictable attendance is an essential function of the position," and concluding that because an LOA can be a reasonable accommodation plaintiff could be a "qualified individual with a disability").
Here, United points out that it granted sixteen extensions of Plaintiff's non-occupational medical LOA, lasting nearly two years (and over three years from Plaintiff's initial LOA regarding his shoulder). It argues, citing numerous cases, that "lengthy and indefinite leaves of absence are not 'reasonable' as a matter of law." Doc. No. 74, Def.'s Reply at 9-11. See, e.g., Blue v. Jackson, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42599, 2007 WL 1724950, at *10 (E.D. Wis. June 12, 2007) ("When an employee seeks to obtain indefinite leave by utilizing repeated requests for short leaves, at some point the requested extension, even if that request is for a relatively short period of time, is no longer a reasonable accommodation."). Analyzing the current evidentiary record, however, the court concludes that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether a further extension of Plaintiff's non-occupational  [*27] medical LOA would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job — i.e., whether he was "a qualified individual with a disability."
"Even an extended medical leave, or an extension of an existing leave period, may be a reasonable accommodation if it does not pose an undue hardship on the employer." Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247 (citations omitted). Thus, while there certainly are situations where a prolonged LOA may be unreasonable, "[a]pplying this rule to the prolonged disability leave situation is tricky." Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 649 (1st Cir. 2000). "These are difficult, fact intensive, case-by-case analyses, ill-served by per se rules or stereotypes." Id. at 650. That is, "[d]etermining whether a proposed accommodation (medical leave in this case) is reasonable, including whether it imposes an undue hardship on the employer, requires a fact-specific, individualized inquiry." Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247.
The ADA places the burden on the defendant to show that an accommodation would be an undue hardship. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) (providing that the term "discriminate" includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical  [*28] or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered identity"); Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247.
Here, although United argues that Plaintiff's LOA was unreasonable as a matter of law, it did not address "undue hardship" at all. And, on the current evidentiary record, "undue hardship" is a disputed question of fact. United's own written LOA policy allows a flight attendant to have a three-year non-occupational medical LOA before being administratively terminated. Again, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff had two distinct medical LOA's — an occupational medical LOA for his shoulder (which began in 2006), and a non-occupational medical LOA for his disability (which began in May of 2007). Under United's policy, Plaintiff had yet to reach the three-year maximum (measured from his LOA that began on May 27, 2007). Indeed, United authorized granting Plaintiff an extension of his non-occupational medical LOA only four days before terminating him. And in determining  [*29] whether an unpaid LOA creates a hardship, a court can consider the employer's LOA policy to determine what's reasonable. See Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247 ("Weighing against Wal-Mart on these issues [is] its stated benefits policy that eligible employees could take up to one year of unpaid medical leave[.]"). "Where an employee's request [for an LOA] is consistent with documented employer leave policies, the courts are more likely to find that the leave is a reasonable accommodation. On the other hand, courts tend to find that a leave request that exceeds existing employer policies is not reasonable." S. Befort, The Most Difficult ADA Reasonable Accommodation Issues: Reassignment and Leave of Absence, 37 Wake Forest L. Rev. 439, 461-62 (Summer 2002) ("Befort"). See also Garcia-Ayala, 212 F.3d at 648-49 (reversing a finding that a plaintiff, seeking additional unpaid leave, was not qualified where "the employer did not contest the reasonableness of the accommodation except to embrace a per se rule that any leave beyond its one-year reservation period was too long").
Moreover, "[t]he ADA does not require an employee to show that a leave of absence is certain or even likely to be successful  [*30] to prove that it is a reasonable accommodation." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1136 (citing Kimbro v. Atl. Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 878 (9th Cir. 1989) ("As long as at the time of Kimbro's termination, there were 'plausible reasons to believe that the handicap [could have been] accommodated' by . . . a leave of absence, ARCO is responsible for its failure to offer such a leave") (citation omitted)). Thus, even exceeding an LOA period in a written policy, without some showing of undue hardship, might not be sufficient. See Befort, 37 Wake Forest L. Rev. at 460 ("[EEOC] guidance suggests that . . . an employer may not apply a no-fault leave policy, under which employees are automatically terminated after a certain period of absence, to deny a request for leave unless either another effective accommodation is available or granting the requested leave would cause an undue hardship.") (referring to the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act).
In short, given questions of fact regarding (1) whether Plaintiff was even in violation of United's non-occupational LOA policy, and (2) whether an additional LOA period would  [*31] cause "undue hardship" to United, at this stage the court cannot find as a matter of law that Plaintiff's request for an extension of his LOA was unreasonable. That is, there remains a question of fact as to whether Plaintiff was "a qualified individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of his position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).

4. Prima Facie Case — Disputed Evidence as to Causation
United does not specifically argue that it is entitled to summary judgment on the last element of the prima facie case (causation, or whether United terminated Shim "because of" his disability). 9 The court thus discusses this element only briefly, and concludes that causation is also a disputed issue of fact.
In this regard, Plaintiff need not show that United terminated him solely because of a discriminatory animus — it need only be one reason. See Head, 413 F.3d at 1065  [*32] ("[W]e hold that the ADA outlaws adverse employment decisions motivated, even in part, by animus based on a plaintiff's disability or request for an accommodation - a motivating factor standard."). As to the third element —adverse employment action because of the disability — "conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139-40. And "direct evidence" is not necessary to demonstrate a causal connection between the disability and the adverse employment action; rather, circumstantial evidence is sufficient. See, e.g., Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1028 (9th Cir. 2006).
Viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence suggests that United terminated Plaintiff because of his numerous requests for non-occupational medical leave. United was aware that he was under the care of psychiatrist, who had diagnosed him with conditions that were (or could be) disabling within the meaning of the ADA. He requested non-occupational medical LOAs — a form of reasonable accommodation under the ADA. And United terminated him because of the  [*33] length of time he had requested such an LOA. Certainly, United ultimately might be able to establish that additional LOA's were unreasonable and an "undue hardship," and thus might be able to prove that it terminated Plaintiff for a legitimate reason under its policies. But summary judgment is inappropriate at this stage.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant United Air Lines's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part, and DENIED in part. Counts Two (claiming Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) and Three (asserting a violation of United's polices) are dismissed, but Count One (violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act) remains.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, December 13, 2012.
