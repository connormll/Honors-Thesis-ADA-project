CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DKT. NO. 33]
Plaintiff Elena Livenson was a software engineer formerly employed by Defendant ARINC Incorporated and its predecessor companies until her termination in 2018. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate her disabilities and instead improperly fired her in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and California Family Rights Act (CFRA). Defendant now moves for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's claims. (Mot., Dkt. No. 33-1; Opp., Dkt. No. 38; Reply, Dkt. No. 40.) For the reasons below, the Court GRANTS the motion.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff began working for Defendant's predecessor company as a software engineer in 1997. (Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (DSUF) 1, Dkt. No. 33-4.)1 Defendant was Plaintiff's employer from 2013 until her termination. (DSUF 4-5.) In 2013, Plaintiff began reporting to Harshna (Hazel) Patel, whom she had previously worked alongside. [*2]  (DSUF 8-9.) From their time working together, Patel was aware that Plaintiff suffered from migraine headaches. (DSUF 10.) Plaintiff did not tell Patel anything else about her migraines or otherwise discuss her health. (DSUF 11-12.)
In Plaintiff's 2015 performance review, Patel praised Plaintiff's work product and leadership skills and "encouraged [her] to attend training on effective communication for performance year 2016" to further those skills. (DSUF 14.) Plaintiff did not attend any leadership training in 2016. (DSUF 15.) Around 2016, Patel promoted Plaintiff to Principal Software Engineer. (DSUF 16.) Plaintiff met some of her performance goals for 2016 but was rated "off-target" in certain areas including working with management and setting a positive example. (DSUF 18.) In her assessment of Plaintiff, Patel noted that Plaintiff "does not always express herself in a professional manner" and "encourage[d] her to [be] more mindful of how and when negative comments are expressed." (DSUF 18.)
In 2017, Plaintiff was assigned to a project designated the "CETC Project." (DSUF 20.) Plaintiff was assigned a "Change Request" or "CR" on the CETC Project. (DSUF 21.) Plaintiff sent an [*3]  email to the CETC Project manager to complain that she did not want to work on the assignment because it did not require her expertise and someone else could do it. (DSUF 21.) When told she needed to complete the work she was assigned, Plaintiff responded "[f]or your information, I am asked to work the projects to solve challenging problems, that senior software developers cannot do." (DSUF 21.) Shortly after, Plaintiff had an email exchange with Patel where she was reminded that she was specifically picked for the CETC Project because it needed her specialized knowledge and that she could not simply refuse an assignment. (DSUF 22.) Plaintiff understood that Patel had told her that her conduct was unprofessional, and she was advised that she could be placed on a Performance Recovery Plan (PRP) if her conduct continued. (DSUF 22-23.) As a result of these issues, Plaintiff was rated as "off-target" for several goals in her 2017 performance review, though she again garnered high praise for her technical skill. (DSUF 24.) Patel made the following comments regarding Plaintiff's behavior:
[Plaintiff's] passion is often viewed as antagonism when [she] becomes agitated during discussions that [*4]  her views are not being heard. In these situations, she tends to interrupt[] her peers, constantly interjects while someone is responding or talking and dismisses other people's ideas who she/he doesn't agree with - many times, this is in the form of loud objections or by walking out mid-meeting. Significant improvement is needed in addressing these behaviors in the coming year. When providing feedback, care should be taken to consider how it is perceived by the listener. The feedback should not be provided in a dismissive manner but in a way that will provide the listener with the information they need to make improvements. This is key to [Plaintiff's] progression in her career path.
(DSUF 24.)
In January 2018, Plaintiff was assigned to a new project called "Platform," which due to its highly technical nature, had mandatory meetings known as "SCRUM." (DSUF 27-29.) Initially, Plaintiff refused to participate in SCRUM and refused to prioritize her work on Platform opting instead to work on lower priority projects. (DSUF 30-31.) When Plaintiff did work on Platform, she provided a plan that was unworkable, leading Patel to ask her for a revised plan that was never provided. (DSUF 32-36.) [*5]  As a result of this failure, Patel scheduled a performance review meeting with Plaintiff and invited Defendant's Senior Human Resource's Manager, Alissa Dorman, to attend. (DSUF 37-39.)
At the meeting, Patel and Dorman asked Plaintiff why she could not attend the mandatory SCRUM meetings, and Plaintiff responded that 10:00 a.m. was not convenient for her because of her migraines. (DSUF 40.) After conferring with Dorman, Patel agreed to move SCRUM to 11:00 a.m. to accommodate Plaintiff. (DSUF 41.) Plaintiff did not make any other requests during the meeting. (DSUF 42.) During the meeting, Dorman warned Plaintiff that she would be placed on a PRP and that unsuccessful completion could result in termination. (DSUF 43.)
On February 6, 2018, Dorman issued Plaintiff a PRP, which was revised on February 7, 2018 after Plaintiff explained that the previous deadlines were not feasible. (DSUF 44-46.) The PRP set forth several terms, and Plaintiff was reminded that a failure to make progress towards those terms could result in termination. (DSUF 47-48.) On February 12, 2018, Plaintiff informed Dorman and Patel that her doctor had placed her on medical leave for stress. (DSUF 49.) Plaintiff was informed [*6]  that she needed to process the leave request through Defendant's third-party administrator. (DSUF 50.) Plaintiff was provided with all of her requested leave, and Defendant did not prevent her from taking it. (DSUF 51.) She returned from her medical leave on February 26, 2018 and did not note any restrictions on her ability to work. (DSUF 53.) Plaintiff did not request any other extended leaves of absence, and she admits that Defendant granted all of her requests for days off, to leave early or come in late, and to work from home related to her migraines and other conditions. (DSUF 54-55.)
On February 28, 2018, Dorman notified Plaintiff that her PRP deadlines had been extended to April 10, 2018 to accommodate her leave of absence, which also included a vacation. (DSUF 56.) On April 10, 2018, Dorman and Patel met with Plaintiff for a 30-day progress review of the PRP. (DSUF 57.) Plaintiff received "unsatisfactory" ratings in multiple areas. (DSUF 58.) On May 3, 2018, Plaintiff stated that she would not attend any more PRP meetings. (DSUF 59.) On May 9, 2018, Dorman sent Plaintiff an email explaining how her interactions with Patel were equally important as her technical work and asked [*7]  if she would be open to having another meeting. (DSUF 60.) Instead of responding, Plaintiff submitted a letter to Defendant's Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) to open an investigation into her PRP. (DSUF 62.) By this time, Dorman and Patel were intending to finish the PRP period and terminate Plaintiff's employment; however, they placed her termination on hold pending the SBC investigation. (DSUF 61, 63.) The SBC investigation concluded that Plaintiff's PRP was not improper, and she was informed of this decision on June 18, 2018. (DSUF 64-65.) Dorman finalized her recommendation to terminate Plaintiff the same day, which was approved on June 19, 2018. (DSUF 67.) On June 25, 2018, Patel informed Plaintiff that because she failed to complete her PRP, her employment with Defendant was being terminated. (DSUF 68-69.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, read in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, shows that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Material facts are those necessary to the proof or defense of a claim, as determined by reference to substantive [*8]  law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A factual issue is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party" based on the issue. Id. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Id. at 255. But if the evidence of the nonmoving party "is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Id. at 249-50.
The burden is first on the moving party to show an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The moving party satisfies this burden either by showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof at trial, or by introducing enough evidence to entitle the moving party to a directed verdict when the moving party bears the burden of proof at trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325; C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000). If the moving party satisfies this initial requirement, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to designate specific facts, supported by evidence, showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. If the nonmovant "fails to properly address another party's assertions of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may . . . consider [*9]  the fact undisputed for the purposes of the motion [or] . . . grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination
Under FEHA,2 it is unlawful for any employer, because of "physical disability, mental disability, [or] medical condition . . . to bar or to discharge [a] person from employment . . . or to discriminate against [a] person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). A plaintiff may prove discrimination by direct evidence of discrimination. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985). However, Plaintiff does not offer any direct evidence of discrimination. Thus, Plaintiff's discrimination claim is analyzed under the burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Because of the similarity in California and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts use the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Reid v. Google, Inc., 50 Cal. 4th 512, 520 n.2, 113 Cal. Rptr. 3d 327, 235 P.3d 988 (2010); Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden to establish a prima facie claim of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Once a plaintiff establishes his or her prima facie case, the burden shifts [*10]  to the defendant to "articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason" for its allegedly discriminatory conduct. Id. If the defendant provides such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show the defendant's reason is not the actual reason, but instead a pretext for discrimination. Id.

1. Prima Facie Case
To establish her prima facie case, Plaintiff must demonstrate she: (1) suffers from a disability; (2) was otherwise qualified and could perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010). The prima facie burden is light, and a plaintiff "need only offer sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination." Id. (internal citations and emphasis omitted).
Defendant does not challenge the first two elements of Plaintiff's prima facie case. (Mot. at 12.) But Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish her third element because she offers no evidence to show that she was terminated because of her disability. (Id.) In her opposition, Plaintiff asserts that she need not demonstrate "but for" causation. (Opp. at 13 (citing [*11]  Alamo v. Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp., 219 Cal. App. 4th 466, 479, 161 Cal. Rptr. 3d 758 (2013).) Instead, Plaintiff contends that causation may be inferred circumstantially because of the close temporal proximity. (Id.) Without citing any specific evidence in the record, Plaintiff contends that she was terminated shortly after requesting a disability accommodation in the form of moving back her morning meetings. (See id. at 13-15.) For purposes of analysis, the Court will assume that Plaintiff has met her minimal burden.

2. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Once a plaintiff has met his or her minimal burden to establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts back to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination. McDonell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. To shift the burden back to the plaintiff, a defendant need only "articulate" rather than prove a non-discriminatory purpose. Bd. of Trustees of Keene St. College v. Sweeney, 439 U.S. 24, 25, 99 S. Ct. 295, 58 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1978). Here, Defendant articulates the business needs of ensuring employees are meeting workplace standards and maintaining a collegial workplace environment. (Mot. at 14.) Defendant has met its burden.

3. Pretext
Because Defendant can articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination, the burden now shifts back to Plaintiff to show that Defendant's "stated reason for the [*12]  adverse employment decision was in fact pretext." McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. Plaintiff may succeed in showing pretext "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). Here, Plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence. "Where evidence of pretext is circumstantial, rather than direct, the plaintiff must produce 'specific' and 'substantial' facts to create a triable issue of pretext." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). Notwithstanding, Plaintiff's burden to raise a triable issue of pretext is "hardly an onerous one." Noyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).
Plaintiff contends Defendant's proffered reasons to terminate her were pretextual for one reason: temporal proximity. A close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action may provide circumstantial evidence of the causal link necessary to establish a prima facie case of pretext. See Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Internat., 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1110 n. 6, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007). "But temporal proximity alone is not sufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext once the employer has offered evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) (collecting cases). Yet Plaintiff offers nothing [*13]  more.
Reliance on temporal proximity alone is not only legally deficient but also factually tenuous in this case. Plaintiff argues that the "hostility and false accusations" against her "noticeably escalated" after she requested that Defendant move back the SCRUM meetings (Opp. at 15) and suggests that her PRPs were the result of her "protected activities in 2018" (id. at 16). Plaintiff's theory, however, lacks record support. It is undisputed that Defendant made Plaintiff aware that she was "off-target" (i.e., not meeting expectations) in her leadership and communication skills starting in 2016. (See DSUF 18, 24.)3 Moreover, while Plaintiff generally asserts that her health condition was the cause of her termination, Plaintiff provides no evidence, let alone specific and substantial evidence, to support this conclusion. In fact, these assertions are contradicted by her own testimony that she did not disclose or discuss her health condition, other than her occasional migraines. (DSUF 12, 42, 53-54, 66.) Plaintiff testified that "[w]e didn't discuss my health," though she did mention her migraines when asked how she was feeling if she happened to have been experiencing a headache at the [*14]  time. (DSUF 11-12.)
While Plaintiff may disagree with Defendant's decisions to place her on a PRP and later terminate her, her disagreement alone is insufficient. See Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) ("The [employee] cannot simply show that the employer's decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent."). Because Plaintiff merely speculates that Defendant's decision to terminate her was pretextual, she cannot carry her burden under the third step of the McDonnell Douglas test. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.

B. Retaliation
Under FEHA,4 it is unlawful for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). Plaintiff's retaliation claim is also analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test. See Patten v. Grant Joint Union High Sch. Dist., 134 Cal. App. 4th 1378, 1384, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2005). For the reasons discussed above in Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, her retaliation claim [*15]  also fails. Assuming that Plaintiff can meet establish her prima facie case, she would be unable to demonstrate that her termination was a pretext for retaliation. Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication of Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

C. FEHA Wrongful Termination
Plaintiff's second cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of FEHA appears derivative of her disability discrimination and retaliation claims. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication of this claim.

D. Failure to Accommodate and Engage in the Interactive Process
Under FEHA, an employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee's known disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). "The . . . elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Cuiellette v. City of Los Angeles, 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). A reasonable accommodation is "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008).
FEHA also [*16]  requires an employer to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). The interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and employee, but "[t]he initial burden rests primarily upon the employee to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).
Here, Plaintiff contends that she was under stress causing her to suffer from anxiety and an elevated heart rate. (Opp. at 16.) Without citing any evidence, Plaintiff argues that Defendant should have accommodated her by reassigning her to another group or having a third person from Human Resources present during her meetings to ensure the communications remained civil. (Id.) Plaintiff does not present any evidence that she made these requests to Dorman or Patel and that they were rejected. Nor can she. Plaintiff's testimony makes clear that she never requested any of these accommodations from Dorman or Patel during her initial meetings when she requested that SCRUM be moved to 11:00 a.m. (DSUF 42) or at any [*17]  point after her return from medical leave. (DSUF 53-55.) The record evidence shows that Defendant granted each of Plaintiff's requests for medical leave, time off, and to come to work late and leave early. (DSUF 54-55.) Because it is the employee's responsibility to initiate the interactive process by identifying a reasonable accommodation and it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not make the requests, Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication of her failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process claims.

E. CFRA
Plaintiff's seventh cause of action is vaguely labeled as "Violation of California Family Rights Act." Defendant construes this claim to be an "interference" claim. (Mot. at 16.) Under the CFRA, it is unlawful "for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right provided [by the CFRA]." Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2(q). "A CFRA interference claim consists of the following elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the employer's interference with or denial of those rights." Moore v. Regents of Univ. of California, 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 250, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) (internal quotations and citations omitted).
Plaintiff's opposition does not mention, let alone clarify, this claim. See Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Countrywide Fin., 802 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1132 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (failure [*18]  to oppose "constitutes waiver or abandonment"). Regardless, Plaintiff cannot prevail on this claim because the record evidence shows that she was granted all of the leave she requested. (DSUF 51.) Defendant is therefore entitled to summary adjudication of this claim.

F. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
To state a valid claim for wrongful termination, "the plaintiff must prove: (1) an employer-employee relationship; (2) plaintiff was terminated; (3) that plaintiff's termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy; and (4) the termination caused plaintiff harm." Mills v. Ethan Allen Interiors, Inc., No. CV-15-01842-BRO (KKx), 2016 WL 7655772, at *14 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 10, 2016). Because this claim is derivative of each of her other claims that have been adjudicated in Defendant's favor, Defendant is entitled to summary adjudication on this claim as well. Neufeld v. Winco Holdings, Inc., No. 1:14-CV-1505 DAD-JLT, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26335, 2016 WL 815649, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2016), aff'd, 699 F. App'x 659 (9th Cir. 2017) ("A common law claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy cannot survive if it is entirely derivative of terminated statutory claims.")

G. Punitive Damages
Because Plaintiff's underlying claims fail, her claim for punitive damages must also fail.

H. Procedural Maneuvers
Plaintiff seeks to avoid summary judgment through a few procedural maneuvers.

1. The Rule 56(d) Request
Plaintiff requests a continuance [*19]  because she did not depose three witnesses: Dorman, Patel, and Steve Passano. (Opp. at 20-22.)
Under Rule 56(d), a court may defer ruling on a motion for summary judgment if the nonmoving party shows by declaration that it cannot present facts to justify its opposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). "The burden is on the party seeking additional discovery to proffer sufficient facts to show that the evidence sought exists, and that it would prevent summary judgement. Moreover, the district court does not abuse its discretion by denying further discovery if the movant has failed to diligently pursue discovery in the past." Chance v. Pac-Tel Teletrac Inc., 242 F.3d 1151, 1161 n. 6 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted).
Plaintiff's request fails for several reasons. First, Plaintiff fails to explain how these three depositions would preclude summary judgment in light of her own testimony that she received every requested accommodation and never asked for an accommodation for anxiety or a heart condition. Second, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate diligence in seeking discovery. The parties' lack of diligence in this case is well documented. (See Dkt. Nos. 31, 34.) Plaintiff inexplicably waited until the very end of discovery to notice these depositions—despite knowing about them [*20]  from the beginning of the case—and then was unable to take the depositions when a dispute arose between the parties because the discovery deadline had lapsed. Third, the discovery deadline has not been reopened. A continuance would therefore be pointless because Plaintiff is no longer able to take these depositions. There is no good cause to reopen and extend the deadline (as the Court has already ruled). Fourth, Plaintiff specifically opposed the continuance of the summary judgment deadline when Defendant sought to extend certain pretrial deadlines. (Dkt. No. 30.) Remarkably, Plaintiff now seeks the relief she only recently opposed. Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) request is denied.

2. The Midnight Errata
At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel argued that the Court should deny the motion because Defendant relied on Plaintiff's deposition, which she did not have the opportunity to review and correct. This argument does not appear to be made in good faith.
Plaintiff filed a declaration in opposition to the summary judgment motion. If she wished to correct allegedly inaccurate deposition testimony, her declaration would have been the time to do so. Instead, Plaintiff filed her errata at 11:39 p.m. on the night [*21]  before the hearing on this motion after the Court had published its tentative ruling earlier that day. Plaintiff's eleventh-hour attempt to contradict her sworn testimony has the earmarks of a sham filing. Cf. Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266-67 (9th Cir. 1991) (plaintiff cannot create a genuine issue of fact by flatly contradicting previous deposition testimony with a later declaration). Indeed, Plaintiff's errata offers no explanation for the timing of the changes and does not include a statement of reasons for making them as required by Rule 30(e). "A statement of reasons explaining corrections is an important component of errata submitted pursuant to FRCP 30(e), because the statement permits an assessment concerning whether the alterations have a legitimate purpose." Hambleton Bros. Lumber Co. v. Balkin Enterprises, Inc., 397 F.3d 1217, 1224-25 (9th Cir. 2005). Here, the timing of the submission and failure to explain the changes strongly supports the conclusion that "the 'corrections' were not corrections at all, but rather purposeful rewrites tailored to manufacture an issue of material fact . . . and to avoid a summary judgment ruling in [Defendant's] favor." Id. Accordingly, the Court strikes the errata for failing to comply with Rule 30(e) and its untimely submission.5
Even if this Court were to consider the errata as a legitimate part of the summary [*22]  judgment record, the alterations would not change the outcome of this motion. Plaintiff now claims: "We didn't discuss my health in detail. I told [Patel] I needed a different schedule because of my migraines and that I would need to work from home on some days." (Errata, Dkt. No. 48-1 at 1.) Plaintiff also now claims she was pressured to return quicker than she wanted and that she was fired before she had the chance to request any additional accommodations. (Errata at 2-3.) None of these claims provides substantial evidence of pretext or lack of accommodation in the face of the undisputed facts showing that Defendant had been attempting to address Plaintiff's performance issues since 2016 and accommodated every specific request for accommodation.

3. The "Meet and Confer"
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant failed to meet and confer before filing this motion as required by Local Rule 7-3. (Opp. at 5-6, 10-12.) After Defendant filed its motion, the Clerk's office issued a notice of deficiencies, which noted among other things, the motion lacked a Local Rule 7-3 compliance statement. (NOD, Dkt. No. 35.) The Court ordered Defendant to file its statement of compliance (Order, Dkt. No. 36), and Defendant did so the [*23]  same day. (Supp. Decl. of Sumithra R. Roberts, Dkt. No. 37.) Attached to Defendant's responsive declaration is an email dated May 18, 2021. (Id., Ex. 1.) The email memorializes the parties' meet and confer and sets forth the reasons that Defendant was bringing the motion. (Id.) Plaintiff's counsel contends that no substantive discussion took place that day (Opp. at 11), and Defendant's counsel responds that Plaintiff's counsel "abruptly disconnected the call" when she attempted to discuss the matter and never responded to the follow up email. (Reply at 2.) This breakdown—on both sides—is unprofessional and does not fulfill the purpose of the rule. Professional civility and compliance with the Local Rules are not optional. See, e.g., Lopez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. SACV 16-01409 AG (KESx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144380, 2016 WL 6088257, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2016) ("Local Rule 7-3 isn't just a . . . mere formalism simply there to be checked off by lawyers."). Notwithstanding this failure by the parties, the Court will not strike the motion on this basis.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment. Defendant is ORDERED to file a proposed judgment by July 2, 2021.
