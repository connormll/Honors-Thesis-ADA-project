Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Dominique Davis, through counsel, filed this employment discrimination action. This matter is before the court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2) (D.S.C.) for a Report and Recommendation on the defendant's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 41.) Davis filed a response in opposition to the motion (ECF No. 43), and the defendant replied. (ECF No. 44). Having reviewed the record presented and the applicable law, the court concludes that the defendant's motion for summary judgment should be granted.

BACKGROUND
The following facts are either undisputed or are taken in the light most favorable to Davis, to the extent they find support in the record. In March 2015, Davis started her employment at the Rehabilitation Clinic of the William Jennings Bryan Dorn Medical Center of the [*2]  United States Department of Veterans Affairs ("the Department") as a Medical Support Assistant. Davis suffers from several disabilities, including pain disorder, idiopathic hypersomnia, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, pulmonary embolism and thrombosis, anemia, radiculopathy, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, and chronic headaches. These conditions interfere with Davis's ability to stand, sit, sleep, speak, breath, concentrate, communicate, lift objects, stay awake, work, see, perform manual tasks, and walk.
In June 2015, Davis submitted a written accommodation request to the Department, asking for an ergonomic chair and an ergonomic assessment of her workstation, which was approved by the Department on June 9, 2015. On February 24, 2016, Davis made a verbal request for further accommodations that she later submitted in writing on March 1, 2016. In the written request, Davis indicated that "she was having flareups and blood clots that required her to be able to stand and stretch to alleviate and lessen the chance of blood clots due to immobility and allow her to work with minimal breaks." (Davis Aff. ¶ 4, Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 43-2 at 2.) Davis also indicated she needed to telework sometimes [*3]  for up to three days based on crying spells caused by her depression. Davis requested that she be provided a sit-to-stand desk and be allowed to telework two to three days per week under a standard telework agreement. The Department provided a written response to Davis on June 16, 2016 that denied Davis's request to telework but approved her request for a sit-to-stand desk.
On March 7, 2016, prior the Department's written response, Davis was advised that a sit-to-stand desk could be accommodated. The employee responsible for ordering the desk, Alan Simmerson, was notified on March 10, 2016 that the desk had to be provided. Davis followed up with Simmerson on March 25, 2016, but Simmerson said that he had ordered a single-screen desk when he was supposed to have ordered a double-screen desk. By June 2016, Simmerson still had not ordered the double-screen desk because of an issue with his credit cards that required Simmerson to undergo training. At that time, Davis was suffering a painful exacerbation of her disabilities, including depression and pain that required injections for relief, which necessitated medical leave. In July 2016, Davis received a sit-to-stand desk but it was not [*4]  compatible with her workspace and unusable. Simmerson immediately removed the sit-to-stand desk.
Prior to the arrival of the incompatible sit-to-stand desk, on June 7, 2016, Davis again requested to telework; she also requested to have a "flex schedule" or adjustable hours and a designated parking space. The Department again denied her request to telework but approved a designated parking space for Davis. A Department manager explained to Davis that telework was not compatible with her position because her duties required working in the clinic. Those duties included face-to-face interaction with customers and patients through a communication system that is not operable from outside of the clinic.
Instead, the Department moved Davis from the Rehabilitation Clinic to Nutrition and Food Services on August 8, 2016 to allow Davis to have decreased face-to-face interaction with people, which Davis indicated was another accommodation she would need. At the Nutrition and Food Service clinic, Davis also worked as a Medical Support Assistant and kept her parking space.
In January 2017, Davis accepted a promotion to work as an Advanced Medical Support Assistant in the Primary Care Clinic. Davis [*5]  again kept her parking space, but Davis was made aware that the Primary Care Clinic would require Davis to have more interaction with people. Davis discussed this issue with the EEO Coordinator, Tori Thompson, who told Davis that if Davis had any issues with the increased interaction with people, Davis should tell Thompson. By March 2017, Davis found the new position stressful because of the increased face-to-face interaction with people with minimal breaks, so Davis told Thompson about these issues, but the Department provided no accommodation to Davis because Davis accepted that promotion. Also, Davis was required to rotate desks in this new position, but they were not sit-to-stand desks. No later than April 2017, a sit-to-stand desk was provided that was compatible with her workstation.
In June or July 2017, the Department moved Davis to the Pharmacy, Anti-Coagulation Clinic to accommodate Davis's request to have fewer interactions with people.
Davis filed this action on August 28, 2018, originally raising claims pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., of hostile work environment, failure to accommodate, retaliation, and failure to promote. At this stage, Davis [*6]  is only pursuing a failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act. (Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 43 at 1.)

DISCUSSION

A. Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party "shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A party may support or refute that a material fact is not disputed by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record" or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine [dispute] of material fact." Ballinger v. N.C. Agric. Extension Serv., 815 F.2d 1001, 1005 (4th Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect the disposition of the case under the applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257.
In discrimination [*7]  cases, a party is entitled to summary judgment if no reasonable jury could rule in the non-moving party's favor. Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 645 (4th Cir. 2002). The court cannot make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence, but the court should examine uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence offered by the moving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The court must determine whether a party's offered evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of discrimination and look at the strength of a party's case on its own terms. See id. at 148 (stating that "[c]ertainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational fact-finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory").

B. Methods of Proof in Employment Cases
A plaintiff asserting a claim of unlawful employment discrimination may proceed through two avenues of proof. First, she may attempt directly to prove discrimination with direct or circumstantial evidence. Alternatively, when direct proof is lacking, a plaintiff may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Love-Lane v. Martin, 355 F.3d 766, 786 (4th Cir. 2004) (stating that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, developed for [*8]  Title VII, has been applied to § 1981 claims); Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 202 F.3d 234, 248 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to retaliation claims under Title VII); Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to claims brought under the ADA). Pursuant to this framework, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight, 601 F.3d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 2010) (Title VII). The defendant's burden "is a burden of production, not persuasion." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142. Once a defendant meets this burden by producing affidavits or testimony demonstrating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, "the McDonnell Douglas framework—with its presumptions and burdens—disappear[s], and the sole remaining issue [is] discrimination vel non." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
In other words, if the defendant meets the burden to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason was "not its true reason[], but [was] a pretext for discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294 (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Accordingly, the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating pretext "merges with the [*9]  ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256) (alterations in original); see also Diamond v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 319 (4th Cir. 2005) (Title VII & 42 U.S.C. § 1981). To meet this "merged" burden, the employee may prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision maker's affidavit is untrue or that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.
"[A] plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. However, "if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff create[s] only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred," summary judgment is appropriate. Id. Accordingly, the court must evaluate "the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be [*10]  considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law." Id. at 148-49. "Notwithstanding the intricacies of proof schemes, the core of every [discrimination] case remains the same, necessitating resolution of the ultimate question of . . . whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294-95.

C. The Defendant's Motion
The Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating against its employees based on disability. 29 U.S.C. § 794; Hannah P. v. Coats, 916 F.3d 327, 336 (4th Cir. 2019).1 To establish a prima facie claim based on an alleged failure to accommodate a disability under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she was a qualified person with a disability; (2) the employer had notice of the disability; (3) the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the position with a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer nonetheless refused to make the accommodation. Hannah P., 916 F.3d at 337 (citing Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., 789 F.3d 407, 414 (4th Cir. 2015)). Here, the parties disagree only as to whether the accommodations provided by the Department were reasonable. Specifically, Davis argues that the Department's delay in providing the sit-to-stand desk and refusal to allow Davis to telework were unreasonable.
"[A]t the summary judgment stage, the employee 'need only [*11]  show that an accommodation seems reasonable on its face,' and then the employer 'must show special (typically case-specific) circumstances that demonstrate undue hardship.'" Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 414 (quoting US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002)); see also Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995). Thus, the plaintiff must present evidence from which a jury may infer that the proposed accommodation is reasonable on its face—that is, "ordinarily or in the run of cases." Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 414 ("A reasonable accommodation is one that is feasible or plausible.") (citing Barnett at 402). A reasonable accommodation should provide a meaningful equal employment opportunity—that is, an opportunity to attain the same level of performance as is available to nondisabled employees having similar skills and abilities. Id. at 416. An agency's accommodation can be reasonable even if it is not the exact accommodation requested by the plaintiff. See Hannah P., 916 F.3d at 338 ("The Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to provide the exact accommodation that an employee requests."); Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 415 ("[T]he employer may provide an alternative reasonable accommodation.").
As to the Department's delay in providing Davis with a sit-to-stand desk, the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that the Department provided Davis alternative accommodations that were reasonable. While [*12]  the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has not yet addressed the issue, other courts appear to unanimously agree that an unreasonable delay in providing an accommodation may violate the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA. See McCray v. Wilkie, 966 F.3d 616, 621 (7th Cir. 2020) (Rehabilitation Act); Valle-Arce v. P.R. Ports Auth., 651 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir. 2011) (ADA); Mogenhan v. Napolitano, 613 F.3d 1162, 1168, 392 U.S. App. D.C. 195 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (Rehabilitation Act); Selenke v. Med. Imaging of Co., 248 F.3d 1249, 1262 (10th Cir. 2001) (ADA). In deciding whether a delay was unreasonable, courts consider the totality of the circumstances, including factors such as whether the employer acted in good faith, the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the nature of the disability and accommodation, and whether the employer provided interim or alternative accommodations. See McCray, 966 F.3d at 621; Selenke, 248 F.3d at 1262-63.
Here, no reasonable jury could find that the Department's accommodations were unreasonable. As documented in the Reasonable Accommodation Interactive Process, Davis needed to stand and stretch to alleviate her pain and reduce the chance of blood clots. (Pl.'s Resp., ECF No. 43-1 at 11.) The Department already allowed Davis to leave her work area to stretch and walk, and her request for a sit-to-stand desk was based on her desire to be able to continue to work without the need for breaks. (Id.) Davis asserts that she experienced "daily pain and depression" [*13]  and "anxiety concerning my increased risk of blood clots" while waiting on the desk, but Davis fails to point to any evidence that those conditions were caused by the lack of a sit-to-stand desk, nor does she present any evidence as to why her ability to take breaks to stretch and walk were insufficient to alleviate those problems and allow her to perform at the same level as similarly situated employees. Therefore, the Department's interim accommodations and the nature of Davis's disability in relation to those accommodations weigh in favor of the Department. Moreover, Davis points to no evidence that the Department acted in bad faith in failing to promptly provide the desk. The evidence in the record shows that the Department made mistakes in ordering the desk (originally ordering the wrong size desk and then having problems with the Department's credit cards), but Davis does not point to any evidence of malfeasance or animus. Therefore, the lack of evidence of bad faith and reasons for the delay weigh in the Department's favor.
Finally, while the length of the delay in providing the desk weighs against the Department, the court concludes that no reasonable jury could find based on [*14]  the totality of the circumstances that the Department did not provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, as the Department permitted Davis to take stretch and walk breaks until it provided her a desk. Accordingly, no reasonable jury could find that the Department violated the Rehabilitation Act for failing to promptly provide a desk. See Hannah P., 916 F.3d at 338 ("The Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to provide the exact accommodation that an employee requests."); Reyazuddin, 789 F.3d at 415 ("[T]he employer may provide an alternative reasonable accommodation.").
The Department is also entitled to summary judgment with respect to Davis's claim based on her request to telework. The Department presented unrefuted evidence that Davis's job could not be performed outside of the clinic. See Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 F. App'x 314, 323 (4th Cir. 2011) ("[T]he ADA does not require an employer to reallocate essential job functions or assign an employee permanent light duty.") (internal quotation marks omitted). The Department provided an affidavit from Davis's supervisor, Karen Collins, who swears that Davis's position of Medical Support Assistant requires the employee to have face-to-face interaction with customers or patients as they enter the clinic. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. [*15]  J., Collins Aff. ¶ 5, ECF No. 41-12 at 1-2.) Collins also swears that though some of the job responsibilities involve making phone calls, those calls go through a specific system that cannot be installed or operated outside of the clinic. (Id.) Accordingly, Collins swears that the functional statement for Medical Support Assistants "clearly defines that the position of the MSA is not suitable for telework." (Id.) Therefore, no reasonable jury could find that Davis's request to telework was a reasonable one, as teleworking would have prevented Davis from performing the essential functions of her job.
Davis argues (and swears in an affidavit) that two similarly situated employees were allowed to telework, while Davis was not. (Pl.'s Resp., Davis Aff. ¶¶ 9, 12, ECF No. 43-2 at 4-5.) However, the unrefuted evidence shows that these employees are not valid comparators. See generally Haynes v. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d 219, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2019) ("[T]o establish a valid comparator, the plaintiff must produce evidence that the plaintiff and comparator dealt with the same supervisor, were subject to the same standards and engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's [*16]  treatment of them for it.") (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting Haywood v. Locke, 387 F. App'x 355, 359 (4th Cir. 2010)). The Department again provided an affidavit from Collins, wherein Collins swears that the first proffered comparator was approved for telework by supervisors in a different clinic, but her telework request was disapproved when Collins became her supervisor. (Def.'s Reply, Collins Aff. ¶ 7, ECF No. 44-1 at 2.) Collins also swears that the other proffered comparator held a different position from Davis, and the second employee's position was compatible with telework. (Id. ¶ 8.) While Davis swears that the first employee's telework request was approved by the same individuals that denied Davis's telework request and that the second employee held "the same duties, other than being in a supervisory role," (Davis Aff. ¶ 12, ECF No. 43-2 at 5), Davis provides no admissible evidence contradicting Collins's specific and direct statements that were within Collins's knowledge. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) ("When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on [*17]  a motion for summary judgment."); Thompson v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir. 2002) (stating the non-moving party has "the ultimate burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact for trial" and that "[c]onclusory or speculative allegations do not suffice, nor does a "mere scintilla of evidence" in support of his case") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Therefore, no reasonable jury could find that the Department's denial of Davis's telework request violated the Rehabilitation Act, as Davis's request was not reasonable.

RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, the court recommends the defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted. (ECF No. 41.)
