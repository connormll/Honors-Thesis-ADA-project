ORDER

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On August 28, 2017, Plaintiff Timothy Hamilton ("Hamilton") filed an Amended Complaint alleging that his former employer, Defendant Schneider National Carriers, Inc. ("Schneider"), discriminated against him on the basis of a disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. Am. Compl. [Doc. 3]. On August 10, 2018, Schneider filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. 38]. On January 24, 2019, the Magistrate Judge issued a Final Report and Recommendation ("R&R") recommending that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment be granted. R&R [Doc. 52]. The Order for Service of the R&R [Doc, 53] provided notice that, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the parties were authorized [*2]  to file objections within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of that Order. After obtaining an extension of time, Hamilton filed his objections on February 28, 2019 [Doc. 57] ("Pl.'s Objs.").

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
In reviewing a Magistrate Judge's R&R, the district court "shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made." 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). "Parties filing objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation must specifically identify those findings objected to. Frivolous, conclusive, or general objections need not be considered by the district court." United States v. Schultz, 565 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Marsden v. Moore, 847 F.2d 1536, 1548 (11th Cir. 1988)). Absent objection, the district court judge "may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings and recommendations made by the magistrate judge," 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), and need only satisfy itself that there is no plain error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation. See United States v. Slay, 714 F.2d 1093, 1095 (11th Cir. 1983). In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has conducted a de novo review of those portions of the R&R to which objections have been made and has reviewed the remainder of the R&R for plain error. See Slay, 714 F.2d at 1095.

HL DISCUSSION

A. Failure to Accommodate [*3] 
In Count Two of the Amended Complaint, Hamilton contends that he was a qualified individual with a disability and Schneider failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for that disability. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 51-67. In the R&R, the Magistrate Judge made the following findings, all of which are undisputed:
(1) Schneider operates as a common and contract motor carrier.
(2) Hamilton was hired by Schneider on November 13, 2013, and his primary duty during the relevant time period was operating a van to haul freight for Home Depot.
(3) On June 29, 2015, Hamilton notified Schneider that he "was enduring a lot of stress due to overload of assignments," and, on July 6, 2015, informed a Schneider human resources partner that he suffered from job-related stress.
(4) On July 7, 2015, Hamilton completed a request for leave.
(5) On July 9, 2015, Hamilton received a letter from Schneider informing him of his eligibility for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA").
(6) On July 23, 2015, Schneider received Hamilton's July 21, 2015, FMLA medical certification from his treating physician stating that (a) Hamilton suffered from "extreme stress and fatigue due to work-related stress," and (b) Hamilton [*4]  could return to work on July 27, 2015, as long as he worked no more than 8-9 hours per day and 45-50 hours per week.
(7) Schneider approved Hamilton's FMLA request beginning July 7, 2015, and ending on July 27, 2015.
(8) On August 10, 2015, Hamilton's treating physician completed another FMLA medical certification stating that Hamilton could sit no more than 7-10 hours per day or work more than 8-10 hours per day.
R&R at 4-5, 11-13, 35-37.
It is undisputed that neither the July 21, 2015, nor August 10, 2015, FMLA certifications identified any specific medical condition other than job-related stress. See Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1465 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (concluding that the plaintiff's job-induced stress did not constitute a disability under the ADA) (citing DeWitt v. Carsten, 941 F. Supp. 1232, 1236 (N.D. Ga. 1996), aff'd, 122 F.3d 1079 (11th Cir. 1997)). Hamilton argued that his submissions of his medical certifications setting out restrictions (even though those restrictions did not indicate a disability) "are sufficient to trigger an employer's obligation to engage in the interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made." Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. 44] at 7. The Magistrate Judge concluded that the legal authority cited by Hamilton did not support the argument that "merely by submitting a physician's note in support of his request for FMLA leave [*5]  to address job-related stress, he put Schneider on notice that he had a disability and was requesting a reasonable accommodation for his disability." R&R at 46. See also Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., No. 7:08-CV-156 HL, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118154, 2010 WL 4639279, at *8 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 8, 2010), aff'd sub nom. Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., Dep't of Human Res., Div. of Family & Children Servs., 446 F. App'x 179 (11th Cir. 2011) ("Placing an employee on FMLA leave does not mean that an employer regards the employee as disabled for ADA purposes. . . . [t]he leave provisions of the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the ADA.") (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(a, b)).
In his objections, Hamilton asserts that the Magistrate Judge ignored the doctrine of "constructive knowledge," and again argues that the submission of the medical certifications was enough to put Schneider on notice that required it to engage in an "interactive process" to provide a reasonable accommodation. Pl.'s Objs. at 5-14. But none of the cases cited by Hamilton support the proposition that a physician's certification that an employee is unable to work more than eight hours per day or 45 hours per week constitutes a disability or puts the employer on notice that it should engage in some further "interactive process." See E.E.O.C. v. C.R. England, Inc., 644 F.3d 1028, 1050 (10th Cir. 2011) (affirming grant [*6]  of summary judgment to employer where the employee's "two requests for home time—which were for "family time," rather than his illness—and his after-the-fact, fleeting statement mentioning a need to see his doctor, did not put [the employer] on notice that [the employee] was requesting reasonable accommodation due to his HIV status."); Calero-Cerezo v. U. S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 21 (1st Cir. 2004) (reversing grant of summary judgment to employer where employer was made aware that the plaintiff suffered from, was prescribed medication for, and hospitalized for major depression); Williamson v. Clarke Cty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1321 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (granting the employer's motion for summary judgment where the employee's informal discussion with his supervisor that he had been diagnosed with ADHD did not put employer on notice that he needed to reduce his job duties to accommodate a disability: "The law did not require [the employer] to speculate, guess or assume that plaintiff's issues were disability-related, when he never saw fit to inform them of that link."); Jordan v. City of Union City, 94 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1337 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (finding that evidence that the employer personally observed and received other reports of the employee's acute anxiety raised a disputed issue of fact as to whether the employee was regarded as mentally disabled).
As stated by the Magistrate Judge, "[n]umerous [*7]  courts have held, however, that an inability to work more than eight hours a day does not constitute a disability under the ADA because an employee is not 'substantially limited' in 'one or more major life activities' if the employee is capable of working a typical forty-hour work week." R&R at 47-48 (citing cases). This Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that the FMLA certifications by Hamilton's physician, which stated that Hamilton could not work more than eight hours per day or forty-five hours per week due to job-related stress, did not provide notice to Schneider that Hamilton suffered a mental or physical disability for which a reasonable accommodation was necessary. See R&R at 49-50. Because Hamilton failed to present evidence that Schneider knew about his alleged disability at the time Hamilton allegedly requested an accommodation, the Magistrate Judge was correct in finding that Hamilton failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based upon his failure to accommodate claim.

B. Essential Functions of Hamilton's Job
The Magistrate Judge found that Schneider presented sufficient evidence to establish that it was an essential function for the job performed by Hamilton that [*8]  a van driver was available to work up to fourteen hours per day and up to seventy hours per week, and that Hamilton failed to present any admissible evidence to dispute this fact. R&R at 61. Therefore, even if Schneider did have knowledge of Hamilton's alleged disability at the time of the presentation of his FMLA certifications, Hamilton still failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based upon a failure to accommodate because he was not a "qualified individual" who could perform all the essential functions of his job, with or without an accommodation. Id. at 62.
In his second objection section, Hamilton begins with a heading that states, "The R&R Downplays Evidence That a Reasonable Jury Could use to Infer That The Defendant's Judgment Regarding the Essential Functions of Plaintiff's Job Was Nothing More than An Ad Hoc Invention to Avoid Accommodating the Plaintiff." Pl.'s Objs. at 14. However, rather than referencing the portions of the R&R to which he objects, Hamilton has adopted the same arguments he made to the Magistrate Judge which opposed Schneider's argument contained in its motion for summary judgment that Hamilton was not a "qualified" individual. Compare Pl's Objs. at 14-17 with [*9]  Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 9-11. "[A] party does not state a valid objection to an R&R by merely incorporating by reference previous filings." Hammonds v. Jackson, No. 13-CV-711-MHS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184125, 2015 WL 12866453, at *6 n.2 (ND. Ga. May 18, 2015); see also Marsden, 847 F.2d 1536, 1548 (11th Cir. 1988) ("Parties filing objections to a magistrate's report and recommendation must specifically identify those findings objected to."). There is nothing in this section of Hamilton's objections which calls into question any of the Magistrate Judge's findings or conclusions with respect to the determination that Hamilton was not an otherwise "qualified individual" who could perform all of the essential elements of his position, with or without a reasonable accommodation.
Nevertheless, the Court has considered Hamilton's objections and finds that they do not support a rejection of the Magistrate Judge's findings or conclusions concerning the "qualified individual" determination: (1) To meet Home Depot's needs and demands, van drivers such as Hamilton had to be available to work up to fourteen hours per day and up to seventy hours per eight-day period; (2) Hamilton was not able to work more than 8-10 hours per day according to the restrictions from his physician; and (3) Hamilton [*10]  failed to identify any van driver who was excused from this essential job function.
Consequently, this Court finds that the undisputed facts in the record support the Magistrate Judge's determination that Hamilton also failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on Schneider's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation because Hamilton was not an otherwise "qualified individual."1

IV. CONCLUSION
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Hamilton's objections to the Magistrate Judge's recommendation to grant summary judgment to Schneider [Doc. 57] are OVERRULED.
After reviewing the remainder of the R&R for plain error, the Court ADOPTS the Magistrate Judge's Final Report and Recommendation [Doc. 52] as the Opinion and Order of the Court.
It is hereby ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 38] is GRANTED and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant as to all of Plaintiff's claims in his Amended Complaint.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to close this file.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 7th day of March, 2019.
