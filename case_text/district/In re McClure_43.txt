CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS: IN CHAMBERS - FINAL RULING ON MOTION TO DISMISS BANKRUPTCY APPEAL [11]
Attached hereto is the Court's Final Ruling on Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Appeal.
Final Ruling on Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Appeal
John P. Reitman ("Appellee"), as Chapter 11 Trustee for the bankruptcy estate (the "Estate") of Shirley Ann McClure ("Appellant"), moves to dismiss Appellant's appeal from an order denying Appellant's motion, filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the "Bankruptcy Court"), for reconsideration of an earlier order approving a settlement. See generally Motion for Order Dismissing Appeal as Untimely ("MTD"), Docket No. 11; see also Notice of Appeal and Statement of Election ("Appeal"), Docket No. 1; [*2]  Order Denying Debtor's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Approving the Settlement with Barrett S. Litt, et al., Case No. 1:13-bk-10386-GM, Docket No. 1615.

I. Background
On March 27, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order denying Appellant's motion for reconsideration of the Bankruptcy Court's prior order, entered on October 23, 2018, granting Appellee's motion to approve a global settlement of: (1) the Estate's claims against Barrett S. Litt ("Litt") and certain related defendants in McClure v. Litt, pending before the Los Angeles County Superior Court as Case No. BC 393584; (2) Litt's secured claims in Appellant's bankruptcy case; and (3) certain consolidated actions pending before this Court, see 2:14-cv-07640-GW. See MTD at 4-5; id., Exs. A, B. The Bankruptcy Court heard Appellant's motion the previous day on March 26, and at the time indicated the court's intent to deny Appellant's motion. See id., Ex. C at 1. The court orally informed Appellant that Appellant could file her appeal immediately, "even though . . . [the] . . . order . . . [was not] . . . up there yet." Id. But, that court further advised Appellant that once the order was entered, Appellant would only have [*3]  fourteen days to file her appeal. See id. Appellant filed her Appeal in both this Court and the Bankruptcy Court on April 11, 2019, 15 days after the Bankruptcy Court entered its order. See Appeal; Docket No. 1; Docket No. 11, Ex. B.
On April 22, 2019, Appellant filed an Emergency Application for Stay, including a Request for Temporary Restraining Order. See Appellant's Emergency Application for Stay, Docket No. 9. This Court denied Appellant's application for a stay pending appeal because Appellant "has no chance of success in her appeal, because the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case." Order Denying Request for Temporary Restraining Order ("TRO Order"), Docket No. 15. Prior to this Court's order denying Appellant's application for a stay pending appeal, Appellee moved for an order dismissing the appeal as untimely. See generally MTD. Appellant filed an Opposition to Appellee's MTD. See Amended Appellant's Opposition to Appellee's Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Appeal ("Opp."), Docket No. 18. Appellee filed a reply. See Reply in Support of Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Appeal ("Rep."), Docket No. 20.

II. Legal Standard
A final order [*4]  or judgment of a bankruptcy court may be appealed to a federal district court. 28 U.S.C. § 158. Section 158 provides that an appeal of a bankruptcy court order shall be taken "in the time provided by Rule 8002 of the Bankruptcy Rules." 28 U.S.C. § 158(c)(2). Rule 8002, in turn, provides that a "notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed." Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a)(1). Further, Rule 8002 provides that a "bankruptcy court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party's motion that is filed: (A) within the time prescribed by this rule; or (2) within 21 days after that time, if the party shows excusable neglect." Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(d)(1) (emphasis added). Similarly, Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) also enables a bankruptcy court, more generally, to enlarge the time allowed or required for an act to be done: "(1) . . . if the request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed; or (2) on motion made after the expiration of the specified period . . . where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect." Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(1). However, Rule 9006(b)(3) indicates that any enlargement of time for taking action under Rule 8002 is available (under Rule 9006) "only to the extent and under the conditions stated" in Rule 8002. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006(b)(3).
The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that the deadline for filing [*5]  a notice of appeal under Rule 8002 is jurisdictional. See, e.g., Ozenne v. Chase Manhattan Bank (In re Ozenne), 841 F.3d 810, 814 (9th Cir. 2016) (finding that BAP lacked jurisdiction to consider any appeal because the appellant did not file a timely appeal); Delaney v. Alexander (In re Delaney), 29 F.3d 516, 518 (9th Cir. 1994) (affirming district court's ruling that the notice of appeal filed 13 days late was not timely despite clerk's failure to mail copy and notice of entry of order as parties have an affirmative duty to monitor the dockets to inform themselves); Anderson v. Mouradick (In re Mouradick), 13 F.3d 326, 327 (9th Cir. 1994) ("The provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 8002 are jurisdictional; the untimely filing of a notice of appeal deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court's order."); In re Souza, 795 F.2d 855, 857 (9th Cir. 1986) (vacating district court's judgment and remanding case for dismissal because notice of appeal was not timely filed under Rule 8002); see also Wilkins v. Menchaca (In re Wilkins), 587 B.R. 97, 107 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2018) ("[T]he 14-day time deadline in Rule 8002(a) is a jurisdictional requirement that acts as an immutable constraint on [the] authority to consider and hear appeals."). Moreover, the parties have an affirmative duty to "monitor the dockets to inform themselves of the entry of orders they may wish to appeal." In re Delaney, 29 F.3d at 518 (quoting In re Sweet Transfer & Storage, Inc., 896 F.2d 1189, 1193 (9th Cir. 1990)). Thus, the failure to file a timely appeal means that a court cannot hear that appeal and review the bankruptcy court's order. See Ramsey v. Ramsey (In re Ramsey), 612 F.2d 1220, 1222 (9th Cir. 1980); see also Wiersma v. Bank of the W. (In re Wiersma), 483 F.3d 933, 938 (9th Cir. 2007). Because timeliness of filing [*6]  an appeal is jurisdictional, courts lack authority to create equitable exceptions. See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007); see also Melendres v. Maricopa Cty., 815 F.3d 645, 649 (9th Cir. 2016) ("[W]e are not at liberty to overlook a defect with the notice of appeal no matter how compelling an appellant's argument may be."); Weilert v. Salven (In re Weilert), 17-cv-984-LJO, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75258, 2018 WL 2064127 at *2 (E.D. Cal. May 3, 2018) (dismissing appeal when notice of appeal was filed one day late).
Nevertheless, as a limited exception to the jurisdictional requirement, the unique circumstances doctrine allows an appellate court to consider an untimely appeal where "a court has affirmatively assured a party that its appeal will be timely." See In re Mouradick, 13 F.3d at 329. The Supreme Court has held that the doctrine "applies only where a party has performed an act which, if properly done, would postpone the deadline for filing [her] appeal and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done." Osterneck v. Ernst & Whinney, 489 U.S. 169, 179, 109 S. Ct. 987, 103 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1989); see also Wiersma, 483 F.3d at 940. In other words, the unique circumstances doctrine requires detrimental reliance on a clear and unambiguous assurance by the court. See In re Slimick, 928 F.2d 304, 310 (9th Cir. 1990).

III. Discussion
In his Motion to Dismiss, Appellee argues that Appellant's failure to file a timely appeal deprives this Court of jurisdiction, and that the Court must therefore dismiss the appeal. See MTD at 6. Appellee further argues [*7]  that Appellant's untimeliness does not fall within the unique circumstances doctrine. See id. In her Opposition, Appellant argues that the Court should deny Appellee's motion because: (1) Appellant's failure to timely file was excusable neglect; (2) Appellant has unique and extraordinary circumstances; and (3) Appellant is a physically handicapped person and should be afforded a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). See Opp. at 2.
In support of Appellant's argument for excusable neglect, Appellant cites three cases, none of which are applicable. Appellant first cites Pincay v. Andrews, 389 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc), for the proposition that the Ninth Circuit recognizes excusable neglect in the context of untimely-filed appeals. See Opp. at 6. Appellant also cites Pioneer Investment Services v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 113 S. Ct. 1489, 123 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993), for the Supreme Court's use of a four-factor balancing test to determine whether an untimely filing resulted from excusable neglect. See Opp. at 6. The Court first notes that in Pioneer, the Supreme Court was interpreting Rule 9006 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. See Pioneer Inv. Servs. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 382, 113 S. Ct. 1489, 123 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9006. The Supreme Court therein states that "Rule 9006(b)(1) empowers a bankruptcy court to permit a late filing if the movant's failure to comply with an earlier deadline was the result of excusable neglect." Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 382 (emphasis added). Thus, Pioneer is not instructive [*8]  here in this case, as Appellant did not file a motion with the bankruptcy court to permit her untimely filing. Moreover, even if Rule 9006 was not limited, in its terms, to a bankruptcy court's ability to extend an applicable deadline, Rule 9006(b)(3) indicates that any Rule 8002 extension under Rule 9006 is limited by Rule 8002's terms. Rule 8002 does explicitly limit that extension power to the "bankruptcy court." Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(d)(1).
In Pincay, the appellee missed a deadline to file an appeal in the district court, as required by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; however as soon as the appellee learned of his error, the appellee promptly tendered a notice of appeal with a request for an extension, within the 30-day grace period. See Pincay v. Andrews, 389 F.3d 853, 854-5 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc). The court applied the Pioneer test and affirmed the district court's order granting the appellee's motion for an extension of time because the delay was due to excusable neglect. See id. at 860. Two points are relevant with respect to Pincay and its inapplicability here. First, the Pincay court was considering a motion for an extension of time filed in the proper court to hear that motion. Second, the appellee filed a request for an extension within the applicable grace period. Here, Appellant is seeking an extension of [*9]  time in the federal district court, as opposed to the bankruptcy court, and Appellant did not file a request for an extension of time to appeal with the bankruptcy court or within the applicable grace period.1
The Bankruptcy Court entered the Order denying McClure's request for reconsideration on March 27, 2019. Bankruptcy Rule 8002's fourteen-day period in which to file a notice of appeal expired on April 10, 2019. McClure filed her Notice of Appeal from the Order on April 11, 2019. Under Bankruptcy Rules 9006(b) and 8002(d)(1), Appellant could have sought an extension of time for filing her Notice of Appeal, based upon excusable neglect, by way of a motion brought in the Bankruptcy Court. However, the last day Appellant could have filed such a motion with the Bankruptcy Court was May 1, 2019; and she failed to do so. The excusable neglect standard, therefore, does not apply here.
Appellant also argues that her unique and extraordinary circumstances constitute excusable neglect. See Opp. at 6. As noted above, the unique circumstances doctrine contemplates express and explicit assurances from the court that an appeal will be timely and detrimental reliance. Nothing in the record indicates that the Bankruptcy Court assured Appellant that [*10]  filing an appeal beyond 14 days after the Bankruptcy Court entered its order would nevertheless be timely. To the contrary, the transcript from the Bankruptcy Court's hearing on March 26, 2019 evidences that the court expressly informed and warned Appellant of the time restraints governing an appeal of the issued ruling. See MTD, Ex. C. The court further informed Appellant that she need not wait until the court formally entered its order. See id. To wit, the court notified Appellant that she could file an appeal immediately.2 Thus, Appellant received no assurances from the court regarding any act that would toll or delay the appeal filing deadline, and thus, Appellant could not have detrimentally relied on any such representations or assurances by the court.3 The Court finds the unique circumstances doctrine inapplicable.
Finally, Appellant argues that allowing the Appeal to proceed would be a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). The ADA does not apply to federal courts. See Henrickson v. Potter, 327 F.3d 444, 447 (5th Cir. 2003) ("[T]he entire federal government is excluded from the coverage of the ADA."); Hollingsworth v. Duff, 444 F.Supp.2d 61, 64 (D.D.C. 2006) (stating that the Rehabilitation Act, applicable to federal agencies and federally funded institutions, does not cover judicial [*11]  branch agencies); Zingher v. Vt. Div. of Voc. Rehabilitation, 30 F.Supp.2d 446, 452 (D. Vt. 1997) (finding that the ADA does not apply to federal executive agencies and noting that federal courts are not subject to the ADA requirements because the ADA's definition of "public entities" is limited to state and local governments and their instrumentalities); Sheridan v. Michels (In re Disciplinary Proceedings), 282 B.R. 79, 92 n.15 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2002) (stating that the ADA is not applicable to the federal courts because the ADA definition of a public entity includes only state and local governments), vacated on other grounds by Sheridan v. Michels (In re Sheridan), 362 F.3d 96 (1st Cir. 2004). Thus, the Court is not obligated by the ADA to consider whether a jurisdictional waiver would be proper or even permissible as an "accommodation."
In addition to the above, the Court also notes that it has already issued an order stating that this Court lacks jurisdiction. See TRO Order. The Court denied Appellant's order for a stay pending appeal, explaining that Appellant had "no chance of success in her Appeal because the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case." Id.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Appellee's Motion to Dismiss, thereby terminating this Appeal.
