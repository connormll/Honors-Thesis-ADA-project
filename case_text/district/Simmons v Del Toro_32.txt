Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
[ECF No. 67]
Plaintiffs Donald Simmons, James Triplett, Therrel Gatling, and Paul Gonzales are current or former Police Officer (Instructors) with the U.S. Navy who claim their employer discriminated [*2]  against them because of their disabilities. Defendant, Carlos Del Toro, Secretary of the Navy, moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendant.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Between 2009 and 2010, Plaintiffs were hired as Police Officer (Instructors) at Commander, Navy Region Southwest ("CNRSW") in the Grade Series 0083 ("GS-0083") Police Series.1 ECF No. 67-2 at 27, 66, 168, 170-71, 116-117. The Position Description ("PD") for Plaintiffs' position sets forth their major duties and responsibilities, which include serving as a "resident subject matter expert [] and resource person" in various law enforcement topics, preparing up-to-date course materials, and teaching courses. ECF No. 67-3 at 56-57. The Parties agree that, for purposes of applicable federal law, Plaintiffs have physical disabilities. Plaintiffs allege discrimination stemming from various changes to their PD during their tenure.

A. 2012 PD Modifications
In September 2011, the Navy terminated its contract with Lockheed Martin, pursuant to which Lockheed Martin had agreed to transport ammunition for approximately five years. ECF [*3]  No. 67-4 at 19, 21, 44. To cover the gap, sometime in 2012, the Navy changed the Police Officer (Instructor) PD, requiring Plaintiffs to obtain a commercial driver's license ("CDL") and move ammunition (the "2012 PD Modifications"). Id. at 18, 21; 67-6 at 36.
In December 2012, Plaintiffs submitted their first "reasonable accommodation" ("RA") requests to the Navy, seeking to be excused from the 2012 PD Modifications in light of their disabilities. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 30, 521; 67-3 at 6, 19, 31. The Navy granted Plaintiffs' RA requests, placing them on a newly created "special accommodation PD" No. Z8990, that did not require Plaintiffs to obtain a CDL. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 31-32, 74-75 178-79, 201; 67-6 at 36-37. On May 28, 2013, PD Z8990 underwent a "pen and ink" change,2 thereby removing the requirement to obtain a CDL and drive explosive or hazardous materials. ECF No. 67-3 at 65, 70. Effective June 16, 2013, Plaintiffs were officially placed on PD Z8990. ECF Nos. 67-4 at 26; 67-2 at 31.3
Around the same time their RA requests were granted, Simmons, Triplett, and Gonzales filed formal EEO Complaints, ECF Nos. 67-2 at 521; 67-3 at 6, 19, 31, alleging [*4]  disability discrimination based on the 2012 PD Modifications, and with respect to Simmons and Gonzales, the anticipated denial of their RA requests, ECF No. 67-4 at 8, 29, 32.4 The Navy issued final agency decisions ("FADs") on all three complaints. Id. The Navy's FAD with respect to Simmons noted that his RA request had already been granted and found that he had failed to prove any discrimination. Id. at 26-27. The Navy's FAD with respect to Triplett likewise found that he had failed to prove discrimination. Id. at 49. The Navy advised both Simmons and Triplett of their right to file a lawsuit in federal court within 90 days of the FAD, id. at 4, 34-35, but neither Simmons nor Triplett did so. Finally, with respect to Gonzales, the Navy found that his complaint regarding the anticipated denial of his RA request was moot because it had already been granted. Id. at 29. The Navy also dismissed Gonzales's complaint regarding the 2012 PD Modifications as untimely because Gonzales had failed to initiate contact within 45 days of the matter alleged to be discriminatory, as required by EEO regulations. Id. Although he had previously submitted an RA request, it appears Gatling did not file [*5]  a formal EEO complaint.5

B. 2017 PD Modifications
In 2017, the Navy again modified Plaintiffs' PD, requiring Police Officer (Instructors) to: (i) pass an annual Physical Agility Test ("PAT"),6 (ii) work in the field, which included two "sustainment watches"7 per month totaling 16 hours, and (iii) attend the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center ("FLETC") or obtain a standards compliance approval from Commander, Navy Installations Command for the FLETC training (the "2017 PD Modifications"). ECF No. 67-5 at 2 ¶ 6.
The decision to modify Plaintiffs' PD originated in 2016, when Matthew Crews, the CNRSW Force Protection Director at the time, determined that the Navy needed greater flexibility with their instructors to cover staffing dips, supplement existing security forces during emergencies or drills, and ensure that instructors kept abreast of current police tactics. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 390-95; see also 67-5 at 2 ¶¶ 4-5 (Crews declaration referencing "constantly evolving threats against the United States" and "the need for Police Office (Instructors) to be fluent in the current security challenges facing Navy installations"). Crews stated that he was the "sole decision-maker" [*6]  with respect to the 2017 PD Modifications. ECF No. 73-1 at 20.
The 2017 PD Modifications were not effective until after December 2017, when the Navy completed "impact and implementation bargaining" concerning the 2017 PD Modifications with the Fraternal Order of Police ("FOP"). ECF No. 67-2 at 475, 483; see also id. at 215 (collective bargaining agreement provision precluding Navy from implementing any new regulation, policy, or practice within its discretion without first giving FOP the opportunity to "bargain concerning the . . . impact and implementation of the change").
After the 2017 PD Modifications went into effect, all Plaintiffs submitted RA requests and filed EEO complaints. The results of that process are different for each Plaintiff.

1. Simmons and Triplett
In March 2018, Simmons and Triplett filed RA requests seeking to be excluded from the 2017 PD Modifications. ECF No. 67-2 at 37, 488, 491, 506. In December 2018, the Navy denied both RA requests finding that Simmons and Triplett could not perform the essential functions of the Police Officer (Instructor) role, even with accommodations, and were therefore not qualified for their positions. Id. at 496, 506. The Navy nonetheless [*7]  offered to assist Simmons and Triplett in a job search for an alternative position "at your current grade or lower, within the commuting area for which you are qualified within CNRSW, if such a vacancy exists." Id. Simmons and Triplett declined the offer. Id. at 498-99, 508-09. On March 22, 2019, the Navy terminated them for medical inability to perform. Id. at 49, 91-92, 95, 501, 511.

2. Gatling
Sometime in 2019, Gatling submitted a RA request to be excused from the sustainment watches required by the 2017 PD Modifications. Id. at 132. The Navy did not grant Gatling's initial RA request, but successfully reassigned him to another position. In April 2020, Gatling accepted an accommodation to be reassigned as a "Materials Handler [] (Fork lift operator — Motor Vehicle Operator)." Id. at 135. In his new role, Gatling receives "safe pay," which ensures that he will never be paid less than he was as a Police Officer (Instructor). Id. Gatling perceives his new role as a demotion. See ECF No. 70-5 ¶¶ 1, 4 (declaring that his new role is a "far less desirable job in the warehouse," "at a substantially lower grade/classification," for which he has "no ability to [receive] pay grade increases [*8]  in the GS classification" or "work in Guard Services").

3. Gonzales
In May 2019, Gonzales submitted an RA request because he was diabetic and suffered from plantar fasciitis and knee pain. ECF No. 67-2 at 183-86. At his deposition, Gonzales could not specify exactly what accommodations he requested in May 2019 and testified that the "decision as far as accommodations . . . would be up to my supervisors or RA coordinator or my doctors." ECF No. 67-2 at 186-87. He apparently wrote in his RA request that he "did not want to do the police duties." Id. at 187.8 On November 8, 2019, the Navy approved Gonzales's RA request, authorizing him to take the alternate PAT, and consume food and take breaks during sustainment watches. Id. at 494.

4. EEO Complaints
All Plaintiffs made initial contact with an EEO counselor regarding the 2017 PD Modifications on February 5, 2018. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 518; 67-3 at 3, 16, 28. On May 2, 2018, Plaintiffs filed formal EEO complaints. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 516; 67-3 at 4, 14, 26. The EEO complaints attached virtually identical narratives which recited allegations regarding the 2012 PD Modifications and brought new claims of discrimination related to the 2017 PD Modifications. [*9]  In May 2019, before the Navy was able to issue FADs, Plaintiffs withdrew from the EEO process, electing instead to file this lawsuit. ECF No. 67-3 at 39, 43, 47, 51.

C. Gonzales's Shoulder Injury
In September 2019 — after the original Complaint in this case was filed — Gonzales suffered a shoulder injury while performing baton training. ECF No. 67-2 at 180. In November 2019, he aggravated the injury after attempting to complete the PAT. Id. at 181. Gonzales submitted another RA request on December 10, 2019, seeking to be exempt from the annual PAT and from providing task direction in field activities in light of his recent injury. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 188-89; 67-4 at 56. On March 12, 2020, Gonzales sought reassignment as an accommodation, but the Navy determined there were no vacant positions that could accommodate Gonzales's medical restrictions. ECF No. 67-4 at 56. On August 31, 2020, the Navy formally denied Gonzales's RA request, and on December 18, 2020, terminated him for medical inability to perform. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 194-95; 67-4 at 56, 60. In January 2021, Gonzales filed a formal EEO complaint, ECF No. 67-6 at 19, and an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"), id. [*10]  at 4, related to his shoulder injury.
In July 2021, Gonzales obtained a doctor's note stating he had recovered from his shoulder injury. ECF No. 67-4 at 64. The note included the doctor's opinion that Gonzales was no longer incapacitated to perform the essential duties of his position, id., and stated that Gonzales "may return to work as soon as possible, without limitations or accommodations," id. at 66.
On October 12, 2021, Gonzales and the Navy executed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the Navy agreed, inter alia, to reinstate Gonzales as Police Officer (Instructor) and pay a lump sum equal to Gonzales's retroactive salary from August 5, 2021 until his reinstatement. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 197; 67-5 at 5. Gonzales agreed to "[w]ithdraw and dismiss with prejudice" his MSPB appeal and formal EEO complaint. ECF No. 67-5 at 6. He further released all claims against the Navy related to his employment occurring prior to the effective date of the settlement agreement, "[o]ther than the claims excluded from this Agreement, (federal law suit, case no. 19CV1448-TWR (WVG) or the claims contained therein)." See also id. at 5 ("This Agreement is not intended to have any preclusive effect on [*11]  his federal law suit, case no. 19CV1448-TWR (WVG) or the claims contained therein."). The settlement also required Gonzales to "[r]efrain from initiating or instituting any other actions, charges, complaints, class actions, appeals, inquiries or other proceedings, against [the Navy], with respect to any matters between Mr. Gonzales and the Navy that occurred prior to the effective date of this Agreement." Id. at 6. Gonzales was reinstated with the Navy on January 31, 2022. ECF No. 67-2 at 169.

II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on August 1, 2019, bringing eighteen counts, including a cause of action under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq. ("Rehabilitation Act"), against the Secretary of the Navy, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other entities. ECF No. 1. On August 18, 2020, the Court dismissed without prejudice every cause of action except Plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act claim and every Defendant except the Secretary of the Navy. ECF No. 11.
On September 18, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint, bringing three causes of action, including a Rehabilitation Act claim, against the same Defendants, including those the Court had previously dismissed without prejudice. ECF No. 12. On November 18, 2020, Plaintiffs filed [*12]  a Second Amended Complaint bringing nine causes of action against the same Defendants. ECF No. 17. After the parties met and conferred, ECF No. 22 at 3, Plaintiffs agreed to file a Third Amended Complaint (the "TAC"), stating a single Rehabilitation Act claim against only the Secretary of the Navy, ECF No. 24. The TAC is the operative complaint. Defendant answered the TAC on March 24, 2021. ECF No. 26.
On July 18, 2022, Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims, ECF No. 67, which is fully briefed, ECF Nos. 70 (opposition brief); 73 (reply). The Court heard oral argument on Defendant's motion on January 19, 2023.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Court "shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is material when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
The movant always bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The [*13]  moving party can satisfy this burden by: (1) presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Id. at 322-23. "Disputes over irrelevant or unnecessary facts will not preclude a grant of summary judgment." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).
If the movant fails to discharge this initial burden, summary judgment must be denied, and the court need not consider the nonmoving party's evidence. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). If the moving party meets this initial burden, however, the nonmoving party cannot defeat summary judgment merely by demonstrating "that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); see also Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995) ("The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient." (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 242, 252)). Rather, the nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings" and by "the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file," designate "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).
When making this determination, the court must view all inferences [*14]  drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. "Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, [when] he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Exhaustion Of Administrative Remedies
Defendant first argues that, due to the exhaustion requirements of the Rehabilitation Act as applied to this case, only incidents that occurred on or after December 22, 2017 are timely and may serve as the basis for Plaintiffs' claims. ECF No. 67 at 21. This would exclude as untimely, for example, allegations related to the 2012 PD Modifications. The Court agrees.
"A federal employee asserting a claim of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act must exhaust administrative remedies before filing a civil action in district court." Bullock v. Berrien, 688 F.3d 613, 616 (9th Cir. 2012). The aggrieved employee must first file an informal complaint by "initiat[ing] contact with a[n EEOC] Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action." 29 C.F.R.§ 1614.105(a)(1). "If an informal resolution is not achieved, the employee must then [*15]  file a formal complaint for decision by an ALJ." Bullock, 688 F.3d at 616; see also 29 C.F.R. §§ 1614.105(d), 1614.106. After the employee's agency issues a final agency decision, the employee may appeal the decision to the EEOC within 30 days of the final agency decision, id. §1614.402(a), or file a federal civil action within 90 days of the final agency decision (or after 180 days from filing of the formal complaint, if the agency has not taken any action after that time). 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(c); 29 C.F.R. 1614.407(a)-(b); Bullock 688 F.3d at 616.
Plaintiffs made initial contact with an EEO counselor on February 5, 2018. ECF Nos. 67-2 at 518; 67-3 at 3, 16, 28. They subsequently filed formal EEO Complaints on May 2, 2018, ECF Nos. 67-2 at 516; 67-3 at 4, 14, 26, and, after waiting the requisite 180 days, withdrew from the administrative process before the agency issued a FAD, and timely filed this lawsuit, ECF No. 67-3 at 39, 43, 47, 51. Plaintiffs have therefore sufficiently exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to discriminatory acts beginning 45 days prior to Plaintiffs' initial contact with the EEO counselor, i.e., December 22, 2017. Any claims with respect to alleged discriminatory acts before that date are untimely.
Plaintiffs argue they are still entitled to bring claims related to alleged discrimination [*16]  dating back to 2012 for two reasons. They contend, first, that the totality of discriminatory acts beginning in 2012 is a "continuing violation" that extends into the limitations period because those acts "were part of the defendant's alleged policy, pattern, and practice," ECF No. 70 at 21-22, and second, that they are entitled to equitable tolling, id. at 22-23. Both arguments are unavailing.
"The doctrine of continuing violations . . . is actually a conglomeration of several different ideas," the essence of which is that "when a defendant's conduct is part of a continuing practice, an action is timely so long as the last act evidencing the continuing practice falls within the limitations period." Bird v. Dep't of Hum. Servs., 935 F.3d 738, 746 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Williams v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 665 F.2d 918, 924 (9th Cir. 1982; Tearpock-Martini v. Borough of Shickshinny, 756 F.3d 232, 236 (3d Cir. 2014)) (internal citations omitted). The Ninth Circuit previously recognized two applications of the continuing violations doctrine: "first, to 'a series of related acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period,' and second, to 'the maintenance of a discriminatory system both before and during [the limitations] period.'" Bird, 935 F.3d at 746 (quoting Gutowsky v. County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997)).
In Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), the Supreme Court limited the serial acts prong of the continuing violations doctrine, holding that "discrete discriminatory acts [*17]  are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges. Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). The Ninth Circuit has applied Morgan to abrogate not only the serial acts prong but also generally the systematic prong of the continuing violations doctrine. Bird, 935 F.3d at 747-48 ("[W]e have applied Morgan [] to abrogate the systematic branch of the continuing violations doctrine as well"). "Thus, after Morgan [], little remains of the continuing violations doctrine." Id. at 748.
Morgan left open the question of whether the systematic prong of the continuing violation doctrine survives with respect to "pattern-or-practice" claims. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 123 n.9. To prove such a claim, plaintiffs must "establish by a preponderance of the evidence that [] discrimination was the company's standard operating procedure[,] the regular rather than the unusual practice." Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1977). But for purposes of the systematic prong of the continuing violation doctrine, the pattern-or-practice theory has been applied only to class actions, not individualized claims. See Bird, 935 F.3d at 748 ("[W]hile we have left room for the systematic branch to apply to class-wide pattern-or-practice claims . . . we have consistently [*18]  refused to apply the systematic branch to rescue individualized claims that are otherwise time-barred.") (internal citations omitted).9
Here, Plaintiffs are pursuing individualized rather than class action claims. Furthermore, in addressing the continuing violation doctrine, Plaintiffs do not state that they are in fact advancing a pattern-or-practice claim. ECF No. 70 at 21-22.10 The continuing violation doctrine does not apply.11
Nor does equitable tolling apply on the facts of this case. In general, the time periods for bringing an EEO complaint are subject to equitable doctrines such as tolling. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113. Such doctrines "are to be applied sparingly." Id. "Equitable tolling applies when the plaintiff is prevented from asserting a claim by wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, or when extraordinary circumstances beyond the plaintiff's control made it impossible to file a claim on time." Stoll v. Runyon, 165 F.3d 1238, 1242 (9th Cir. 1999). Plaintiffs fail to proffer any evidence that the Navy prevented Plaintiffs from asserting a claim or that exigent circumstances made it impossible to file this lawsuit. Plaintiffs' briefing cites cases for the proposition that "mental incompetence constitutes a ground for equitable [*19]  tolling," ECF No. 70 at 23, but does not assert that Plaintiffs were mentally incompetent. Plaintiffs have not established that this doctrine applies.12
The Court thus concludes that Plaintiffs' claims with respect to allegedly discriminatory acts occurring prior to December 22, 2017 are time-barred.13

B. Adverse Employment Action As To Plaintiff Gonzales
Next, Defendant argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on the claim of Plaintiff Gonzales — who of the four defendants is the only one currently employed as a Police Officer (Instructor) — because "the Navy granted his May 2019 request for accommodation, which is the only accommodation request at issue in this lawsuit." ECF No. 67 at 17. Defendant also notes that after the initial filing of this lawsuit, Gonzales sustained a shoulder injury, which led to another request for accommodation, an initial denial of that request, a separation from federal employment, an administrative appeal by Gonzales and new EEO complaint, a reinstatement of Gonzales with back pay, and a settlement agreement. ECF No. 67 at 24-25. Defendant asserts that "Gonzales's shoulder-related accommodation request, separation, MSPB appeal and second EEO complaint [*20]  are not part of this lawsuit." Id. at 25. Defendant adds that Gonzales was represented throughout those administrative processes by separate counsel and reached a separate resolution pursuant to which he released those claims. Id.
Gonzales does not respond to, or deny, Defendant's assertion that the Navy granted Gonzales's May 2019 request for accommodation. Instead, he argues that in settling his claim relating to his post-lawsuit shoulder injury, he was not releasing any claims in this case: "As part of negotiating his resinstatement, Mr. Gonzales signed a settlement agreement wherein he released claims relating to his firing, but not the claims in this lawsuit. To this end, paragraph 1 of the release agreement . . . specifically provides that this pending lawsuit is exempted from the scope of that agreement." ECF No. 70 at 16.14
Gonzales's response simply ignores the substance of Defendant's summary judgment argument. Even if his release agreement carved out and did not release his claim in the current lawsuit, this does not mean his claim in the current lawsuit must therefore survive summary judgment. Gonzales admits that he is currently employed as a Police Officer [*21]  (Instructor) and that "[h]e was allowed an accommodation to walk as opposed to run the physical agility test which he passed." ECF No. 70 at 8. Gonzales has failed to meaningfully respond to Defendant's argument, to meaningfully oppose Defendant's request for summary judgment, or to articulate a valid legal and factual basis for his claim. The Court therefore grants summary judgment to Defendant as to the claim of Plaintiff Gonzales.

C. Rehabilitation Act Claim As To Simmons, Triplett, and Gatling

1. The McDonnell Douglas Framework
The Parties agree that the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies here. See also Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 49-54 (2003) (applying McDonnell Douglas to ADA disability discrimination claim); Mustafa v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1175-76 (9th Cir. 1998) (applying McDonnell Douglas to Rehabilitation Act claim); ECF No. 67 at 25 (Defendant's brief); ECF No. 70 at 19 (Plaintiffs' opposition).
Under that framework, a "plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Raytheon, 540 U.S. at 50 n.3. "To state a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she is a person with a disability, (2) who is otherwise qualified for employment, and (3) suffered discrimination because of her disability." Walton v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 492 F.3d 998, 1005 (9th Cir. 2007) (superseded by statute on other grounds).
"The requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a  [*22] prima facie case . . . on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence. The plaintiff need only offer evidence which gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal quotations omitted). Additionally, "the elements and contours of a prima facie case will differ according to the facts at hand," and a plaintiff may establish discrimination "through comparison to similarly situated individuals, or any other circumstances 'surrounding the adverse employment action [that] give rise to an inference of discrimination.'" Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 358 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir. 2004)).
Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "[t]he burden of production, but not persuasion, then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action." Chuang v. Univ. of California Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1123-24 (9th Cir. 2000). "If defendant meets this burden, plaintiffs must then raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's proffered reasons for their terminations are mere pretext for unlawful discrimination." Hawn, 615 F.3d at 1155. "A plaintiff can show pretext directly, by showing that discrimination more likely motivated the employer, or indirectly, by showing that the employer's explanation [*23]  is unworthy of credence." Vasquez v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 641 (9th Cir. 2003).

2. Application
In their operative pleading, the TAC, Plaintiffs allege disparate treatment in violation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act: "The plaintiffs claim that their respective record of disability was the reason for the defendants' decision to discharge them or to otherwise engage in adverse employment actions towards each of them." ECF No. 24 at ¶ 187. "Liability in a disparate-treatment case depends on whether the protected trait . . . actually motivated the employer's decision." Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 52, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003).
The Parties' briefing does not dispute that Simmons, Triplett, and Gatling have one or more physical disabilities; that they were medically unable to perform one or more functions of the Police Officer (Instructor) position,15 as that PD was updated in late 2017; and that as a result of that inability, Simmons and Triplett were ultimately terminated and Gatling was assigned to a different position. It is also undisputed that during their tenures, Simmons, Triplett, and Gatling did their jobs without any discipline, reprimands, or negative performance evaluations.
The Parties dispute whether Simmons, Triplett, and Gatling were "qualified" to do the Police Officer (Instructor) job after that position [*24]  was modified in 2017, an element of a plaintiff's prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas. An individual is qualified if "the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).16 Essential functions are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires," and the term "does not include the marginal functions of the position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, without limitation:
(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;
(ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job;
(iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function;
(iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function;
(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;
(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or
(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3). However, "the essential function inquiry is [*25]  not conducted as of an individual's hire date." Hennagir v. Utah Dep't of Corr., 587 F.3d 1255, 1262 (10th Cir. 2009). "The ADA does not limit an employer's ability to establish or change the content, nature, or functions of a job. [The court] must look instead to whether a job function was essential at the time it was imposed on [plaintiff]." Id. (internal citation omitted).
Defendant claims that the 2017 PD Modifications were essential functions. Defendant offers the declaration of Matthew Crews, who explains that the command's Force Protection Program "has the critical mission of protecting national security assets, infrastructure, information, and personnel of the United States." ECF No. 67-5 ¶ 2. According to Crews, this mission requires that the program's law enforcement personnel receiving training of the highest quality, and that to deliver such training "the instructors must incorporate the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures in security and policing." Id. ¶ 3. Crews states that he determined in or around 2016 that updates to Plaintiffs' PD were necessary:
Before these updates were implemented, many of our Police Officer Instructors had not performed duties associated with the Navy's law enforcement program for at least several years. [*26]  In response to constantly evolving threats against the United States, my Force Protection management colleagues and I saw the need for Police Officer Instructors to be fluent in the current security challenges facing Navy installations, so that our Naval Security Forces could be appropriately trained to increase their readiness and develop into a more effective security force.
Id. ¶ 5.17 Crews further states that the 2017 updates
bring the Police Officer Instructors in line with their fellow Police Officers, who must pass an annual Physical Agility Test, work in the field, and attend the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) or obtain a standards compliance approval from Commander, Naval Installations Command for the FLETC training. These updates ensure that the Police Officer Instructors maintain first-hand experience with current police practices so that they are, in turn, effective instructors in current policing techniques. The readiness of the Instructors also improves the installations' security capabilities, because Police Officer Instructors can now support operations during emergencies or drills.
Id. ¶ 6. Crews also states that the updates were applied uniformly to all [*27]  Police Officer (Instructors) at every installation throughout CNRSW, regardless of disability status. Id. ¶ 7. He states that most of the Police Officer (Instructors) onboard at the time of the implementation, and as of the date of Crews's declaration in July 2022, in fact have service-connected disabilities. Id. He states that the same is true of CNRSW's Police Officers, and that "all management involved in suggesting, ordering, and implementing the changes also have service-connected disabilities." Id. at ¶¶ 7-8.
Plaintiffs argue they are qualified individuals because the new requirements were not essential functions and there was "no legitimate business need" for the 2017 PD Modifications. ECF No. 70 at 11. Plaintiffs further point out that the position of Police Officer (Instructor) is different from that of Police Officer. Id. at 10-11. Plaintiffs argue that "[n]othing about the plaintiff's jobs as police Ofc. instructors changed and there was no national emergency, no emergency situations or other business needs that may have justified otherwise changing job duties." Id. Plaintiffs' briefing does not specifically address the Crews Declaration or the 2017 updates, but argues more [*28]  generally that there was no need "to repeatedly make changes" to their PD. Id. Plaintiffs represent that numerous law enforcement supervisors testified in their depositions that they were unaware of a business need or emergency requiring changes to their PD (but Plaintiffs do not provide page number citations to the deposition testimony that they contend is relevant). Id. at 11-13. In reply, Defendant states that it was Crews — and not these individuals — who made the decision to update the Police Officer (Instructor) PD in 2017.18
Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing their prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas. Although Plaintiffs assert that they have met this burden, they decline to analyze how the elements of the burden are met here. See, e.g., ECF No. 70 at 19 ("Under this burden shifting scheme, a plaintiff must set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination claim under the rehabilitation act of 1973. Plaintiffs have done so here.").19 On balance, the Court agrees with Defendant that the 2017 PD Modifications were essential functions, and concludes that Plaintiffs have not met their burden in opposing Defendant's summary judgment motion. In addressing the element of whether they were [*29]  qualified for the Police Officer (Instructor) position, Plaintiffs do not meaningfully engage with the argument and evidence presented by Defendant, but instead insist that there was no need to change the PD.
On a disparate treatment claim, of course, the ultimate issue is not whether the Court agrees that the changes to the PD were necessary or unnecessary; the issue is whether Plaintiffs have made a prima facie case that Defendant acted with discriminatory intent — that Plaintiffs were qualified but suffered discrimination because of their disabilities. This evidence, too, is lacking. Plaintiffs' brief makes no effort to situate Plaintiffs relative to other Police Officer (Instructors) — disabled or otherwise — who either were able or unable to perform the functions of the job. The Crews Declaration states that most of the Police Officer (Instructors) and Police Officers — at the time the 2017 updates were implemented and today — have service-connected disabilities; and that all the management involved in implementing the updates also have service-connected disabilities. ECF No. 67-5 at ¶¶ 7-8. Plaintiffs have not addressed this evidence either.20
In [*30]  the event Plaintiffs were to satisfy their burden to make a prima facie case, under the second step of McDonnell Douglas the burden of production would shift to Defendant, as employer, to state a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). "It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254. Defendant would easily meet this burden based on the Crews declaration discussed above.
In the third step of McDonnell Douglas, the burden would then shift back to Plaintiffs, who "must then raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant's proffered reasons for their terminations are mere pretext for unlawful discrimination." Hawn, 615 F.3d at 1155. Here, again, Plaintiffs offer a conclusion but no analysis. ECF No. 70 at 20 ("Even if the Court concludes that defendant met this burden, plaintiffs have established sufficient evidence of pretext to raise factual disputes as to the purported business reason to add and then remove qualifications to the PD for the instructor position."). But this is Plaintiff's burden. As discussed further above, Plaintiffs have not offered sufficient evidence that the reasons for the 2017 updates [*31]  set forth in the Crews Declaration, or the reasons for their termination or reassignment based on inability to satisfy the requirements of the job, were false or pretextual.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs' disparate treatment claim fails.21

3. Other Theories
Plaintiff's Opposition brief also mentions the "disparate impact" theory of liability, a term that appears nowhere in Plaintiffs' 93-page TAC. ECF No. 24.
"In a disparate impact case ... plaintiffs must do more than merely raise an inference of discrimination ... they 'must actually prove the discriminatory impact at issue.'" Garcia v. Spun Steak Co., 998 F.2d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir. 1993) (quoting Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902 F.2d 1417, 1421 (9th Cir. 1990)). "The plaintiff may not merely assert that the policy has harmed members of the group to which he or she belongs. Instead, the plaintiff must prove the existence of adverse effects of the policy, must prove that the impact of the policy is on terms, conditions, or privileges of employment of the protected class, must prove that the adverse effects are significant, and must prove that the employee population in general is not affected by the policy to the same degree." Id. "A plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal connection cannot make [*32]  out a prima facie case of disparate impact." Texas Dep't of Hous. & Cmty. Affs. v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 533, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 192 L. Ed. 2d 514 (2015).
Here, Plaintiff's brief poses the question, as a purportedly genuine dispute of material fact, "Were Plaintiffs the Subject of Disparate Impact by Employer?" ECF No. 70 at 15. However, Plaintiffs never undertake to analyze or answer this question. They do not attempt to set forth a prima facie case of disparate impact. At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel did not provide any legal or factual analysis to support a finding of disparate impact. As a result, this theory is unavailing to Plaintiffs.
Plaintiff's Opposition brief likewise mentions the "failure to accommodate" theory of liability. ECF No. 70 at 15, 17. Failure to make a reasonable accommodation is a separate theory of liability, distinct from disparate treatment or disparate impact. Payan v. Los Angeles Cmty. Coll. Dist., 11 F.4th 729, 738 (9th Cir. 2021). Plaintiffs' briefing mentions this theory but fails to analyze it, perhaps because the accommodation requested is simply that the 2017 PD Modifications not be applied to them; a request to be exempted from essential job functions is not a request for a reasonable accommodation. See Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2012). Plaintiffs do advance a separate theory of "failure to engage in the interactive process." Plaintiffs contend that [*33]  "[o]nce an employer is aware that an employee may be in need of accommodation, the employer is required to engage in interactive process with the employee aimed at determining appropriate reasonable accommodations." ECF No. 70 at 18-19. Plaintiffs do not offer any legal authority in support of this theory. Nor did their counsel provide any such authority at oral argument, or respond to Defendant's argument that this was not a valid theory of liability. In fact, this is not a valid theory of liability. See Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2018) ("[T]here exists no standalone claim [under the ADA] for failing to engage in the interactive process. Rather, discrimination results from denying an available and reasonable accommodation."). This theory fails as well.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 67, is GRANTED. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the case.
