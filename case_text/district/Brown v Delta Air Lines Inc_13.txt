Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Rosonda Brown filed the above-captioned action through counsel on November 6, 2020. On August 4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint [23], and on August 1, 2022, after her counsel withdrew, Plaintiff filed a pro se Second Amended Complaint [41]. Plaintiff alleges that Delta Air Lines, Inc., ("Delta"), her former employer, failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.1
The action is now before the Court on the Defendant's Motion for a Sanctions Order [83] ("Motion for Sanctions"), Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [85], Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [88], and Plaintiff's Motion for Relief under Rule 37(c)(1) [93] ("Motion for Relief"). For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [85] be GRANTED, [*2]  Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [88] be DENIED, Defendant's Motion for Sanctions [83] be GRANTED, and Plaintiff's Motion for Relief [93] be DENIED.

I. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RELIEF
After Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [85], Plaintiff filed a Motion for Relief under Rule 37(c)(1) [93] ("Motion for Relief"), requesting that the Court exclude consideration of the Declaration of Annelyse Sanders [85-2] that Defendant submitted in support of its motion. See Declaration of Annelyse Sanders [85-2] ("Sanders Decl."), attached as Exhibit 1 to Def. Mot. [85]. Plaintiff argues that Delta is "automatically precluded from using any testimony or evidence from Annelyse Sanders" because, she contends, Ms. Sanders failed to appear for her 30(b)(6) deposition noticed for December 12, 2022. Pl. Mot. [93] at 2.
Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs a party's duty to disclose certain information in its initial disclosures. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. Rule 26 provides, in relevant part:
(a) Required Disclosures.
(1) Initial Disclosure.
(A) In General. Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:
(i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone [*3]  number of each individual likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;
(ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment; . . . .
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(i)-(ii).
Under Rule 37, parties who fail to make the required disclosures or to identify a specific witness during discovery are prohibited from using that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion or at trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). Rule 37 provides in relevant part:
(c) Failure to Disclose, to Supplement an Earlier Response, or to Admit.
(1) Failure to Disclose or Supplement. If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion [*4]  and after giving an opportunity to be heard:
(A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure;
(B) may inform the jury of the party's failure; and
(C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi).
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).
"Rule 37 sanctions are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to the litigants and insure the integrity of the discovery process." Gratton v. Great Am. Commc'n, 178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). Furthermore, a district court has substantial discretion in deciding whether to impose sanctions under Rule 37. Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353, 1366 (11th Cir. 1997); Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir. 1993). A court may consider various factors in considering what sanctions to impose upon a litigant who has failed to comply with the discovery obligations under the Federal Rules, including the unsuitability of another remedy, the intransigence of the party, and the absence of a reasonable excuse for the failure to comply. See Nat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 96 S. Ct. 2778, 49 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1976).
In this case, although Plaintiff argues that Delta should be sanctioned under Rule 37(c)(1), she has failed to demonstrate that Delta failed to disclose the identity of Annelyse Sanders as a potential witness, as required by Rule 26(a). See Defendant's Initial Disclosures [45] dated August 15, 2022, Att. A [45] at 8 (identifying Annelyse Sanders as a witness who "has knowledge [*5]  of her communications with Plaintiff and Ms. Iglesias regarding Plaintiff's request for accommodation and return to work in 2018"). Plaintiff nevertheless argues that Delta is precluded from relying on the Sanders Declaration because Ms. Sanders failed to appear for a 30(b)(6) deposition noticed for December 12, 2022. Pl. Mot. [93] at 2. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate, however, that she properly served Delta with a notice of a 30(b)(6) deposition, or that Delta failed to comply with such a notice.2
The Court held a discovery conference with the parties on September 28, 2022, to address several discovery disputes, including Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's 30(b)(6) deposition notice. See Minute Sheet [67]. At that time, the Court advised the parties that it had sustained Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's notice, and it allowed Plaintiff to resubmit the 30(b)(6) notice by October 31, 2022, but limited that notice to ten topics. See id. Subsequently, on October 11, 2022, the undersigned issued an Order and Non-Final Report and Recommendation [69] on Defendant's Motion for Sanctions [51], in which the Court ordered Plaintiff to communicate with Defendant's counsel by "video-conference [*6]  for the purpose of meeting and conferring regarding discovery disputes, or any other purpose for which the parties must confer in this case. This Order includes the obligation that Plaintiff must, at Defendant's request, speak directly about any such issue via video-conference to be arranged by Defendant, and not rely solely on written communications." Order & Non-final Report & Rec. [69] at 14-15.
In Plaintiff's Motion for Relief, she contends that the Court "was aware since September 2022 that Plaintiff was attempting to do a 30(b)(6) and/or depose Annelyse Sanders, however Opposing Counsel refused to allow Plaintiff to take the deposition of Annelyse Sanders." Pl. Mot. [93] at 2. Significantly, however, Plaintiff attached no copy of the notice of 30(b)(6) deposition to her motion, nor does she even identify the date on which she allegedly served Delta with a 30(b)(6) notice of deposition. Plaintiff also does not attach a copy of a deposition transcript supporting her claim that no 30(b)(6) witness failed to appear for the deposition.
In response, Delta contends that, after the discovery conference on September 28, 2022, when the Court sustained its objections to Plaintiff's 30(b)(6) notice, [*7]  Plaintiff never served it with another 30(b)(6) notice. See Def. Br. [100] at 1-2. In her reply brief, Plaintiff states that she served Delta with the 30(b)(6) notice "on November 30, 2022 in person and/or again on December 2, 2022 via email." Pl. Reply Br. [105] at 2. But again, Plaintiff fails to attach any copy of the 30(b)(6) notice she allegedly served on Delta on November 30, 2022, or December 2, 2022. Moreover, as Delta points out, Plaintiff filed no certificate of service with the Court at any time after the discovery conference on September 28, 2022, indicating that she ever served Delta with a second 30(b)(6) notice.3
Further, Plaintiff does not contend in her Motion for Relief that she ever requested a video conference with Delta's counsel to discuss any alleged dispute over a 30(b)(6) deposition, as she was required to do by the Court's previous Order, nor did Plaintiff ever request a conference with the Court to resolve any dispute over a 30(b)(6) deposition, as she was required to do. See Scheduling Order [50] at 2 (advising the parties that they are required to request a conference with the Court in the event that a discovery dispute arises that they are unable to resolve [*8]  in a conference between themselves).
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she ever served Delta with a proper 30(b)(6) deposition notice that complied with the Court's requirements set forth at the discovery conference on September 28, 2022. Moreover, because Plaintiff failed to confer with Delta's counsel about any alleged dispute over a 30(b)(6) deposition, and also failed to bring this alleged dispute to the attention of the Court before the end of discovery, she has waived any objection to the Court's consideration of the Sanders Declaration on the ground that Sanders failed to appear for a 30(b)(6) deposition. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Relief [93] be DENIED.

II. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
A. Facts
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from "Delta's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [85-4] ("Def. SMF"), "Plaintiff's Counter-Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment" [96] ("Pl. Resp. SMF"), and their associated exhibits. The Court may also draw some facts directly from other material in the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court [*9]  need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
In this District, Local Rule 56.1B explains the requirements imposed on each party in asserting and opposing motions for summary judgment. Local Rule 56.1B(1) first explains that to present a proper motion for summary judgment, the moving party must include a statement of the material facts that it contends are undisputed:
A movant for summary judgment shall include with the motion and brief a separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried. Each material fact must be numbered separately and supported by a citation to evidence proving such fact. The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (b) supported by a citation to a pleading rather than to evidence; (c) stated as an issue or legal conclusion; or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's statement of undisputed facts.
LR 56.1B(1), NDGa.
In addition, Local Rule 56.1B(2)(a) requires a respondent to a summary judgment to file a response to the movant's statement of undisputed facts. LR 56.1B(2)(a), NDGa. Local Rule 56.1B(2)(a)(2) then provides that the respondent must respond to the movant's facts [*10]  or they will be deemed admitted:
This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1B.(1).
LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa.
The respondent to a summary judgment motion must include such responses on an individually numbered basis, with a separate and precise response individually addressed to every one of the movant's statements of fact that the respondent intends to dispute. LR 56.1B(2)(a)(1), NDGa. Moreover, the Local Rules require that, when the respondent intends to refute the movant's fact, the respondent must support such refutations with "specific citations to evidence." LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2)(i), NDGa.
The Eleventh Circuit has held that a failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1 is not a "mere technicality," because "[t]he rule is designed to help the court identify and organize the issues in the case." Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008)). "Local Rule 56.1 protects judicial resources by 'mak[ing] [*11]  the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge.'" Reese, 527 F.3d at 1268 (internal quotes and citation omitted); see also Libel v. Adventure Lands of America, Inc., 482 F.3d 1028, 1032 (8th Cir. 2007) ("Courts have neither the duty nor the time to investigate the record in search of an unidentified genuine issue of material fact to support a claim or defense.").
Thus, it is each party's obligation to cite to evidence in the record that establishes a triable issue of fact, and the Court cannot cull through the entire record in an effort to search for evidence that creates a disputed issue. See United States v. Adkinson, 135 F.3d 1363, 1378-1380 (11th Cir. 1998); Johnson v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 126 F.3d 1372, 1373 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Dickson v. Amoco Performance Products, Inc., 845 F.Supp. 1565, 1570 (N.D. Ga. 1994) ("It should be the party's responsibility to direct the court's attention separately to each portion of the record which supports each of the party's distinct arguments.").
In this case, although Plaintiff filed a "Counter-Statement of Disputed Material Facts in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment" [96] that appears to be her intended response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, Plaintiff's response generally fails to comply with the requirements of Local Rule 56.1.4 While Plaintiff is proceeding pro se, she is still required to follow the Local Rules, which are clear that the Court must deem the movant's facts to be admitted unless [*12]  the respondent files a proper response or objection disputing each fact. LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa. Plaintiff has not complied with these rules and has generally failed to provide a proper response to Delta's assertions of fact.5
In particular, Plaintiff has attempted to object to many of Delta's submitted facts by providing blanket objections. See Pl. Resp. SMF [96] at 2. Plaintiff first objects to Delta's facts that are supported by a citation to Plaintiff's deposition on the ground that the copy of the deposition transcript cited by Delta was not signed by Plaintiff or the court reporter, although Plaintiff expressly acknowledges that, at the time Delta filed its Motion for Summary Judgment [85], the signed transcript was not even available. See id. After Plaintiff filed her response to Delta's motion, however, Delta filed the signed copy of Plaintiff's deposition transcript on January 20, 2023. See Pl. Dep. [98]. Accordingly, Plaintiff's objection is OVERRULED.
Plaintiff also objects to Delta's facts supported by citations to Plaintiff's deposition on the ground that Plaintiff generally objected to the questions from Delta's counsel during her deposition. See Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 3-4. Plaintiff [*13]  does not explain how this would be a valid objection to Delta's submitted facts, and this objection is also OVERRULED.
Plaintiff also objects to all of Delta's facts that are supported by a citation to the "Attending Physicians' Statement Of Continued Disability" ("APS") dated august 9, 2018. See Pl. Resp. SMF at 2; see also Def. SMF at ¶¶ 17-24; Sanders Decl. [85-2] at ¶ 13, Ex. 2. Plaintiff objects to the "APS" because she contends that it is a "fraudulent document and/or disputed document," and also objects to it has "inadmissible third party hearsay." Pl. Resp. SMF at 2. Plaintiff, however, cites to no admissible record evidence supporting her contention that the APS is a "fraudulent document." Further, for the reasons discussed in more detail below, Plaintiff's objection is OVERRULED.
Plaintiff objects further to all of Delta's submitted facts that are supported by a citation to the Declaration of Annelyse Sanders. See Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 5-8. As discussed above in connection with Plaintiff's Motion for Relief, however, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Delta failed to comply with its discovery obligations by not disclosing Ms. Sanders as a witness or not making her available [*14]  for a deposition. Thus, this objection is also OVERRULED.
Because Plaintiff's responses to Delta's Statements of Fact largely repeat these meritless objections, the majority of Delta's facts are deemed admitted. Nevertheless, the Court has endeavored to determine whether Plaintiff has disputed any of Defendants' facts with a citation to record evidence showing the fact is in genuine dispute. But for those facts submitted by Defendants that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which Plaintiff has not expressly disputed with citations to record evidence, the Court must deem those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa. The Court must generally accept those admitted facts as true, so long as the facts are supported by citations to record evidence, do not make credibility determinations, and do not involve legal conclusions. See E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007).
Unless otherwise noted, the Court has also excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. The Court [*15]  has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff Rosonda Brown began her employment with Delta in 2011, when Delta hired her to work at the airport in Los Angeles, California ("LAX"). Def. SMF at ¶ 1; Pl. Dep. [98] at 67. In September of 2015, she transferred to a Ramp Agent position at Hartsfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta ("ATL"). Def. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. Dep. at 67, Ex. 1, at 1.
A Ramp Agent performs a large number of tasks, including lifting, loading and unloading baggage, transporting baggage and mail to and from the aircraft using a tug and/or belt loader, reading and entering information into computers, record keeping and documentation. Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep. at 121-23, Ex. 6 at 1-2. As it relates to lifting baggage, an essential function of the Ramp Agent position is that the "job requires routinely lifting bags or items weighing up to 50 pounds" and it "occasionally require[es] lifting bags and items weighing between 50 and 70 pounds." Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep. [84], Ex. 6, at 1.6 When asked about the lifting requirements of the Ramp Agent position, Plaintiff [*16]  testified, "I don't recall what the weight restrictions were." Def. SMF at ¶ 4; Pl. Dep. at 123.
While on a leave of absence in late June of 2018, Plaintiff contacted Delta's Accommodation Program and requested an accommodation. Def. SMF at ¶ 5; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 3. In the accommodation process, the employee is required to provide Delta with a completed Accommodation Request Form ("ARF") and current written medical information from her medical provider regarding the employee's relevant medical condition and accommodation request and any medical restrictions caused by that condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 6; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 4. If the employee does not provide that medical information, Delta asks the employee to provide a Medical Release Form allowing Delta to obtain such medical information report from the employee's medical provider. Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 5.
Plaintiff emailed an ARF dated July 11, 2018, to Delta's Equal Opportunity Accommodation Program Manager, Annelyse Sanders.7 Def. SMF at ¶ 8; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 6, Ex. 1. In her ARF, Plaintiff stated that, due to neck, back and shoulder pain, she could not lift, push, or pull "over a certain amount of weight" and could [*17]  not stand for a long period, and as a result, she requested to be transferred to a new department. Def. SMF at ¶ 9; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 6, Ex. 1. Sanders was unable to determine if Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her Ramp Agent position based on Plaintiff's ARF because Plaintiff did not identify what she believed to be her lifting restriction and submitted no medical information from her medical provider regarding any restriction. Def. SMF at ¶ 10; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 7.
Accordingly, after Plaintiff signed a Medical Release Form, Sanders informed Plaintiff that she would fax forms to her medical provider. Def. SMF at ¶ 11; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 8. Plaintiff informed Sanders that her medical provider was a "Dr. Gonzalez" at the Clinica Mi Pueblo in Corona, California ("Clinic"). Def. SMF at ¶ 12; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 8. On July 30, 2018 Sanders had her office fax the blank forms to be completed to the Clinic. Def. SMF at ¶ 13; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 9.
On August 1, 2018, Sanders received by fax the cover sheet she had faxed to the Clinic and it stated that Plaintiff had not been seen at the Clinic since September 8, 2017 (i.e., almost a year earlier), and therefore the Clinic [*18]  could not evaluate Plaintiff at that time. Def. SMF at ¶ 14; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 10, Ex. 2, at 1. Sanders contacted Plaintiff and informed her that Sanders needed current medical information from Plaintiff's medical provider. Def. SMF at ¶ 15; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 11, Ex. 3, at 2. On August 8, 2018, Plaintiff emailed Sanders in pertinent part, "I just left my doctor's appointment and she will be sending over my information today." Def. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4.
On August 9, 2018, the Clinic faxed completed forms back to Delta, including a one-page "Attending Physicians' Statement Of Continued Disability" ("APS").8 D e f. S MF a t ¶ 17; Sand e rs Decl . a t ¶ 13, Ex. 2, at 4 . T he A PS stated it was completed by Alicia Iglesias, and that Plaintiff had been seen and evaluated at the Clinic on August 8, 2018. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 18-19; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 14, Ex. 2. The APS stated that Plaintiff could sit, stand, and walk for 8 hours; lift and carry from 0 to 34 pounds "Continuously" (defined as up to 100% of her shift), 25 to 50 pounds "Frequently" (defined as between 34% and 66% of her shift), and from 51 to 100 pounds "Occasionally" (defined as up to 33% of her shift) (collectively the "APS [*19]  Restrictions"). Def. SMF at ¶ 22; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 13, Ex. 2, at 4. The APS stated that Plaintiff was able to return to work without restrictions at full duty effective August 9, 2018. Def. SMF at ¶ 23; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 13, Ex. 2, at 4.
Plaintiff testified that she spoke with Iglesias at the Clinic in or around August of 2018, and she believes that Iglesias is a physician's assistant at the Clinic.9 Def. SMF at ¶¶ 21-22; Pl. Dep. at 31-32, 112. When asked specifically whether she saw Iglesias, or any doctor on August 8, 2018, Plaintiff testified that she could not recall. Def. SMF at ¶ 20; Pl. Dep. at 99-102, 104-05. When asked about the email that Sanders received on August 8, 2018, purportedly from Plaintiff, in which Plaintiff told Sanders, "I just left my doctor's appointment and she will be sending over my information today," Plaintiff responded, "I don't recall this information," and "I don't recall seeing this email," but she did not expressly deny sending it. See Pl. Dep. at 103-05.
On August 10, 2018, Sanders emailed Plaintiff stating that the Clinic had faxed the forms to Delta the previous evening. Def. SMF at ¶ 25; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 15, Ex. 4. In that email, Sanders also [*20]  explained what the restrictions were in the APS and wrote, "The above work restrictions do not prevent you from performing the essential functions of your position as a Ramp Agent in Department 120 at ATL. As a result, your accommodation claim will be closed. Please consult with A27 [offices near that ATL gate] to coordinate your return to work." Def. SMF at ¶ 26; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 15, Ex. 4.
To confirm that she was reading the documents from the Clinic correctly, on August 14, 2018, Sanders contacted the Clinic by phone and asked to speak to Dr. Gonzalez, who Plaintiff had identified as her medical provider at the Clinic. Def. SMF at ¶ 27; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 23. She was informed by the Clinic that there was no Dr. Gonzalez employed at the Clinic. Def. SMF at ¶ 28; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 24. Sanders reviewed the APS and saw that it was signed by Iglesias and asked to speak to Iglesias, who then confirmed to Sanders that: (1) the APS faxed on August 9 to Delta was correct; (2) the APS Restrictions remained her restrictions; and (3) the APS is the document that should be considered by Delta regarding Plaintiff's return to work. Def. SMF at ¶ 30; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 24, Ex. 4.
Sanders concluded [*21]  from the APS and from her August 14 telephone call with Iglesias that Iglesias understood that the stated restrictions allowed Plaintiff to return to her Ramp Agent job without restrictions because the stated restrictions allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential tasks of the job at full duty. Def. SMF at ¶ 24; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 17. Later on August 14, 2018, Sanders emailed Plaintiff and informed her that she had talked to Iglesias and that Iglesias had confirmed that the APS Restrictions were correct (which Sanders repeated in her email to Plaintiff) and that Plaintiff needed to return to her job because the restrictions did not prevent her from performing the required functions of her Ramp Agent position. Def. SMF at ¶ 31; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 25, Ex. 4. Plaintiff did not respond to that email. Def. SMF at ¶ 32; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 25.
On August 28, 2018, Plaintiff reported to work at A-27 at Atlanta Airport. Def. SMF at ¶ 33; Pl. Dep. at 116-19. Plaintiff secretly recorded a conversation she had with Lead Agent Chris Holt and supervisor Tom Glaushas. Def. SMF at ¶ 34; Pl. Dep. at 34-36. Although Plaintiff never produced this recording to Delta in response to discovery requests, Delta [*22]  received the recording from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and had it transcribed.10 Def. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Dep. at 43; Munger Decl. [85-3], at ¶ 2, Ex. 1.
As reflected on the recording, individuals who Plaintiff identified at her deposition were Holt and Glaushas spoke in Glaushas's office in Plaintiff's presence. Def. SMF at ¶ 36; Pl. Dep. at 40. Holt told Glaushas that he had just been talking with Plaintiff and that Plaintiff told him that she had a lifting restriction of 50 pounds, which Delta contends was false and inconsistent with the APS Restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 2-3. Reading aloud from the Sanders email setting forth the APS Restrictions, Glaushas stated, "Well, it says here lifting/carrying up to 34 pounds continuously, 34 to 50 frequently, 51 to 100 occasionally." Def. SMF at ¶ 38; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 3. Holt responded, "Well, then—well, we're good then." Def. SMF at ¶ 38; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 3. Plaintiff interjected, "Okay. That's not the doctor's note that I—that was sent over and the doctor's note that they made a copy of when I returned to work." Def. SMF at ¶ 40; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 3.
Glaushas [*23]  called someone named Cindy at A-27 and, after hanging up the phone with Cindy, stated that the email from Sanders with the APS Restrictions was all that Cindy had as well.11 Def. SMF at ¶ 41; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 3-4. Glaushas told Plaintiff that the only restrictions that he had and that Cindy had were the APS Restrictions and that, if she had some other restrictions, she needed to present them to the accommodations group. Def. SMF at ¶ 42; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 4-5. Holt reiterated that the restrictions they had from the accommodations people indicated that Plaintiff could lift over 50 pounds occasionally. Def. SMF at ¶ 43; Munger Decl., Ex. 1, at 6.
In a statement she provided to the EEOC, Plaintiff stated that, after the note from the Clinic dated August 15, 2018 (the "August 15 Note") was found, she was sent home. Def. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. dep. at 107, 117-20, Ex. 5, at 10-11. The August 15 Note stated that Plaintiff could return to work "with lift, push, pull weight limit of up to 50 pounds repetitively." Def. SMF at ¶ 45; Pl. Dep. at 111, Ex. 5, at 9.
Plaintiff contends that, thirty minutes after she left work on August 28, 2018,12 she received a call from the Human Resources [*24]  ("HR") manager, Kiha Jones.13 Def. SMF at ¶ 46; Pl. Dep. at 118-20, Ex. 5, at 11-12. In this conversation, Plaintiff again stated that her lifting restrictions prevented her from lifting over 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 23; Pl. Dep., Ex. 5, at 11. Plaintiff alleges that Jones told Plaintiff that she could perform her Ramp Agent duties and that she was on an unapproved leave. Def. SMF at ¶ 48; Pl. Dep., Ex. 5, at 11. Later on August 28, 2018, Plaintiff emailed Sanders, and wrote that she "cannot lift over 50 lbs on my requested doctor's note." Def. SMF at ¶¶ 49-50; Pl. Dep., Ex. 5, at 12-13. Plaintiff wrote Sanders that, after she left work earlier that day, Jones had called her and stated that she was on unapproved leave because "my notes indicate I am able to do the job per specifications." Def. SMF at ¶ 51; Pl. Dep., Ex. 5, at 12-13.
After August 28, 2018, Plaintiff never returned to her Ramp Agent position. Def. SMF at ¶ 52; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 26. Plaintiff never provided any updated medical information from Iglesias or any other medical provider that changed the APS Restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 53; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 28. At all times on and after August 28 until her termination, [*25]  Plaintiff remained on an unapproved leave of absence. Def. SMF at ¶ 54; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 29.
Later in 2018, Plaintiff bid for a Ticket Agent position at LAX and, in November 2018, she received an email offering her the position that stated she had 24 hours to accept the offer. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 55, 57; Pl. Dep. at 125-26. The Ticket Agent position had the same lifting requirements as Plaintiff's Atlanta Ramp Agent position. Def. SMF at ¶ 56; Pl. Dep. at 123-24. Plaintiff did not accept that offer by the deadline and remained on an unapproved leave of absence. Def. SMF at ¶ 58; Pl. Dep. at 125-126; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 29.
On November 22, 2019, Delta General Manager Barbara Franz sent a letter by certified mail to Plaintiff at an address that Plaintiff admits she had lived at in Apple Valley, California. Def. SMF at ¶ 59; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8, at 57-58. Delta would have received that address from Plaintiff in 2019. Def. SMF at ¶ 59; Pl. Dep. at 143. The letter stated that Delta was "very concerned" that Plaintiff had been on an unauthorized absence since August of 2018, and further stated:
At this point, it is important you take immediate action to resolve with your current status by doing one [*26]  of the following:
- If you are able to return to your prior position of Ramp Agent, please contact your local return to work coordinator to arrange to return to work
- If you are unable to perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent job, and wish to seek an accommodation, please contact accommodations at 404-715-9811 or accommodations@delta.com to initiate an accommodation request
- If you are unable to work, please contact Sedgwick at 877- 67-DELTA to initiate a leave of absence.
Please call me (404-714-4118) upon your receipt of this letter to advise which of the above options you will be pursuing. Given the length of time you have been on unauthorized leave, it is imperative that you act promptly. Thus, if I have not heard from you by December 6, 2019, I have no alternative but to assume you are no longer interested in working for Delta.
Def. SMF at ¶¶ 60-61; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8.
On January 22, 2020, Manager Jaime Schock sent a memo to Station Manager Kevin Breen recommending that Plaintiff be terminated. Def. SMF at ¶ 52; Munger Decl. at ¶ 3; Ex. 2. Schock stated that Plaintiff had been on unauthorized leave since August of 2018 and that Delta's attempts to contact Plaintiff by phone [*27]  and through certified mail had been unsuccessful. Def. SMF at ¶ 63; Munger Decl. at ¶ 3, Ex. 2. Plaintiff testified that she learned of her termination on February 4, 2020, because she was unable to access her Delta intranet account and a Delta representative then had told her that was because she had been terminated. Def. SMF at ¶ 64; Pl. Dep. at 171-72.
On December 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed an EEOC Charge against Delta alleging disability discrimination and retaliation. Def. SMF at ¶ 65; Pl. Dep. at 96- 97; Ex. 2.
In Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint filed on August 4, 2021, she alleged for the first time that she "often worked the International Departures wing, which frequently required her to lift or carry over 50 pounds." First Amend. Compl. [23] at ¶ 23. At no time during her employment did Plaintiff ask for an accommodation to be permitted to work only on domestic flights in her Ramp Agent job. Def. SMF at ¶ 68; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 19. Data on Delta's weighed bags in 2018 established that only 9% of its domestic bags and only 14% of its international bags weighed over 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 69; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 21, Ex. 5.
Because the APS Restrictions provided that Plaintiff [*28]  could lift between 51 and 100 pounds up to 33% of her shift (and considering that her shift included substantial tasks that did not require lifting such as work on computers), the APS Restrictions did not prevent Plaintiff from performing the essential functions of her Ramp Agent job even if she worked only international flights. Def. SMF at ¶ 70; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 22.
B. Defendant's Objection to the Iglesias Affidavit
As noted above, Plaintiff objects to all of Delta's facts that are supported by a citation to the APS dated August 9, 2018, because she contends that it is a "fraudulent document and/or disputed document," and also objects to it has "inadmissible third party hearsay." Pl. Resp. SMF at 2. Although Plaintiff has not cited to any record evidence in support of her contention that the APS is a "fraudulent document," Plaintiff has submitted the "Affidavit of Alicia Iglesias," in which Iglesias states that she did not evaluate Plaintiff on August 8, 2018, and she did not "complete and sign the Sedgwick form called the 'Attending Physician's Statement of Continued Disability' which appears to be dated on 8/9/18." See "Affidavit of Alicia Iglesias" [95] ("Iglesias Aff.") at 43-44. [*29]  Delta has objected to the Court's consideration of the Iglesias Affidavit on the ground that the "affidavit" was "drafted and forged by [Aasir] Azzarmi,"14 and also because it was not signed under penalty of perjury or signed in the presence of a notary. Def. Reply Br. [101] at 5-6.
When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court may consider depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits or declarations submitted by the parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion "must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).
An affidavit is "[a] voluntary declaration of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths, such as a notary public." Black's Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed.1990). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, when a court is considering a motion for summary judgment, an unsworn declaration may be given the same force and effect as an affidavit if it is signed and dated and includes language in substantially the following form: "I declare (or certify, [*30]  verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature)." 28 U.S.C. § 1746(2).
Thus, there are two statements that are essential to a proper verification under § 1746: (1) an assertion that the facts are true and correct; and (2) a statement that the first assertion is made under penalty of perjury. United States v. 8 Gilcrease Lane, Quincy Fla. 32351, 587 F. Supp. 2d 133, 139 (D.D.C. 2008). Because the statement of verification must be in "substantially" the same form as the statement set forth in § 1746(2), however, the language in the statement of verification need not be identical to the language in the statute in order for a court to consider it sufficiently in compliance. See, e.g., Cobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 260, 364 U.S. App. D.C. 2 (D.C.Cir. 2004); Schroeder v. McDonald, 55 F.3d 454, 460 n.10 (9th Cir. 1995).
In this case, the Iglesias Affidavit [95], although styled as an "affidavit," is not a valid affidavit, because it was not signed and sworn before an officer authorized to administer oaths, such as a notary public. Moreover, the Iglesias Affidavit also cannot be considered by the Court as a valid declaration, because it does comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1746(2). While it states that "the information set forth herein is true and correct to the best of my knowledge," there is nothing that indicates that Iglesias intended for it to be a sworn statement made under penalty [*31]  of perjury. See Nissho-Iwai American Corp. v. Kline, 845 F.2d 1300, 1305-06 (5th Cir. 1988) (a purported "affidavit" that was "neither sworn nor its contents stated to be true and correct nor stated under penalty of perjury" could not be considered by the court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment).
Thus, because the purported "Affidavit" of Iglesias is not signed and sworn before a notary, nor signed under penalty of perjury, the Court cannot consider it as admissible evidence under Rule 56 that may be considered in ruling on either party's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Defendant's objection to the Iglesias Affidavit [95] is SUSTAINED. The Court has not considered the Iglesias Affidavit in ruling on either party's motion for summary judgment. Moreover, because the Iglesias Affidavit is not admissible under Rule 56, the Court further finds that Plaintiff has failed to cite to any admissible record evidence that the APS submitted by Delta is a "fraudulent document" that must also be excluded from evidence.
Moreover, even if the Court considered the Iglesias Affidavit as evidence that the APS was a "fraudulent document," Delta would still be entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim because Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that she was [*32]  unable to perform the essential functions of her position, or that she required a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her position. See discussion, infra.
C. Discussion
1. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Dietz v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 598 F.3d 812, 815 (11th Cir. 2010). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In making its determination, the court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Jurich v. Compass Marine, Inc., 764 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2014).
Once the movant has adequately supported its motion by citing to materials in the record, the party opposing summary judgment must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there [*33]  is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 242. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
When [*34]  considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
2. Plaintiff's ADA Claim
Plaintiff's only claim remaining in this case is that Delta violated the ADA when it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Order [37] at 5.
a. Standards under the ADA
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). Title I of the ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, [*35]  and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court for Title VII employment discrimination cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 F. App'x 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under [*36]  the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence of discrimination under the same burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). If the defendant produced evidence of a legitimate reason for the adverse action that was unrelated to the alleged disability, the burden would then shift back to the plaintiff to "demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1997).
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply. See Nadler, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, [*37]  applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D.Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims in [Nadler], but it inexplicably did not publish the opinion and provide trial courts with a clear answer to this previously unaddressed issue.").
b. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff alleges that, at all relevant times, she was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, and that Delta failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation for her disability in violation of the ADA.
As noted above, the definition of "discriminate" under the ADA includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination [*38]  under the ADA, a plaintiff must generally demonstrate that she: (1) has a disability as defined in the ADA, (2) is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998).
Specifically, to prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) is disabled; (2) was a "qualified individual" when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226; Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). In addition, a plaintiff must present evidence establishing that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky, 80 F.3d at 447-48.
The first prima facie element requires the plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The relevant provision of the ADA defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A); see also Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268. A person [*39]  may also have a "disability" under the ADA if the person has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).15
The second element of the prima facie case requires the Plaintiff to establish that she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for [*40]  the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
Thus, an employee must show that she is able to meet all of a job's requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish a valid ADA claim. See Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; written job descriptions; the amount of time spent performing the particular function; the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function; the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement; the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past; and the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010); Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). If a plaintiff cannot [*41]  perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
In determining what functions of a given job are deemed to be essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment . . . and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The regulations also state three factors that make it more likely that a specific duty is an essential function of the job: (1) the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the person holding the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular function. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii)).
Thus, the Court must accord substantial weight to Defendant's job description of the essential duties of the position. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir. 2007). The Court is not required to accept all functions in the [*42]  job description, however, because it must weigh the Defendant's job description against all other relevant factors, including the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function; the terms of any collective bargaining agreement; the work experience of past employees in the job; and the current work experience of employees in similar jobs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(ii)-(vii).
It is not enough for an employer to merely label a function essential; the employer must instead actually require employees in the position at issue to perform those functions that the employer claims are essential to the position. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n). If a plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of the position without a reasonable accommodation, she must make a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible, and that such an accommodation would enable him to perform those essential functions. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56; Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 281 (11th Cir. 1994). If a plaintiff is able to meet this burden, the defendant must produce evidence of an affirmative defense that the accommodation requested is unreasonable or that it would cause an undue hardship on the employer. See Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1996). The plaintiff, however, retains the [*43]  burden at all times of identifying a reasonable accommodation that is available and demonstrating that the accommodation would allow him to perform the essential functions of the job. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56; Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527; Moses v. Am. Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 447 (11th Cir. 1996).
The third and final element of the Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). As noted above, the ADA expressly provides that an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for [*44]  individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
Determining what is reasonable for each individual employer is a highly fact-specific inquiry that will vary depending on the circumstances and necessities of each employment situation. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527. The regulations provide that an employer may restructure a job by reallocating or redistributing non-essential, marginal job functions, but is not required to reallocate essential functions. The essential functions are by definition those that the individual who holds the job would have to perform, with or without accommodation, in order to be considered qualified for the position. See 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(n); Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527; Milton v. Scrivner, Inc., 53 F.3d 1118, 1124 (10th Cir. 1995) (an employer is not required to reallocate job duties in order to change the essential functions of a job); Larkins v. CIBA Vision Corp., 858 F. Supp. 1572, 1583 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (a reasonable accommodation does not require an employer to eliminate the essential functions of a position). Thus, if the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodations, the employer has no duty to eliminate the essential functions of the position or to hire someone else who can perform those functions for the employee.
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or [*45]  every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the [*46]  employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation [*47]  and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, for the purpose of resolving its Motion for Summary Judgment, Delta does not appear to dispute that the Plaintiff can establish that she had a disability or was regarded as having a disability, or that she was a "qualified individual" who could perform the essential functions of her position. See Def. Br. [85-1] at 14-15. Indeed, Delta argues that the undisputed evidence in this case establishes that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job without any accommodation at all. For that reason, Delta argues, Plaintiff has failed to show that Delta violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability. See id.
Delta argues that the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job without any accommodation "not only in August 2018 but at all times thereafter while she was employed at Delta." Id. at 15. According to Delta, the job description for the Ramp Agent position states that an essential function is to be able to lift between 50 and 70 pounds occasionally, and the data of weighed bags establishes that less than 15% of weighed bags were [*48]  over 50 pounds, showing that the job description requirement is correct. Id. Thus, because the APS Restrictions showed that Plaintiff could lift from 51 to 100 pounds occasionally (up to 33% of her shift), Delta argues that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job and no accommodation was required that would enable her to perform her job. Id.
In response, Plaintiff fails to cite to any evidence that disputes Delta's contention that she was able to perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent job without any accommodation. In her brief, she nevertheless argues that "Defendant's Statement of Facts, which are not material facts, do not disprove any of the elements of Plaintiff's ADA claim." Pl. Br. [94] at 11. Pl. Br. [94] at 11 (Plaintiff's page 5). But Plaintiff misunderstands Delta's burden to establish that it is entitled to summary judgment. It is not Delta's burden to "disprove" the elements of Plaintiff's claim. Instead, as discussed, once Delta shows the Court that there is an absence of evidence to support the Plaintiff's claim, it is Plaintiff's burden to present specific facts, supported by competent evidence, that demonstrate the existence of a genuine [*49]  issue for trial. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). She has failed to do so.
Plaintiff also argues that "Defendant failed to produce evidence to prove that Plaintiff is not a 'qualified individual' for the LGA SkyClub position that Plaintiff 'seeks' or 'desires,' as this is a REASSIGNMENT case." Pl. Br. at 11-12 (emphasis in original). According to Plaintiff, the issue in this case is not whether she could perform the Ramp Agent job, but whether she was qualified to perform the "new job" of the LGA SkyClub position.16 Id. at 12. As discussed above, a reasonable accommodation may include a reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b). But as also discussed, an employer is not required to provide an employee with any conceivable accommodation, including a transfer to another position, merely because the employee requests such an accommodation. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997). "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff has failed to cite to any evidence that she required an accommodation that would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job as a Ramp Agent.
As set forth above, it is undisputed that an essential function of the [*50]  Ramp Agent position is that the "job requires routinely lifting bags or items weighing up to 50 pounds" and it "occasionally require[es] lifting bags and items weighing between 50 and 70 pounds." Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep., Ex. 6, at 1. Further, it is undisputed that data on Delta's weighed bags in 2018 established that only 9% of its domestic bags and only 14% of its international bags weighed over 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 69; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 21, Ex. 5. It is also undisputed that the APS Restrictions that were provided to Delta from the Clinic that treated Plaintiff stated that Plaintiff was able to lift between 51 and 100 pounds up to 33% of her shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 22; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 13, Ex. 2, at 4. The APS also stated that Plaintiff was able to return to work without restrictions at full duty effective August 9, 2018. Def. SMF at ¶ 23; Sanders Decl. at ¶ 13, Ex. 2, at 4.
Thus, Delta has provided evidence that Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of her Ramp Agent position without requiring any accommodation for her alleged disability, and Plaintiff has cited to no evidence that disputes Delta's evidence. Plaintiff instead argues that the APS is a "fraudulent [*51]  document" and the Court should not consider it. But the only other evidence submitted by either party that relates to Plaintiff's lifting restrictions is the August 15 Note, which stated that Plaintiff could return to work "with lift, push, pull weight limit of up to 50 pounds repetitively." Def. SMF at ¶ 45; Pl. Dep. [84] at 110-11, Ex. 5 [84-5], at 9-10 (emphasis added). Plaintiff has not cited to any record evidence that she was ever required to lift more than 50 pounds "repetitively" in her Ramp Agent position, as the data showed that, in 2018, only 9% of Delta's domestic bags and only 14% of its international bags weighed over 50 pounds. Thus, the undisputed evidence shows that, even assuming that Plaintiff had a disability under the ADA, she did not require an accommodation to enable her to perform the essential functions of her Ramp Agent job. See Edwards v. WellStar Med. Grp., LLC, No. 20-13866, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 21036, 2022 WL 3012297, at *6 (11th Cir. July 29, 2022) ("[i]f an employee does not require an accommodation to perform her essential job functions, then the employer is under no obligation to make an accommodation, even if the employee requests an accommodation that is reasonable and could be easily provided") (emphasis in original) (quoting D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2020)).
In sum, the Court finds that, even assuming [*52]  that Plaintiff could establish that she had a disability under the ADA, she has failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on Delta's alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation because she has failed to present any evidence that she required a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent position. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [85] be GRANTED.

III. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff has also filed a separate Motion for Summary Judgment [88]. In connection with her motion, Plaintiff has filed a "Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment" [88-2] ("Pl. SMF"). In response, Defendant has filed its "Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [103] ("Def. Resp. SMF"). The Court notes that, on a plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the defendant, as the non-movant. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff's submitted facts, and Defendant's responses to those facts, and finds that, [*53]  for the majority of the facts, the parties largely repeat the facts and evidence cited above. Plaintiff has included some additional facts, however, her facts are largely unsupported by any citation to competent record evidence or are immaterial to any issues presented in this case.
In her Statement of Facts, Plaintiff contends that the essential functions of Plaintiff's Ramp Agent job include the ability to "occasionally lift bags from between 50-70 lbs." Pl. SMF at ¶ 19. Delta states that it does not dispute that an essential function of the Ramp Agent job was to occasionally lift between 50 and 70 pounds. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 19. Plaintiff further states that Defendant has no evidence to prove that Plaintiff "did not need a reasonable accommodation because she was able to perform the essential functions of her Ramp agent position without a reasonable accommodation." Pl. SMF at ¶ 25. Delta disputes this, and contends that the APS is evidence that Plaintiff did not require an accommodation to perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent position. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 25.
In Plaintiff's brief in support of her Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff alleges that, on August 13, 2018, [*54]  "Defendant and/or Ms. Sanders alleged they received updated recent medical information from Plaintiff's doctor's office stating that Plaintiff had 35 lb. lifting restrictions." Pl. Br. [88] at 4. Significantly, Plaintiff cites to no record evidence in support of that allegation, and it does not appear to be included in her Statement of Facts. In any event, even assuming that Plaintiff had presented any evidence to support that allegation, such as a note from her doctor's office stating that she was limited to lifting no more than 35 pounds, Delta would still be entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim, because Plaintiff admits that an essential function of the Ramp Agent job is the ability to "occasionally lift bags from between 50-70 lbs." Pl. SMF at ¶ 19.
As discussed above, "[a]n accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted). Thus, it is unreasonable to require an employer to permanently excuse an employee from performing [*55]  aspects of the job, redefine the job to exclude the functions she cannot perform, or reassign those tasks to other employees. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260 ("[E]mployers are not required to transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists."); Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 819 (7th Cir. 2004) (employer need not alter employee's job to omit essential functions). More specifically, employers are not required to modify an employee's existing medium or heavy-duty position into exclusively light-duty work because of a physical restriction. See, e.g., Richardson v. Friendly Ice Cream, 594 F.3d 69, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2010) (employer need not excuse a restaurant manager from necessary lifting on the basis of a shoulder injury and lifting restrictions).
Thus, under Plaintiff's theory of her claim, although an essential function of the Ramp Agent job was to occasionally lift bags that weighed between 50 and 70 pounds, because she had injuries that allegedly prevented her from lifting more than 35 pounds, Delta should have allowed her to remain in the Ramp Agent position without lifting more than 35 pounds, or it should have reassigned her to a new position of her choice. Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, however, the ADA does not require Delta to do either. Under [*56]  Plaintiff's theory, her claim would fail because she would not be a "qualified individual" under the ADA, as she could no longer perform the essential functions of the Ramp Agent position, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Eliminating an essential function of the job is not a reasonable accommodation, nor is requiring other employees to perform the essential functions that Plaintiff cannot perform. If Plaintiff could not lift more than 35 pounds, as she contends (without any evidence), Delta would still be entitled to summary judgment on her claim, just for a different reason—that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA, because she has not identified any accommodation that would allow her to lift bags over 50 pounds, and she admits that lifting bags over 50 pounds was an essential function of the Ramp Agent job.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [88] be DENIED.

IV. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
Delta has also filed a Motion for Sanctions [83], which has also been filed in Plaintiff's other case pending against Delta, in which she asserts claims of race discrimination and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 against [*57]  Delta and three individual employees. See Brown v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 1:22-CV-4566-SEG-JSA ("the § 1981 Action"). Delta contends that, although Plaintiff has been proceeding pro se in this action and the § 1981 Action, and has represented to the Court that she is personally signing all the documents filed in this case, Plaintiff has actually been allowing another individual to secretly prosecute both actions, including by drafting and filing materials and communications with the Court and opposing counsel. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's pleadings, briefs, and other documents are actually being drafted by "infamous non-lawyer vexatious litigator Aasir Azzarmi," and Delta seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and Azzarmi. Def. Br. [83-1] at 1-2. Delta requests that Plaintiff and Azzarmi be held in civil contempt for violating the Court's Order in this action requiring her to review and sign all documents filed in this case, and to refrain from allowing another person to file her documents for her, and requests that Azzarmi "be referred for review for federal criminal prosecution for obstruction of justice, unauthorized practice of law, and other possible crimes with [*58]  respect to these lawsuits." Id. at 3-4.
Sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including dismissal, may be imposed against an attorney or a party who files a pleading that (1) has no reasonable legal basis; (2) has no reasonable factual basis; or (3) is filed for an improper purpose. Thomas v. Evans, 880 F.2d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.1989). The purpose of Rule 11 is to "'discourage dilatory or abusive tactics and help to streamline the litigation process by lessening frivolous claims or defenses.'" Id. (quoting Rule 11's advisory committee note). Although Rule 11 applies to pro se plaintiffs, the court must take into account a plaintiff's pro se status when it determines whether the filing was reasonable. Id. at 1240.
There is no doubt that Plaintiff's actions in both the § 1981 Action and this case have been troubling, and Delta has shown that there is a strong likelihood that Plaintiff has been receiving assistance in drafting the documents in both cases. Delta previously filed a Motion for Sanctions [61], and, in the Non-Final Report and Recommendation recommending denial of that motion, the undersigned discussed some of those issues and concerns. See Order and Non-Final Report and Recommendation [69] at 6-15.
In particular, the undersigned noted that, although Plaintiff represented that [*59]  she has "never worked with, seen, spoken to, communicated with or ever met this person named Aasir Azzarmi at any time in [her] life," and "I DO NOT KNOW THIS PERSON," Plaintiff offered no explanation as to why she has included Azzarmi on her witness list attached to her Initial Disclosures if she does not know him and has never spoken to him or communicated with him in any way. See Pl. Aff., attached to Pl. Br. [65] at 15-17; Pl. Initial Disclosures, Att. A [43] at 5.
Plaintiff's responses during her deposition even more directly show a likely violation of Rule 11. See Pl. Dep. [98]. Plaintiff filed the Complaint in the § 1981 Action on September 8, 2022, and she was deposed in this case less than two months later, on November 30, 2022. Nevertheless, when Plaintiff was asked about her claims in the § 1981 case, she had no idea what they were, or what that case was about. See id. at 168-70 (when Plaintiff was asked if she had filed any other lawsuit against Delta, she stated, "I believe so," but when asked when she filed the second lawsuit, she responded, "I don't recall," and when asked if she could recall what the lawsuit was about or what the legal claims were, she responded, "Not at the moment."). [*60] 
The extraordinary record in this case includes many examples pointed out by Delta raising significant suspicions of bad faith and improper "ghost writing" in these cases. The Court has not been eager to reach the issue of sanctions, as it is loath to resolve cases other than on the merits except when absolutely and clearly warranted. The Court remains loath to do so, which is why it rests primarily on recommending summary judgment in favor of Delta on the merits. But the Court is convinced that Plaintiff did not prepare and file many of the papers in this case, and virtually all of the papers filed in the § 1981 Action, and that she has no basis to support the factual validity of the allegations in the § 1981 Action. Delta has shown that Plaintiff has filed numerous documents in both cases for the improper and bad faith purpose of harassing Delta. Thus, the Court is forced to recommend that, as an alternative ground, that Plaintiff's claims in this case be dismissed based on sanctions for bad faith and vexatious litigation and violations of Rule 11.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Sanctions [83] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on the alternative [*61]  ground that Plaintiff has not complied with Rule 11 in litigating this action.

V. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [85] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all claims in this action. IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that Defendant's Motion for Sanctions [83] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on the alternative ground that Plaintiff has not complied with Rule 11 in litigating this action.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [88] be DENIED, and Plaintiff's Motion for Relief [93] be DENIED.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 19th day of July, 2023.
