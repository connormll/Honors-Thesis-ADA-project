FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION
PAPAK, Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Madeline Sheridan filed claims against defendant Providence Health & Services ("Providence"), alleging age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination and Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)-(2), and Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.030(1)(a); failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §12112, and Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.112; denial or interference with exercise of family medical leave in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. § 2615, and the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA), Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.183; and exposure to a hostile work environment and constructive discharge because of age, disability, perceived disability, or opposition to unlawful employment in violation of the ADEA, ADA, and Oregon law. Now before the court is Providence's motion for summary judgment (#23). For the reasons discussed below, the motion should [*2]  be granted in part and denied in part.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Summary judgment is not proper if material factual issues exist for trial. See, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1171, 116 S. Ct. 1261, 134 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1996). In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the district courts of the United States must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and may neither make credibility determinations nor perform any weighing of the evidence. See, e.g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 554-55, 110 S. Ct. 1331, 108 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1990); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000).
The substantive law governing a claim or defense determines whether a fact is material. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987). The court must view the inferences drawn from the facts "in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id. (citation omitted). In employment discrimination cases "very little evidence" is required to survive summary judgment "because the ultimate question is one that can only be resolved through a searching inquiry-one that is appropriately conducted by the fact finder upon a full record." Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., 80 F.3d 1406, 1410 (9th Cir.) (internal [*3]  quotations, citation omitted), cert denied, 519 U.S. 927, 117 S. Ct. 295, 136 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1996).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff Madeline Sheridan, now 52 years old, is a nurse. She first began working for defendant Providence Health Systems ("Providence") in 1984. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 4, at 1) (hereinafter "Sheridan Decl."). For the last ten years of her employment with Providence, Sheridan had worked as a nurse in the Medical-Surgical Unit at Providence Milwaukie Hospital, which cares for all types of patients, including those recovering from major surgeries. (Sheridan Decl., ¶3); (D.'s Br., Att. 1, at 53-54) (hereinafter "Arbitration Transcript").

I. Change of Management
Sometime in 2004 or 2005, Dee-J Putzier became manager of the Medical-Surgical Unit and Ronda Hansen became assistant nurse manager of the day shift, reporting to Putzier. (Arbitration Transcript, at 51,53, 475.) Sheridan reported directly to Hansen. Id. at 56. After Putzier arrived, she placed a new emphasis on improving the standard of nursing care and holding nurses to higher expectations. Id. at 260-262. This effort included placing computers in patient rooms, requiring "real time" computer charting at the point of care, electronic medication scanning, and chart auditing. [*4]  Id. at 433; (D.'s Br., #24, Ex. 3, Sheridan Dep., at 125-126) (hereinafter "Sheridan Dep."); (D.'s Br., #24, Ex. 3, Johnson Dep., at 24) (hereinafter "Johnson Dep."). According to Providence's director of nursing information services, Sheridan was not enthusiastic about learning computer charting, since she believed it was a barrier to providing patient care. (Arbitration Transcript at 444.) In late 2006, the unit also transitioned from 8-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts, which Sheridan disliked. Id. at 115.
Sheridan asserts that around the time Putzier and Hansen took leadership of the Medical-Surgical Unit, they began "a pattern of harassment" designed to force older nurses out of their jobs. (Sheridan Decl., ¶¶6-7.) This harassment consisted of hiring young nurses out of college and transferring, terminating, or accepting resignations of older nurses. Id. at ¶7. Sheridan stated that she "observed . . . targeting of older nurses on the unit which [she] did not see occur to younger nurses." Id.

II. Performance Problems
Before mid-2005, Sheridan's performance evaluations were mostly positive regarding her patient care and communication, although they indicated problems with attendance, continuing education, [*5]  and excessive overtime. In mid-2005, Sheridan's performance in other areas began to decline. Sheridan's 2006 evaluation, which covered the period from April 2005 to April 2006 and was completed by Ronda Hansen, identified two areas where Sheridan's work needed improvement: being a "team member" and "adapting to changing patient needs in the unit." (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 23.) Hansen commented that Sheridan had difficulty dealing with others on the team and other departments, sometimes acted disrespectfully, and needed to improve on signing off on doctor's orders to confirm that they had been completed. Id. at 4, 9; (Arbitration Transcript at 62-63.)
In fact, Hansen reminded Sheridan three times to sign off on physician orders, in addition to raising the same concern in Sheridan's evaluation. (D.'s Br., #24, Ex. 4, Dep. Ex. 17 at MS 0034)2. The problem persisted, and in November 2006 Providence issued a documented verbal warning noting that in the past six days Sheridan had failed to sign off on at least three charts. Id.; (Arbitration Transcript at 65-66.) The warning also addressed Sheridan's failure to perform chart audits, a new requirement initiated in March 2006 to assist the hospital's [*6]  "quality improvement efforts." Id.
In January 2007 Sheridan took a personal leave of absence from Providence because she was severely depressed after the death of her mother. (Arbitration Transcript at 117); (Sheridan Dep. at 26-27). She returned to work at the end of March 2007. (Ex. 14 at MS 0046.) Sheridan apparently continued to experience performance problems when she returned. Her 2007 evaluation, completed in August of that year by Hansen, noted that Sheridan required improvement in continuing education, since she completed only 10.3 out of 16 required hours. (Ex. 14 at MS0045.) Although all other areas were marked "meets expectations," Hansen noted several deficiencies in Sheridan's patient care, including one incident where Sheridan sent a patient home with an IV still in her arm and another where Sheridan failed to notice that a patient with a pacemaker was scheduled for a potentially dangerous MRI. Id. at MS 0046; (Arbitration Transcript at 667-69.) Consequently, Hansen wrote that "both of these incidents bring into question the ability of [Sheridan] to provide safe and competent patient care." (Ex. 14 at MS 0046.) Sheridan testified, however, that the patient with the IV [*7]  did not go home on her shift and thus, she did not discharge the patient with the IV still in her arm. (Arbitration Transcript at 123-124.) She also explained that she had no reason to know that second patient had a pacemaker, since she had not yet assessed the patient. Id. at 125.
The 2007 evaluation also reported that Sheridan was "not eager" to embrace the new medication scanning procedures and had "multiple incidents" where she gave a patient the wrong medication because she failed to scan the drug or check the medication order. (Ex. 14 at MS 0047.) Sheridan, however, explained that she was having a difficult time adapting to the system, which did not work well initially. (Arbitration Transcript at 126-129.)

III. Putzier's Statements
Sometime in 2006, Sheridan had a conversation with Putzier where Putzier made several allegedly age-related statements about her. (Sheridan Decl., ¶14.) Sheridan initiated the conversation to speak about the uncomfortable work environment and ask what Putzier planned to do about it. Id. Putzier responded that it was none of Sheridan's business what she planned to do and added that Sheridan was "burnt out." Id. Putzier also told Sheridan: "don't let the door hit [*8]  you on the way out," which Sheridan perceived as expressing Putzier's desire that Sheridan leave Providence. Id.

IV. Jack Keegan incident
Jack Keegan was a younger nurse hired at Providence by Putzier. (Sheridan Decl., ¶8.) During Keegan's employment interview in January 2007, he inquired about the rate of turn-over at Providence. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 24, at 1.) Putzier laughed nervously and told him that that some of the older nurses need to move on. Id. At some point after being hired, Keegan related this conversation to Sheridan. (Sheridan Decl., ¶8.)

V. Kaiban Incident
In August 2007, Sheridan observed an incident involving an older nurse on the unit, Esther Kaiban. (Sheridan Decl., ¶9.) On Kaiban's last day of work before retirement, she slipped and fell, injuring her knee. Id. Sheridan saw Kaiban sitting in a chair rubbing her knee and heard Putzier say "Oh, did you want to go home early on your last day, Esther?" Id. Putzier and Hansen both laughed and Kaiban "appeared humiliated." Id. Following the incident, Sheridan made a complaint to the Director of Nurses that Putzier and Hansen had treated Kaiban abusively and were targeting older nurses for termination. Id. at 11. Sheridan [*9]  did not see any investigation or corrective action occur and instead perceived that Putzier and Hansen began to target Sheridan and "create a hostile workplace" for her. Id. at 12.

VI. Refusal to Recommend for Scholarship
According to Sheridan, Putzier made statements on the unit praising the value of four year college degrees for nurses. Unlike many younger nurses who had bachelor's degrees in nursing, Sheridan had an associate degree. (Sheridan Decl., ¶13.) In June 2008, Sheridan was accepted into a university program that would allow her to obtain a bachelor's degree. Id. Sheridan sought financial assistance from Providence, which had a program to pay for advanced education for nurses. Id. To receive funding from Providence, Sheridan needed the recommendation of Putzier, the unit supervisor. Id. Putzier, however, refused to recommend Sheridan, stating that Sheridan "might be going to school but not on the hospital's dollar." Id. Sheridan did not pursue her bachelor's degree. Id.

VII. Further Performance Problems
In October 2008, Sheridan attempted to take a flu shot from a medication dispensing machine and asked another nurse to give it to her, despite knowing her actions violated hospital policy. [*10]  (Ex. 18 at MS 0067.) When the other nurse asked Sheridan if this was allowed, Sheridan told her it was not. Id. Putzier then entered the room and Sheridan several times told that other nurse "you are so dumb!" There were several other people in the room at the time, including a physician and some medical students. (Arbitration Transcript at 71-72.) Afterwards, Hansen explained to Sheridan that taking the flu shot was stealing, but Sheridan apparently did not understand the seriousness of the incident, so Hansen gave Sheridan a written warning. Id. Sheridan wrote a three page narrative explaining her perspective on the incident in which she described the management's response as an example of its general policy to "punish, humiliate, and maintain employee dis-ease . . . ." (Ex. 18 at MS 0067-0068.) Human Resource staff Grace Johnson later asked Sheridan if she wanted to discuss her comments, but Sheridan declined. (Sheridan Dep. at 157); (Ex. 20.)
In December 2008 and January 2009, Hansen noted several more incidents involving Sheridan's performance, although Sheridan's explanations of many of those events differ from Hansen's. (Exs. 21, 23, 24.) On December 23, 2008, Sheridan administered [*11]  an IV pain medication to a patient who was being cared for by two other nurses after the patient several times requesting pain relief. (Sheridan Dep. at 157-161.) Sheridan planned to tell the other nurses, but forgot, and also failed to immediately make an entry into the electronic medical chart. Id. The other nurses had decided to request a medication change switching the patient to an oral pain medication, but at the time Sheridan administered the IV, the orders still called for IV medication. Id.
On January 12, 2009, a patient's daughter complained to Hansen that Sheridan had acted abrupt, rushed and treated her mother roughly. (Ex. 24 at MS 0790.) Although Sheridan admits she was "a basket case," "extremely anxious," and "not able to do a good job under the circumstances," she states that she did not treat the patient roughly. (Sheridan Dep. at 167-169.)
On January 23, 2009, Hansen reported that Sheridan gave a patient a medication twice within two hours, even though the medication was ordered only twice per day. (Ex. 24 at MS 0791.) Sheridan explained that she may have given the patient the medication twice but an error scanning the medicine could also have accounted for double [*12]  entry. (Sheridan Dep. at 176.)
On January 26, 2009, Sheridan stayed two and a half hours after the end of her shift to complete charting because she had to finish work left over by newer nurses on the earlier shift. (Arbitration Transcript at 367-368); (Sheridan Dep. at 162-163.) That same day a patient's daughter complained to a charge nurse that Sheridan was ignoring her mother and had only been in her mother's room once in 12 hours. (Arbitration Transcript at 367.) Sheridan explained that she did not ignore the patient and actually resolved some of the daughter's frustration over her mother's treatment during a prior hospitalization by having a doctor come speak with the daughter. (Sheridan Dep. at 165.)
On January 27, 2009, despite having help from two other nurses in the morning, Sheridan failed to complete surgery paperwork in time for a patient's scheduled surgery. (Ex. 24); (Arbitration Transcript at 91); (Sheridan Dep. at 170). Sheridan explained that she had been busy making up for work left over by the night shift nurse. (Ex. 24); (Arbitration Transcript at 91-92).
Later that day, Sheridan believed that a dying patient's lungs were filling with fluid. (Sheridan Dep. at 170-172.) [*13]  Consequently, she stopped the patient's IV without consulting the physician and in contravention of the physician's orders that the IV remain in place. Id. Sheridan had previously spoken with the physician about discontinuing the IV, but the physician was frustrated with the family and said he did not want to discuss the issue with them further. (Sheridan Dep. at 174-175.) Sheridan felt compelled to stop the IV because of her duty as a nurse to do no harm to her patient. Id. at 172-173. After Sheridan stopped the IV, Hansen warned Sheridan that she was practicing medicine without a license and urged Sheridan to raise the issue with a physician. (Arbitration Transcript at 95-97.) Sheridan refused, got frustrated with Hansen, and left Hansen's office throwing her hands up in the air. (Arbitration Transcript at 97.) When Hansen had the physician reevaluate the patient, the physician determined that the patient's lungs were fine and there was no reason to turn off the IV. Id. at 98. At some point after turning off the IV, Sheridan explained to the patient's family why continuing the IV was harmful for a patient with kidney failure. Id. at 175. The family then agreed to stop the IV and Sheridan called another physician [*14]  who ordered the IV to be discontinued. Id.
The same day, Hansen discovered that Sheridan had charted that she administered itching medicine to a patient even though she had not actually done so. (Ex. 24 at MS 0791); (Arbitration Transcript at 99.) Hansen also noted some confusion with Sheridan's documentation of another of the patient's medications; Sheridan had given the patient IV Haldol as ordered, but had incorrectly coded the medication as oral Haldol and entered a note indicating it was administered by IV. (Ex. 24 at MS 0791); (Arbitration Transcript at 99-100.)
Also that same day, Hansen asked Sheridan to follow a new protocol for a delirium patient. (Ex. 24 at MS 0791) (Arbitration Transcript at 93-94). Although Hansen was not familiar with the protocol, she trusted Sheridan to carry it out. Id. The protocol required hourly delirium assessments and medication levels appropriate for the assessment results. Id. Later in the evening, Sheridan told Hansen that she had only done the assessments and medication at noon, 5 PM, and 6 PM, explaining that nurses did not do delirium patients on this particular floor, because the nurses did not usually do assessments every hour. Id. Hansen [*15]  expressed concerned that Sheridan had not sought out additional help to allow her to follow the protocol of hourly assessments. Id.

VIII. Review of Performance with Human Resources
On January 29, 2009, Hansen met with Grace Johnson, a Human Resources staff member, about Sheridan's performance issues. (Arbitration Transcript at 100-101). Hansen also examined an audit of Sheridan's charting indicating that Sheridan back-charted many events on January 23rd and January 26th, some as much as 12 hours after they occurred. (Arbitration Transcript at 102-104, 438-441); (Ex. E-76.) Hansen and Johnson scheduled a meeting to discuss Sheridan's performance issues. (Arbitration Transcript at 106.)

IX. Medical Leave
Sometime in November or December 2008, Sheridan had begun to experience sharp pain in her arms and wrists after moving a large piece of furniture. (Sheridan Decl., ¶16.) Sheridan's symptoms worsened to the degree that the pain prevented her from sleeping adequately at night. Id. Sheridan received a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Id. at ¶ 17. On January 30, 2009, Sheridan requested intermittent family medical leave effective January 27, 2009 so that she could stay home on days when [*16]  she could not work due to lack of sleep. Id at ¶¶17,20; (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 5 at 5.) Providence approved her leave request. (Sheridan Dep. at 186.) Indeed, Sheridan took at least one day off because she had not gotten sufficient sleep. (Sheridan Dep. at 187.)

X. Performance Observations
On January 27, 2009 and February 1, 2009, Sheridan noticed another nurse, Sue Gloier, following her and monitoring her work. (Sheridan Decl., ¶¶18-19.) No one explained why Gloier was following her and Sheridan believed that her supervisors assigned Gloier to monitor her as part of their plan to fire her. Id. at ¶19. Sheridan felt that being monitored was discriminatory and increased her anxiety about the workplace. Id. at ¶19.
An email from Gloier to Putzier and Hansen on February 1, 2009 confirms that Gloier was surreptitiously observing Sheridan's performance. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 5 at 48.) Gloier tried unsuccessfully to arrange to be charge nurse when Sheridan was working so that she could have the freedom to observe Sheridan, but still managed to observe Sheridan while she was caring for patients. Id. Gloier reported that at the beginning of her shift, Sheridan was in a "withdrawn/weird [*17]  mood," muttering to herself "as if she needed the verbal reinforcement to help her concentrate," and acting withdrawn and cool towards patients. Id. Later in her shift, Sheridan's mood shifted and she became talkative with patients and co-workers. Id. Gloier noted that Sheridan had "interesting mood swings" throughout her shift and appeared "almost borderline bizarre" by the end of the shift. Id. Gloier also reported that Sheridan took three official breaks, coming back each time smelling of cigarettes. Id. Overall, Gloier suspected there was "something seriously wrong" with Sheridan's "thought processes/emotions" and compared her behavior to another nurse whom she had monitored who turned out to be binge drinking on days off. Id. Gloier then directly posed the question: "Do you have any concerns that [Sheridan] might be binge drinking?" Id. Finally, Gloier suggested that the supervisors allow her to continue to monitor Sheridan under the guise of performing audits and helping out new hires. Id.

XI. Request for Medical Leave for Surgery
On February 2, 2009, Sheridan requested two months of full medical leave — from February 10, 2009 until April 10, 2009 - so that she could have bilateral [*18]  carpal tunnel surgery recommended by her doctor. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 5 at 51-52); (Ex. 30); (Sheridan Dep. at 186-188.) Providence approved Sheridan's leave request. (Arbitration Transcript at 1082.)

XII. February 3rd Meeting
Before Sheridan left on her medical leave, she met twice with Providence staff. On February 3, 2009, Sheridan, her union representative, Johnson, and Hansen discussed Sheridan's performance issues, including patient care, medication administration, and documentation. (Ex. 26); (Arbitration Transcript at 107-108); (Sheridan Dep. at 179-183.) Sheridan disputed several of the allegations of medication errors and said that the rest of the performance issues arose from her medical disabilities. (Sheridan Decl., ¶21.) Hansen also told Sheridan she would be placed on a work plan, which Sheridan perceived as a form of discipline. (Sheridan Decl., ¶21.) During the meeting, Sheridan also explained that her hands were bothering her and keeping her up at night, but that she had not been aware that it was affecting her work. (Ex. 26 at 4); (Arbitration Transcript at 108-110); (Sheridan Dep. at 181.) When asked by Hansen what Sheridan wanted, she responded that she wanted: [*19]  "1, immediate feedback if I get patient complaint. I want things fair/calm. Want the atmosphere to be not negative. Why is Sue Training. 2, support. 3, brought along if something is lacking." Id. at 182-183; (Ex. 26.) At some point, Sheridan told Hansen that she believed Hansen was trying to harass her as a part of the management's pattern of forcing older nurses towards termination. (Sheridan Decl., #21.) Ultimately, Sheridan accepted Providence's offer to start her medical leave immediately, even though she was originally schedule to begin leave on February 10, 2009. (Arbitration Transcript at 110.) After the meeting, Hansen called Sheridan to set up a meeting to follow up on their February 3rd discussion and Sheridan opted to meet on February 9, 2009, the day before her scheduled surgery. Id. at 114-115; (Ex. E-31.)

XIII. February 9th Meeting and Work Plan
On February 9, 2009, Hansen and Johnson participated in a second meeting with Sheridan where they placed her on a work plan setting out requirements in four performance areas. The work plan stated:
Respect: Madeline can have no patient complaints regarding lack of care, poor care, or disrespectful interactions. Madeline can have no disrespectful verbal outbreaks [*20]  with coworkers at the desk or in the hall.
Medication Administration: Madeline must comply with all the medication administration requirements. She must confirm her medication in Clinical Horizons before administration, bar code her patient ID band, bar code the medication, give the medication at the time it is bar coded and within the prescribed amount of time. * * *
Documentation: Madeline must follow the Providence Health and Service standards of charting (copy given). Real time charting must be done on all patients.
Prioritization: Madeline will get out of work in a timely fashion. Overtime will be at a minimum. * * * Madeline must come to the charge nurse when she is having difficulty keeping up with her patient care, medication administration, documentation, or any other aspect of her work. * * * Madeline will reorient with Sue Gloier [Clinical Resource Coordinator] for the first 2 days that she comes back to work to assess her level of organization and prioritization and Sue will offer recommendations for improvement.
(Ex. 32.) Hansen later described these as the same expectations she maintained for all nurses at Providence, but Sheridan characterized the plan as "unreasonable" [*21]  because it set a higher standard of performance than applied to other nurses. (Arbitration Transcript at 115-117); (Sheridan Decl., ¶¶26,27.) Indeed, Dawn Hersberger, a resource nurse who did not work in Sheridan's unit, found aspects of Sheridan's work plan either unreasonable (the requirement of no patient complaints for failure to provide proper care or for disrespectful interactions) or impossible (real-time charting for all patients). (Arbitration Transcript at 660-663); (Brischetto Decl., #32, Ex. 11, at 4-5). Hersberger admitted, however, that having no such patient complaints is Providence's "goal" for nurses and that back charting after many hours is not a good nursing practice. (Brischetto Decl., #32, Ex. 11 at 8-9.) Sheridan now declares that she had particular difficulty with the requirement to perform all charting in real time because of the ADD symptoms she was experiencing, although all areas addressed by the work plan were affected by her symptoms of depression, ADD, or carpal tunnel syndrom. (Sheridan Decl., ¶27.) During the meeting, Hansen and Johnson told Sheridan that she would be subject to termination if she failed to satisfy the requirements of the work plan. [*22]  (Sheridan Decl., ¶26.)

XIV. Physician's Release and Return to Work
On March 23, 2009, Sheridan's physician released her back to work on modified duty consisting of full shifts every other day for one week and full duty thereafter. (Sheridan Decl., ¶30); (Ex. 35). Putzier, however, told Sheridan that she could not return to work until April 1, 2009, in part because she did not want Sheridan working with any limitations and in part because Sue Gloier was on vacation. (Sheridan Dep. at 197-198.) Consequently, Sheridan missed three days of work. Id. at 199. About a year later, after Sheridan had filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), Providence sent Sheridan a check compensating her for the three missed workdays, which Sheridan refused to accept. Id.

XV. Meeting Director of Human Resources
On March 26, 2009, while still on leave, Sheridan met with Providence's Regional Director for Human Resources, Ed Freysinger. (Sheridan Dep., ¶33.) During that meeting, Sheridan told Freysinger about her medical problems, including severe depression and carpal tunnel syndrome. Id. She also said that she had been disciplined because of performance issues arising from those problems and because [*23]  she sought a leave of absence due to those problems. Id. Sheridan alerted Freysinger that she perceived her managers were harassing and terminating older nurses and that she felt that she was being forced to quit. Id. Additionally, Sheridan described how her managers refused to honor her doctor's release to modified duty after her surgery. Id. Sheridan requested Freysinger transfer her to a different unit, but Freysinger refused, citing the informal Providence policy of keeping employees with their current managers when there are existing performance issues. Id.; (Freysinger Dep. at 35-36.) Freysinger told Sheridan he would investigate her allegations and call her back, but he never contacted her again. (Sheridan Decl., ¶33.)

XVI. Return to Work
On March 30, 2009, Sheridan presented a physician's release to full duty without restrictions and Providence returned her to work on April 1, 2009. (Sheridan Decl., ¶34); (Ex. 37); (Sheridan Dep. at 207.) During Sheridan's first two shifts — April 1 and 3, 2009 - preceptor Sue Gloier worked with Sheridan to reorient her, as required by Sheridan's work plan. (Sheridan Dep. at 207-208); (Ex. 38.) Sheridan was not told that Gloier would be looking [*24]  for performance issues, but Gloier wrote an extensive report about Sheridan's performance. (Sheridan Decl., ¶35); (Ex. 38.)
On her first day back, Sheridan completed a "very difficult teaching session" with a hostile family member, but "remained distant and aloof." (Ex. 38 at MS 0596.) She initially resisted Gloier's suggestion to chart the teaching session immediately, but then documented the discharge at the main desk. (Ex. 38 at MS 0597.) She completed concise and accurate debriefs of CNAs. Id. Gloier identified several problems with the way Sheridan administered medications, instructed her on the correct method, and observed that Sheridan adopted those techniques by the end of her shift. Id. When Sheridan handled a catheter incorrectly, Gloier instructed her on proper techniques for catheters. Id. at MS 0598. Gloier also taught Sheridan how to save her computer charting mid-stream so that she could respond to call lights and pump alarms while she was charting. Id. Gloier also pushed Sheridan to complete her charting in patients rooms instead of sitting at the main desk, which Sheridan agreed reduced her stress but still resisted because it prevented her from resting her feet at [*25]  the main desk. Id. Sheridan explained that even before her surgery she had trouble staying on her feet for 12 hour shifts. Id.
Sheridan had trouble following procedures to arrange for a cigarette break with her nurse buddy. Id. at MS 0598 - 0599. She also became agitated in the afternoon because she needed a cigarette and began to verbally "bully" Gloier. Id. at MS 0599. Soon thereafter, Sheridan left for a break without securing a buddy to cover, causing Gloier to suspect that she often took unauthorized cigarette breaks that endangered the safety of patients. Id. at MS 0599-0600.
During her next shift, Sheridan demonstrated that she did not retain many of the techniques Gloier taught previously, quickly fell behind, and stopped making hourly rounds. Id. at MS 0601. Sheridan was emotionally warm to patients who were friendly and undemanding but detached and cool to those who needed significant emotional support. Id. Sheridan also refused a patient's request to fax a prescription to the pharmacy, even though she had time to complete the task. Id. Her cigarette breaks interrupted patient care. Id. at MS 0601-0602. Overall, Sheridan failed to adopt the techniques Gloier modeled for connecting [*26]  with patients and provided "Madeline-centered care and not patient centered care." Id. at MS 0602.
Over the next several shifts, Sheridan's supervisors noted a number of performance concerns. Sheridan did not chart in real time for a number of assessments and also failed to perform several assessments. (Ex. 44 at MS 0075-0076.) Several patients and families complained about Sheridan's nursing and one asked for another nurse to be assigned. Id. at MS 0074. Another nurse reported that Sheridan was acting strangely, had trouble focusing, made inappropriate remarks to a patient's family, and failed to properly tend to a surgical dressing on an abdomen wound or chart about the wound. (Ex. 41.) A coworker reported that Sheridan was having an exaggerated response to an incident, speaking rapidly, waving papers, and raising her voice. (Ex. 40); (Arbitration Transcript at 407-408.) Another co-worker observed Sheridan's disorganized speech and inappropriate laughter. (Arbitration Transcript at 268-269.) A nurse manager also received a complaint from a patient about Sheridan's care and angry outbursts in response to an IV alarm that repeatedly triggered. (Ex. 39.) In retrospect, Sheridan acknowledged [*27]  that she was "not okay at that point in time." (Sheridan Dep. at 225.)

XVII. April 14th and April 16th Meetings
On April 14, 2009, Hansen met with Johnson to discuss the complaints Hansen had received about Sheridan and to follow up on the work plan. (Arbitration Transcript at 123-124); (Ex. E-74.) Hansen monitored Sheridan on April 15, 2009, finding that she was doing "okay" and scheduled a meeting with her on April 16, 2009 to discuss her recent performance. (Arbitration Transcript at 126-127.) Hansen, Putzier, Johnson, and Sheridan were present at the meeting on April 16th, and Sheridan was informed that she would be issued a final written warning the next day. (Sheridan Dep., ¶37); (Ex. 42.) During the meeting, Sheridan was confronted with a long list of alleged medication errors. (Sheridan Decl., ¶ 39.) In response, Sheridan presented documentation from medical records explaining why in each case she had deviated from the computer-generated medication schedule. Id. During the meeting, Sheridan also expressed her dissatisfaction with having to do real-time charting while standing in patient rooms, stating that she preferred to chart several hours after the fact. (Arbitration Transcript [*28]  at 236-240); (Ex. 42).
At one point near the end of the meeting, Hansen stated that Sheridan's co-workers were telling Hansen that Sheridan was acting like a "tweaker" and Sheridan felt that Hansen was implying that Sheridan was psychotic. (Arbitration Transcript at 1112.) Sheridan then asked Hansen if she was insinuating that she and other co-workers thought Sheridan was crazy and Hansen responded that she was "concerned." Id. at 241, 1113-1114. Sheridan felt offended that people were concerned and perceived that Hansen and Putzier were trying to make her feel "awful" by raising this topic in a manner that was not compassionate or caring. Id. at 241, 1113-1114. Johnson interpreted this interchange as a denial by Sheridan that she suffered from any mental health problems. (Johnson Dep. at 97.)
At the end of the meeting, Sheridan told the others that she needed to go outside and cry because she was so upset, and requested to be excused from work. (Arbitration Transcript at 1113); (Sheridan Decl., ¶38.) After a long, uncomfortable silence, during which Sheridan felt that Putzier and Hansen intended to deny her request, one of Sheridan's supervisors finally agreed. (Sheridan Decl., ¶38); (Briscetto Decl., #31, Ex. 8 at 34). Sheridan [*29]  felt that her supervisors were trying to humiliate her. Id. Sheridan did not work the rest of her shift. (Arbitration Transcript at 243.)

XVIII. Resignation on April 17th
The next day Sheridan returned to work specifically to meet with Hansen. (Sheridan Decl., ¶40); (Arbitration Transcript at 133-134.) Putzier hovered around outside the meeting. (Sheridan Dep. at 244.) Hansen showed Sheridan the final written warning, which compared the expectations in her work plan with many of the performance issues that arose since Sheridan returned from medical leave. (Sheridan Decl., ¶40); (Ex. 44.) On the bottom of the final warning, Sheridan wrote "I cannot apparently function with computer documentation as my top priority," but Sheridan refused to sign the form to acknowledge receipt. (Ex. 44.) Hansen again showed Sheridan the list of medication errors without acknowledging Sheridan's documentation explaining those actions. (Sheridan Decl., ¶40.) During the meeting, Sheridan perceived that she was in a battle with her supervisors, was having a nervous breakdown and was "too anxious to reason." Id. Sheridan felt that she "just had to get the hell out of there." (Sheridan Dep. at 243, 245.) Sheridan [*30]  made a decision in the middle of the meeting to resign and wrote "I resign" on a piece of paper, signed it, and gave it to Hansen.3 (Sheridan Dep. at 244-245); (Ex. 43.) Hansen told Sheridan that resigning was not in Sheridan's best interest. (Arbitration Transcript at 1118-1119.) Sheridan responded that she did not know what to do and Hansen suggested she talk to Johnson in Human Resources. Id. Hansen called Human Resources, and when no one answered, she started to fill out resignation paperwork and walked Sheridan to Human Resources. Id. at 134-135.

XIX. Attempt to Rescind Resignation
Sheridan rested over the weekend and on April 20, 2009, Sheridan gave Human Resources Director Laurie Ayers Pino a note saying that she rescinded the resignation she previously gave to Hansen. (Ex. 47.) Sheridan told Ayers Pino that she was not capable of delivering good patient care while doing real-time charting, and that she wanted a transfer out of the Medical/Surgical Unit. (Sheridan Dep. at 260-261, 267.) Ayers Pino refused to allow Sheridan to rescind her resignation for several reasons. Providence had a general policy not to accept rescinded resignations, Sheridan's resignation appeared to be "thought out," [*31]  Sheridan had been clear that she did not want to work for Putzier, Sheridan did not agree with Providence's standards for computer charting, and a transfer to another unit or hospital would still require Sheridan to adhere to those charting standards. (Arbitration Transcript at 580); (Ex. 51.)

XX. Grievance Proceedings
On April 29, 2009, Sheridan filed a grievance, which was resolved through a binding arbitration proceeding. (Ex. 50.) The arbitrator denied Sheridan's grievance in its entirety, finding that Sheridan voluntarily resigned from her position because she was unhappy with the work environment and disagreed with Providence's real-time charting requirement, among other policies. (Blatt Decl., #26, Ex. 2 at 24-25.)

ANALYSIS
Sheridan brings three different types of claims in this action. First, Sheridan alleges claims for discrimination and retaliation based on age, disability, and perceived disability under the ADEA, the ADA, and Oregon law. Specifically, she argues that Providence harassed her through different treatment, excessive monitoring, unreasonable work plans, and a final written warning, all of which created working conditions that were so discriminatory that they amounted [*32]  to a constructive discharge. Second, Sheridan alleges that Providence failed to reasonably accommodate her disabilities as required under the ADA, causing termination of her employment. Finally, Sheridan alleges that Providence interfered with her rights to intermittent family medical leave under the FMLA and OFLA by barring her return to work for one week in March 2009 even though she possessed a physician's release back to work.
I find that the arbitral decision, which previously determined Sheridan resigned from her position voluntarily, does not preclude Sheridan from alleging constructive discharge. Nevertheless, Sheridan fails to create a genuine dispute concerning whether she was constructively discharged or subjected to a hostile work environment. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted on Sheridan's discrimination and retaliation claims. However, if there was a triable issue concerning constructive discharge or creation of a hostile work environment, I would recommend denying summary judgment on Sheridan's age discrimination claims because Sheridan creates a genuine dispute regarding whether Providence's proffered explanations for its conduct was a pretext for age discrimination. [*33]  In addition, I find that genuine issues of material fact remain for a jury concerning Sheridan's reasonable accommodation claim, including whether Sheridan notified Providence of her need for accommodation, whether Sheridan's conduct alone triggered a duty to begin the interactive process, and whether Sheridan cut off Providence's obligation to interact in good faith by denying she suffering from mental impairments. Additionally, despite Providence's attempt to compensate Sheridan for the wages she lost during the week she was not allowed to return to work following her surgery, Sheridan's FMLA and OFLA interference claim survives summary judgment because Sheridan has the possibility of recovering additional damages at trial.

I. Constructive Discharge

A. Collateral Estoppel/Issue Preclusion
Providence first argues that collateral estoppel- or issue preclusion- prevents Sheridan from pursuing her constructive discharge claims before this court because a grievance arbitrator already concluded that Sheridan resigned from her position voluntarily. I disagree and find that the arbitral decision has no preclusive effect on Sheridan's ability to pursue either her federal or state law claims [*34]  based on a constructive discharge theory.
In Markell v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of the NW, No. CV 08-752-PK, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95891, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95891 (D. Or. Sept. 14, 2009), this Court extensively analyzed whether an arbitral decision on a collective bargaining grievance should be granted preclusive effect in a federal judicial proceeding. The seminal case on this topic, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 59-60, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974), held that arbitral decisions resolving Title VII disputes issued pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement's mandatory arbitration provision are not to be given preclusive effect in any subsequent federal action. Markell, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95891, at *16. Crucially, Gardner-Denver recognized that even though grievance arbitration and federal litigation may focus on similar factual and legal disputes, they should still remain distinct. Gardner-Denver, 415 U.S. at 49-50 ("In submitting his grievance to arbitration, an employee seeks to vindicate his contractual right under a collective-bargaining agreement. By contrast, in filing a lawsuit under Title VII, an employee asserts independent statutory rights accorded by Congress. The distinctly separate nature of these contractual and statutory rights is not vitiated merely because both were violated as a result of the same factual occurrence."). Subsequently, in Wright v. Universal Mar. Serv. Corp., 525 U.S. 70, 119 S. Ct. 391, 142 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1998), the Supreme Court clarified that a waiver [*35]  of federal forum rights in a CBA that is less than "clear and unmistakable" cannot be effective. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95891, [WL] at *17, citing Wright, 525 U.S. at 80.
Most recently, in 14 Penn Plaza, LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 129 S. Ct. 1456, 173 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009), the Supreme Court refused to overrule Gardner-Denver and its progeny, but held that "a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate [federal] claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law." Id. at 1474. There, the CBA explicitly prohibited discrimination based on certain protected characteristics and stated that claims made under Title VII, the ADA, and the ADEA "shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures [] as the sole and exclusive remedy for violations. Arbitrators shall apply appropriate law in rendering decisions based upon claims of discrimination." Id. at 1461. Thus, the Supreme Court reasoned that "the collective-bargaining agreement's arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims," and thus, Gardner-Denver did not control. Id. at 1468-1469.
In light of this precedent, I concluded that when a CBA lacks a "clear and unmistakable" waiver of a federal judicial forum — as when the CBA only explicitly authorizes arbitration of contract-based claims — the arbitral decision does [*36]  not preclude later litigation of federal claims. Markell, 2009 U.S. District LEXIS 95891, at *19-20. My summation still comports with the more recent decisions on this topic. See, e.g., Mathews v. Denver Newspaper Agency LLP, No. 09-1233, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 11454, at *17-18 (10th Cir. 2011) (applying Gardner-Denver and finding no preclusion of statutory claims where CBA stated that "[t]he arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, change or modify any provision of this Agreement, but shall be authorized only to resolve the dispute submitted to him or her" and the dispute submitted to arbitration asserted no statutory claims); Martinez v. J. Fletcher Creamer & Son, Inc., No. CV 10-0968 PSG (FMOx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93448, at *12-13 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2010) (holding that arbitral decision had no preclusive effect because the CBA did not expressly reference or incorporate any of the statutes at issue).
Here, as in the recent cases cited above, the CBA lacks a "clear and unmistakable" waiver of Sheridan's right to litigate her claims in a federal judicial forum. Although the CBA at issue here contains a non-discrimination provision like in 14 Penn Plaza, that provision does not require the grievance process to be the sole remedy for violations of federal discrimination statutes, as does the CBA in 14 Penn Plaza. ( Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 15 at 6) ("The Hospital and Union will comply with applicable [*37]  laws prohibiting discrimination in employment matters because of race, color, national origin, religious belief, sex, age, marital status, veteran status, mental or physical disability; lawful activities relating to Union matters that do not interfere with normal Hospital routine, the nurse's duties, or the duties of other Hospital employees; or any other legally protected status, including applicable laws regarding harassment."). Additionally, the mere fact that Sheridan's rights against discrimination under the CBA overlap with her statutory rights does not serve as a waiver of the judicial forum. See 14 Penn Plaza, 129 S. Ct. at 1467 ("[b]ecause the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator authority to resolve only questions of contractual rights, his decision could not prevent the employee from bringing the Title VII claim in federal court regardless of whether certain contractual rights are similar to, or duplicative of, the substantive rights secured by Title VII.") (internal quotations omitted). Since the CBA here does not "expressly cover[] both statutory and contractual discrimination claims," it cannot serve as a "clear and unmistakable" waiver of Sheridan's federal judicial [*38]  forum. See Wright, 525 U.S. at 80; 14 Penn Plaza, 129 S. Ct. at 1474.
Applying the 10th Circuit's recent analysis in Mathews also reinforces this conclusion. First, the language of the CBA here is remarkably similar to that in the CBA at issue in Mathews, both of which narrowly defined grievances as contractual disputes over the terms of the CBA itself. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 15 at 45) (CBA defines a grievance as "any dispute by a nurse over the Hospital's interpretation and application of the provisions of this Agreement"); Mathews, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 11454, at *19 (CBA applied only to disagreements "as to the interpretation, application or construction of this contract [i.e. the CBA], including all disputes involving discharge or discipline."). Moreover, both the CBA here and in Mathews prohibit the arbitrator from expanding the scope of the issues to be resolved beyond those submitted by the parties. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 15 at 47) ("The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this Agreement."); Mathews, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 11454, at *17. Further, as in Mathews, all those involved- Sheridan, Providence, and the arbitrator- framed the issues to be resolved as disputes concerning interpretation of the CBA, not discrimination statutes. (Blatt Decl., [*39]  #26, Ex. 2 at 2-3). Thus, Sheridan is not precluded from pursuing federal discrimination claims based on constructive discharge.
The same result obtains for Sheridan's state law claims. Oregon courts embrace the reasoning of Gardner-Denver and apply it to state law discrimination claims under Or. Rev. Stat. Chapter 659, which, like Title VII, is meant to "afford an alternative or to supplement existing remedies in a collective bargaining agreement."c See Vaughn v. Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone, 289 Or. 73, 87, 611 P.2d 281 (1980); Andrews v. May Dep't Stores, 96 Or. App. 305, 313, 773 P.2d 1324, 1328 (1989) (acknowledging Vaughn as binding precedent and holding that an "arbitration award did not bar plaintiff's claims under ORS chapter 659 on principles of res judicata and that the parties are not collaterally estopped from relitigating facts that were decided in arbitration"). This line of Oregon cases based on Gardner-Denver remains good law. Faris v. Gamble, Inc., 133 Or. App. 221, 228, 889 P.2d 1363, 1367 (1995). Thus, the arbitral decision has no preclusive effect on Sheridan's state law constructive discharge claims under Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.030(1)(a),(b) for age discrimination, Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.030(1)(f) for opposing unlawful employment practices, or Or. Rev. Stat. 659A.112 for disability discrimination.
Finally, I agree with plaintiff that even if this Court were to find that collateral estoppel could theoretically preclude relitigation of Sheridan's claims based on the CBA arbitration, the elements of collateral estoppel [*40]  are not met in this instance. In particular, the arbitrator examined whether Sheridan's resignation was voluntary and found only that she possessed the "mental capacity to understand she was resigning from her job when she wrote the words 'I resign' and signed her name . . . ." (Blatt Decl., #26 Ex. 2 at 55.) Thus, by focusing only on Sheridan's mental capacity to resign, the arbitrator never applied the relevant tests under federal or Oregon law to determine whether Sheridan was constructively discharged.

B. Merits of Constructive Discharge
The standard for establishing constructive discharge differs under federal and state law. Under federal law, an employee's decision to resign constitutes a constructive discharge when a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt that she was forced to quit because of "intolerable and discriminatory working conditions."4 Knappenberger v. City of Phoenix, 566 F.3d 936, 940 (9th Cir. 2009). "Whether working conditions were so intolerable and discriminatory as to justify a reasonable employee's decision to resign is normally a factual question for the jury." Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., 80 F.3d 1406, 1411 (9th Cir. 1996). However, as a matter of law a "single isolated incident" cannot support a finding of constructive discharge. Id. at 1412; c.f. Poland v. Chertoff, 494 F.3d 1174, 1179 (9th Cir. 2007) (cross-country transfer [*41]  resulting in a demotion to a non-supervisory position was not, as a matter of law, a constructive discharge). Thus, the Ninth Circuit requires plaintiffs alleging constructive discharge to show some "aggravating factors" such as a continuous pattern of discriminatory treatment, Schnidrig, 80 F.3d at 1412, incidents of differential treatment over a period or months or years, Watson v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 823 F.2d 360, 361 (9th Cir. 1987), or "very poor working conditions" involving denial of promotions, efforts to embarrass and humiliate, and relegation to dull tasks, Satterwhite v. Smith, 744 F.2d 1380, 1383 (9th Cir. 1984). Harassing or discriminatory behavior ending well before the employee's resignation is insufficient for constructive discharge. See Manatt v. Bank of Am., 339 F.3d 792, 804 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding no constructive discharge when allegedly discriminatory conduct ended two years before plaintiff quit); Montero v. Agco Corp., 192 F.3d 856, 861 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding no constructive discharge where harassing behavior ended three to four months before the plaintiff resigned).
Here, I find that Sheridan presents insufficient evidence to advance to a jury on the question of whether Providence's conduct amounted to a constructive discharge. Sheridan asserts a course of discrimination starting in approximately 2006 and continuing until her resignation in April 2009. Therefore, I consider evidence of all events in that time [*42]  period, although I focus specifically on events temporally close to her resignation. This course of discrimination allegedly involved: Sheridan's observation of nursing management targeting older nurses for harassment starting in 2005; Putzier's insensitive comments to Esther Kaiban, an older nurse; Putzier's comments to Sheridan in 2006 and 2009 that Sheridan was "burnt out" and that she should not let "the door hit [her] on the way out;" Putzier's refusal to recommend Sheridan for a Providence program subsidizing Sheridan's tuition for nursing course work; Sue Gloier's surreptitious performance monitoring of Sheridan on two days in late January and early February 2009; Putzier and Hansen's imposition of an arguably unreasonable work plan on February 9, 2009; Providence's refusal to return Sheridan to work on March 23, 2009 pursuant to her physician's release; Ed Freysinger's refusal of Sheridan's request to transfer and apparent failure to investigate Sheridan's complaints following a meeting on March 26, 2009; Hansen's observation of Sheridan's work performance on April 15, 2009; Putzier and Hansen's confrontation of Sheridan with a list of numerous medication errors without considering [*43]  Sheridan's explanations of those incidents; and Sheridan's supervisor's awkward hesitation when Sheridan requested to be excused from work to cry after the end of a challenging meeting on April 16, 2009.
Even viewing these incidents in the light most favorable to Sheridan, I cannot conclude they both created objectively "intolerable and discriminatory working conditions" and involved aggravating factors such as a continuous course of discriminatory conduct or efforts to humiliate and embarrass. Most, if not all, of these incidents lack objective indicia of discriminatory motive. Aside from Sheridan's generalized assertion that Putzier and Hansen started targeting older nurses in 2005, Sheridan does not present sufficient evidence to suggest that any of these various incidents were related to her age, her disability, her perceived disability, or her opposition to unlawful activity, the alleged bases for discrimination. In fact, Providence presents undisputed evidence that Sheridan committed multiple medical errors affecting patient safety, which necessitated increased observation, supervision, and a work plan. Furthermore, although Sheridan subjectively found several aspects of Providence's [*44]  conduct to be humiliating, nothing indicates that others would have reacted similarly. Moreover, the undisputed fact that Hansen tried to convince Sheridan not to resign causes the court to question the reasonableness of Sheridan's view that Providence sought to force her from her job. Finally, Sheridan's attempt to rescind her resignation and return to work only days after she left severely undermines her argument that conditions at Providence were so intolerable and discriminatory that she- or any reasonable person- would feel compelled to quit. See Simmons v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, NO. C-10-14, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56371, at *15-16 (S.D. Tex. May 26, 2011) ("[plaintiff's] own allegation that she requested her job back almost immediately after resigning . . . negates any contention that her working conditions were intolerable.")
Since Sheridan admits that the Oregon standard for establishing constructive discharge is stricter than the federal requirements, Sheridan similarly fails to create a triable issue on constructive discharge under Oregon law. Consequently, summary judgment should be granted on the allegations within Sheridan's first and fourth claims for relief that rely on constructive discharge as the relevant adverse employment action. [*45] 

II. Hostile Workplace
Sheridan also argues that besides being constructively discharged, she was subject to a hostile workplace violative of the ADEA. To state a prima facie claim for hostile work environment based on age discrimination, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) she was subjected to unwelcome physical or verbal conduct sufficiently severe to be both subjectively and objectively hostile and so as to create an abusive work environment, and (2) defendant failed to take adequate remedial action in response to plaintiff's complaints. Smith v. Pathology Assocs. Med. Labs., LLC, No. 2:10-CV-126-HU, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84395, at *8 (D. Or. Aug. 1, 2011) (citing Dawson v. Entek lnt'l, 630 F.3d 928, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2011)).
It is clear from Sheridan's declaration and deposition testimony that she possessed a subjective belief that her work environment was abusive. Moreover, Sheridan complained to Human Resources Director Ed Freysinger on March 26, 2009 about Putzier's efforts to drive Sheridan to resignation, but Freysinger apparently never investigated further or initiated any remedial action. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 9 at 7). Thus, the dispositive inquiry is whether there is any evidence that Sheridan was subjected to objectively severe conduct creating an abusive work environment. [*46] 
To create a hostile work environment, defendant's conduct must be objectively offensive, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering "all the circumstances." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201(1998); DeWeese v. Cascade Gen. Shipyard, No. 08-860-JE, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87027, at *36 (D. Or. May 9, 2011). To determine whether conduct is sufficiently offensive to create a hostile work environment, courts consider the frequency and severity of the conduct, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's work performance. Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993).
As with constructive discharge, I find that Sheridan has not presented enough evidence of objectively severe conduct to advance to a jury on her hostile work environment claim.5 None of the conduct allegedly creating the hostile work environment involved physical threats. Sheridan was subjected to only two arguably discriminatory comments over the course of three years. She was observed intensively at work for at most three days. The allegedly humiliating incidents-the two comments from Putzier, the confrontation with medication errors, and the awkward pause by supervisors when Sheridan requested time to cry- were relatively few and mild. And, Providence's institution [*47]  of increased supervision and the work plan did not unreasonably interfere with Sheridan's performance; indeed, Providence apparently instituted these measures to improve Sheridan's performance by clearly delineating Providence's expectations of Sheridan and giving her the skills she needed to meet those expectations. Overall, while a reasonable person in Sheridan's position might have felt considerable pressure to demonstrate improved performance, there is no dispute that Providence did not subject Sheridan to objectively offensive conduct creating a hostile work environment.

III. Discrimination and Retaliation
Since I found that as a matter of law Sheridan did not suffer a constructive discharge or hostile work environment, Sheridan's discrimination and retaliation claims necessarily fail. Nevertheless, if Sheridan had established a prima facie case, including a showing of an adverse employment action such as constructive discharge or hostile work environment, her age discrimination claim would survive but her disability or perceived disability claim and her retaliation claim would still fail.
Concerning age discrimination, Sheridan adduces sufficient evidence to create a triable [*48]  issue concerning pretext.6 To show pretext, a plaintiff may either offer direct evidence of a discriminatory motive or specific and substantial circumstantial evidence tending to show that the employer's proffered motives are inconsistent or unbelievable, and thus, are actually pretext for unlawful discrimination. See Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1028 (9th Cir. 2006); Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 1998). Here, Sheridan presents a combination of both direct and circumstantial evidence. First, Sheridan offers some direct evidence that a Providence nurse manager sought to remove older nurses. Specifically, Putzier's comments to Jack Keegan in 2007 indicates that Putzier was engaged in a prolonged effort to replace older nurses on the unit. Moreover, in light of her statement to Keegan, Putzier's comment that Sheridan was "burnt out" suggests Putzier included Sheridan in that group of older nurses who needed to be replaced.
Additionally, Sheridan offers some specific and substantial circumstantial evidence that Providence implemented Sheridan's work plan for discriminatory reasons rather than to mitigate Sheridan's performance problems. As an initial matter, I do not give any credence to Sheridan's statistical evidence purporting [*49]  to show that Providence sought to rid the Medical-Surgical unit of older nurses.7 Nevertheless, Sheridan presents other evidence probative of pretext. Although resource nurse Dawn Hersberger testified Sheridan's work plan merely reiterated Providence policy and sound nursing practice, she declared that the absolute requirements of the work plan were not practically achievable. Thus, Hersberger's account suggests that even if Providence had legitimate concerns about Sheridan's nursing performance, the particularly strict work plan it imposed would virtually ensure Sheridan's failure. In sum, if Sheridan managed to establish that she suffered an adverse employment action, she would create a genuine issue for trial on her age discrimination claim.
Unlike with age discrimination, Sheridan fails to create a genuine dispute over whether Providence's conduct was a pretext for discrimination based on disability, perceived disability, or retaliation. First, Sheridan fails to provide any evidence whatsoever indicating Providence was motivated by her disability. Second, even if Providence nurse management suspected that Sheridan was binge drinking — and the record suggests they did not — binge [*50]  drinking is not a disability protected under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. §12114(c)(4); Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.127(5). Finally, Sheridan presents insufficient evidence to indicate that Providence nurse managers both knew of her complaints of harassment before they imposed the allegedly discriminatory work plan and associated disciplinary measures and took those steps because of Sheridan's complaints.

IV. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation
Unlike the claims discussed above, Sheridan creates a question of fact for trial concerning her second claim for relief that Providence violated the ADA and state law by failing to provide her reasonable accommodations for her disabilities. Sheridan argues that Providence failed to initiate the interactive process, despite being notified that her medical impairments caused her performance problems.
The Ninth Circuit holds that "employers, who fail to engage in the interactive process in good faith, face liability for the remedies imposed by the [ADA] if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible." Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc), vacated on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). "[A]n employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine dispute as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive [*51]  process." Id. The interactive process requires: (1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective. Zivkovic v. Southern California Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002). The interactive process is usually triggered by "an employee or an employee's representative giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for accommodation." Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1114. The employee need only "inform the employer of the need for an adjustment due to a medical condition using plain English and need not mention the ADA or use the phrase reasonable accommodation." Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1112.
Here, I find Sheridan creates a triable issue concerning whether she triggered the interactive process by putting Providence on notice that she needed an accommodation due to her medical conditions. Sheridan relies on two different pieces of evidence to demonstrate that she notified Providence of her need for accommodation. First, she declares that during the February 3, 2009 meeting she told Hansen that most of her "performance issues were issues arising from my medical disabilities." (Sheridan Decl., #21.) In oral argument, Providence described this [*52]  statement as a "sham" declaration, which contradicted Sheridan's earlier deposition testimony in order to create an issue of fact and avoid summary judgment. Providence notes that even after being given multiple opportunities to describe the full extent of her requests of Providence during that February 3, 2009 meeting, Sheridan never recalled raising a connection between her performance problems and her disabilities. (Sheridan Dep. at 182-184).
In the Ninth Circuit, the "sham affidavit rule" prevents a party from creating an issue of material fact by introducing an affidavit that contradicts prior deposition testimony. Kennedy v. Allied Mutual Insurance Co., 952 F.2d 262 (9th Cir.1991). Before applying the sham affidavit rule, "the district court must make a factual determination that the contradiction was actually a sham.'" Id. at 267. "Sham" testimony is that which "flatly contradicts earlier testimony in an attempt to 'create' an issue of fact and avoid summary judgment." Id. I do not find Sheridan's declaration to be a sham in this instance because Sheridan did not previously deny that she told Hansen her performance problems were connected to her disabilities. Rather, in her earlier deposition testimony, Sheridan merely stated that she did not recall any [*53]  additional responses to Providence's question during the meeting: "What do you want?" (Sheridan Dep. at 184.) Thus, Sheridan's more recent declaration supplements her previous account of the February 3, 2009 meeting rather than "flatly contradict[ing]" it.
Moreover, even if the above-described section of Sheridan's declaration is a sham and should be striken, Sheridan produces other evidence that she notified Providence of her need for accommodation. Sheridan arguably alerted Ed Freysinger, Providence's Regional Director of Human Resources, to her need for accommodation during their March 26, 2009 meeting. There, she disclosed a long history of mental health issues, seeking counseling from the employee assistance program and psychiatrists, and taking anti-depressants. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 9 at 5-6.) She told Freysinger that she was "emotionally collapsing" and that she needed to be put on medical leave for performance issues. Id. at 8-9. In the meeting she also talked about her deteriorating relationship with Putzier and Hansen. Id. at 7,15. At some point, Sheridan requested a transfer, which Freysinger rejected.8 Id. at 10. Providence characterizes Sheridan's request for a transfer as a response to the breakdown [*54]  of her relationship with her supervisors. Nevertheless, in the context of Sheridan's disclosures concerning her mental health problems and need for medical leave, Sheridan's request for a transfer can also be interpreted as a request for accommodation. This is precisely the type of factual dispute that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.
Even assuming, without deciding, that Sheridan did not explicitly raise her need for accommodation at either of those two meetings, Sheridan also creates a factual dispute over whether Providence was nonetheless bound to initiate the interactive process. See Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir 2001) (in some limited circumstances, the interactive process may be triggered by the employer's recognition of the need for an accommodation). An employer must initiate interaction if the employer: (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation. Barnett v. U.S. Air., Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir.2000) (citing EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with [*55]  Disabilities Act, EEOC Compliance Manual (CCH), § 902, No. 915.002 (March 1, 1999)).
Here, Sheridan satisfies the first requirement, since Providence admits that at least Hansen knew that Sheridan suffered from depression and ADD, and was being treated for both. (Arbitration Transcript at 136-137, 152.) Further, it is possible for a reasonable jury to conclude that Providence had reason to know that Sheridan's performance issues were linked to her disabilities, satisfying the second requirement. In their reports to nursing supervisors, several nurses described a series of alarming behaviors indicative of a mental impairment: Sheridan was "acting funny," not being "totally there," "having trouble focusing," telling people "she had an epiphany," and exhibiting "pressured speech," a "flight of ideas," and "thought processes not consistent w[ith] rational thinking." (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 5 at 15, 16, 69, 70.) In fact, after reviewing one of these reports, Johnson wrote a note in which she listed several potential next steps suggesting concern for Sheridan's mental health: "(1) Performance; (2) Drug Test; (3) Fit for Duty?; (4) Administrative Leave." Id. at 71.
Finally, a reasonable jury could find [*56]  that Providence knew or should have know that Sheridan's disabilities prevented her from requesting a reasonable accommodation, establishing the third requirement. Providence argues that Sheridan had twice previously requested leaves of absence and was not currently impaired in her ability to focus or concentrate. (Sheridan Dep. at 26, 30-31.) Nevertheless, there is also evidence that Sheridan experienced difficulty understanding and communicating about her situation. (Arbitration Transcript at 205-206) (during February 3rd meeting Sheridan was unable to answer questions put to her and Hansen was concerned that Sheridan had "no ability to see the things that were going on around her.") Further, Sheridan submits an expert declaration explaining that someone with her disabilities would have difficulty requesting more specific accommodations. (Brischetto Decl., #31, Ex. 1.) The combination of this evidence, Sheridan's rather bizarre behavior, and Sheridan's obviously tense relationship with her direct managers, creates a triable issue about Sheridan's ability to adequately request accommodation. Thus, a jury must decide whether Providence had an independent duty to initiate the interactive [*57]  process with Sheridan.
Providence argues that even if its duty to interact was triggered, Sheridan precluded any further discussion of potential accommodations by denying any mental health problems and thereby terminating the interactive process. EEOC regulations provide that if an employee with a disability rejects a reasonable accommodation offered by an employer and consequently cannot perform her job, the employee is no longer considered to be a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(d). Consequently, many courts hold that an employer fulfills its obligations under the ADA when an employee rejects its offer of a reasonable accommodation. See, e.g., Bellino v. Peters, 530 F.3d 543 (7th Cir. 2008); Cravens v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 214 F.3d 1011, 1019 (8th Cir. 2000); Kuehl v. Wal-Mart Stores, 909 F. Supp. 794 (D. Colo. 1995).
That is not the situation here, however. First, Providence never actually offered Sheridan a reasonable accommodation for her depression and ADD; it merely expressed concern about Sheridan's mental health. Thus, Sheridan arguably never rejected a reasonable accommodation offered by Providence, as contemplated by the EEOC regulations and case law. Further, it is debatable whether Sheridan even denied suffering from a mental disability before she resigned. The record indicates that during the April 16, 2009 meeting with [*58]  her supervisors, Sheridan became defensive in response to Hansen raising concerns about her mental health, asking Hansen if she was insinuating that Sheridan was crazy. Although Human Resources staffer Johnson interpreted Sheridan's response as a denial that she suffered mental health problems, Sheridan explained that she was simply reacting to the uncaring manner of Hansen's questioning. Moreover, I disagree with Providence that Sheridan's post-resignation April 20, 2009 statement to Human Resources Director Ayers Pino that, "I'm not crazy. I'm a perfectly sane RN in a crazy sit[uation]" somehow retroactively relieved Providence of its responsibility to engage in the interactive process with Sheridan in the months prior to her resignation. (Ex. E-95.)
I am cognizant of the difficulty Providence and other employers face when deciding whether to initiate the interactive process with an employee suffering from mental impairments, especially given the EEOC's guidance that it is generally inappropriate for an employer to focus discussion of performance problems on an employee's disability. See EEOC Guidance: The Americans With Disabilities Act: Applying Performance and Conduct Standards [*59]  to Employees with Disabilities, Section III(C)(13), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/performance-conduct.html#question (last visited Aug. 26, 2011). Nevertheless, factual disputes remain concerning whether Sheridan requested accommodation, whether Sheridan's conduct triggered Providence's duty to interact, and whether that duty persisted even after Sheridan rebuffed Providence's attempt to inquire about her mental health.9

IV. Interference with Family Medical Leave
Finally, I find outstanding factual issues remain on Sheridan's FMLA and OFLA claim. FMLA and OFLA10 both provide a right for eligible employees of covered employers to protected leaves of absence from work of up to twelve weeks for specified medical reasons, including an employee's own serious health condition. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601(b), 2612; Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 659A.159(1)(c), 659A.162. The FMLA creates two substantive employee rights: "first, the employee has a right to use a certain amount of leave for protected reasons, and second, the employee has a right to return to his or her job or an equivalent job after using protected leave." Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1122 (9th Cir. 2001), citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a), 2614(a). The right to reinstatement after taking FMLA is limited, however: [*60]  "Nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle any restored employee to . . . any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave." 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(3)(B). Sanders v. City of Newport,  657 F.3d 772  , 2011 WL 905998, at *6 (9th Cir. Mar. 17, 2011). By presenting "evidence that an employer failed to reinstate an employee who was out on FMLA leave to her original (or an equivalent) position," the employee establishes a prima facie denial of her FMLA rights. Sanders, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998, at *5 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b)).
To prevail on a FMLA claim, an employee must also prove that she has been prejudiced by the employer's violation. Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002). The FMLA provides for several types of damages: (1) "wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation;" (2) "any actual monetary losses sustained by the employee as a direct result of the violation;" (3) pre-judgment interest on denied wages, etc.; (4) liquidated damages equal to the sum of wages, etc. and interest, except that the court in its discretion may eliminate liquidated damages when the employer proves that the violation was in good faith and the employer had reasonable grounds for believing its conduct was [*61]  not violative of the FMLA; and (5) appropriate equitable relief, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A),(B).
Here, Sheridan argues that by failing to allow her to return to work under the conditions set out by her physician's release of March 23, 2009, Providence violated her right to intermittent leave under the FMLA. The parties dispute whether Sheridan's release satisfied the FMLA's requirements for a request for intermittent leave, as well as whether intermittent leave is even the appropriate characterization of Sheridan's request. Indeed, since Sheridan's release limited her to working 12-hour shifts spaced a least one day apart, and since defendants admit that Sheridan's normal work schedule involved 12-hour shifts every other day, Sheridan's modified release could also viewed as a request for reinstatement to her original position following her medical leave for surgery. Accordingly, there is at least a question of fact concerning whether Providence refused to reinstate Sheridan on March 23, 2009 in violation of the FMLA and the OFLA.
In addition, there remains a triable issue on the extent of damages for Sheridan's FMLA and OFLA violations. Providence argues that Sheridan [*62]  cannot possibly prove damages at trial because Providence tendered Sheridan a check for her three days of lost wages. Even if she had accepted it, however, the check for three days of lost wages would have been inadequate to compensate Sheridan for the alleged FMLA and OFLA violations. Under FMLA, Providence is liable for not only for Sheridan's lost wages, 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I), but also for prejudgment interest on those wages, 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(ii), and potentially, liquidated damages equal to the sum of the lost wages and interest. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii). Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate because the amount of damages on Sheridan's FMLA and OFLA claim remains to be resolved at trial.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Providence's motion for summary judgment (#23) should be granted in part and denied in part. Providence's motion should be granted as to Sheridan's claims for age discrimination, disability discrimination, perceived disability discrimination, and retaliation (first and fourth claims). By contrast, Providence's motion should be denied as to Sheridan's ADA and Oregon law for failure to provide reasonable accommodation (second claim) and Sheridan's FMLA and OFLA claim (third claim).
