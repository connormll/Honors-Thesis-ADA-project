Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court for consideration of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, (Dkt. 33), the Response in opposition thereto filed by Plaintiff, (Dkt. 34), and Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. 38) The Court has also considered the Parties' Joint Stipulation of Agreed Material Facts, (Dkt. 37), and Plaintiff's Material Facts Pertinent to Genuine Dispute. (Dkt. 39)
Upon consideration of all relevant findings, case law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Regina Height ("Plaintiff"), who is proceeding pro se, brings this suit against Defendant Denis Richard McDonough, Secretary of the United States Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA") and alleges that "she was subjected to [a] hostile work environment, retaliation, disability discrimination and illegal termination." (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 6)2 Plaintiff alleges [*2]  that the Defendant discriminated against her based on her disability—specifically, her thoracic aneurysm, major depression, and anxiety disorder. (Id. at 4)
Plaintiff is a former employee of the VA and was a Contract Specialist for Networking Contracting Office ("NCO 8"), Construction Team 2. (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 1) ("Stipulation") Plaintiff's chain of command included her immediate supervisor, W. Mark Johnson; Division Chief, Raymond McCain; Alternate Deputy, Dennis Bleckley; and Director of Contracting, Stephen Elliot. (Id. at ¶ 2) Plaintiff alleges that she began her employment at the VA on November 9, 2009. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 16) Prior to her employment at the VA, Plaintiff served in the military, obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration, and worked in various contracting roles. (Id. at ¶ 19) On April 17, 2015, the Defendant allegedly approved Plaintiff's Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") request, authorizing "12 work weeks of leave for serious health conditions [mitral valve regurgitation with Tachycardia]." (Id. at ¶ 28) Defendant then approved her subsequent FMLA request on April 18, 2016. (Id. at ¶ 32) On October 4, 2016, Plaintiff alleges that she was diagnosed with a [*3]  thoracic coronary aneurysm and that, due to this condition, she "has to keep blood pressure at 110/70 to prevent enlargement of the aneurysm." (Id. at ¶ 49)
On or about October 4, 2016, Plaintiff informed her supervisor, W. Mark Johnson, that she needed to request reasonable accommodation ("RA"). (Stipulation, Dkt. 37 at ¶ 3) W. Mark Johnson approved Plaintiff for full-time telework on an interim, ad-hoc basis, so that she could prepare and apply for reasonable accommodation. (Dkt. 33 at ¶ 4; Dkt. 1 at ¶ 52) A few weeks later, on October 20, 2016, Lou Demian, a Local Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator ("LRAC"),3 emailed Plaintiff "to introduce himself, explain the process for applying for RA, and provide the necessary forms for the plaintiff to complete, including the VA 0857e form." (Stipulation at ¶ 5) The LRAC requested that Plaintiff submit her VA 0857e form4 on October 20, 2016, November 9, 2016, January 9, 2017, and January 11, 2017. (Id. at ¶ 8) W. Mark Johnson informed Plaintiff on November 28, 2016, that she had to return to work on December 5, 2016, if she did not submit her completed VA 0857e Form by December 2, 2016. (Id. at ¶ 9)
On January 12, 2017, the Plaintiff was sent [*4]  an Order to Return to Duty ("January 12, 2017, Order"), but she failed to comply with the January 12, 2017, Order. (Id. at ¶ 15) The LRAC administratively closed Plaintiff's Request on January 25, 2017, because she failed to submit the VA 0857e form and attend any of the interactive meetings with the LRAC. (Id. at ¶¶ 10, 12) The LRAC had tried to schedule an interactive meeting with Plaintiff on three different occasions: December 14, 2016, December 16, 2016, and January 20, 2017. (Id. at ¶ 10) On March 23, 2017, Plaintiff was issued a Reprimand for her failure to comply with the instructions of the February 21, 2017, Proposed Reprimand. (Id. at ¶¶ 16-17) On August 22, 2017, Plaintiff was issued a Proposed Removal for unauthorized absences that totaled over 673 hours, but she never filed a reply to the Proposed Removal despite her right to do so. (Id. at ¶ 21) On September 7, 2017, Plaintiff was issued a Decision on Proposed Removal effective September 23, 2017, for unauthorized absences. (Id. at ¶ 22)
Prior to the filing of the EEO Complaint, Plaintiff filed an appeal on May 12, 2018, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), pursuant to 29 C.F.R. § 1614.403(a), from the Agency's April 13, [*5]  2018, final decision relating to her equal employment opportunity ("EEO") complaint. (Dkt. 1-2) On September 20, 2019, the EEOC issued its findings that Plaintiff was not discriminated against or harassed based on her disability and advised her that she had ninety (90) days to file a civil action. (Id. at 9) Plaintiff complied with the 90-day requirement by filing a Complaint on November 6, 2019. (Dkt. 1)
Defendant now moves for summary judgment, asserting that Plaintiff's disability-discrimination claim fails because Plaintiff "did not suffer adverse employment actions because of her disability," (Dkt. 33 at 13); her retaliation claim fails "because there is no causal link between the adverse employment actions and protected activities," (Id. at 15); her failure to accommodate claim fails because she "cannot show that the [D]efendant failed to provide reasonable accommodation," (Id. at 17); and, the hostile work environment claim fails because she "was not subject to unwelcome harassment that was severe or pervasive based on her disability or protected activities." (Id. at 18)

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
The Court must "grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute [*6]  as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Waddell v. Valley Forge Dental Assocs., Inc., 276 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining that "[s]ummary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law"). For a factual dispute between the parties to defeat summary judgment, the factual dispute must be "both genuine and material." Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2008). A fact is material if it "affect[s] the outcome of the suit under the governing law," and is genuine "if a reasonable trier of fact could return judgment for the non-moving party." Id.
A court will "construe the facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the non[-]moving party and when conflicts arise between the facts evidenced by the parties, [the court will] credit the non[-]moving party's version." Davis v. Williams, 451 F.3d 759, 763 (11th Cir. 2006) The role of the jury is to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, "[t]herefore, if the determination of the case rests on which competing version of the facts or events is true, the case should be submitted to the trier of fact and the motion for summary judgment denied." Hodgetts v. City of Venice, Fla., 794 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1271 (M.D. Fla. 2011)
A moving party discharges its burden on a motion for [*7]  summary judgment by showing or pointing out to the Court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. Denney v. City of Albany, 247 F.3d 1172, 1181 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). When a moving party has discharged its burden, the non-moving party must then designate specific facts (by its own affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file) that demonstrate there is a genuine issue for trial. Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320-1321 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). The party opposing a motion for summary judgment must rely on more than conclusory statements or allegations unsupported by facts. Evers v. Gen. Motors Corp., 770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir. 1985) ("conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value."). "If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact . . . the court may grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials . . . show that the movant is entitled to it." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act
Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act "forbid discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of public services." J.S., III by & through J.S. Jr. v. Houston Cty. Bd. of Educ., 877 F.3d 979, 985 (11th Cir. 2017). Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against a "qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application [*8]  procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C.A. § 12112. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits any "otherwise qualified individual . . ., solely by reason of her or his disability, [from] be[ing] excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Disability discrimination claims "under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards, and the two claims are generally discussed together." J.S., III by & through J.S. Jr., 877 F.3d at 985.
To establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that she has a disability; (2) that she was qualified to serve in her position, with or without some reasonable accommodation, despite her disability; and (3) that she suffered some adverse employment action because of her disability. Doe v. Dekalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1445 (11th Cir. 1998). Under the ADA, there are two separate categories of disability discrimination claims; "(1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." Toliver v. City of Jacksonville, No. 3:15-CV-1010-J-34JRK, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48523, 2017 WL 1196637, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 31, 2017). "The third element of the prima facie case of discrimination is proven in different ways depending on [*9]  the type of ADA claim." Haines v. Cherokee Cty., No. 1:08-CV-2916-JOF/AJB, 2010 WL 2821853, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:08-CV-02916-JOF, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71524, 2010 WL 2821780, at *16 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2010). For a disparate treatment claim, the plaintiff must establish the "third element by showing that she suffered an adverse employment action and that her disability was the determining factor in her termination." Id. A failure to accommodate claim, "is proven by showing that the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the disabled plaintiff." Id.
1. No reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff suffered her adverse employment actions due to her disability
Disparate treatment relates to "discriminatory intent and occurs when a disabled person is singled out for disadvantage because of his disability." L.E. v. Ragsdale, 2021 WL 4841056, at *2. A disparate treatment claim "requires a plaintiff to show that [s]he has actually been treated differently than similarly situated non-handicapped people." Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1216 (11th Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the ADA, the Plaintiff must establish: (1) that she has a disability; (2) that she was qualified to serve in her position, with or without some reasonable accommodation, despite her disability; and (3) that she suffered some adverse employment action because of her disability. Doe v. Dekalb Cty. Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1445 (11th Cir. 1998). Unlawful discrimination [*10]  will be presumed if these elements are established, and the defendant "can rebut this presumption only by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason (or reasons) for the adverse employment action." Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir. 1999). If the defendant meets this burden, then the plaintiff must prove, "more probably than not, that the [defendant] took an adverse action against him on the basis of his disability." Toliver, 2017 WL 1196637 at *7.
To survive a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must offer some evidence that a defendant took an adverse employment action solely by reason of plaintiff's disability— "[m]ere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment." Fort v. Thompson, No. 1:04-CV-0060-CAP, 2006 WL 8431283, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 5, 2006), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:04-CV-60-CAP, 2006 WL 8431348 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 29, 2006) (finding that plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act where "[p]laintiff . . . offer[ed] no evidence, beyond her conclusory allegations, that [d]efendant's failure to approve or deny [p]laintiff's . . . application was solely by reason of [p]laintiff's impairments").
The Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff suffered adverse employment actions because of her disability.
First, Plaintiff fails to proffer her own specific facts (by [*11]  affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file) to support her claims. In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following adverse employment actions: Defendant's "clos[ing] out [of] Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request," (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 7); Defendant's issuance of "reprimand to Plaintiff to come into the office to work on March 23, 2016" (Id. at ¶ 81); Defendant's cutting off Plaintiff's VPN access and wages, (Id. at ¶ 85); removal of Plaintiff from federal civilian service on September 7, 2017, (Id. at ¶ 92); and her loss of "federal civilian retirement pension." (Id. at ¶ 110) These allegations show that Plaintiff was terminated, but they do not support a contention that the adverse employment actions were improper.
In its Motion, Defendant proffers specific facts through sworn declarations that Plaintiff suffered adverse employment actions because of her misconduct unrelated to her disability. Specifically, Defendant offers the declaration of Plaintiff's LRAC coordinator that "[Plaintiff] had to follow all the rules and go through the process for Reasonable Accommodation [and that] she failed to do so." (Dkt. 33-1, Ex. 3 at 123-124, ¶ 13) Plaintiff [*12]  does not provide evidence that she followed the process for Reasonable Accommodation. Instead, she admits that she "never attended any of the scheduled meetings" and she failed to submit the VA 0857e form. (Dkt. 37 at ¶¶ 10, 12) Defendant also offers the declaration of Plaintiff's supervisor, W. Mark Johnson, in which he states that Plaintiff's "medical condition, disability, request for reasonable accommodation, request for FMLA leave, and EEO activity had nothing to do with her reasonable accommodation request being administratively closed" and "nothing to do with her removal." (Dkt. 33-1, Ex. 4 at 140, ¶¶ 16-17)
Additionally, Defendant proffers the Declaration of Rachel Terranova, an Employee Labor Relations Specialist for the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, in which she explains that Plaintiff "repeatedly failed to follow supervisory instructions to return to work, [that] her actions were considered as a misconduct and therefore subject to discipline (up to and including removal from her position)." (Id., Ex. 5 at 145-146, ¶ 3) She further attests that Plaintiff's actions were the cause of her removal and that Plaintiff's "medical condition, disability, request for FMLA, request [*13]  for reasonable accommodation, and EEO complaint had absolutely no connection to or effect on her removal." (Id. at 149, ¶ 14)
Plaintiff does not provide any of her own specific facts to rebut this evidence. Furthermore, Plaintiff's own admissions refute her claim that her supervisors took the adverse employment actions solely because of her disability. She admits that she failed to participate in the reasonable accommodation application process and return to work. Plaintiff further admits that her "immediate supervisor . . . never made any negative or derogatory comments about her medical condition or disability [,]" (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 26), and "that no statements were made to the plaintiff to indicate that the VA was cutting off her VPN access, pay, and employment because she had applied for medical/disability retirement, engaged in the EEO process, applied for reasonable accommodation or had a disability." (Id. at ¶ 28) Plaintiff also admits that she never submitted a completed VA Form 0857e5 ; never attended any of the scheduled interactive meetings; did not comply with the January 12, 2017 Order to Return to Duty; received the February 21, 2017 notice of Proposed Reprimand but failed [*14]  to follow the instructions; and that she received the March 23, 2017 Order (Second Notice of Order to Return to Duty), but did not report to duty as required by the Order. (See Dkt. 33-1). In light of these admissions, no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff suffered disability discrimination. She simply cannot establish a link between the adverse employment actions and her disability.
2. No reasonable jury could find that a reasonable accommodation was not provided as Plaintiff admits that she did not properly follow the accommodation process
Although Defendant contends that it never denied Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodations, but only administratively closed her request due to her failure to engage in the interactive process, the Court nonetheless will next consider Plaintiff's contention that Defendant did not provide her a reasonable accommodation when it denied her request to continue to telework indefinitely. (Dkt. 33-1, Exhibit 3 at 122-23, ¶ 11; Dkt. 39 at ¶ 3)
An employer "unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for the disability—unless doing so would impose [*15]  undue hardship on the employer." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish discrimination by failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff "must merely show that (1)[s]he was disabled, (2) [s]he was otherwise qualified, and (3) a reasonable accommodation was not provided." Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *5 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007).
The Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that the Defendant unreasonably withheld an accommodation from plaintiff because the record establishes conclusively that Plaintiff failed to complete the process to obtain a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff admits that she never attended any of the scheduled interactive meetings, despite the LRAC's attempts to schedule meetings on December 14, 2016, December 16, 2016, and January 20, 2017. (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 10) She also admits that she did not submit the VA 0857e form, despite having ninety-six (96) days to complete the RA process. (Id. at ¶ 12)
Plaintiff claims that the LRAC "lied . . . about receipt" of her medical records. (Dkt. 39 at ¶ 9) Plaintiff claims that on December 14, 2016 the LRAC received her 18-page "clinical psychological medical report, dated December 2, 2016," stating that Plaintiff was "suicidal and work environment [w]as negatively impacting [*16]  her health." (Dkt. 34 at ¶ 3; Dkt. 34-1, Exhibit 2 at 17) As such, Plaintiff argues that there was no need for her health care provider to complete the VA 0857e form because she had already provided the necessary medical documentation.
The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff's failure to submit the VA 0857e form prevented the progression of the interactive process between herself and her employer.6 See Dillard v. City of Austin, 837 F.3d 557, 563 (5th Cir. 2016) ("The interactive process is a two-way street; it requires that employer and employee work together, in good faith, to ascertain a reasonable accommodation."). As noted by the LRAC, VA 0857e does more than just describe an individual's medical conditions. It also "helps the LRAC understand the employee's functional limitations and brainstorm ways to work around the employee's limitations without sacrificing essential job duties." (Dkt. 33-1, Exhibit 3 at 119, ¶ 4) The form considers: "(a) the job duties the employee is unable to perform due to the disability; (b) the nature, severity and duration of the impairment; (c) one or more activities the impairment limits; (d) the extent or degree to which an impairment limits an activity; (e) the reason the employee requires an accommodation; [*17]  and (f) how the accommodation will assist an employee in performing the essential functions of the position." (Id.) As such, according to the LRAC, relying solely on Plaintiff's medical records would not suffice because "medical records are not a substitute for the VA 0857e medical form." (Id.)
Furthermore, even if the LRAC had considered Plaintiff's medical records, the LRAC was still entitled to request additional documentation from Plaintiff, including the VA 0857e medical form. Plaintiff had a continuing obligation to engage in the interactive process with the Defendant by submitting the appropriate documentation and attending an interactive meeting. The VA Handbook makes it clear that employees must "engage in the interactive process" by working with their supervisors, human resources management representatives, the VA's accessibility and training center, and the U.S. Department of Defense's Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program to identify accommodations that will enable them to perform the essential functions of their job, participate in VA activities, and/or enjoy the benefits and privileges of VA employment. VA Handbook 5975.1, part m, no. (2). While Plaintiff contends [*18]  that she informed Defendant that she "require[d] a representative to engage in the [interactive meetings] on her behalf," (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 64), Plaintiff proffers no evidence that she "engage[d] in the interactive process" by working with a human resources management representative. See VA Handbook 5975.1, part m, no. (2). In any event, as explained above, Plaintiff's failure to provide the VA 0857e medical form after multiple requests serves as an independent basis for finding that she failed to "cooperate" in the interactive process with the LRAC and her supervisor. (Dkt. 33-1, Exhibit 3 at 119, ¶ 3)
In sum, Plaintiff offers no evidence that creates a genuine issue for trial as to whether Defendant provided, or at the very least attempted to provide her with, a reasonable accommodation. See D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2020) ("an employer will not be liable for failure to accommodate if the employee is responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process.").

B. Retaliation Claim
Title VII prohibits retaliation against "an employee because she has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by Title VII, or because she has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, [*19]  proceeding, or hearing." Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a)). The Rehabilitation Act's anti-discrimination provision "incorporates the anti-retaliation provision of the ADA . . . [so,] the prima facie case for retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as that under the ADA." Albra v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F. App'x 885, 891 (11th Cir. 2007).7
To state a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show (1) that "she engaged in statutorily protected activity," (2) that "she suffered an adverse action," and (3) "that the adverse action was casually related to the protected activity." Gogel v. Kia Motors Mfg. of Ga., 967 F.3d 1121, 1134 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 924 (11th Cir. 2018); Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281, 1307-08 (11th Cir. 2009). In the Eleventh Circuit, at the prima facie stage of the review process, courts "construe[] the causal link element broadly so that a plaintiff merely has to prove the protected activity and the negative employment action are not completely unrelated." McWhorter v. Nucor Steel Birmingham Inc., 304 F. Supp. 3d 1185, 1194 (N.D. Ala. 2018) (quoting Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., 513 F.3d 1261, 1278 (11th Cir. 2008)); see also McNeal v. Duval Cty. Sch. Bd., No. 3:11-CV-00498-J-32, 2011 WL 6010293, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 1, 2011) ("[t]o establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated."). A plaintiff can also establish a prima facie case "by showing close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse . . . action." Tolar v. Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, LLP, 997 F.3d 1280, 1294 (quoting Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007)).
Here, Plaintiff alleges that "she experienced [*20]  retaliation after she filed her EEO complaint on March 30, 2017, when the VA cut off her VPN remote access to government programs, pay, and employment," (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 27), which occurred on April 28, 2017. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 85; Dkt. 1-2 at 5) In addition, Plaintiff alleges two more retaliatory acts: the cutting off of her pay and the issuance of a "memorandum to remove [her] from federal service," which occurred on April 28, 2017, and September 7, 2017, respectively. (Dkt. 33-1, Ex. 1 at 35, 133:22-134:11; see also Dkt. 1 at ¶¶ 85, 92) On this record, the Court finds that Plaintiff established a prima facie case based on her filing of the EEO Complaint. Notably, Defendant does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case for retaliation. (See Dkt. 33 at 16) First, the filing of the EEO Complaint constituted protected activity. After filing the charge, Plaintiff was cut off from remote access to government programs, pay, and employment. Finally, there was a presumptive causal connection between the two events due to the close temporal proximity between the filing of the EEO Complaint and the adverse actions. See Gogel, 967 F.3d at 1136.
Once the prima facie case is established, there [*21]  is a "presumption that the adverse action was the product of an intent to retaliate." Id. at 1135. The burden of production then shifts to the defendant to rebut that presumption by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the defendant is able to produce such a reason and meet its burden, the presumption is rebutted, and the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the "proffered reason was merely a pretext to mask [retaliatory] actions." Id. At this stage, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove "that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action." Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 352, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013).
Defendant proffers legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment actions. Defendant explains that the adverse employment actions did not stem from Plaintiff's filing of the EEO complaint, but rather her "own doing"—specifically, her failure to "complete the reasonable accommodation application process," "report to duty as ordered," "to meet the criteria for disability retirement," and "seek reconsideration of the denial of her disability retirement." (Dkt. 33 at 16) (citing Dkt. 33-1, Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 8-10; Exhibit 4 at ¶¶ 16-17, 20; Exhibit 5 at [*22]  ¶ 14) Moreover, Plaintiff "admits that no statements were made to [her] to indicate that the VA was cutting off her VPN access, pay, and employment, because she had . . . engaged in the EEO process...." (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 28) She also admits that she "never complied with the January 12, 2017 [Order to Return to Duty]." (Id. at ¶ 12)
In her Response, Plaintiff proffers no evidence to establish that but for her filing of an EEO complaint, Defendant would not have taken the adverse employment actions against her. Plaintiff does not provide any additional evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the claimed adverse employment actions were related in any way to her filing of the EEO Complaint. In her Material Facts Pertinent to Genuine Dispute,8 Plaintiff notes that she "filed a formal EEO Complaint on March 30, 2017 [and that] [t]hese employees retaliated against her by taking steps to deny [her] right to employment." (Dkt. 39 at ¶ 12) But Plaintiff's conclusory statement that she suffered retaliation does not counter Defendant's evidence that the adverse employment actions were unrelated to Plaintiff's filing of the EEO Complaint. Consequently, on this record no reasonable [*23]  jury could conclude that Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff because she filed an EEO complaint.

C. Hostile Work Environment
Under Title VII, a hostile work environment claim is established by showing that the "workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). The Eleventh Circuit "has never recognized a hostile work environment claim under the ADA." Phillips v. Harbor Venice Mgmt., LLC, No. 8:19-CV-2379-T-33TGW, 2020 WL 2735201, at *391011, 2020 WL 2735201, at *3 (M.D. Fla. May 26, 2020) (citing to Menzie v. Ann Taylor Retail Inc., 549 F. App'x 891, 896, n. 9 (11th Cir. 2013) ("We have never held in a published opinion that a hostile work environment claim is available under the ADA.")). However, in unpublished opinions, panels of this circuit have reasonably "assume[d] . . . that an ADA hostile-work environment claim exists" because the ADA "uses identical language" as a "gender-based hostile work environment" claim under Title VII. Stewart v. Jones Util. & Contracting Co. Inc., 806 F. App'x 738, 741 (11th Cir. 2020) (comparing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) with 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)).9 Therefore, this Court examines Plaintiff's hostile work environment and retaliatory hostile work environment claims using Title VII standards. Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim is governed by the "severe or pervasive" standard, while the retaliatory hostile work environment [*24]  is governed by "the well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination" standard. See Monaghan v. Worldpay US, Inc., 955 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir. 2020) (citing Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)).
1. No reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on her hostile work environment claim because Plaintiff does not proffer any evidence of unwelcome harassment, based on her disability, that is pervasive and severe
To establish a hostile work environment, the plaintiff must show: "(1) that [s]he belongs to a protected group; (2) that [s]he has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment [was] based on a protected characteristic of the employee, [such as a disability] . . . ; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) that the employer is responsible for such environment under either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability." Miller, 277 F.3d at 1275. The "severe or pervasive" prong includes "both an objective and a subjective component," in that "the employee must subjectively perceive the harassment as severe or pervasive enough to change the terms of her employment, and the harassment must result in [*25]  an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." Id. In examining the objective component, courts "consider the frequency and severity of the retaliatory conduct, as well as whether it (1) is physically threatening or humiliating, and (2) unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance." Phillips, 2020 WL 2735201, at *4.
Regarding the hostile work environment claim, no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff suffered pervasive and severe harassment due to her disability because Plaintiff fails to counter, with admissible evidence, Defendant's proffered evidence that no such harassment occurred. Defendant argues that Plaintiff "was not subject to unwelcome harassment that was severe or pervasive based on her disability or protected activities." (Dkt. 33 at 18) To support the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, Defendant offers Plaintiff's own admissions. Defendant proffers evidence that Plaintiff admits that her immediate supervisor, the division chief, and the director of contracting "never made any negative or derogatory comments about her medical condition or disability." (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 26) Similarly, in Plaintiff's deposition, she testifies that she was never the [*26]  victim of derogatory comments relating to her disability. Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence to counter Defendant's claim that Plaintiff "was not subject to any unwelcome harassment as a result of her disability or protected activity." (Dkt. 33 at 19).
A few examples illustrate the point. First, in her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was "cursed [at] and yelled at . . . in private discussions," but she fails to proffer any evidence to show that this treatment was severe or pervasive, or occurred because of her disability. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 34) Second, Plaintiff testifies that her Division Chief, Raymond McCain "never said anything negative" about her health or disability, and that he never did "anything else [aside from reprimands for her failure to physically attend work] to punish [her] for teleworking or requesting to telework because of her medical condition." (Exhibit 33-1, Exhibit 1 at 60:4-61:12). Plaintiff also testifies that the reason for these reprimands stemmed from her failure to come into the office because she was "never given authorization to telework for a medical condition." (Id. at 61:20-62:2)
Plaintiff further references "an anonymous email [that] was sent requesting [*27]  assistance for the hostile and abusive environment at Tampa Network Contracting Agency." (Dkt. 34 at ¶ 13) The email allegedly concerned the actions of Mr. Stephen Elliot, Director of Network Contracting. Plaintiff contends that he "played an intricate role in all punitive actions taken against the plaintiff and her loss of employment" and that "[n]o employee . . . should be subject to an abusive work environment." (Dkt. 39 at ¶ 11) However, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence that this email concerned her directly or that it was related in any way to her disability. In fact, the email contends that Mr. Elliot is "a serious bully," "walks around and bothers people unnecessarily," and "judges them for small things like having their office door closed even though he does not know why their door was closed." (Dkt. 34-1 at 55) There is no indication that any employee faced harassment due to a disability. As such, while Plaintiff's interactions with Mr. Elliot may have been unpleasant, she has not established that he subjected her to a hostile work environment based on a protected characteristic. See Miller, 277 F.3d at 1275.
Consequently, because Plaintiff fails to designate specific facts by her own affidavits, [*28]  depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff suffered from a hostile work environment.
2. No reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff on the retaliatory hostile work environment claim because Plaintiff does not proffer any evidence of unwelcome harassment, based on her disability, that might have dissuaded her from making a charge of discrimination
Title VII also "prohibits the creation of a hostile work environment in retaliation for an employee's engagement in protected activity." Tonkyro v. Sec'y, Dep't of Veterans Affs., 995 F.3d 828, 835 (11th Cir. 2021) (citing to Gowski v. Peake, 682 F.3d 1299, 1312 (11th Cir. 2012), which held that the 11th circuit "recognizes a cause of action for retaliatory hostile work environment").10 To state such a claim, the plaintiff must show: "(1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) after doing so, she was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) her protected activity was a but for cause of the harassment; (4) the harassment was such that it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination; and (5) a basis exists for holding her employer liable, either directly or vicariously." Kavianpour v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., No. 120CV00152MLBRGV, 2021 WL 2638999, at *2644055, 2021 WL 2638999, at *26 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 28, 2021), report and recommendation [*29]  adopted as modified sub nom. Kavianpour v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, No. 1:20-CV-152-MLB, 2021 WL 2635854 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 29, 2021), reconsideration denied, No. 1:20-CV-152-MLB, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143475, 2021 WL 3285445 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 2, 2021).
The Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff suffered from a retaliatory hostile work environment. There is no dispute that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity by filing an EEO complaint on March 30, 2017. (Dkt. 37 at ¶ 27) However, Defendant proffers evidence that Plaintiff was never subjected to harassment as a result of filing an EEO complaint. Plaintiff admits that her immediate supervisor, the division chief, and the director of contracting "never made any negative or derogatory comments about her medical condition or disability," (Dkt. 37, at ¶ 26). Plaintiff also admits that "no statements were made to [her] to indicate that the VA was cutting off her VPN access, pay, and employment, because she had . . . engaged in the EEO process. . . ." (Id. at ¶ 28) Plaintiff testified to the same in her deposition. (Dkt. 33-1, Ex. 1 at 137:17-140:1) In light of Plaintiff's admissions, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff was subject to a retaliatory hostile work environment.
