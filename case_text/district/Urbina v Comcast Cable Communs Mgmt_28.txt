ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Re: ECF Nos. 40, 42

INTRODUCTION
In this case based on diversity jurisdiction, the plaintiff Misael Urbina sued his former employer Comcast for wrongful termination based on his disability in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940.1 See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Mr. Urbina hurt his back on the job, permanently lost his ability to lift more than 25 pounds, and as a result, lost his job as a Comcast network technician. Comcast contends that an essential function of the job was lifting 70 pounds or more.2 Mr. Urbina counters that Comcast could have accommodated his disability by accommodating his lifting restriction or by offering him a different, open job and in any event did not engage in the good-faith interactive process [*2]  that FEHA requires.3
Both parties moved for summary judgment.4 The court grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment and denies Mr. Urbina's motion because (1) lifting 70 pounds or more is an essential job function, (2) Comcast was not required to offer a permanent job modification, and (3) Mr. Urbina has not met his burden of establishing that an accommodation was objectively available to him.

STATEMENT

1. The Network Tech Job
Mr. Urbina began working for Comcast's predecessor in September 1999 as an installer.5 He continued with Comcast and was promoted in 2003 or 2004 to a CommTech 4 ("Network Tech") in Comcast's Network department.6 Beginning in 2010, Mr. Urbina worked on the team that covered northern San Francisco and reported to Network Supervisor Ken Torres.7 Mr. Urbina never had any performance issues.8
The parties agree about the general requirements of the Network Tech job, but they disagree about whether lifting and carrying 70 pounds or more is an essential function of the job.
Network Techs are responsible for fixing service failures and outages. They respond to job tickets generated by Comcast's computer system.9 Each ticket identifies a "node" that needs service [*3]  or repair.10 Network Techs on Mr. Torres's team are assigned to one of three geographic areas in northern San Francisco.11 Each area has a mixture of aerial and underground nodes.12 Job tickets are coded — red, yellow, or green — based on priority and Mr. Torres assigned tickets in order of priority.13 Network Techs handle their own individually assigned job tickets, but they can call each other for assistance when needed.14 Network Tech job requirement are as follows:
• Using an aerial lift or bucket truck to access aerial nodes.15
• Climbing utility poles or ladders to access aerial nodes located in backyard easements.16
• Working on top of a utility pole, accessed via bucket truck.17
• Removing heavy vault lids weighing 90 pounds or more to access underground nodes.18 To remove the lids, Network Techs hook themselves to the lid with a latch and pull using their body weight.19
• Standing 50 to 70 percent of the time.20
• Lifting and carrying loads of 70 pounds or more.21 Equipment regularly carried includes ladders (70 pounds), tools (35 pounds), and batteries (at least 24 pounds).22

2. The Injury and Medical Restrictions
On May 1, 2014, Mr. Urbina injured himself at work while removing an underground vault [*4]  lid.23 Comcast sent him to workers' compensation doctors.24 He returned to work the next day with restrictions of "no bending, kneeling, squatting, climbing stairs or ladders, and limited use of left leg." 25 In July 2014, Mr. Urbina had an MRI.26 Dr. Toy, a spine and rehabilitation specialist, concluded that Mr. Urbina had an injury to a disk in his lower back.27 Dr. Toy gave Mr. Urbina a steroid injection, which reduced his pain but did not improve his condition.28 In December 2014, Mr. Urbina consulted with a surgeon, who concluded he was not a good candidate for surgery.29
On January 16, 2015, Dr. Toy permanently restricted Mr. Urbina from lifting more than 25 pounds and pushing or pulling more than 50 pounds of force.30 Katherine Mercado, a leave-of absence ("LOA") consultant, spoke with Mr. Urbina when he received the limitations, and he "agreed with the restrictions outlined."31
On January 23, 2016, Dr. Toy filled out a "Certification by Health Provider, that Mr. Urbina was not substantially limited in performing life activities and could perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.32 Dr. Toy later testified in that "[he] did not believe [he] had reviewed [*5]  [the job] restrictions when [he] went through [the Certification] form." 33 In his deposition, Dr. Toy confirmed Mr. Urbina's physical limitations contained in the treatment records, including the permanent lifting restriction.34

3. Comcast's Policies
Comcast routinely provides temporary light-duty assignments to employees who cannot perform their essential job functions.35 It does not allow employees to stay on light duty permanently.36 Comcast allows employees to return to their regular work only if they can perform the essential functions of their job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.37 If an employee cannot return to work after ten to twelve weeks on a light-duty assignment, then Comcast places the employee on a leave of absence and holds open the employee's job position.38 Comcast pays employees who are injured on the job temporary total-disability benefits through Comcast's workers' compensation carrier.39
If an employee becomes permanently restricted from performing the essential functions of his own job, even with reasonable accommodation, Comcast provides the employee job-reassignment opportunities through Comcast's job-search process and assigns a Leave of Absence Consultant [*6]  to work with the employee.40 The consultant reviews online job listings, looking for jobs based on the employee's home address, qualifications, and/or medical restrictions.41 They ask employees for an updated resume or have conversations with employees to determine their qualifications.42 They forward the job listings to the employee weekly.43 Comcast expected employees to also search for job listings on its website.44 The job search lasts 60 days.45 In its motion, Comcast says that if the employee meets the minimal qualifications and interviews, Comcast will reassign the employee to the position, but its cited authorities don't support that proposition directly.46 Mr. Urbina testified that he was advised that if he identified an alternate job he was interested in, he would receive the position if he was a "suitable" candidate.47 If an employee is unable to find an alternative job, Comcast terminates the employee.48
Leave of Absence Consultants administer leaves of absences.49 The Consultants work out of Comcast's HR Shared Services department in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.50 They work with a local Return to Work Specialists in California to identify and administer light duty assignments.51 Comcast's [*7]  HR Compliance Team approves Leave of Absence Consultants' decisions about placing an employee in a job search or terminating an employee.52

4. Light Duty: May 2, 2014 to July 28, 2014
Comcast placed Mr. Urbina on light duty from May 2, 2014 to July 28, 2014.53 Mr. Urbina continued to work for Mr. Torres's Network Tech team.54 To comply with his medical restrictions, Mr. Urbina pulled job tickets only on routes that consisted primarily of aerial work.55 He could not respond to high-priority tickets that required work to be done that violated his lifting restrictions.56 He avoided jobs that involved underground work that would have required him to remove heavy vault lids. He also avoided jobs involving aerial work in backyard easements that would have required him to carry a 70-pound ladder. 57 His physical restrictions prevented him from working at the Pine Street hub, where he worked previously, because it consisted primarily of underground work.58 He could not change heavy batteries.59 He called on other Network Techs for assistance on jobs he could not complete himself.60
He completed other Network Tech tasks that did not require any lifting, including completing a CLI plant drive out, running Forward [*8]  Err Correction reports to detect signal corruption to detect signal leakage, conducting Pathtrack monitoring to detect signal impairments, and setting up a node.61 Mr. Urbina testified that he worked approximately 80% of the time performing his regular duties just as he had performed before his injury.

5. Temporary Paid Leave of Absence: July 25, 2014 to February 5, 2015
Comcast ended light duty and placed Mr. Urbina on a temporary paid leave of absence on July 25, 2014.62 Leave of Absence Consultant Katherine Mercado made the decision, and Return to Work Specialist Dena Galvan told Mr. Urbina. In her email to Mr. Urbina, she said that Comcast was placing him on a leave of absence effective July 26, 2014 "due to exhausting light duty."63 Mr. Urbina asked to remain on light duty.64 While on leave of absence, Comcast held Mr. Urbina's position open, and Mr. Urbina received workers' compensation payments.65

6. Removal: February 3, 2015
On January 26, 2015, Ms. Mercado received notice that Mr. Urbina had permanent medical restrictions that restricted him to no lifting over 25 pounds and no pushing/pulling over 50 pounds.66 Mr. Urbina does not dispute these restrictions.67 Ann Righetti, a Comcast Return [*9]  to Work Specialist, told her that those restrictions could not be accommodated in the Network Tech position. 68 Other relevant managers at Comcast testified that Mr. Urbina's restrictions meant that he could not perform his essential job functions and could not be accommodated.69 After discussing Mr. Urbina's case with the Compliance team and receiving authorization, Ms. Mercado removed Mr. Urbina from his position, put him on unpaid medical leave of absence, and placed him in the job-search process.70 On February 3, 2015, Ms. Mercado spoke with Mr. Urbina by phone about the decision to remove him from his Network Tech position and place him on unpaid leave of absence. She also told him about Comcast's job search process.71 He agreed to the job search process.72

7. Job Search Process: February 5, 2015 to April 5, 2015
Ms. Marcado sent Mr. Urbina a letter by UPS overnight mail notifying him that he would be placed on unpaid leave of absence from February 5, 2015 to April 7, 2015 to give him an opportunity to obtain a new job with Comcast.73 The letter referred to Mr. Urbina's permanent restriction (no lifting over 25 pounds and no pushing or pulling over 50 pounds) and Comcast's conclusion [*10]  that this precluded his ability to perform his essential job function of being able to lift and carry loads of 70 pounds and more.74 The letter included the contact information of Janie Gussin, a member of his job-search team. The letter told Mr. Urbina to review job openings on Comcast's website and contact Ms. Leonard to discuss any jobs that interested him.75 It said that Ms. Gussin would work with him to provide assistance in the job search and determine if there were any other reasonable accommodations that would allow him to return to work. It also said that if Mr. Urbina did not find a job within the 60 days that he could return to, with or without a reasonable accommodation, his "employment with Comcast will be administratively separated."76 Mr. Urbina acknowledged that he received the letter.77
On February 6, 2015, Ms. Gussin spoke with Mr. Urbina by phone to discuss the job search process and sent him an e-mail that day telling him that he had 60 days (until April 7) to find a job, informing him that she would send weekly updates on internal postings of possible interest, asking for his active engagement during the search (including communicating with her weekly), and asking [*11]  for a current resume (if he had one).78 During the job-search process, Comcast sent Mr. Urbina nine e-mails — on February 18, February 25, March 4, March 11, March 17, March 25, and March 27 — to Mr. Urbina's Comcast e-mail address MUrbina@comcast.net.79 In most emails, Ms. Gussin apparently sent postings. The records do not contain the emails with the postings and instead document only "Sent posting;" a second timeline summarizes that Comcast sent the following postings: Xfinity Sales Executive/ IT Support Representative; Xfinity Sales Associate; Xfinity sales Pfessional MDU; Customer Sales/Service Rep I; Customer Sales/Service Rep; and CommOps, Quota Rep.80 In a March 17 email, the Comcast consultant said that there were not any internal postings since the March 10 update, when she forwarded a posting.81 A March 31 email said the same and asked whether Mr. Urbina had searched the external postings and identified any jobs of interest.82 On April 1, the Comcast consultant asked in an internal email: "Has anyone heard from Misael? His job search ends on April 7, 2015, and he has not been responding to my emails."83 The records reflect that Mr. Urbina did not respond to the e-mails.84 Ms. Gussin also [*12]  called Mr. Urbina on March 16 and left a voicemail message.85
Mr. Urbina testified that: (1) he received only one email from Comcast and it contained a listing for a sales executive position;86 (2) he spoke with a "lady" (he could not recall her name) by phone, who told him to look for jobs on a Comcast website and to contact her if he was interested in any positions;87 (3) he was told he was "going to have to apply like anyone from the street," be "interviewed like anyone else," and would get the position if he was a "suitable" candidate;88 (4) he looked for jobs on the website twice but did not find any that interested him; 89 (5) he was told to contact Ms. Gussin only if he were interested in a position she sent to him;90 (6) he did not apply for any positions at Comcast; 91 and (7) he asked several times to return to the Network Tech position on light duty.92 He produced a list that shows open jobs from January 6 through April.93

8. Termination — April 22, 2015
On April 14, 2015, Mr. Urbina called Comcast and spoke to Ms. Gussin. He testified that she said his 60-day job search process had expired, and he should have received a letter terminating his employment.94 Ms. Gussin testified that she concluded [*13]  that Mr. Urbina was not interested in an alternative position because of his lack of response to e-mails and calls.95 She told Ms. Stofferahn about her communications with Mr. Urbina and asked her to approve his termination.96 Ms. Stofferahn approved the termination.97 Ms. Gussin sent Mr. Urbina a letter on April 22, 2015, stating that he would be administratively separated from Comcast on April 23, 2015.98

9. The Claims
Mr. Urbina charges Comcast with five claims under FEHA: (1) wrongful discharge based on disability in violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a); (2) failure to accommodate his disability in violation of § 12940(m); (3) failure to engage in a good-faith interactive process in violation of § 12940(n); (4) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of § 12940(k); and (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy.99
Mr. Urbina and the defendants both moved for summary judgment on all claims.100 The court held a hearing on October 5, 2017.

GOVERNING LAW
The court must grant a motion for summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. A dispute about a [*14]  material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id. at 248-49.
The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion, and identifying portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, or affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). To meet its burden, "the moving party must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000); see Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) ("When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out "'that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.'") (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325).
If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to produce evidence supporting its claims or defenses. Nissan Fire & Marine, 210 F.3d at 1103. The non-moving party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's evidence, but instead must produce admissible evidence that shows there [*15]  is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. See Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1076. If the non-moving party does not produce evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, inferences drawn from the underlying facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

ANALYSIS
The court grants Comcast summary judgment on all claims on the grounds. Mr. Urbina's lifting restriction meant that he could not perform the essential job function of lifting 70 pounds or more. Comcast was not required to offer his limited work assignment indefinitely. And Mr. Urbina did not identify any other assignments objectively available to him during the interactive process.

1. Claim Two: Failure to Accommodate — Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(m)
FEHA makes it unlawful "for an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical . . . disability of an applicant or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). In evaluating FEHA claims, courts use the burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green. See Arparicio v. Comcast, Inc., No. 16-cv-3952-JST, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128131, 2017 WL 3453348, at *5 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)) (other citation omitted). Under that analysis, a plaintiff must first make out a prima [*16]  facie case. Id. To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show that (1) he has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) he was otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of California—Orange Cnty, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-1010 (2009).
Comcast does not dispute that Mr. Urbina has a disability and is otherwise qualified for his former job.101 And it notes that Mr. Urbina does not dispute that by giving him a light-duty assignment, it accommodated Mr. Urbina while he had that assignment.102 It contends that its discharge of Mr. Urbina was lawful because Mr. Urbina could not do the job with or without reasonable accommodation: he could not lift 70 pounds — an essential job function — and instead was restricted to lifting 25 pounds and pushing or pulling 50 pounds.103 Mr. Urbina counters that Comcast could have accommodated his lifting restriction by continuing his light duty permanently or giving him a different job.104
Reasonable accommodations can include restructuring an employee's responsibilities, if essential functions are not eliminated. Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 375, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) "Reasonable accommodation may also include reassignment to a vacant position if the employee [*17]  cannot perform the essential functions of his or her position even with accommodation." Id. at 377. The reasonableness of an accommodation generally is a question of fact. Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 799 (N.D. Cal. 2015).

1.1 Permanent Light Duty
Mr. Urbina contends that Comcast could have accommodated his disability by allowing him to work on light duty indefinitely.105
"A reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job he or she holds or desires." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 373; accord Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 798; see Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). "[E]xamples of reasonable accommodations . . . include reallocating nonessential functions or modifying how or when an employee performs an essential function, but not eliminating essential functions altogether." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 375.
Under the FEHA, an employer who has created a temporary light-duty assignment to accommodate an employee's disability has no obligation to make that assignment permanent. Raine v. Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223-24, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006). Employers do not have to create new positions for disabled employees. Id. at 1223-24. And employers are not required to shift essential job duties to other employees so that an employee can keep working in a job. Carballow v. Comcast, 13-cv-5572-MMC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119344, 2015 WL 5257983, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 8, 2015) (citing Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1079, 1089 (9th Cir. 2006)).
The issue in this case turns on whether lifting 70 pounds (or [*18]  more) is an essential job function. The undisputed evidence establishes that it is.
"Essential duties" are defined as "the fundamental job duties of the employment position of the individual with a disability holds or desires." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(1). Evidence of whether a function is essential includes the following:
(A) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential.
(B) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing candidates for the job.
(C) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function.
(D) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function.
(E) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
(F) The work experiences of past in the job.
(G) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12026(f)(A)-(G).
Determining the essential functions of a position is a highly fact-intensive inquiry. Lui v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 211 Cal. App. 4th 962, 971 (2012). "An employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that he can perform the essential functions must put forth evidence establishing those functions." Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 991 (9th Cir. 2007) (quotation and citations omitted); see also Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012). Courts generally defer to an employer's judgment about what job functions are "essential." Lui, 211 Cal. App. 4th at 971-72.
Mr. Urbina admits that before he was injured, he had to (1) lift vault lids [*19]  weighing "from 10 pounds to 150 pounds and sometimes up" to access underground vaults,106 (2) carry a 70-pound ladder to access nodes in backyard easements;107 and (3) carry and replace 50-pound batteries.108 The job description describes "core job responsibilities" that includes "lifts and carries loads of 70 lbs. or more."109 The manufacturer's specifications for Network Tech equipment describes it as weighing between 24 and 92 pounds.110 Comcast personnel — Network Supervisor Mr. Torres, Manager of Network Engineering Matt Silvey, and Director of Network Technicians Curtis Christenson — confirm the heavy-lifting requirements.111 Heavy lifting of more than 70 pounds undisputedly is an essential function of the Network Tech job.
Comcast put Mr. Urbina on light duty to allow him to recover. It has no obligation to make that assignment permanent. Comcast does not have to shift the essential job function of heavy lifting to other employees. That accommodation is not reasonable, particularly given that technicians work on their own.
Mr. Urbina points to Dr. Toy's January 2015 certification that Mr. Urbina could perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.112 This does [*20]  not change the outcome. Dr. Toy testified that he did not read the job requirements when he signed the certification, and he confirmed the weight restrictions.113 Mr. Urbina does not dispute that he has the lifting limitations.114
In sum, the undisputed evidence shows that lifting 70 pounds or more is an essential function of the Network Tech job. Comcast had no legal obligation to provide permanent light duty.

1.2 Reassignment As Accommodation
Mr. Urbina claims that Comcast could have accommodated his disability by reassigning him to a vacant position.115
If an employee cannot perform the essential functions of his position even with accommodation, reasonable accommodation can include reassignment to a vacant position. Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 377. "[A]s a reasonable accommodation, an employer or other covered entity shall ascertain through the interactive process suitable alternate, vacant positions and offer an employee such positions, for which the employee is qualified." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11068(d)(1); see Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1389-90, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000). "
FEHA entitles the disabled employee to "preferential treatment" in reassignment of existing employees. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11068(d)(5); Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 265, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). An "employer has a duty to reassign a disabled employee if an already funded, vacant position at the same level exists." Swanson v. Morongo Unified School Dist. 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 970, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014) (emphasis [*21]  in original; internal quotes omitted); see Prilliman v. United Airlines, 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 950-51, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997) ("[A]n employer who knows of the disability of an employee has an affirmative duty to make known to the employee other suitable job opportunities with the employer and to determine whether the employee is interested in, and qualified for, those positions if the employer can do so without undue hardship or if the employer offers similar assistance or benefits to other disabled or nondisabled employees or has a policy of offering such assistance or benefit to any other employees."). "[A] n employer is relieved of the duty to reassign a disabled employee whose limitations cannot be reasonably accommodated in his or her current job only if reassignment would impose an "'undue hardship' on its operations or if there is no vacant position for which the employee is qualified." Spitzer, 80 Cal. App. 4th at 1389.
At summary judgment, an employer must show the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of both the former job and any available vacant position to which he or she might be reassigned as a reasonable accommodation. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 962, 965-966 (2008).
California courts recognize that employees have less access to information than employers about vacant positions. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018-19 (quoting Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984). But even if the employee [*22]  was unaware of the availability of a reasonable accommodation while in the workplace, discovery through litigation remedies that imbalance. Id.; Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 379. Thus, an employee must identify an accommodation that was objectively available. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018. Courts in this district follow this approach. See Achal, 144 F. Supp. 3d at 800.
There are fact disputes here. Comcast asserts that it would reassign Mr. Urbina to any open position that he qualified for.116 Mr. Urbina counters that Ms. Gussin told him that he was "going to have to apply like anyone from the street," "be interviewed like anyone else," and would receive the job if he were "suitable."117 Mr. Urbina identifies jobs that were available.118 Comcast identifies job postings that it sent Mr. Urbina.119 Mr. Urbina disputes that he received them.120 He said that he received only one e-mail with a sales position that he was not qualified for, and he contends that Comcast did not genuinely inquire about his skills or interests. Comcast counters that Mr. Urbina did not respond to nine emails, and it reasonably concluded that he was not interested in reassignment.
But assuming that the facts are as Mr. Urbina asserts, he still has not shown now that a reasonable accommodation was objectively available [*23]  then. See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 379. Mr. Urbina points to an unavailable hub tech position.121 He asserts his entitlement to notice of supervisor positions, but he does not contend that they were same-level positions.122 The court pressed this point at the hearing. Mr. Urbina said that he claimed only entitlement to notice of the supervisor positions (presumably as part of the interactive process), not qualification for them.
The court grants summary judgment to Comcast.

2. Claim Three: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process — Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(n)
The court similarly grants Comcast summary judgment on Mr. Urbina's claim that Comcast Comcast failed to engage in the interactive process. Comcast argues that it made a good-faith effort to engage Mr. Urbina,123 and Mr. Urbina disputes he received the emails that Comcast said that it sent.124 Assuming the facts are as Mr. Urbina asserts, failure to engage in the good-faith interactive process is unlawful only if the reasonable accommodation is possible. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. 4th at 981-82. As the court said in the previous section, Mr. Urbina does not identify an accommodation that was actually available during the time period of the interactive process.
FEHA prohibits an employer from "fail[ing] to engage in a timely, good faith, [*24]  interactive process with an employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "[I]t is the employee's initial request for an accommodation which triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process of determining one." Spitzer, 80 Cal. App. 4th at 1384. "The interactive process requires communication and good[-] faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984. For the process to work, both sides must communicate directly and exchange essential information, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process. Id. at 984-85; accord Humphrey v. Memorial Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2001). The employee has the burden of proof to identify whether a reasonable accommodation was possible. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984; Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018-19.
As the court held in the last section, Mr. Urbina has not identified any jobs that were objectively available. And as discussed in the last section, he claims only entitlement to notice of supervisory positions as part of the interactive process, not that they were objectively available to him. [*25]  They were not "already funded, vacant position[s] at the same level. . . ." Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 970.
Moreover, Comcast offered Mr. Urbina a defined process for identifying vacant positions that interested him, not just those that were vacant and at the same level.125 Mr. Urbina agreed to participate in that process.126 He knew that Ms. Gussin would send job postings to his personal Comcast e-mail address MUrbina@comcast.net.127 Comcast had a transfer policy that outlined the company's and the employee's responsibilities in the job-search process.128 Undisputed evidence shows that this process worked. Ms. Gussin helped 35 to 40 disabled employees find job reassignments in two years.129 And Comcast actually identified positions for Mr. Urbina. He knew about (and checked) the website, which shows aspirational positions. Both parties are responsible for keeping communications open. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984-84; Jensen, 38 Cal. App. 4th at 264-65.
Mr. Urbina's argument to the contrary is that Comcast should have done more to alert him to possibilities for promotion to supervisor positions. But Comcast identified same-level positions and a process to identify any positions of interest. And in the end, leaving aside the robustness (or not) of Mr. Urbina's participation in the interactive [*26]  process, he points to no positions that were objectively available at the same level.
The court grants Comcast summary judgment.
3. Claim One: Disability Discrimination — Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a)
The McDonnell Douglas test requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (FEHA discrimination). After the plaintiff establishes that rebuttable presumption of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse-employment action. Id. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's stated reason for the adverse action was pretextual. Id.
In a reasonable-accommodation case with an adverse employment action, a failure to make a reasonable accommodation is direct evidence of disability discrimination. Capote v. CSK Auto, Inc., No. 12-cv-02958-JST, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56030, 2014 WL 1614340, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 22, 2014). "The disability-discrimination and the reasonable-accommodation analyses merge, the court applies the general summary-judgment burden shifting analysis, and the disability-discrimination claim depends on the viability of the reasonable-accommodation claim coupled with a showing of the adverse-employment action." Id. (collecting cases).
Here, the court granted Comcast [*27]  summary judgment on the reasonable-accommodation claim. The disability claim is predicated on that claim. The court grants Comcast summary judgment on the disability claim too.

4. Failure to Prevent Discrimination
The elements of a failure-to-prevent-discrimination claim are: the plaintiff "(1) . . . was subjected to discrimination; (2) [the] defendant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 804 (citing Leland v. City & Cty. of San Francisco,576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008)). Courts have interpreted "a failure to prevent discrimination claim [to be] essentially derivative of a [FEHA] discrimination claim." Id. (citing Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist, 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (N.D. Cal. 1998)).
A FEHA claim for failure to prevent discrimination requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that discrimination occurred. Id. (citing Trujillo, 63 Cal. App. 4th at 289). Because the court grants summary judgment to Comcast on the predicate discrimination claims, it also grants Comcast summary judgment on the failure-to-prevent discrimination claim.

5. Claim Five: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
A common-law claim for discrimination in violation of public policy must be constitutionally or statutorily based. Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1095, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992). Violation of the FEHA "violates a "'substantial and fundamental' [*28]  public policy." City of Moorpark v. Super. Ct., 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1160-61, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998). Mr. Urbina's wrongful-termination claim is grounded in the underlying FEHA claims. Because the court grants Comcast summary judgment on the FEHA claims, it grants summary judgment on this claim too.

CONCLUSION
The court grants Comcast's motion for summary judgment and denies Mr. Urbina's motion for summary judgment.
This disposes of ECF Nos. 40 and 42.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
