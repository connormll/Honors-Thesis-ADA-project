Raygoza v. Walmart Inc., Case No. 2:21-cv-00809-GW (KSx)
Tentative Ruling on Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment

I. Introduction
Paz Raygoza ("Plaintiff") sued Walmart Inc. ("Defendant" or "Walmart"), her former employer, identifying eleven causes of action in her [*2]  Complaint: 1) discrimination in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 2) retaliation in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 3) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k); 4) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 5) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 6) violation of California Government Code § 12945 (pregnancy disability leave); 7) violation of California Family Rights Act, California Government Code §§ 12945.2 et seq.; 8) wrongful termination in violation of the public policy of the State of California; 9) denial of and discrimination based upon the use of sick leave (California Labor Code §§ 233, 234, 246.5); 10) declaratory judgment; and 11) failure to permit inspection of personal and payroll records, in violation of California Labor Code §§ 1198.5, 226(c), 226(f), and 432. On November 15, 2021, Walmart moved for summary judgment on seventeen issues which cover every one of Plaintiff's claims along with her request for punitive damages in this action.

II. Background
A. Summary Judgment Standards
Summary judgment is proper when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Miranda v. City of Cornelius, 429 F.3d 858, 860 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005).1 As adjusted, where applicable, by the "McDonnell Douglas" framework frequently at issue in employment cases, to satisfy its burden [*3]  at summary judgment, a moving party without the burden of persuasion "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added); see also Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) ("When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out 'that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.'") (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986), and citing Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, 212 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 2000)); Fairbank, 212 F.3d at 532 (holding that the Celotex "showing" can be made by "pointing out through argumentthe absence of evidence to support plaintiff's claim"). In contrast, for a moving party to prevail at summary judgment when that party also bears the burden of persuasion on the issue in question, the party "must show that the evidence is so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it." Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 890 (9th Cir. 2008) (omitting internal quotation marks). It "must establish beyond controversy every essential element" of its claim." S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003).
The summary judgment procedure is not simply one-sided, however (and even the lack of an opposition does not guarantee a moving party's success [*4]  on such a motion).
If the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party may not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment[, but instead] must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The opposing party must "cit[e] to particular parts of materials in the record" or show that the materials the moving party cited do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record."); Phillips & Stevenson, RUTTER GROUP PRAC. GUIDE, FEDERAL CIV. PRO. BEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2021) ("Phillips & Stevenson"), ¶¶ 14:101.10-101.12, 14:102. In addition, under this Court's Local Rules, where the moving party on a motion for summary judgment has "claimed and adequately supported" material facts, those facts "are admitted to exist without controversy except [*5]  to the extent that such material facts are (a) included in the 'Statement of Genuine Disputes' [described in Local Rule 56-2] and (b) controverted by declaration or other written evidence filed in opposition to the motion." See C.D. Cal. L.R. 56-3; see also Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 575 F.3d 1040, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009) ("The 'party opposing summary judgment must direct [the court's] attention to specific, triable facts,' and the reviewing court is 'not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.'") (quoting S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2003) and Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001)); Carmen, 237 F.3d at 1029 ("[W]hatever establishes a genuine issue of fact must both be in the district court file and set forth in the response.").
"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In addition, factual assertions made in legal memoranda, but not supported by the evidence submitted, are insufficient. See S.A. Empresa De Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense v. Walter Kidde & Co., 690 F.2d 1235, 1238 (9th Cir. 1980).
Generally-speaking (as adjusted, in some respects, in the McDonnell Douglas setting, discussed infra), in judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the Court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence, and views all evidence [*6]  and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630-31 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)); Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072, 1075 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc); Miranda, 429 F.3d at 860 n.1. Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See National Steel Corp v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 496, 502 (9th Cir. 1997); Thornhill Publ'g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir.1979); see also Phillips & Stevenson ¶ 14:171.
With all of these considerations in mind, the Court must then determine whether "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; see also Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995) ("The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient.").

1) Overrule. 2) Overrule. 3) Sustain as to first clause, overrule as to the remainder. 4) Sustain, overbroad. 5) Overrule.

C. Factual Background2
Plaintiff worked as a Cashier at Defendant's store in La Habra, California beginning in December 2015, until Defendant "separated" — i.e., terminated — her employment on January 24 (or January 25), 2019. See Defendant Walmart Inc.'s Reply Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative Partial Summary Judgment ("DRS"), Docket No. 32, ¶¶ 1, 20; Response of Walmart Inc. to Plaintiff's Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("DRO"), Docket No. 31, ¶¶ 1-2, 31.
When Defendant hired her, Plaintiff completed Defendant's standard new-hire orientation process, during which she reviewed "the company's policies and procedures that applied to [her] as an employee at Walmart." See [*8]  DRS ¶ 2. Throughout the duration of Defendant's employment of Plaintiff, Defendant had an Attendance and Punctuality Policy ("Attendance Policy"). See DRO ¶ 4. Defendant's Attendance Policy states: "[E]ach unauthorized absence will result in a partial occurrence or one or more full occurrences. If you accumulate nine (9) or more occurrences in a rolling six-month period, through any combination, you will be subject to termination." See DRS ¶ 4; DRO ¶ 5. Under the Attendance Policy, an "absence" yields 1.0 occurrence, an "absent no call" yields 3.0 occurrences, a "late in" yields a 0.5 occurrence, an "absent late in" yields 1.0 occurrence, an "early out" yields a 0.5 occurrence, and an "absent early out" yields 1.0 occurrence. See DRO ¶ 6.
Plaintiff was aware of Defendant's Attendance Policy and that she was required to comply with it. See DRS ¶ 5. Thus, Plaintiff understood that if she accumulated nine (9) "occurrences" in a rolling six-month period, her employment could be terminated. See id. ¶ 6. Plaintiff also understood that if she did not have any protected paid time-off ("PTO") to use when she missed work due to being sick, she would receive an occurrence for the absence. See [*9]  id. ¶ 7.
Two of Walmart's other policies are also of-significance with respect to this topic. Defendant's Accommodation in Employment Policy ("Accommodation Policy") states as follows:
If you need assistance to perform essential functions of your job due to a medical condition . . . , you may be eligible for a job adjustment (JA) under this policy whether or not the condition is a disability. You may also be eligible for a leave of absence . . . .
You may be eligible for a job adjustment if you are qualified for the job you hold but, because of a medical condition, including pregnancy, you need assistance to perform the essential functions of your job . . . .
You may be eligible for a reasonable accommodation3 if you have the skills, ability, knowledge, certification and experience necessary and can perform the essential functions, either with or without reasonable accommodation for the job you hold . . . but, because of a disability, you need assistance . . . to perform the essential functions of a job.
Disability also includes a temporary disability arising from pregnancy if (a) in the opinion of a woman's health care provider, she is unable because of pregnancy, childbirth or a related [*10]  medical condition to work, to perform any one or more of the essential functions of her job . . . or (b) the woman is suffering from severe morning sickness or needs to take time off for prenatal or postnatal care or any other condition related to or resulting from pregnancy . . . .
You may request a job adjustment or reasonable accommodation, at any time by telling any salaried member of management in your facility or an HR representative that, because of your condition, you need help to do your job or gain access to your workplace.
See id. ¶ 27 (emphasis in original); Declaration of Laura Kish in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment, Exh. B, Docket No. 19-2 at pages 2-3 of 5. Meanwhile, Defendant's Leave of Absence Policy states as follows:
At Walmart, we recognize that there are times when family and medical issues necessitate time away from work.
You are eligible for FMLA Leave under the FMLA and/or the CFRA if you (a) have been employed at Walmart for a total of at least 12 months and (b) have worked at least 1250 hours within the 12-month period before taking FMLA Leave. If you do not meet these eligibility requirements, [*11]  you are not eligible for FMLA Leave. However, you may be eligible to take Personal Leave.
Leave may be taken continuously or on a reduced schedule or an intermittent basis. You may take intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA Leave only when . . . [y]our health care provider certifies it is medically necessary for medical treatment or to recover from your serious health condition . . . .
See DRS ¶ 28. Plaintiff understood that Defendant offered various leaves of absence and also understood that such leaves were requested through Defendant's third-party administrator, i.e. Sedgwick. See id. ¶ 29.
In or around October 2018, Plaintiff learned she was pregnant. See DRO ¶ 20. Her pregnancy was deemed high-risk because she was 38 years old at the time. See id. ¶ 21.
Plaintiff testified that she never contacted management or Human Resources and asked for a leave of absence — or, indeed, for any special accommodation, including asking to come in to work late for her shift or to have a greater number of sick days than entitled under Defendant's policy — because of her pregnancy and also testified that she never asked for or requested in any way a leave of absence in 2018 or 2019 (though she does [*12]  point to communications she had with Tina Rodriguez ("Rodriguez"), her store's "People Lead," and Martha Casillas ("Casillas"), during which she asserts she told them on one particular occasion that she was having complications from her pregnancy and needed to go home because "something was just not right"4 ). See DRS ¶¶ 39-44, 68; DRO ¶ 29. Similarly, during her pregnancy, Plaintiff never contacted Sedgwick regarding any leave of absence or any type of accommodation for her pregnancy (though she asserts she "did not have the opportunity" to contact Sedgwick). See DRS ¶ 45.
On December 31, 2018, Plaintiff felt especially ill from her pregnancy and had to leave her shift earlier than scheduled. She testified that she "was not feeling well at all . . . this was like worse than other times, worse than normal wear and tear, fatigue and tiredness . . . . I felt like I had a fever, like — just internal like heat . . . my feet were swollen as well, so I had to sit down . . . . I remember that specifically, and I remember it also because it was New Year's Eve." See DRO ¶ 24. She testified that she told Rodriguez and Casillas that she was leaving "because I was having complications and that [*13]  I felt like if [sic] I had a fever" and that "something was just not right," and that they simply responded "Oh, I hope you feel better." See id. ¶ 25. She also missed work the following day, January 1, 2019, because she was still sick from her pregnancy (though the evidence is that she simply called in sick, not that she told anyone in particular anything specific about why, or to what extent, she was sick). See id. ¶ 26; DRS ¶ 12; Declaration of Nayri Jilizian in Support of Plaintiff's Opposition to Walmart Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment ("Jilizian Decl."), Exh. A, at 105:17-107:10.
Plaintiff's doctor never put her on any type of leave of absence, either in the form of consecutive days or an intermittent leave of absence. See DRS ¶ 30; see also Footnote 2, supra. Nor did Plaintiff ever provide any kind of doctor's note to Defendant relating to her pregnancy. See DRS ¶ 31. Likewise, Plaintiff never submitted or turned-in to Defendant's Human Resources group, Defendant's management, or Sedgwick, any restrictions on her ability to work during her pregnancy. See id. ¶ 32; see also Footnote 2, supra. In fact, Plaintiff's doctor never gave her a medical note saying that she could not [*14]  engage in certain work activities or indicating, or providing her, with any kind of restrictions on her ability to work. See DRS ¶¶ 33-34; see also Footnote 2, supra. Plaintiff never had to be hospitalized or go into the hospital for treatment (other than for routine scheduled checkups) prior to her delivery, and testified that she was "able to work all the way up to shortly before [her] delivery," though she also provides evidence that pregnancy-related symptoms affected her ability to work on certain days and that she called the "Kaiser nurse line" on at least one occasion in order to speak with a nurse. See DRS ¶¶ 35-38.
In response to an interrogatory asking for the dates of health care treatment, Plaintiff responded that she "received treatment throughout the entirety of her pregnancy and specifically on January 24, 2019, January 30, 2019, February 13, 2019, February 27, 2019, March 6, 2019 and March 13, 2019. See id. ¶¶ 48-49. In response to document requests in this action for medical records related to the disability she alleges in this case, Plaintiff produced only two documents. See id. ¶¶ 46-47. Plaintiff also indicates that — as mentioned above — she called a doctor or nurse's [*15]  hotline in association with her condition on December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2019, though it did not result in her obtaining a doctor's note because the "visit" was only done over the phone, not in-person. See DRO ¶ 30.
Plaintiff accrued 0.5 occurrence points on September 30, 2018, 1.0 occurrence points on October 11, 2018, 1.0 occurrence points on November 12, 2018, 0.5 occurrence points on November 27, 2018, 1.0 occurrence points on December 31, 2018, 1.0 occurrence points on January 1, 2019, 1.0 occurrence points on January 4, 2019, 1.0 occurrence points on January 6, 2019, 1.0 occurrence points on January 14, 2019, 1.0 occurrence points on January 20, 2019, and 1.0 occurrence points on January 22, 2019. See DRS ¶¶ 8-18; DRO ¶ 29; see also Footnote 2, supra. Thus, Plaintiff had 10 occurrences on her record as of January 22, 2019 (though she disputes whether all of the occurrence points should have been on her record). See DRS ¶ 19; see also Footnote 2, supra.
Plaintiff was responsible for applying any accrued, available PTO to her absences. See DRS ¶ 56. Her Statement of Final Pay shows that she did not have any available PTO as of January 22, 2019 (though Plaintiff asserts that [*16]  Defendant's alleged violation of its Attendance Policy means that there is a dispute as to whether she at least should have had protected PTO as of that date). See id. ¶ 57; see also Footnote 2, supra. Defendant separated Plaintiff's employment on January 24, 2019. See DRS ¶ 20.
Although, with its Reply papers, Defendant challenges the value of the evidence Plaintiff relies upon for the point, Plaintiff provides evidence that she asserts indicates that she had 63 late-arrivals and 68 absences between February 1, 2016 and January 22, 2019. See DRO ¶ 7. She routinely surpassed the allotted nine occurrence-threshold without being terminated (although, again, Defendant, questions the accuracy/meaning of the evidence relied-upon by asserting that Plaintiff "could have" used PTO to reduce her occurrence points below the threshold). See id. ¶¶ 8-17.
A final policy relevant to Plaintiff's case is Defendant's "California Associate Access to Personnel Files" policy, which states, in pertinent part, that "[a]ssociates or former associates who wish to review their personnel file should notify their supervisor or a salaried member of management, verbally or in writing." See DRS ¶ 61. Plaintiff mailed [*17]  a record request to Defendant's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas (though she also asserts she made a verbal request for her records from Rodriguez, who performed human resources services). See id. ¶¶ 63, 68; DRO ¶ 32.
While Rodriguez was a "People Lead," she did not create, modify, or implement policy for Defendant, and had no authority to hire or fire associates. See DRS ¶¶ 69-70. Similarly, Heather Atkinson ("Atkinson"), an Assistant Store Manager — a position that operated on the store-level, and that was below Co-managers and the Store Manager — did not make, suggest or influence decisions that ultimately determined Defendant's corporate policy. See id. ¶¶ 71-73.

III. Analysis
The Court will begin its analysis with Plaintiff's fourth and fifth claims, because those claims directly-implicate an issue of notice that will also be relevant to analysis of Plaintiff's first, second and — derivatively — third claims.
A. Reasonable Accommodation and Interactive Process
Plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action are for "failure to provide reasonable accommodations" and "failure to engage in a good faith interactive process," respectively, relying upon California Government Code subsections 12940(m) and 12940(n).5See Complaint ¶¶ 62, 70. [*18]  These two claims will be discussed together because of their related nature.
FEHA requires employers — on pain of a civil action for damages if noncompliant — to make reasonable accommodation for the known disabilities of employees to enable them to perform a position's essential functions, unless doing so would produce undue hardship to the employer's operations. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1) (designating as an "unlawful employment practice" the "fail[ure of an employer] to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee," excepting accommodations that would "produce undue hardship"); A.M. v. Albertsons, LLC, 178 Cal.App.4th 455, 463, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449 (2009); Bagatti v. Dep't of Rehab., 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 357, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002); see also Chin, Cathcart, Callahan & Lowe, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION (The Rutter Group 2020) ("Chin & Cathcart"), ¶¶ 9:2250, 9:2345.6 Thus, in addition to one more necessity discussed below, a prima facie case for a reasonable accommodation claim requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that she has a disability covered by FEHA, that she is a qualified individual (i.e., that she can perform the essential functions of the relevant position), and that Walmart failed reasonably to accommodate her disability. See Hernandez v. Rancho Santiago Cmty. Coll. Dist., 22 Cal.App.5th 1187, 1193-94, 232 Cal. Rptr. 3d 349 (2018); Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶¶ 9:2346-2346.3.
An employer's reasonable accommodation duty is an employer's affirmative duty where the employer is aware of an employee's disability or regards an employee as disabled (even if the employee has not requested an accommodation), and if a supervisor has acquired knowledge that she has a duty to communicate to the employer, a conclusive presumption arises that she has done so. See Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 60, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006); Cal. Fair Emp't & Housing Comm'n v. Gemini Aluminum, 122 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1015, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 906 (2004) (considering claim for religious accommodation under Government Code § 12940(l)); Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 950-51, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶¶ 9:2251-2253. Even a single failure to accommodate may be actionable. See A.M., 178 Cal.App.4th at 465; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2254.
Connected with the reasonable accommodation duty is the legislative mandate that an employer engage in the "interactive process" or else face a charge of a different, but related,7 "unlawful employment practice." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) (providing that it is an "unlawful employment practice" for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition"); see also Chin & [*20]  Cathcart ¶ 9:2347.8 "[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (quoting Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000)). One approach indicates that "[t]he employee must initiate the process unless his or her disability and the resulting limitations are obvious." Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014); see also Soria v. Univision Radio L.A., Inc., 5 Cal.App.5th 570, 600, 210 Cal. Rptr. 3d 59 (2016); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2282. An alternative formulation provides that an employer must initiate the interactive process: (1) when an employee with a known physical or mental disability or medical condition requests a reasonable accommodation; (2) when the employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation through a third party or by observation; or (3) when the employer becomes aware of the possible need for accommodation because the disabled employee has exhausted leave under applicable federal and/or state statutes and the employer's leave policy, and the employee or employee's health care provider indicates that further accommodation is necessary for recuperative leave or to allow the employee to perform essential job functions. See Chin & Cathcart [*21]  ¶ 9:2281.1; see also Prilliman, 53 Cal.App.4th at 950; Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 887, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) (discussing knowledge of disability in context of disability discrimination claim). Taking initial steps does not absolve an employer of liability if the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process. See Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal.App.4th at 984-87; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2281.2.
As to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim, Walmart argues both that Plaintiff was not disabled and that she never requested an accommodation or gave Walmart notice of her need for one. Instead, she was never restricted in any major life activity and never gave Walmart a doctor's note, and was able to work up until her delivery. In response, Plaintiff first rejects the assertion that an employer's duty only arises once an employee requests an accommodation, and then also notes the duty runs to employees regarded-as disabled, even if not in-fact disabled. Plaintiff is correct on the law but, as will be discussed below, it does not save her reasonable accommodation claim.
On the interactive process claim, Walmart relies on the same arguments it made in connection with Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim, and adds that if anyone was responsible for any breakdown [*22]  in the process, it would have been Plaintiff because she failed to provide information to Walmart, meaning that Walmart never knew what action it needed to take in the circumstances. In her Opposition, Plaintiff asserts that she told Rodriguez that she was too sick from her pregnancy, but Rodriguez failed to engage in any interactive process in response. In addition, she again points out that this duty likewise is not dependent upon an employee requesting an accommodation (although that is one way in which the interactive process-duty can commence); an employer is required to initiate the process even when it only becomes aware of the need for an accommodation via observation, and there is no need for the employer to be aware that the condition constitutes a disability. Again, Plaintiff is correct on the law, but this is not enough.
For both her reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims, Plaintiff asserts that she "was suffering from severe pregnancy related symptoms, including severe morning sickness, lightheadedness, fatigue, and fevers." Docket No. 24, at 14:26-27. On December 31, 2018, she also claims that she specifically informed Rodriguez that she had to leave work [*23]  earlier-than-scheduled because of what she was experiencing, and that this condition continued through the next day. She also claims that "she began experiencing more complications and missed work on January 4, 6, 14, 20, and 22, 2019." Id. at 15:7- 10.
In the face of all of this, according to Plaintiff, Rodriguez did nothing other than to tell Plaintiff to "feel better."9 Plaintiff believes that a reasonable accommodation under the circumstances "would have been for Walmart to grant Plaintiff up to four months of intermittent pregnancy disability leave for her absences, as required by law, and to classify correctly Plaintiff's absences on and after November 2018 as Authorized for purposes of the Attendance Policy." Id. at 15:24-28. At a minimum, a finite leave of absence is indeed one example of a reasonable accommodation under FEHA. See Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 263; Sanchez v. Swissport, Inc., 213 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1338, 153 Cal. Rptr. 3d 367 (2013); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2266.
But, again, Walmart contests the idea that Plaintiff gave it notice, or that it had knowledge, of Plaintiff's purported disability, because of the evidence that Plaintiff never gave it a doctor's note, never requested an accommodation, and never requested a leave of absence. In addition, when Plaintiff reported [*24]  her absences, she answered "None" as the reason(s) for her absence(s).
With respect to Plaintiff's interactions with Rodriguez and Casillas on December 31, 2018, Walmart colors the incident as Plaintiff merely "casually" informing them that she was going home because she was not feeling well, and further argues that even if Plaintiff had told the women that she was leaving because of pregnancy complications, a one-time incident would not be sufficient to put Walmart on notice that Plaintiff was "disabled by pregnancy." Walmart argues that it is "ludicrous and contrary to law" to assert that such a one-time incident could give rise to interactive process and reasonable accommodation duties.
Both of these claims fail if Plaintiff did not have a "known" disability and Defendant did not "regard" Plaintiff as having a disability. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(4) (including "[b]eing regarded or treated by the employer . . . as having, or having had, any physical condition that makes achievement of a major life activity difficult" as within the definition of "physical disability"); id. § 12926(o) ("'Race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, [*25]  marital status, sex, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status' includes a perception that the person has any of those characteristics. . . .") (emphasis added); id. § 12940(m)(1) (requiring reasonable accommodation for an employee's "known physical or mental disability"); id. § 12940(n) (requiring engagement in an interactive process "in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition"); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11065(d)(5) ("A 'perceived disability' means being 'regarded as,' 'perceived as' or 'treated as' having a disability"); Doe v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation, 43 Cal. App. 5th 721, 738, 255 Cal. Rptr. 3d 910 (2019); id. at 740 ("Information about the nature and extent of Doe's claimed disabilities was crucial to CDCR's ability to determine whether it was able to reasonably accommodate those disabilities. The lack of any evidence indicating Doe provided such information to CDCR is fatal to his interactive process and accommodation claims."); Featherstone v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal.App.5th 1150, 1166-67, 217 Cal. Rptr. 3d 258 (2017); Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 598; Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 971 (indicating that "[t]he employee must initiate the [interactive] process unless his or her disability and the resulting limitations are obvious"); Prilliman, 53 Cal.App.4th at 949-51; see also Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal.App.4th 509, 515, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006) ("Because Neisendorf was not eligible for FEHA protection [due to the jury's determination that she was not a "disabled [*26]  person" under the FEHA], LS&Co. had no accommodation obligation to Neisendorf under the FEHA . . . ."); id. at 518 n.6. Yet, this is the summary judgment stage, not trial. As a result, the only question is whether there is a triable issue in this regard. Still, the evidence Plaintiff has presented, faithfully-assessed, does not get her over the hump as to this issue, for the following reason.
"[A]n employer knows an employee has a disability when the employee tells the employer about his condition, or when the employer otherwise becomes aware of the condition, such as through a third party or by observation." Faust, 150 Cal.App.4th at 887 (considering claim of disability discrimination); see also Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 592. An employer need only know the underlying facts amounting to a disability, not that those facts amount to a disability. See, e.g., Faust, 150 Cal.App.4th at 887; Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 593. "'While knowledge of the disability can be inferred from the circumstances, knowledge will only be imputed to the employer when the fact of disability is the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts. Vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations.'" Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1248, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008) (discussing employer notice in context of disability discrimination [*27]  claim) (omitting internal quotation marks) (quoting Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal.App.4th 228, 237, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997)) (emphases added); see Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 592; see also Doe, 43 Cal.App.5th at 738-39 ("Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, . . . the employee bears the burden to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations.") (omitting internal quotation marks) (quoting Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009)). At the same time, it is true that an employee need not "use the term 'disability' or unequivocally invoke the protections of FEHA." Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 593.
Here, with respect to notice of what she asserts was a qualifying "disability," other than the fact of the existence of her pregnancy, Plaintiff points only to her interactions with Rodriguez and Casillas on December 31, 2018, the day she left work early. In terms of what she reported having communicated to Rodriguez and Casillas that day, she says she told them that she was leaving because she "was having complications" and she "felt like if I had a fever" and "something was just not right." See DRO ¶ 25; Jilizian Decl., Exh. A, at 230:17-20 ("And then I remember telling — I remember seeing Tina that day also and a [sic] Martha. And [*28]  I told them that I was leaving because I was having complications and that I felt like if [sic] I had a fever."); id. at 231:1-6 (indicating that she told Rodriguez and Casillas "that I needed to go home because I felt like I have a fever or something was — something was just not right, and that I needed — I actually said, 'I'm sorry that I need to go home.'"). As Defendant argues, Plaintiff points to no information provided to Defendant by any doctor on her behalf, and no communication between her and Defendant's Human Resources group, Defendant's management, or Sedgwick, regarding any details of her condition or need for time off from work, though such evidence is not necessarily required in terms of sufficient provision of notice. Compare Salgado v. Iqvia, Inc., 459 F.Supp.3d 1318, 1328 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (citing doctor's notes reflecting postpartum depression diagnosis and opinion that employee should be off work in concluding that triable issue of fact regarding disability was established); Cortez v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., No. CV 17-4787-GW (JPRx), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 227201, 2018 WL 6071093, *10 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2018), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 22534, 2021 WL 3214765 (9th Cir. July 29, 2021).
For it to constitute a "physical disability," a condition or impairment must limit a major life activity, meaning it makes the achievement of that major life activity difficult. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(1)(B)(ii); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11065(l)(3). Working is one such possible life activity. [*29]  See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(1)(B)(iii); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11065(l) (explaining that term "[m]ajor life activities" is to be "construed broadly" and to include "especially those life activities that affect employability or otherwise present a barrier to employment or advancement"); id. § 11065(l)(3)(D).
Understandably, therefore, disability within the meaning of Government Code subsection 12940 can be pregnancy-related, see, e.g., Sanchez, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1339,10 but it must still "limit a major life activity" or make "achievement of a major life activity difficult." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m).11 "Being unable to work during pregnancy is a disability for the purposes of section 12940." Sanchez, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1340. Here, Plaintiff was able to continue to work, as evidenced by the fact that she did continue to work (and was under no instruction from any doctor that she needed to stop working). Although she certainly took days off from work, Plaintiff did not convey any particular information to Walmart about the reason she took days off in January 2019 following her apparent sickness of December 31, 2018-January 1, 2019. See Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1249 ("Not every illness qualifies as [a] disability.") (omitting quotation marks) (quoting Mont-Ros v. City of W. Miami, 111 F.Supp.2d 1338, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2000)); compare Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 588 (indicating that "mitigating measures" — such as doctor visits/medical appointments — resulting in "[r]epeated or extended absences from work" may qualify an ailment [*30]  as a disability by constituting a limitation on the major life activity of working); id. at 589 ("[E]vidence she could not work full time due to treatment of her condition plainly established a triable issue of material fact on the issue whether Soria had a disability under FEHA.") (emphasis added). As a result, Walmart's mere awareness that Plaintiff was pregnant or that she was sick for a day or two could not give it sufficient notice for purposes of these claims.12
Even assuming that Plaintiff did suffer from a "disability" within the meaning of FEHA, on this presentation Plaintiff cannot establish that Walmart knew about any such disability or even "regarded" Plaintiff as being disabled. As noted previously, knowledge of disability is only "imputed to the employer when the fact of disability is the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts" and "[v]ague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity" are insufficient. See Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1248.
The Court sees little difference between the evidence Plaintiff has alleged here at summary judgment and the allegations the plaintiff made in King v. Permanente Med. Group, Inc., No. 2:13-1560, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134388, 2013 WL 5305907 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2013), though that case concerned notice for purposes of a disability [*31]  discrimination claim. There, the district court concluded that an employee informing her employer that the employee was "ill," providing a doctor's note stating that she was unable to work for a one-week period, and taking sick leave on three occasions was insufficient to provide notice of a disability. See 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134388, [WL] at *1, 7-8. Avila — which, similar to King, also included some measure of communication to an employer from the employee's physicians, evidence which is absent here — is likewise comparable to what Plaintiff conveyed here in terms of the vagueness of the information provided. See 165 Cal.App.4th at 1249.
In comparison, in Soria the plaintiff "specifically told [her supervisor] she had been diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor and the doctors wanted to remove it, which would require removal of part of her stomach and esophagus." Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 593. Comparing this favorably with the unclear information transmitted by the plaintiff in Avila, the California Court of Appeal rejected the argument that the employer did not have sufficient notice of the plaintiff's disability. See id. at 592-93; see also Kimbro v. Atl. Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 875 (9th Cir. 1989) (concluding, in case brought for discrimination/reasonable accommodation under Washington law, that employee's "frequent discuss[ion]" of condition with supervisor, [*32]  supervisor's knowledge employee was receiving medication and treatment, and fact that supervisor personally witnessed "debilitating effects" of condition was sufficient to show supervisor was "fully aware" that employee's headaches "were a manifestation of a serious medical condition"). Plaintiff has not directed the Court to any other case supporting a conclusion that the information she provided to Rodriguez and Casillas was sufficient to put Walmart on notice of facts about her condition that would rise to the level of a disability (though, as noted previously, there is no obligation for Walmart to be aware that the condition would actually be considered a disability under FEHA).
The facts Plaintiff has presented, construed in her favor, fall squarely within California case law's description of what is insufficient to transmit knowledge/awareness of disability. While no particular "magic words" are required, the "fact of disability" is unquestionably not "the only reasonable interpretation of the known facts" considering what Plaintiff indicates she told Rodriguez and Casillas on December 31, 2018. See King, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134388, 2013 WL 5305907, at *8 ("Plaintiff's alleged disability is far from 'the only reasonable interpretation [*33]  of the known facts,' and her factual allegations are therefore insufficient to impute knowledge of her alleged disability onto defendant.") (quoting Brundage, 57 Cal.App.4th at 237). What Plaintiff was actually suffering from, or the severity of that suffering (see Docket No. 24, at 14:26-15:3) — if it was more than she told Rodriguez or Casillas (or Walmart in general) — matters not, if that information was not conveyed to her employer. Without sufficient notice in this regard, Walmart could not have been aware that its reasonable accommodation and interactive process duties had kicked-in. Her claims for violations of those duties therefore fail. The Court will consequently grant Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action.
B. Discrimination and Retaliation
The Court will next discuss Plaintiff's first and second causes of action, setting forth the legal requirements and procedural considerations for both claims first before addressing the parties' arguments concerning them

1. Discrimination
Plaintiff's first claim is for discrimination in violation of California Government Code section 12940. Section 12940(a) of California's Government Code provides in pertinent part that "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice," except in situations not applicable [*34]  here, "[f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability, mental disability, medical condition [or] sex . . . of any person . . . to discharge the person from employment, . . . or to discriminate against the person . . . in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that she "was a member of multiple protected classes as a pregnant woman, with a disability, perceived disability and/or medical condition that affected her major life activities and required her use medical leave [sic] for treatment." Complaint ¶ 35.
"To prevail under the disparate treatment theory," as Plaintiff attempts to do here, "an employee must show that the employer harbored a discriminatory intent." Mixon v. Fair Emp't & Housing Comm'n, 192 Cal.App.3d 1306, 1316, 237 Cal. Rptr. 884 (1987); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2128. Courts have established methods to aid in getting at the sometimes-elusive question of intent in this context.
At the summary judgment stage, absent direct evidence (of which Plaintiff provides none)13 of an intent to discriminate against her based upon a protected characteristic (or the perception of any of those characteristics), Plaintiff must proceed by way of the burden-shifting paradigm set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000); Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal.4th 203, 214, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013); Trop v. Sony Pictures Entm't Inc., 129 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1144-45, 29 Cal. Rptr. 3d 144 (2005); see also Dep't of Fair Employment & Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (" [*35] Lucent Techs.") ("'California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . based on a theory of disparate treatment' because 'such claims must usually be proved circumstantially.'") (quoting Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 354); Zeinali v. Raytheon Co., 636 F.3d 544, 552 (9th Cir. 2011) ("[W]hen entertaining motions for summary judgment in employment discrimination cases arising under state law, federal courts sitting in diversity must apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme as a federal procedural rule.") (quoting Dawson v. Entek Int'l, 630 F.3d 928, 934 (9th Cir. 2011) and Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2001)) (omitting internal quotation marks). This first requires that she establish a prima facie case of discrimination. See, e.g., Alamillo v. BNSF Ry. Co., 869 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 2017).
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination at the summary judgment stage, Plaintiff must offer proof: (1) that she belongs to a class of protected individuals; (2) that she was qualified for her position or performed it satisfactorily, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that Walmart treated her differently than a similarly situated employee who does not belong to the same protected class as Plaintiff or that other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action give [*36]  rise to an inference of discrimination/suggest a discriminatory motive. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 355; Glynn v. Superior Court, 42 Cal.App.5th 47, 53 n.1, 254 Cal. Rptr. 3d 772 (2019); Scotch, 173 Cal.App.4th at 1004; Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1246; Alamillo, 869 F.3d at 920; Zeinali, 636 F.3d at 552. The burden on Plaintiff at this first McDonnell Douglas step is slight. See Schechner v. KPIX-TV, 686 F.3d 1018, 1022 (9th Cir. 2012) ("The requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case . . . on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence.") (omitting quotation marks) (quoting Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994)); Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal.App.4th 143, 159, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011) ("The burden in this stage is not onerous and the evidence necessary to satisfy it is minimal.") (omitting internal quotation marks); Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal.App.4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) (describing plaintiff's prima facie case burden under McDonnell Douglas as "fairly minimal").
If Plaintiff succeeds in proving her prima facie case, there is a presumption that Walmart undertook the challenged employment action for a discriminatory reason. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 355. The burden then shifts to Walmart to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 355-56; Zeinali, 636 F.3d at 552.
Legitimate reasons in this context are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and therefore, if true, would preclude a finding of discrimination. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 358; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:415. An employer's reasons, if honestly-believed and non-discriminatory on their face, may preclude a finding [*37]  of discrimination, even if such reasons are "foolish or trivial or baseless." See Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:417 (quoting Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002)); Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 358 ("[I]f nondiscriminatory, Bechtel's true reasons need not necessarily have been wise or correct. While the objective soundness of an employer's proffered reasons supports their credibility . . . , the ultimate issue is simply whether the employer acted with a motive to discriminate illegally.") (omitting internal citation); Cornell v. Berkeley Tennis Club, 18 Cal.App.5th 908, 935, 227 Cal. Rptr. 3d 286 (2017) (noting that the plaintiff "properly recognizes that the issue is not whether she actually planted the recorder but whether the Club honestly believed that she did so"); King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal.App.4th 426, 432, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) ("For purposes of establishing the moving employer's initial burden of proof, it does not matter whether plaintiff actually did commit an integrity violation as long as UPS honestly believed he did.").
"[A] defendant meets its resulting burden of production" at this second step under McDonnell Douglas "by 'introduc[ing] evidence, which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.'" Bodett v. CoxCom, Inc., 366 F.3d 736, 742 (9th Cir. 2004) (emphasis added) (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). "In other words, the factfinder's general duty to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant does not require [*38]  that the court make a credibility determination on the defendant's evidence at the summary judgment stage, even if it has reason to disbelieve that evidence." Id. (emphasis added).
Should Walmart carry this burden at the second McDonnell Douglas step, the presumption of discrimination disappears and Plaintiff may defeat summary judgment by satisfying the usual standard of proof required in civil cases. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 356. In other words, Plaintiff then has an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by Walmart were not its true reasons, but merely a pretext for discrimination. See id. ; Faust, 150 Cal.App.4th at 886 ("Once the employer has [carried its burden,] the plaintiff must offer evidence that the employer's stated reason is either false or pretextual, or evidence that the employer acted with discriminatory animus, or evidence of each which would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the employer intentionally discriminated."); see also Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); Rashdan v. Geissberger, 764 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2014); Zeinali, 636 F.3d at 552. Thus, summary judgment is not appropriate if, based on the evidence in the record, a reasonable jury could conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant undertook the challenged employment action because of Plaintiff's protected [*39]  status (using a "substantial factor" analysis, discussed further infra).
However, at this third stage, creation of "only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue" in the face of "uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination has occurred" will not suffice to defeat summary judgment. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 362 (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148-49, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)); see also Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1113, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007) ("[A]n employee seeking to avoid summary judgment cannot simply rest on the prima facie showing, but must adduce substantial evidence from which a trier of fact could infer the articulated reasons for the adverse employment action were untrue or pretextual."); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:445. In other words, "summary judgment for the employer may . . . be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred." Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 362. But see Nicholson v. Hyannis Air Serv., Inc., 580 F.3d 1116, 1127 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating, in context of Title VII claim, that "[t]he amount of evidence required" to show that "there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding pretext" is "minimal").
Some courts have expressed this [*40]  burden at the third McDonnell Douglas stage as requiring "substantial evidence" of pretext, at least where the plaintiff only has circumstantial evidence. See Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 965; Serri v. Santa Clara Univ., 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 865, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 732 (2014); DeJung v. Superior Court, 169 Cal.App.4th 533, 553, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 99 (2008); Loggins, 151 Cal.App.4th at 1113; Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1735, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994). Others have noted that circumstantial evidence of pretext must be "specific" and "substantial." See Batarse v. Serv. Employees Int'l Union Local 1000, 209 Cal.App.4th 820, 834, 147 Cal. Rptr. 3d 340 (2012); King, 152 Cal.App.4th at 433; Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 69, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000); Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746; EEOC v. Boeing Co., 577 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 2009); Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co., LLC, 413 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir. 2005); Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221-22 (9th Cir. 1998). Others have commented on the lack of clarity in the case law on this point. See Davis v. Team Elec. Co., 520 F.3d 1080, 1091 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting confusion in the case law whether "specific" and "substantial" circumstantial evidence is required or whether "a lesser amount should suffice"); Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1029 (9th Cir. 2006).
Plaintiff may attempt to satisfy her burden at the third step by proving that the legitimate reasons Walmart offered were dishonest/false (factually untrue), creating an inference that those reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 356; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:435. However, a "plaintiff's subjective beliefs in an employment discrimination case do not create a genuine issue of fact; nor do uncorroborated and self-serving declarations." King, 152 Cal.App.4th at 433; see also Diego v. City of L.A., 15 Cal.App.5th 338, 356, 223 Cal. Rptr. 3d 173 (2017); Merrick v. Hilton Worldwide, Inc., 867 F.3d 1139, 1147 (9th Cir. 2017) (noting that an employee-plaintiff "'must do more than establish a prima facie case and deny the credibility of [the employer-defendant's] witnesses'").
Because a "wrong" or "mistaken" reason is not the same as a false or pretextual [*41]  reason, some California decisions have described a plaintiff's approach in this regard as requiring demonstration of "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal.App.4th 297, 314, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010); see also Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 363 ("The authorities suggest that, in an appropriate case, an inference of dissembling may arise where the employer has given shifting, contradictory, implausible, uninformed, or factually baseless justifications for its actions."); Reeves v. MV Transp., Inc., 186 Cal.App.4th 666, 674, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 896 (2010); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:462. At the same time, though "[p]roof that the employer's proffered reasons are unworthy of credence may 'considerably assist' a circumstantial case of discrimination, because it suggests the employer had cause to hide its true reasons," "an inference of intentional discrimination cannot be drawn solely from evidence, if any, that the company lied about its reasons." Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 360-61; see also Arnold v. Dignity Health, 53 Cal.App.5th 412, 426, 266 Cal. Rptr. 3d 253 (2020) ("'Logically, disbelief of an Employer's stated reason for a termination gives rise to a compelling inference that the Employer had a different, unstated motivation, but it does not, without more, reasonably [*42]  give rise to an inference that the motivation was a prohibited one.'") (quoting McGrory v. Applied Signal Tech., Inc., 212 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1531-32, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 154 (2013)); Slatkin v. Univ. of Redlands, 88 Cal.App.4th 1147, 1157, 106 Cal. Rptr. 2d 480 (2001); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:438. In the end, however, evidence that an employer's nondiscriminatory reasons given are false, coupled with evidence supporting the prima facie case, may be enough to survive summary judgment. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 356; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:437.
Summing-up the process, "'[t]o prevail on summary judgment [on a disability discrimination claim under FEHA], [the employer is] required to show either that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of [the] FEHA claim or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment.'" Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 745 (quoting Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1247); see also Galvan v. Dameron Hospital Assn., 37 Cal. App. 5th 549, 559, 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 16 (2019) (indicating that, at summary judgment, moving-party employer has initial burden to present admissible evidence showing one or more elements of prima facie case is lacking or establishing employment action was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors before burden shifts to employee non-movant); King, 152 Cal.App.4th at 432 ("UPS, as the party moving for summary judgment, bears the initial burden of demonstrating that at least one of the elements of plaintiff's employment discrimination claim is without merit."). [*43] 
Before describing the parties' arguments, however, a further comment is necessary with respect to the "substantial factor" analysis referenced supra. An individual's protected characteristic need only have been a "substantial factor" in the adverse employment action for section 12940(a) to be implicated. See Horsford v. Bd. of Trs. of Cal. State Univ., 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 375, 33 Cal. Rptr. 3d 644 (2005); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶¶ 7:350, 7:489.5. This "substantial factor" requirement obviously means that Plaintiff must be able to show that Walmart knew that Plaintiff had (or perceived Plaintiff as having) a protected characteristic. See Soria, 5 Cal.App.5th at 590-91 ("As part of showing that discriminatory animus was a substantial cause of the adverse employment action, an employee must show that the employer had knowledge of the employee's protected characteristic."); Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1247 ("'An adverse employment decision cannot be made because of a disability, when the disability is not known to the employer.'") (quoting Brundage, 57 Cal.App.4th at 236) (omitting internal quotation marks); Alamillo, 869 F.3d at 920 ("BNSF did not know that Alamillo was disabled when the decision to initiate disciplinary proceedings was made, and Alamillo concedes that BNSF "disregarded" his disability when it decided to terminate him."); see also Prue v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc., 242 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1378, 196 Cal. Rptr. 3d 68 (2015); Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1248 ("As noted above, to show that Continental acted with discriminatory [*44]  intent, plaintiff was required to produce evidence that the Continental employees who decided to discharge him knew of his disability."); Alamillo, 869 F.3d at 920 ("Alamillo's claim fails at the first step — establishing a prima facie case — because the summary judgment record contains no evidence that his OSA was 'a substantial motivating reason for' BNSF's decision to terminate him."); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2296.6 ("To show disparate treatment (discriminatory intent), plaintiff must show that the employer knew or should have known that plaintiff had a disability."). As discussed supra in connection with Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims, Walmart's knowledge of any "disability" was lacking here.
As a result, for Plaintiff to prevail on this claim, she must rely on a protected characteristic other than her purported disability. Crucial here, therefore, is the observation that "sex," as used in Government Code subsection 12940(a), is defined to include "[p]regnancy or medical conditions related to pregnancy." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(r)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11030(c).


2. Retaliation
Plaintiff's second cause of action is for retaliation in violation of California Government Code section 12940. It is an unlawful employment practice for any employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any [*45]  person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h); see also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11021 (further explaining retaliation prohibition and giving partial definition to "[o]pposition to practices prohibited by the Act"). This is the normal statutory source of a FEHA retaliation claim. See, e.g., Chin & Cathcart ¶ 5:1462.14 With respect to this claim, Plaintiff alleged that she "engaged in the protected activities of exercising her right of reporting her pregnancy, disabilities and requesting accommodations." Complaint ¶ 46.
A retaliation claim under FEHA is likewise governed by the McDonnell Douglas process. Thus, Plaintiff has to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, with Walmart then given the opportunity to articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, finally leading to Plaintiff needing to show that Walmart's proffered explanation is merely a pretext for an illegal termination. See Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992). A prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in a protected activity, Walmart subjected her to adverse employment action, and there is a causal link between the protected activity and Walmart's action. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005); Flait, 3 Cal.App.4th at 476.

3. The Parties' Arguments and [*46]  the Court's Analysis
With respect to Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims, Walmart argues that there is no evidence of any link between Plaintiff's pregnancy and her separation/termination. Thus, it asserts that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the final element of the prima facie claim for either of the two claims. Walmart then contends that it had a legitimate reason for Plaintiff's termination — assessment of her situation under its Attendance Policy. It also argues that Plaintiff cannot present sufficient evidence of pretext because she has only her own judgment as to whether Walmart should have terminated her under the circumstances.
In response, Plaintiff highlights her view of the evidence as demonstrating that she was not terminated previously, at a time when she had excessive absences but was not pregnant. Thus, Plaintiff argues that she can satisfy the final element of her discrimination and retaliation claims because Walmart's "violation of its own policy while Plaintiff was pregnant, juxtaposed against a repeated pattern and practice of non-enforcement of that policy when Plaintiff was not pregnant, is evidence of discrimination and retaliation." Docket No. 24, at 8:15-17. [*47] 
As to the "violation" of Walmart's policy, Plaintiff appears to be asserting — specifically with respect to her departure from work on December 31, 2018, and her absence from work the following day, January 1, 2019 — that Walmart did not apply that portion of its policy which provides that "Authorized" absences are not considered part of an employee's attendance record, and that an authorized absence includes absences due to pregnancy disability, because those absences are protected by law. But in making that last contention, Plaintiff relies on California Government Code § 12945(a)(1), which concerns allowing employees "disabled by pregnancy" to take periods of leave. She contends that she was "disabled by pregnancy" because "she suffered from severe morning sickness and needed to take time off for prenatal care." Docket No. 24, at 9:1-3. Plaintiff points to the fact that she had a "doctor's note related to a prenatal care visit" "in her possession" on the day of her termination, asserts she was deemed high-risk because she was pregnant at 38 years of age, and "experienced pregnancy-related complications during her third trimester that caused her to miss several days of work" in addition to suffering severe morning-sickness. [*48]  Id. at 9:4-11.
In terms of Walmart's awareness of these circumstances, Plaintiff directs the Court to one witness's confirmation that it was common to see Plaintiff sit down occasionally during her shift; Plaintiff's characterization of her own testimony as being that she told Rodriguez and Casillas that she was leaving work on December 31, 2018 because she was having pregnancy-complications and "something was just not right"; and that Plaintiff informed Rodriguez that "she was still experiencing severe pregnancy-related symptoms and would not be able to work the following day on January 1, 2019."15 Id. at 9:18-26.
As discussed further infra in connection with Plaintiff's Government Code section 12945 claim and supra in connection with her reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims, she was not "disabled by pregnancy" within the meaning of the applicable regulatory definition of that claim, and she did not sufficiently give Walmart notice of any "disability." To Walmart, these conclusions mean that there was no way for it to deem Plaintiff's absences "Authorized," and therefore it did not misapply its own Attendance Policy.
In any event, in making her arguments, Plaintiff appears to be asserting, [*49]  at least in part, that Walmart incorrectly applied its attendance policy. See id. at 10:18-21; id. at 12:24-27, 13:3-7 (same, addressed to pretext). As set forth above, this is not an acceptable basis for a plaintiff to challenge, or for a court to find, an employer's employment decision as/to be discriminatory. See, e.g., Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 358; King, 152 Cal.App.4th at 433. Yet there also appears to be at least the slightest suggestion that Plaintiff is also challenging the truthfulness of Walmart's assertion that it was the Attendance Policy violation that prompted its decision. See Docket No. 24, at 10:13-15.
But whether it is proper to characterize that attack as a "truthfulness" attack or not, the evidence of Walmart's failure or refusal to terminate Plaintiff for earlier instances where she exceeded the allowable number of "occurrences" is evidence that supports Plaintiff's case. The Court believes this evidence is sufficient to satisfy both Plaintiff's initial burden of demonstrating her prima facie discrimination case's final element and to get over the hump in terms of a sufficient showing of pretext. While some might argue that it is not "substantial" enough to demonstrate pretext, the Court believes that it is enough to [*50]  get Plaintiff to a jury on this question/claim (perhaps especially because of the continuing struggle in the case law in terms of describing just what level of evidence is needed from a plaintiff at the pretext stage).
In challenging Plaintiff's assertions concerning its failure to terminate her for any earlier instance when she asserts she exceeded the allowable number of "occurrences," Walmart relies in its Reply on certain factual assertions that were not presented in its original motion papers — that "the IVR Call List does not track attendance occurrences — it simply logs the absence and the reason for the absence, if provided," and that "[a]ny number of [Plaintiff's] late arrivals or absences may have been Authorized under the Attendance Policy." Docket No. 35, at 3:10-15; see also id. at 4:6-12 (asserting that Plaintiff used protected PTO to clear occurrences in prior six-month period, whereas she no longer had available PTO at time of termination); DRO ¶¶ 7-8, 10, 12, 14, 16. But, on summary judgment, a court is to determine whether a moving party has proved the opposing party's inability to demonstrate an essential element of her case (or "pointed out" a gap in the case/necessary [*51]  showing), and is supposed to view all evidence and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If a moving party waits until its Reply to add new facts into the mix in an attempt to dispute or disprove the opposing party's assertions, a court cannot ensure that those facts are indeed undisputed, especially where it is construing evidence in a nonmoving party's favor.16
In the end, there is no dispute that Plaintiff was pregnant, or that Walmart knew about Plaintiff's pregnancy. See Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, Int'l, Inc., 82 F.3d 578, 580-81 (3d Cir. 1996) (explaining that prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination under Title VII requires "critical element" of employer's knowledge of membership in protected class); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:295. As noted previously, that condition amounts to a protected characteristic because of its inclusion within the definition of "sex." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(r)(1); id. § 12940(a); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:194. Plaintiff has presented evidence that she was terminated — purportedly for violating Walmart's Attendance Policy, the source of Walmart's proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason — only after she became (and Walmart knew she was) pregnant, thereby putting to rest any [*52]  contention that there is no evidence of any link between Plaintiff's pregnancy and her separation/termination for purposes of Plaintiff's satisfaction of her prima facie discrimination case. As to pretext, Plaintiff has presented evidence that suggests the purported Attendance Policy-based reason for her termination was false because she had not been fired on multiple other occasions when she had run afoul of that policy, and that the reason given was not just false, but that the actual reason was discrimination-based because the only difference between when she was not terminated for violation of that policy and when she was is that, in the latter circumstance, she was pregnant. In other words, Plaintiff has evidence not just that she thinks she should not have been terminated for violating Walmart's Attendance Policy in this instance (a position that would carry no weight in a proper analysis, see, e.g., Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 358; King, 152 Cal.App.4th at 433), but that Walmart — reflected in its own prior history vis a vis Plaintiff — has demonstrated its own conclusion that violation of this policy does not inexorably lead to termination. Walmart may be correct that Plaintiff's reliance on that evidence is unjustified, but it has [*53]  not demonstrated — at least not in a way that is sufficient for summary judgment purposes — the unquestioned truth of that position at this point in time.
In sum, the Court does not believe that Defendant's position regarding Plaintiff's discrimination claim necessarily prevails. As such, as to that claim, the Court will deny its motion.
As for Plaintiff's second cause of action, Plaintiff correctly observes that Defendant's argument regarding her retaliation claim is limited — so far as the prima facie case goes — to Plaintiff's ability to demonstrate the third element of her prima facie retaliation case. See Docket No. 16, at 15:25-27. But that third element deals with whether Plaintiff can demonstrate a causal connection between the protected activity in question and Walmart's action. It therefore necessarily requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that there is a protected activity.
It is not at all clear what that protected activity is here. If Plaintiff's protected activity consists of her "[a]bsences due to pregnancy disability" because they are "protected by law," Docket No. 24, at 8:24-25, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she suffered from a "disability" (as discussed supra) [*54]  or that she was "disabled by pregnancy" (as discussed infra) or that, even if either of these things were true, Walmart had knowledge/notice of them (a causal link problem, see Morgan, 88 Cal.App.4th at 70, even if not a protected activity problem). The Court can discern no other hint of a protected activity here (and if Plaintiff asserts it consisted of what she believed was a request — or requests — for reasonable accommodation, the Court has already explained why her communications could not be understood in that regard). See Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal.App.4th 216, 247-48, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) (indicating that notifying an employer of medical status is not a protected activity on which a retaliation claim may be based, even if that medical status constitutes a disability under FEHA).
For this reason, it would appear that Plaintiff's retaliation claim will fail at the first McDonnell Douglas step, and there is no reason for the Court to have to consider whether Defendant has a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation, or whether Plaintiff can sufficiently demonstrate that explanation is pretextual.
The Court will grant Defendant's motion with respect to Plaintiff's second cause of action.
C. Failure to Prevent
It is also an unlawful employment practice in California for an employer "to fail to take [*55]  all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination . . . from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Plaintiff's third claim for relief is based on this form of alleged wrong. Walmart's only argument in its motion with respect to this claim is based upon its belief that it would be successful on this motion with respect to Plaintiff's first and second claims — that without a viable underlying discrimination or retaliation claim, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a failure to prevent discrimination/retaliation claim. Plaintiff appears to agree with the proposition that a viable underlying discrimination/retaliation claim is necessary to a failure-to-prevent claim having a chance of success. See Docket No. 24, at 13:19-21. This is correct. See Dickson v. Burke Williams, Inc., 234 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1315-16, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 774 (2015); Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:672.
In light of the Court's analysis above, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate retaliation, but her discrimination claim survives. Consequently, because Walmart does not actually move for summary judgment with respect to the question of whether it actually took sufficient steps to prevent discrimination, Plaintiff's third cause of action to the extent it concerns a claim for failure to prevent discrimination survives this motion. The Court therefore [*56]  grants Defendant's motion in part and denies it in part in connection with this claim.
D. Sections 12945/12945.2
Plaintiff's sixth and seventh claims for relief are for violation of California Government Code § 12945 (pregnancy disability leave) and violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), California Government Code §§ 12945.2 et seq., respectively. Plaintiff alleged in her Complaint that she exercised her right to pregnancy disability leave and medical leave under section 12945 and the CFRA, but was not provided that leave, and was retaliated against for her attempt to exercise that right. See Complaint ¶¶ 81-85, 95-100.
California Government Code subsection 12945(a)(1), part of the California Pregnancy Disability Leave Law, makes it an "unlawful employment practice" for an employer to refuse to allow "an employee disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition" to take leave for a "reasonable period of time" of up to potentially four months and to return to work thereafter, "as set forth in the commission's regulations," Cal. Gov't Code § 12945(a)(1) (emphasis added), or for an employer "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this section," id. § 12945(a)(4). See also generally Chin & Cathcart ¶ 12:1420.
Government Code subsection 12945.2(a), meanwhile, makes it an "unlawful employment practice" for [*57]  certain employers to refuse the request of certain employees "to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave," with the council to "adopt a regulation specifying the elements of a reasonable request." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a). It is also an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge or discriminate against an individual because of the individual's exercise of the right to family care and medical leave provided by subsection 12945.2(a), or "to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise" any right provided under subsection 12945.2. See id. §§ 12945.2(k)(1), 12945.2(q).
For both Plaintiff's sixth and seventh claims, Defendant contends that Plaintiff never even requested leave. As to the sixth claim in particular, it adds that being "disabled by pregnancy" requires the opinion of Plaintiff's health care provider, and her doctor — as Plaintiff admits, see DRS ¶¶ 32, 34 — never placed any restrictions on Plaintiff's work. Plaintiff argues in response that her "degree of morning sickness" amounted to "disabled by pregnancy" under section 12945. Thus, she looks to her interaction with Rodriguez on December 31, 2018 as support for a claim under Government Code § 12945 in general, and subsections 12945(a)(3)(A) and 12945(a)(4), in particular.
Defendant points [*58]  to California Code of Regulations, Title 2, section 11035(f), for the definition of "disabled by pregnancy." See also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 12:1505; Salgado v. Iqvia, Inc., 459 F.Supp.3d 1318, 1327-28 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (citing regulatory definition of "disabled by pregnancy" in context of reasonable accommodation claim under Government Code § 12940(m)); Fu v. Walker Parking Consultants, 796 F.Supp.2d 1148, 1158 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (quoting predecessor regulation); Sasco Elec. v. Fair Emp't & Housing Comm'n, 176 Cal.App.4th 532, 543 n.6, 97 Cal. Rptr. 3d 482 (2009) (same). That definition is as follows:
A woman is "disabled by pregnancy" if, in the opinion of her health care provider, she is unable because of pregnancy to perform any one or more of the essential functions of her job or to perform any of these functions without undue risk to herself, to her pregnancy's successful completion, or to other persons. An employee also may be considered to be disabled by pregnancy if, in the opinion of her health care provider, she is suffering from severe morning sickness or needs to take time off for: prenatal or postnatal care; bed rest; gestational diabetes; pregnancy-induced hypertension; preeclampsia; post-partum depression; childbirth; loss or end of pregnancy; or recovery from childbirth, loss or end of pregnancy. The preceding list of conditions is intended to be non-exclusive and illustrative only. Nothing in this Article shall exclude a transgender individual who is disabled by pregnancy.
Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11035(f) (emphases added). Here, [*59]  Plaintiff admits that this regulation applies, see Docket No. 24, at 9:1-4, but has not provided evidence that, in the opinion of her health care provider, any of this was true for her. That she may have had such an opinion does not matter for purposes of this definition. The only medical record or evidence from a health care provider she has submitted on this point merely indicates — as of January 24, 2019 — that she was pregnant and suggests that she was under supervision for high-risk pregnancy. See Declaration of Nayri Jilizian in Support of Plaintiff's Opposition to Walmart Inc's Motion for Summary Judgment, Exh. H (Docket No. 29-8).
Plaintiff plainly has not submitted any evidence that she met the definition of "disabled by pregnancy," required for her to prevail under Government Code subsection 12945(a)(1). Although "disabled by pregnancy" is not a term used in subsection 12945(a)(3)(A), involving refusals to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee "for a condition related to pregnancy," that subsection similarly applies to requests made by an employee "with the advice of the employee's health care provider." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945(a)(3)(A); see also Gonzales v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 142 F.Supp.3d 961, 969 & n.38 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (indicating that the accommodation was requested with the advice of a health care provider is one of the essential [*60]  elements of a pregnancy discrimination claim for failure to accommodate under Government Code section 12945(a)(3)(A)); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11040(a)(1) (providing that it is unlawful for employer to deny a request for reasonable accommodation made by an employee "affected by pregnancy" if, among other things, "[t]he employee's request is based on the advice of her health care provider that reasonable accommodation is medically advisable"); Chin & Cathcart ¶ 7:301, at 7-83. Again, evidence of the "advice" of Plaintiff's health care provider — bearing upon the subject of reasonable accommodation or otherwise — is absent here. Because she cannot sustain any claim under either subsections 12945(a)(1) or 12945(a)(3)(A) and those are the only two subsections of section 12945 she asserts any primary rights under, her attempt to make out a claim under subsection 12945(a)(4) — which only deals with interference, restriction, or denial of any other rights under section 12945 — necessarily also fails. Plaintiff, therefore, cannot prevail in connection with her sixth claim for relief, and Defendant's motion is granted with respect to that claim.
The same statutory and regulatory limitations/requirements do not apply to Plaintiff's claim under Government Code section 12945.2/CFRA, however. As to that claim, Walmart is left with its argument that Plaintiff never requested leave. For [*61]  some reason, the Court observes no argument directed to Government Code § 12945.2, in particular, in Plaintiff's Opposition brief.
The language of subsection 12945.2(a) unquestionably requires a "request." See also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11091; see generally Chin & Cathcart ¶ 12:835. While "[w]hether notice is sufficient under CFRA is a question of fact," Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1255, Plaintiff appears to have no evidence of any leave request — certainly no evidence of any request that was denied. See, e.g., id. (concluding that "call[ing] in sick" is insufficient by itself to put employer on notice of need for CFRA leave).17 In fact, it appears to be Plaintiff's position that she was unaware of any leave rights. See, e.g., Docket No. 24, at 15:15-19 (criticizing Rodriguez for, among other things, "not inform[ing] Plaintiff of her right to take intermittent leave . . . and that the leave administered by Sedgwick was not exclusively for post-partum"). How she would have made a "request" for a right she purports not have known about is decidedly unclear. Absent a request for leave, it does not appear that Plaintiff can sustain a claim under section 12945.2/subsection 12945.2(a).18 See Hortobagyi v. Columbia Sussex Mgmt., LLC, No. CV 14-0244 DOC (FFMx), 2015 WL 12683950, *9 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2015). Therefore, the Court grants Walmart's motion with respect to Plaintiff's seventh claim for relief as well.
E. Wrongful Termination [*62]  and Declaratory Relief
Plaintiff's eighth cause of action is for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy of the State of California, and her tenth cause of action is for a declaratory judgment under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1060.
Similar to Plaintiff's third claim for failure to prevent discrimination/retaliation, Defendant's only argument concerning Plaintiff's eighth and tenth claims is that they are entirely derivative. As to the eighth claim in particular this is due to the fact that Plaintiff never identified any public policy other than those connected to discrimination and retaliation.19 Plaintiff effectively confirms this in her Opposition, identifying her belief that she was terminated based on her pregnancy and pregnancy-related disabilities as the violation(s) of public policy(ies) in question. As to the tenth claim, Plaintiff simply argues that it is improper to dispose of a declaratory judgment claim "so long as any one claim survives, since an actual controversy will exist." Docket No. 24, at 19:6-8.
Under the reasoning set forth supra, Plaintiff's discrimination claim will survive this motion. In light of the fact that Walmart's argument as to this claim is based only on the [*63]  failure of the underlying discrimination/retaliation claims, therefore, the Court will grant its motion in part and deny it in part as to Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim. See, e.g., Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal.App.5th 1, 62, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021).
As to Plaintiff's claim for a declaratory judgment, while there is a certain aspect of her claim that will survive this motion, and therefore an argument limited only to the fact that the claim is derivative fails, it would appear to the Court that this claim is not simply derivative, but that it is duplicative as well. The actual controversy Plaintiff has identified is whether or not Defendant discriminated against her, wrongfully-terminated her, or retaliated against her. See Complaint ¶¶ 126-128. Plaintiff wants the Court to "condemn" these practices "prospectively," and make Defendant "aware of their [sic] obligations under the law to not engage in discriminatory practices and to not violate the law in the future." Id. ¶¶ 129-130. The other causes of action Plaintiff has presented either may in the future achieve these same ends, or have now failed (or may still in the future fail) to achieve these same ends. As a result, the Court questions the point of Plaintiff maintaining her tenth cause [*64]  of action beyond this stage. See, e.g., Mendoza v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 6 Cal.App.5th 802, 820-21, 212 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2016); Tyler v. Travelers Commercial Ins. Co., 499 F.Supp.3d 693, 702 (N.D. Cal. 2020) ("Where a claim for declaratory relief is merely duplicative of other causes of action asserted by a plaintiff, dismissal is proper."); Richter v. CC-Palo Alto, Inc., 176 F.Supp.3d 877, 900 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (stating same rule in context of claim for declaratory relief brought pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1060). It will discuss this issue, and why — given it — there is any reason Plaintiff's declaratory relief claim should continue, with the parties at oral argument on the motion.
F. Sick Leave Denial/Discrimination
Plaintiff's ninth claim for relief is styled as "denial of and discrimination based upon the use of sick leave," citing California Labor Code sections 233, 234, and 246.5. The claim appears based on the theory that "Plaintiff repeatedly used and attempted to use accrued sick leave to seek treatment for a medical condition," but that Walmart "disciplined Plaintiff, and ultimately terminated" her, "count[ing] Plaintiff's sick leave as absences which subjected her to discipline and discharge." Complaint ¶ 120.
For this claim, Defendant argues that Plaintiff was responsible for applying her own PTO and that, in any event, she had none so there could not have been a denial. See Docket No. 16, at 25:5-15. Plaintiff does not so much as mention Labor Code sections 233, 234, or 246.5 in her Opposition [*65]  brief (and, perhaps consequently, Walmart ignores the subject in its Reply brief as well). This is not by itself sufficient reason to conclude that Walmart prevails as to this claim, as Walmart is still required to sustain its burden as the moving party. See Phillips & Stevenson ¶¶ 14:329, 14:331.1. But Plaintiff's failure to discuss the claim does not aid her case.
Labor Code subsection 233(a) provides, in part, that
[a]ny employer who provides sick leave for employees shall permit an employee to use in any calendar year the employee's accrued and available sick leave entitlement, in an amount not less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the employee's then current rate of entitlement, for the reasons specified in subdivision (a) of Section 246.5.
Cal. Lab. Code § 233(a) (emphasis added). Subsection 233(c) then provides that "[a]n employer shall not deny an employee the right to use sick leave or discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using, or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave to attend to an illness . . . or for any other reason specified in subdivision (a) of Section 246.5." Id. § 233(c). "Sick leave" — at least as used in section 23320 — is defined to mean "accrued increments of compensated leave provided by an employer [*66]  to an employee as a benefit of the employment for use by the employee during an absence from the employment for any of the reasons specified in subdivision (a) of Section 246.5." Id. § 233(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added). Labor Code section 234 then provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]n employer absence control policy that counts sick leave taken pursuant to Section 233 as an absence that may lead to or result in discipline, discharge, demotion, or suspension is a per se violation of Section 233." Id. § 234 (emphasis added).
Finally, under Labor Code section 246.5, employers are to "provide paid sick days" — upon the oral or written request of an employee — for, among other things, the "[d]iagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, an employee." Id. § 246.5(a)(1). That section also instructs that an employer, among other things, "shall not deny an employee the right to use accrued sick days, discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using accrued sick days [or] attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days." Id. § 246.5(c)(1) (emphases added).
Walmart has provided evidence that Plaintiff had no remaining accrued PTO at the time of her termination. See DRS ¶ 57. This is sufficient for Walmart to meet its burden [*67]  on its summary judgment motion. See, e.g., Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1102. Plaintiff has not submitted evidence to the contrary. Although she asserts she was not allowed to see her PTO records at the time she was terminated, Plaintiff apparently uncovered no evidence during discovery that conflicts with Defendant's assertion regarding her lack of PTO as of that time. Plaintiff — having not addressed the claim in connection with this motion21 — does not contend that her claim in this regard concerns any time period other than when she was terminated. It is therefore unclear how Plaintiff can sustain a claim for denial of sick leave or sick days.
There is case law suggesting that at least a sick leave retaliation claim is to be assessed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting procedure (or at least a process that sounds awfully similar). See Wilkin v. Cmty. Hosp. of the Monterey Peninsula, 71 Cal.App.5th 806, 827, 286 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2021) (affirming grant of summary judgment on Labor Code sick leave retaliation claim where trial court concluded that plaintiff had "failed to show the Hospital's decision to discipline and terminate her employment was the result of retaliation, and failed to show the Hospital's legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for her discharge were used as a pretext"). Even if that is true, the absence of accrued, [*68]  existing, sick leave would seem to be a deficiency in such a claim's prima facie case, meaning that it would fail at the first McDonnell Douglas stage. Plaintiff has not demonstrated a triable issue with respect to whether she had PTO to use at the time of her termination, and no evidence that she used accrued and available PTO in connection with the absences that led to her termination, so it is not possible for Walmart to have retaliated against Plaintiff for such use.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Walmart's motion with respect to Plaintiff's ninth claim for relief.
G. Failure to Permit Inspection
Plaintiff's final claim for relief is for "failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records" under California Labor Code sections 1198.5, 226(c), 226(f), and 432. Subsection 1198.5(a) of California's Labor Code provides that "[e]very current and former employee . . . has the right to inspect and receive a copy of the personnel records that the employer maintains relating to the employee's performance or to any grievance concerning the employee," and subsection 1198.5(b)(1) obligates an employer to "make the contents of those personnel records available for inspection . . . not later than 30 calendar days from the date the employer receives a written request" and to provide [*69]  the employee with a copy of the personnel records. Cal. Lab. Code §§ 1198.5(a), 1198.5(b)(1). Subsection 226(b) provides current and former employees of certain employers the same inspection/receipt rights with respect to "records pertaining to their employment, upon reasonable request to the employer" (i.e., with no facial "written request" requirement), with subsection 226(f) providing a penalty for an employer's failure in this regard. Cal. Lab. Code §§ 226(b), 226(f). Section 432 of the Labor Code simply provides that "[i]f an employee . . . signs any instrument relating to the obtaining or holding of employment, he shall be given a copy of the instrument upon request." Cal. Lab. Code § 432.
As to this claim, Defendant argues that it permissibly designated people to whom employees should send requests for personnel records/records pertaining to their employment, and that Plaintiff failed to follow that designated process. Indeed, subsection 1198.5(f) of the Labor Code provides that an "employer may designate the person to whom a request is made." Subsection 226(c) has the same provision for requests made under subsection 226(b).
The evidence supports Walmart's designation in this regard. Walmart's "California Associate Access to Personnel Files" policy instructs employees wishing to review their personnel file that they "should notify their supervisor or a salaried [*70]  member of management, verbally or in writing." See DRS ¶ 61. The evidence is also clear with respect to who Plaintiff says she notified. She mailed a request to Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and there is also evidence that she made a verbal request for her records from Rodriguez. See DRS ¶¶ 63, 68; DRO ¶ 32.
Plaintiff argues that "[i]t is proper to serve a corporation at its headquarters," citing several cases. Walmart does not respond to this "headquarters" argument in its Reply, but simply doubles-down on its argument that the law permitted it to designate people to whom such a request could be made, and that Plaintiff did not comply with such a designation.
Plaintiff also asserts that, putting aside her mailing to Bentonville, her communication with Rodriguez sufficed (though, because it was verbal, it would not have sufficed under Labor Code section 1198.5, at a minimum). Whether or not that communication concerned "personnel records" and/or "records pertaining to [Plaintiff's] employment," Walmart notes in response that Rodriguez was not a salaried member of management or Plaintiff's supervisor.
It is clear that Plaintiff did not comply with Labor Code sections 1198.5 and 226, given Walmart's designation under subsections 1198.5(f) and [*71]  226(c). The cases Plaintiff cites for service upon a company's headquarters all deal with service of process, not service of a request for records to a recipient permissibly-designated under California Labor Code subsections 1198.5(f) and 226(c). See Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F.3d 909, 912-13 (9th Cir. 2011); Strotek Corp. v. Air Transp. Ass'n of Am., 300 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir. 2002); Savarese v. Edrick Transfer & Storage, Inc., 513 F.2d 140, 144-45 (9th Cir. 1975). In addition, the Court sees no fact or evidence referenced in the DRS or DRO supporting a conclusion that Rodriguez was Plaintiff's supervisor (or a "salaried member of management"). Plaintiff's request made to someone at the store where she worked was not compliant with Walmart's policy's designation, which is permissible under Labor Code subsections 1198.5(f) and 226(c).22
While it would seem to be Walmart who would bear the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue raised here — Plaintiff's failure to comply with Walmart's designated process under subsections 1198.5(f) and 226(c), seemingly an affirmative defense to these types of claims — it has done what it needed to do as the moving party on that issue. See Shakur, 514 F.3d at 890; S. Cal. Gas, 336 F.3d at 888; see also Garcia v. Wal-Mart Assocs., No. CV 19-07784-CJC (SKx), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40134, 2021 WL 4027542, *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2021) (granting summary judgment in favor of defendant where employee mailed request to defendant's Bentonville headquarters despite defendant's policy designation, offering that "[t]o conclude otherwise would render meaningless the California Legislature's express decision to permit corporations to designate the person to whom requests [*72]  are made"). In response, Plaintiff has come up empty with respect to any fact germane to Walmart's precise defense. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Walmart's motion with respect to Plaintiff's eleventh claim for relief.
H. Punitive Damages
Finally, on the issue of punitive damages, Walmart argues that Plaintiff is unable to identify evidence of oppression, fraud or malice, as required by California Civil Code § 3294(a), and certainly not in a way that would satisfy the applicable clear and convincing evidence standard applicable to such a showing. See Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a) ("In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant."). It then also makes the point that even if Plaintiff were able to do this, she has not associated such conduct with anyone who would meet the definition of an "officer, director, or managing agent," as required by Civil Code § 3294(b) in cases involving a corporate employer. See id. § 3294(b) ("With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and [*73]  conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.").
Plaintiff responds that Defendant purposely created a false narrative to justify her termination. However, other than briefly asserting in her Opposition — without any effort to specify what she means, or citation to any evidence in this regard — that Defendant "authorized or ratified Plaintiff's termination," Docket No. 24, at 18:27-19:2, Plaintiff does not appear to respond to Walmart's arguments regarding a failure to tie any conduct to anyone who meets the definition of "officer, director, or managing agent" (and certainly does not present any argument even suggesting that Rodriguez or Atkinson serve in such a role). Walmart notes this failure in its Reply (in addition to factually-distinguishing Plaintiff's sole "false narrative" authority). See Docket No. 35, at 18:20-24.
Putting aside the question of whether Plaintiff has sufficient evidence of the type of conduct required for an award of punitive damages under a clear and convincing evidence standard, see Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a), Defendant's alternative argument — that Plaintiff [*74]  has not presented any evidence of the involvement of an "officer, director, or managing agent" — is convincing. Certainly Plaintiff has not identified the involvement in her case of any "officer" or "director" of Walmart. Meanwhile, "[t]he term 'managing agent' includes 'only those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decisionmaking so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy'" such that a plaintiff must show that the employee in question "'exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business.'" Powerhouse Motorsports Grp., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., 221 Cal.App.4th 867, 886, 164 Cal. Rptr. 3d 811 (2013) (quoting White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 566-67, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999)); see also Glovatorium, Inc. v. NCR Corp., 684 F.2d 658, 661 (9th Cir. 1982) ("The key inquiry in the determination of whether an employee is a managing agent is 'the degree of discretion the employees possess in making decisions that will ultimately determine corporate policy.'") (quoting Egan v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co., 24 Cal. 3d 809, 822-23, 169 Cal. Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141 (1979)); Cruz v. HomeBase, 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167-68, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435 (2000) ("'[C]orporate policy' is the general principles which guide a corporation, or rules intended to be followed consistently over time in corporate operations. A 'managing agent' is one with substantial authority over decisions that set these general principles and rules."). The mere ability to hire and fire employees does not render [*75]  a supervisory employee a managing agent under subsection 3294(b). See White, 21 Cal.4th at 566.
Defendant presented evidence that Rodriguez did not create, modify, or implement policy for Walmart, and had no authority to hire or fire associates, and that Atkinson did not make, suggest or influence decisions that ultimately determined Walmart's corporate policy. See DRS ¶¶ 69-73; see also Cruz, 83 Cal.App.4th at 168 (concluding that individual who "was not a manager of numerous stores, but only a supervisor subordinate to the store manager in a single outlet of a multi-store chain" was insufficient, as a matter of law, to demonstrate "managing agent" status). At a minimum, Defendant "pointed out" — as the moving party — a gap in the evidence necessary for Plaintiff to recover punitive damages. See Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1076. Summary judgment is the stage at which Plaintiff is required to have accumulated evidence of an officer's, director's or managing agent's involvement so that she may present that evidence to the Court, if challenged on this point. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that demonstrates a triable issue in this regard. As a result, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff has complied with its obligation as the non-moving party on this issue. See T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
Plaintiff [*76]  has not demonstrated a genuine issue of fact whether any "officer, director, or managing agent" was involved in the purported "false narrative" conduct which she asserts supports her theory for an award of punitive damages. As a result, the Court will grant Defendant's motion with respect to the issue of whether Plaintiff may recover punitive damages in this action.

IV. Conclusion
The Court will deny Walmart's motion with respect to Plaintiff's first and eighth causes of action. It will also deny it in part with respect to Plaintiff's third claim for relief. The Court will discuss with the parties whether there is any continuing need for Plaintiff's claim for a declaratory judgment (her tenth claim for relief). The Court will otherwise grant Defendant's motion.
