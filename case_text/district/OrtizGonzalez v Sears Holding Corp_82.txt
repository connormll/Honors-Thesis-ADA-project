Opinion



 [*191]  REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
On May 19, 2011, plaintiff Jacqueline Ortiz González ("plaintiff" or "Ortiz") filed a complaint against defendants Sears Holding Corporation, also known as Sears Roebuck of Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Sears"), Melvin Fonseca ("Fonseca"), and Melissa Negrón ("Negrón"), alleging claims under the Americans with Disability Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., Law 44 of July 2, 1985 ("Law 44"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 501 et seq., and Law 80 of May 30, 1976 ("Law 80"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185a et seq. ECF No. 1. Pending before the court is defendants' motion for summary judgment, along with plaintiff's response  [**2] and defendants' reply. ECF Nos. 35; 51; 63. 1

I. Summary of Uncontested Material Facts2

A. Plaintiff's Medical Condition
Plaintiff was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 when she was fifteen years old. Due to her condition, plaintiff does not secrete insulin at all. As such, she has always been on insulin treatment to control her blood sugar levels. She uses two types of insulin: long-term and rapid-action. Plaintiff takes long-term insulin twice a day, in the morning and at night, and rapid-action insulin with her food or whenever her sugar levels get too high. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 2, 8; 51-1, ¶¶ 1.2-1.3, 2, 8; 63-1, ¶¶ 1.2-1.3.
Ordinarily, plaintiff injects herself in the morning with both the long-term and rapid-action insulin and has her breakfast. Between 2.5 and 3 hours later, she has a light snack and, another 2.5 to 3 hours later, she has her lunch. Another 2.5 to 3 hours later, she has an afternoon snack, and 2.5 to 3 hours later she has dinner. She has a final snack before going to bed.  [*192]  Over the course of one day, plaintiff has three meals and three snacks. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 9; 51-1, ¶ 9.
Plaintiff must check her blood sugar level with every meal, using a medical device called a glucometer. Additionally, she usually checks her blood  [**4] sugar level when she takes her snack. Whether she does so depends on how her blood sugar levels had been that day. She also needs to check her blood sugar levels if she feels ill. The times when plaintiff needs to monitor her blood sugar vary constantly and depend on a number of factors, including the time she had breakfast and whether she feels ill. Moreover, diabetes patients urinate more frequently than non-diabetic individuals in order to eliminate excess sugar. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 10-11; 51-1, ¶¶ 1.10-1.11, 1.13-1.14, 7.13-7.15, 10-11; 63-1, ¶¶ 1.10-1.11, 1.13-1.14, 7.13-7.15.
Ortiz must have a snack when her blood sugar is low or adjust her insulin treatment when her blood sugar is high. A "snack" could involve drinking four ounces of juice. Failure to take a snack when needed runs the risk of hypoglycemia, which could result in symptoms such as slurred speech, confused thinking, disorientation, profuse sweating, and even loss of consciousness. Plaintiff specifically has experienced symptoms such as hunger, thirst, trembling, nervousness, sweating, headache, coldness, heat, or pain. Stress is a factor which may affect the blood sugar levels of a diabetes patient. Diabetes was  [**5] the seventh leading cause of death listed on U.S. certificates in 2007. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 1.7, 1.9, 1.12, 1.14-1.15, 7.13-7.14, 7.16-7.17; 63-1, ¶¶ 1.7, 1.9, 1.12, 1.14-1.15, 7.13-7.14, 7.16-7.17.

B. Plaintiff's Background
Plaintiff graduated from high school in 2004, attended the University of Puerto Rico, Bayamon campus, from May 2004 to May 2009, and transferred to Atlantic University College on February 25, 2010. As of March 29, 2012, she had not yet graduated from Atlantic University College. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 3; 51-1, ¶ 3.
In 2005, plaintiff began working for Sears as a part-time Sales Associate in the Service and Parts Department of the Bayamon Service Center under the supervision of Janice Cotto ("Cotto"). At the time, she underwent a pre-employment examination where the evaluating physician stated that plaintiff suffered from type I diabetes and "requires eating at her times." ECF No. 43-3, at 1. Plaintiff provided the medical certificate from the examination to Sears, which was placed in her personnel file. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 4-5; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.1-2.2, 2.5-2.7, 4-5; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.1-2.2, 2.5-2.7.
During her pre-employment interview, plaintiff disclosed her diabetes condition  [**6] to Elizabeth Ayala ("Ayala"). At the time, Ayala was the Human Resources Representative at the Service and Parts Department. Plaintiff also explained that she needed to take breaks to monitor her blood sugar levels or ingest food, or leave if she felt ill. Plaintiff told Ayala that she "ha[d] to eat at specific hours." ECF No. 51-3, at 9. Plaintiff, however, did not request a specific schedule for her breaks. She told Ayala that it depended on her blood sugar levels each day. Ayala informed Ortiz that Sears "provide[d] a break during the scheduled hours." Id. at 10. Ayala also told her that, if she "needed more than that break, ... she could always talk to her manager and she would refer it to Human Resources Manager and they could evaluation [sic] the situation individually." Id. While plaintiff worked at the Service and Parts Department of the Bayamon Service Center, Cotto would always let her use the restroom, measure her blood sugar levels, take snacks, and  [*193]  administer insulin. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 12; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.3-2.4, 2.9-2.11, 3.1, 12; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.3-2.4, 2.9-2.11, 3.1.
Sears employees are entitled to one fifteen-minute rest period for each four hours of work in a workday. Additionally,  [**7] Sears employees have a right to a sixty-minute lunch break if they work five hours or more in a workday. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 15; 51-1, ¶¶ 3.6, 15; 63-1, ¶ 3.6.

C. Galería Los Paseos Store
On September 7, 2008, after the department where she worked closed, plaintiff was transferred to the Galería Los Paseos Store ("Paseos Store") as a part-time Office Associate assigned to the Human Resources ("HR") Department. By this point, Ayala had been transferred to the position of HR Lead at the Paseos Store. As such, Ayala was plaintiffs first supervisor at the Paseos Store. When plaintiff started there, she again informed Ayala about her medical condition and her need to monitor her blood sugar level, to eat snacks if it was too low, and to inject insulin. Ortiz also explained to Ayala what to do if she fainted. Nevertheless, plaintiff never requested a specific schedule of breaks to ingest food or monitor her blood sugar to Ayala, Negrón (HR Lead at time of plaintiff's resignation), or anyone else at Sears. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 6-7, 13; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.15-2.16, 3.2, 6-7, 13; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.15-2.16, 3.2.
While Ayala was plaintiff's supervisor at the Paseos Store, plaintiff's diabetes condition was in  [**8] an uncontrolled state. Under such circumstances, blood sugar levels can be high all of the time or drop to very low levels. Ayala told the store manager about plaintiff's medical condition. When there was a change of managers, she would give the new manager the information. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 3.3-3.4; 63-1, ¶¶ 3.3-3.4.
Each time that plaintiff asked Ayala for "a break before the two hours and [Ayala] understood that it wasn't going to interfere with her job and she could take it, [Ayala] would say yes." ECF No. 51-3, at 30. Ayala would let Ortiz go to the restroom as needed. She did not consider plaintiff's restroom breaks to be excessive. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 2.12, 3.8; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.12, 3.8.
Ayala had "always known [plaintiff] to be a good associate." ECF No. 51-3, at 11. She never had any complaints about Ortiz's work. Cotto, plaintiff's first supervisor, gave her good references about her work. Cotto considered plaintiff to be a good employee who could run the office in her absence and do the work of HR Lead. While under Ayala's supervision, Ortiz typically completed all of the tasks she was assigned. On the occasions when the time allotted was insufficient to do so, she would inform  [**9] Ayala. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 2.14, 2.26-2.27; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.14, 2.26-2.27.
Plaintiff would monitor her blood sugar levels with a glucometer in a restroom of the Paseos Store, which was across the hall from the HR office. The process of measuring her sugar levels would take ten to fifteen seconds. In the event that her blood sugar level was very high, she had to administer insulin. At the Paseos Store, she would do this in a restroom stall. The entire process would take ten to fifteen minutes. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 17; 51-1, ¶¶ 5.2-5.3, 17; 63-1, ¶¶ 5.2-5.3.
Plaintiff would bring snacks from home or buy something to eat during her work shift to stabilize her blood sugar levels. If plaintiff's blood sugar levels reached over 400, she would have to leave the workplace. Plaintiff's physician's instructions to her indicated that, under such circumstances, she would have to administer insulin and go home to rest. If her blood  [*194]  sugar levels nonetheless remained high, she would have to seek immediate medical attention, either with her doctor or at an emergency room. During the period Ortiz was under the supervision of Negrón, who was HR Lead at the time of plaintiff's resignation, this occurred only  [**10] one time. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 5.4-5.6; 63-1, ¶¶ 5.4-5.6.
At the Paseos Store, plaintiff was generally assigned the morning shift, from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Plaintiff would have breakfast before going to work. As a part-time employee, plaintiff would generally work shifts that were not longer than five hours. Under Ayala's supervision, plaintiff worked approximately fifteen to twenty hours per week. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 18-20, 23; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.20, 18-20, 23; 63-1, ¶ 2.20.
At Sears, the Department Manager would distribute the hours assigned to the Department among the employees. The decision as to the number of hours assigned to the HR Department at the Paseos Store was made by Sears employees in the United States. The Operations Manager would notify the HR Lead the amount of hours allotted to the HR Department. Forty hours would be designated for the HR Lead, who was a full-time employee. The HR Lead would then distribute the remaining hours among the part-time employees. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 23; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.18, 24; 63-1, ¶ 2.18.
When plaintiff first began working at the Paseos Store, there were only two employees assigned to the HR Department: Ayala and plaintiff. In the summer of 2009,  [**11] a second part-time employee, Ricardo Quiñones ("Quiñones"), was hired. Quiñones remained as an Office Associate at the time of Ortiz's departure in April of 2010. Even when Quiñones was hired, Ayala would typically assign more hours to plaintiff because she was "more knowledgeable of the work." ECF No. 51-3, at 21. Quiñones mostly handled cash deposits. His availability was also limited because he was a student. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 24; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.17, 2.19, 25; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.17, 2.19.
Plaintiff's tasks as an Office Associate involved performing office work, assisting employees, and working with the store's payroll. See ECF No. 51-4, at 25. The functions related to the safe funds occurred on a daily basis, took approximately two hours, and were usually conducted in the morning. The task of "register detail," which also was conducted daily, took about ten or fifteen minutes. ECF No. 51-1, ¶ 2.23. An Office Associate might also be assigned the monthly task of reconciling the cash registers, discussed further below. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 25, 52; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.22-2.23, 26, 54; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.22-2.23.

D. Change in Management
At the end of May of 2009, Fonseca began working as the Operations Manager at  [**12] the Paseos Store. See ECF Nos. 35-9, at 5; 58-1, at 104. He oversaw the operational part of the entire store, including the HR Department. Additionally, after the Store Manager left at the beginning of 2010, Fonseca assumed the responsibilities of said position. On one occasion, Ayala mentioned to Fonseca that Ortiz had a medical condition and needed to monitor her blood sugar levels, administer insulin, and take breaks. ECF No. 51-3, at 31-32. Fonseca was aware "that [Ortiz] has a problem with her sugar." ECF No. 58-1, at 114; see ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 3.5, 3.7, 4.1, 4.9; 63-1, ññ 3.5, 3.7, 4.1, 4.9.
In October of 2009, Ayala left the position of HR Lead at the Paseos Store. Although plaintiff applied for the position of HR Lead, she was not chosen. Nevertheless, she performed the duties of HR Lead for approximately two months until  [*195]  Negrón assumed said position. On December 13, 2009, Negrón began working as HR Lead at the Paseos Store, with Fonseca as her direct supervisor. Negrón graduated from the University of Puerto Rico in 2006 and received a Master's Degree in Human Resources from Metropolitan University in 2008. She worked as a "job coach" or "employment trainer" at Educavipro,  [**13] Inc., from 2005 thru 2008. ECF No. 43-4, at 7. At said organization, Negrón was responsible for identifying job opportunities for persons with disabilities and performing on-the-job training. She had also previously worked part-time at Kmart. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 29-32; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.26, 4.2-4.4, 4.6, 4.9, 31-34; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.26, 4.2-4.4, 4.6, 4.9.
When Negrón assumed the position of HR Lead at the Paseos Store, Ortiz informed her that she had diabetes and high blood pressure. She also explained that she would need to take breaks to eat, check her blood sugar, and go to the restroom frequently. Plaintiff, however, did not request breaks of a specific length of time. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 22; 51-1, ¶¶ 5.1, 22; 63-1, ¶ 5.1.
Plaintiff, along with Fonseca, trained Negrón for about one week. On December 21, 2009, Negrón was diagnosed with influenza and was out sick until December 31, 2009. As HR Lead, Negrón supervised the HR Department, including both Office Associates, Ortiz and Quiñones. She also assigned their work schedules. Negrón, plaintiff, and Quiñones were the only three employees in the HR Department. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 33-34; 51-1, ¶¶ 4.5-4.8, 35-36; 63-1, ¶¶ 4.5-4.8.
In distributing  [**14] the hours assigned to the HR Department, Negrón considered plaintiff's and Quiñones's availabilities and which employee, if either, was assigned to work on Sunday. Over the course of the fourteen weeks between January 10, 2010, and April 3, 2010, Ortiz was assigned fewer hours than Quiñones during five of the weeks. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 35-36; 51-1, ¶¶ 37-38. 3
Over the course of the five weeks between January 3 and February 6, 2010, plaintiff and Quiñones were scheduled for 83 hours and 61 hours, respectively. Plaintiff was assigned more hours than Quiñones during each of the five weeks. During said period, plaintiff was assigned between 15 and 23 hours per week, while Quiñones was not assigned more than 12.5 hours per week. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶ 6.6; 63-1, ¶ 6.6.
Between February  [**15] 14 and April 3, 2010, plaintiff and Quiñones were assigned 95 and 103.5 hours, respectively. During said period, plaintiff was assigned between 12 and 15.5 hours per week, while Quiñones was assigned between 12 and 19.5 hours per week. During the five weeks between February 28 and April 3, 2010, Quiñones was assigned more hours than plaintiff. On February 25, 2010, plaintiff began taking three night classes at Atlantic University College. The classes did not limit her availability for work. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 37; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.21, 6.7, 39; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.21, 6.7.
"[T]here were times" when plaintiff "could not measure [her] sugar," because her supervisors "wanted [her] to finish [a job] quickly." ECF No. 58-1, at 27. Over the course of Negrón's supervision of Ortiz— [*196]  from mid-December 2009 to early April 2010—their shifts overlapped on approximately thirty-two days. When plaintiff would tell Negrón that she had to check her sugar, Negrón would respond, "[O]h, well, go," or ask, "[A]gain?" and make "a gesture." Id. at 36. On two or three occasions, when plaintiff went into the restroom, Negrón also entered "quickly, ... stay[ed] standing for a little while and le[ft] ... quickly again." Id. at 50.  [**16] Negrón was not "standing in front of the mirror." Id.; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 38; 51-1, ¶¶ 5.8-5.10, 5.12, 40; 63-1, ¶¶ 5.8-5.10, 5.12.
On at least one occasion, when Fonseca saw plaintiff eating at the workplace, he asked, "[Y]ou are eating again?" ECF No. 51-2, ¶ 12. At least once, when plaintiff "went to drink water," he would ask "why [she] was drinking so much." Id. Fonseca also "scream[ed] to [plaintiff] in front of sales associates and clients, making comments about [her] taking too much time to complete a task." Id.; see ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶ 5.14; 63-1, ¶ 5.14.
On an unspecified number of occasions, Fonseca and Negrón, with a "bad attitude ... or making faces," stated to plaintiff, "Oh, you're going to the bathroom again," or asked why she had "not finished [her work] in so long," in front of customers and other employees. ECF No. 58-1, at 62. 4 Fonseca and Negrón had "a bad demeanor" or "a negative attitude the whole time." Id. at 61-62; see ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 5.11, 5.14-5.16; 63-1, ¶¶ 5.11, 5.14-5.16.
Every time that plaintiff had to go to the restroom, measure her blood sugar, or do anything else related to her condition, she was in fact able to do so. Aside from a contested incident on April 5, 2010, discussed below, plaintiff was never specifically prohibited from taking time to ingest food. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 58, 60; 51-1, ¶¶ 60, 62.

E. Plaintiff's Performance

1. Sign Transmission
"Inasmuch as the Marketing Department" was allocated thirty to thirty-two hours per week, whereas the HR Department was given approximately sixty-eight hours and up to eighty during "the high season," "the marketing duty of 'sign transmission' was assigned to the HR Department" sometime in the beginning of 2010. ECF No. 35-1, ¶ 39. Plaintiff had previously participated in a course titled "How to Print Signs" between September 25 and November 14, 2008. ECF No. 35-17; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 39, 41, 23; 51-1, ¶¶ 6.1, 41, 43; 63-1, ¶ 6.1.
This task, which was to be done on Tuesdays and Thursdays by the Office Associate scheduled to work on that date, entailed printing  [**18] the store promotions. Specifically, the task required that the Office Associate sit in front of a computer that had already received the signs and, depending on the sign size, place the appropriate size paper in the printer and print the same. After printing the signs, the associate would separate them by department. An employee for the Marketing Department was responsible for placing the signs in the store. The task would take the Office Associate approximately thirty minutes. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 40; 51-1, ¶¶ 6.1, 42; 63-1, ¶ 6.1.
Negrón would regularly send electronic communications to Ortiz and Quiñones detailing the lists of specific tasks to do on a  [*197]  particular day. Most of the e-mails were sent because she was not going to be present at the store at the same time as the Office Associates. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 42; 51-1, ¶ 44.
The first time that the task of sign transmission was assigned in writing to plaintiff was on February 9, 2010. 5 On that day, Negrón sent Ortiz and Quiñones an e-mail stating in part:
Last week I assigned several tasks for the days that I was not going to be in the store and many of them were not done. I understand that sometimes there isn't time for everything  [**19] but it is important that we keep communication open about what was done and not, to then establish priorities.
ECF No. 43-14, at 11. The e-mail includes a list comprised of more than fifteen different tasks, including six which had to be conducted on a daily basis and six which had to be conducted at least once a week. The e-mail also indicates that sign transmission was to occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Tuesdays, an Office Associate was also expected to take the attendance of all managerial employees and associates. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 43; 51-1, ¶¶ 6.2-6.4, 45; 63-1, ¶¶ 6.2-6.4.
During the first three weeks following the February 9, 2010, e-mail, Ortiz worked each Tuesday and Thursday, whereas Quiñones worked only one (February 25, 2010). See ECF No. 51-4, at 43-72. Quiñones worked none of the Tuesdays and three of the Thursdays between February 9 and March 19, 2010, the date of plaintiff's Performance Plan for Improvement, discussed below. See id. at 54-66. Between February 9 and April 5, 2010, plaintiff's final day, she worked each Tuesday and Thursday—a total of seventeen days—whereas Quiñones worked only five. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 6.5, 6.15; 63-1, ¶¶ 6.5, 6.15.
On February 22, 2010, Negrón sent plaintiff an e-mail assigning her several tasks for February 23, 2010, including completing office detail and reports and sign transmission. Two days later, Negrón sent plaintiff an e-mail indicating that "the transmission of the signs had not been done, the detail had not been worked on and the office reports had not been worked on completely." ECF No. 43-14, at 7; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 44-45; 51-1, ¶¶ 46-47.

2. Performance Plan for Improvement
On March  [**21] 19, 2010, Negrón prepared a Performance Plan for Improvement ("PPI") concerning plaintiff's work performance. The PPI reads in part:
On Feb/9/10, I sent an e-mail specifying the daily tasks with their priorities and up to today, March/14/2010, 6 you are  [*198]  not fully meeting these responsibilities. When you fail to meet these responsibilities, the productivity of the office and the store is affected, even more when you are failing to do the transmission of the signs, which impacts the marketing of the store and customer service.
... The store gets affected when you fail to meet your tasks because failing to transmit the signs, they are not placed on time and the customer service is affected. In addition, that it affects your co-workers who have to complete your tasks in addition to their own.
ECF No. 43-5, at 1. The PPI also states, "If you continue failing to complete the assigned tasks and do not show progress, other disciplinary measures will be taken, including suspension and termination of employment." Id. The PPI was discussed with Ortiz on March 20, 2010. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 46; 51-1, ¶¶ 6.8-6.10, 48; 63-1, ¶¶ 6.8-6.10.
On the PPI, plaintiff wrote, "I signed, but I don't agree, because I always comply with the tasks that are assigned to me, if I do not finish something, it's because I didn't have time, or there was some setback, because I don't come to work to do nothing and waste time." ECF No. 43-5, at 2. She told Negrón on the same day that she did not have enough time for sign transmission because "the associates called her for something or she was doing other tasks." ECF No. 68-2, at 6. There were "many instances" where Ortiz would arrive at work, "find that Mr. Quiñones had not done tasks assigned," and "have to do the work he left undone from the previous day." ECF No. 51-2, ¶ 8. Negrón observed plaintiff working on her assigned tasks during work hours, but not wasting time. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 47; 51-1, ¶¶ 6.12-6.13, 6.15, 6.17, 49; 63-1, ¶¶ 6.12-6.13, 6.15,  [**23] 6.17.

F. New Medical Note
By March 23, 2010, plaintiff was feeling "extremely stressed," distracted, and nervous because of Negrón's treatment of her. ECF No. 51-2, ¶ 15. That same day, Ortiz checked her blood sugar level at work and it was over 400. She told Negrón that her blood sugar level was "extremely high" and she had to leave. ECF No. 43-1, at 41. Negrón responded, but the content of such response is disputed. 7 See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 48; 51-1, ¶¶ 7.1-7.2, 7.20, 50; 63-1, ¶¶ 7.1-7.2, 7.20.
In order to attend to her medical situation, plaintiff went to the office of her physician, Dr. Joseph Campos ("Dr. Campos"), who had been treating plaintiff since January of 2009. At that time, plaintiff's diabetes mellitus was uncontrolled. She complained of increased thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination (polyuria), which resulted in more frequent visits to the restroom. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 7.3-7.4; 63-1, ¶¶ 7.3-7.4.
Ortiz reported to Dr. Campos that she had been under a lot of stress at work and had not been eating. She indicated that on "many occasions" she was not given time to take her snacks at work, comply with her diet, or measure her blood sugar  [*199]  level. ECF No. 51-4, at 10. Plaintiff requested a medical certificate explaining her need for a reasonable accommodation in order to continue working. In response to Ortiz's request, Dr. Campos asked Dr. Melba Feliciano ("Dr. Feliciano") "for a recommendation" due to her expertise with diabetes. Id. at 7. Dr. Feliciano wrote the following:
This is a 22-year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy and history of arterial  [**25] hypertension on treatment. This patient due to her chronic condition of diabetes mellitus type 1 on insulin therapy and arterial hypertension as chronic complication of the disease needs a strict control of glycemia and arterial hypertension to prevent further complications. She needs a regular meal plan schedule according to insulin therapy and action profile, stressful events or chronic stress has been reported to contribute to uncontrolled glycemia. Reasonable accommodation with her present job assignment is recommended. Thanks for your attention.
Id. at 8; see also id. at 17-18; ECF No. 58-1, at 116; see ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 7.4-7.6, 7.8-7.9, 7.11; 63-1, ¶¶ 7.4-7.6, 7.8-7.9, 7.11.
Dr. Campos wrote a note which states, "Patient with diagnosis of DM type 1 which requires strict diet and blood sugar monitoring. Patient currently with uncontrolled blood sugar which requires special treatment and attention." ECF No. 35-21. Plaintiff gave Dr. Campos's medical note to Negrón on her next day of work, March 25, 2010. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 50; 51-1, ¶¶ 7.10, 7.18, 52; 63-1, ¶¶ 7.10, 7.18.
Plaintiff submitted the sick leave request form for March 23, 2010, "two or three times because they had not  [**26] paid [her] the sick hours, the remainder of hours [she] was going to work that day." ECF No. 58-1, at 52-53. She made the request "[t]o her, at Human Resources which is where the requests are done." Id. at 52. On April 9, 2010, plaintiff was paid for 2.05 hours of sick leave for the period between March 21 and April 3, 2010. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 49; 51-1, ¶¶ 5.17, 51; 63-1, ¶ 5.17.

G. Final Day of Work
One of plaintiff's responsibilities as an Office Associate was the reconciliation of the store's cash registers. See ECF Nos. 43-1, at 10. The task, which occurred monthly, involved verifying that each cash register at the store had $100 in cash. When the task was conducted by an Office Associate, a supervisor, such as an assistant manager, the HR Lead, or an employee from the Loss Prevention Department, was usually present. This task was normally completed before the store opened at 9:00 a.m. and on the first Sunday or Monday of the fiscal month. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 25, 52; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.24-2.25, 8.2, 8.4, 8.12, 26, 54; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.24-2.25, 8.2, 8.4, 8.12. 8
 [*200]  On Monday, April 5, 2010, plaintiff was scheduled to work from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. She arrived to work at 8:00 a.m. See ECF No. 35-10, at 29. On that day, Ortiz  [**29] was assigned the task of reconciliation of the cash registers approximately one or two hours after she began work. See ECF No. 58-1, at 58. Ortiz was informed by management that she had to complete the task quickly. There were between ten and fifteen cash registers to reconcile. Because the store was already open, the task took Ortiz approximately one to two hours. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 53-54; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.24, 8.1, 8.9-8.11, 55-56; 63-1, ¶¶ 2.24, 8.1, 8.9-8.11.
Negrón began work at 7:00 a.m., two hours before the store opened. At 11:58 a.m., she left for lunch. See ECF No. 35-10, at 29. Negrón did not complete the reconciliation of the cash registers before lunch. By noon, plaintiff had been working for four hours. That day, she had not monitored her blood sugar levels between breakfast and lunchtime. She "was not able to measure [her] sugar" because management "wanted [her] to do [the reconciliation of the cash registers] fast." ECF No. 58-1, at 27. On that day, however, no one specifically told plaintiff that she could not measure her blood sugar level. See ECF No. 43-1, at 32-33; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 55-56; 51-1, ¶¶ 8.5-8.8, 57-58; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.5-8.8.
At around 11:00 a.m., plaintiff  [**30] began feeling sick and felt it necessary to measure her blood sugar level. She was trembling and had a headache, leading her to believe that her sugar was either very high or very low. By noon, Ortiz felt that she "had to go to lunch." ECF No. 58-1, at 27; see ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 8.13-8.14; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.13-8.14.
José Carmona ("Carmona"), a Sales Associate, requested that plaintiff provide change for a cash register. Plaintiff told him that she would give him the change and then go to lunch. She began heading downstairs with Carmona. Sometime after Negrón left for lunch, plaintiff encountered Fonseca. She told Fonseca that she was not feeling well, was shaking, "c[ould]n't take it anymore," and had to take her lunch break. ECF No. 58-1, at 59. She told him that she would finish the task upon her return and that there was not much work remaining. She told him "several times" that she was feeling bad, that it was already noon, that she had been working for three or four hours, and that she had to have lunch. Id. at 30. The content of Fonseca's responses to Ortiz's  [*201]  concerns is contested. 9 See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 8.15-8.21; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.15-8.21.
After plaintiff gave Carmona the change he requested,  [**32] she accessed her personnel file to obtain her most recent medical certificate to show Fonseca. Plaintiff subsequently asked Fonseca why he had not permitted her to go to lunch even though he knew her medical condition. Fonseca told her that "he needed another person, a supervisor, a manager who was a woman" to be present. ECF No. 58-1, at 32. Ortiz brought Carmen Tañón ("Tañón") to see Fonseca, but he responded that it had to be with Negrón. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 8.25, 8.27-8.28; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.25, 8.27-8.28. 10
After leaving at 12:23 p.m., see ECF No. 35-22, plaintiff drafted a handwritten letter of resignation in her mother's car. The letter reads as follows:
Attn. Melvin Fonseca
I hereby communicate to you my decision of terminating my job with Sears Los Paseos.
This responds to the intransigency and negative attitude of my superiors with regard to my job and my health condition. In addition, that my rights are being violated.
Effective today April 5, 2010.
/s/ Jacqueline Ortiz González
Enclosed Medical  [**33] Certification
ECF No. 58-1, at 121. Plaintiff had no legal counsel assisting her at the time. Before returning to the store, plaintiff bought juice from Walgreens and drank it. After drinking the juice, plaintiff's blood sugar level was normal. See ECF Nos. 51-1, ¶¶ 8.20, 8.26, 8.31-8.32; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.20, 8.26, 8.31-8.32.
Plaintiff then returned to the store to deliver her letter of resignation. Plaintiff submitted the letter of resignation along with a copy of her recently submitted medical certificate. That day, April 5, 2010, was plaintiff's final day of work at Sears. The next day, plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor. See ECF No. 43-12; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 61, 81; 51-1, ¶¶ 8.1, 8.31-8.32, 63, 83; 63-1, ¶¶ 8.1, 8.31-8.32.

H. Vacation Liquidation Payment
Sears's payroll system requires "a complete period of inactivity of the associate for the system to have acknowledge [sic] that the associate is inactive and the system automatically then generates the liquidation." ECF No. 43-4, at 23. If the  [*202]  system "has the correct address, the associate should receive [the liquidation pay] in four weeks, more or less."  [**34] Id. at 25; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 75; 51-1, ¶ 77. 11
On April 23, 2010, plaintiff was paid her last regular paycheck, corresponding to the pay period of April 4 to 17, 2010. The check corresponding to plaintiff's accrued vacation check was issued on May 7, 2010, and arrived at the Paseos Store on May 11, 2010. On May 13, 2010, Ortiz faxed Brenda Casanova, an employee of Sears, a letter indicating the address for the check to be sent. Plaintiff deposited the check on May 24, 2010. See ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 76-80; 51-1, ¶¶ 78-82.

I. Sears Policies and Procedures on Employment Discrimination
While at Sears, plaintiff received training regarding company procedures. As part of plaintiff's Induction Training, which was conducted by Ayala, plaintiff was provided with a copy of Sears's Associates Manual and signed receipt of the same on November 11, 2005. See ECF No. 43-8; see ECF  [**35] Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 63-64; 51-1, ¶¶ 2.9, 65-66; 63-1, ¶ 2.9.
The Associates Manual includes a complaint procedure for employees who believe they are the victims of harassment. Under the procedure, an employee should explain the situation to the immediate supervisor. If the employee is not satisfied with the supervisor's response or is uncomfortable speaking with the supervisor, the employee should immediately contact the supervisor's manager or the human resources representatives. If the employee feels that insufficient attention has been given to the complaint or is uncomfortable speaking with somebody from the employee's own unit, the employee should call 1-888-88sears. See ECF No. 43-9, at 2; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 67; 51-1, ¶ 69.
As an employee of the HR Department, plaintiff was required to have knowledge of the policies against discrimination at Sears. Plaintiff was aware of the company's policy prohibiting harassment in the work place and the procedure for presenting a complaint, including the availability of a hotline. The company's computer training system assigns trainings depending on an employee's position. The system then generates a report for the trainings taken by the employee.  [**36] The annual Training Schedule includes training on several topics, including policies and procedures. Plaintiff received Induction Training and training on Sears's Code of Conduct. Plaintiff, however, did not call the Human Resources hotline because she "did not feel confident" that it would remain confidential. ECF No. 43-1, at 75; see ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶¶ 68-69, 71-74; 51-1, ¶¶ 70-71, 73-76.

II. Legal Standard
The purpose of summary judgment "is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required." Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992). Summary judgment is granted when the record shows that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "'A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party. A fact is material if it has the  [*203]  potential of determining the outcome of the litigation.'" Farmers Ins. Exch. v. RNK, Inc., 632 F.3d 777, 782 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Rodríguez-Rivera v. Federico Trilla Reg'l Hosp., 532 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 2008)).
The  [**37] party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant presents a properly focused motion "averring 'an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case[,]' [t]he burden then shifts to the nonmovant to establish the existence of at least one fact issue which is both 'genuine' and 'material.'" Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Garside v. Osco Drug., Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990)). For issues where the nonmoving party bears the ultimate burden of proof, that party cannot merely "rely on the absence of competent evidence, but must affirmatively point to specific facts" in the record "that demonstrate the existence of an authentic dispute." McCarthy v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir. 1995). The plaintiff need not, however, "rely on uncontradicted evidence .... So long as the plaintiff's evidence is both cognizable and sufficiently strong to support a verdict in her favor, the factfinder must be allowed to determine which version of the facts is most compelling." Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004)  [**38] (emphasis in original).
In assessing a motion for summary judgment, the court "must view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor." Griggs-Ryan, 904 F.2d at 115 (citations omitted). There is "no room for credibility determinations, no room for the measured weighing of conflicting evidence such as the trial process entails, [and] no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood ...." Greenburg v. P. R. Mar. Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987). The court may, however, safely ignore "conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation." Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).

III. Analysis

A. Individual Liability under ADA and Law 44
The First Circuit "agree[s] with the virtually universal view that Title I of the ADA, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 'addresses the conduct of employers only and does not impose liability on co-workers.'" Román-Oliveras v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth., 655 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Fantini v. Salem State Coll., 557 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 2009)  [**39] (internal quotation omitted)). With respect to Law 44, although "[t]he Puerto Rico Supreme Court has yet to rule on the question of individual liability under Law 44," "[c]ourts have consistently held that there is no individual liability under [the same]." Cardona Román v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 799 F. Supp. 2d 120, 131 (D.P.R. 2011). Because neither Title I of the ADA nor Law 44 provides for individual liability, the claims against Negrón and Fonseca under said statutes should be dismissed.

B. Failure-to-Promote and Retaliation Claims
Defendants argue that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies in connection with her failure-to-promote claim and that said claim is time-barred. ECF No. 36, at 5-6 (citing ECF No. 1,  [*204]  ¶¶ 4.9-4.11). In response, plaintiff contends that her failure-to-promote claim was "not present[ed] ... as a separate claim," but rather was "included ... only to provide a factual context for understanding the dynamics at the workplace once Negrón began to supervise plaintiff after receiving training from Ms. Ortiz ... and thereafter created an environment which was hostile to plaintiff's health needs." ECF No. 51, 7-8. "[I]ncidents apparently fall[ing] outside  [**40] the limitations period ... can be used as 'background evidence' to support [plaintiffs'] timely claims." Rodríguez v. Municipality of San Juan, 659 F.3d 168, 177 n.5 (1st Cir. 2011) (First Amendment context). Such incidents "do[] not provide a basis for damages," but they "shed light on the impact of [defendants'] later [conduct]." Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 553 F.3d 121, 142 (1st Cir. 2009) (context of antidiscrimination statutes, including ADA); see also Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). As such, defendants' request to dismiss plaintiff's failure-to-promote claim should be found moot. Facts pertaining to an alleged failure to promote shall be analyzed, not as a separate claim, but, if relevant, within the context of plaintiff's other claims.
According to defendants, plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Nevertheless, plaintiff states that she is "not raising a separate claim of retaliation." ECF No. 51, at 15. Thus, defendants' request to dismiss plaintiff's claim of retaliation should also be found moot. To the extent that evidence otherwise pertaining to a retaliation claim is relevant to the analysis  [**41] of plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge claims, it shall be analyzed within such contexts.

C. Failure-to-Accommodate Claim
The definition of discrimination under the ADA includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the] covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [entity's] business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" includes "[m]odifications or adjustments ... to the manner or circumstances under which the position ... is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). "A 'reasonable accommodation' is one which would enable the plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job and at least on the face of things is feasible for the employer under the circumstances." Mulloy v. Acushnet Co., 460 F.3d 141, 148 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2001)).  [**42] In order to survive a motion for summary judgment on a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA, "'a plaintiff ordinarily must furnish significantly probative evidence that he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the applicable statute; that he works (or worked) for an employer whom the ADA covers; that the employer, despite knowing of the employee's physical or mental limitations, did not reasonably accommodate those limitations; and that the employer's failure to do so affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of the plaintiffs employment.'" Gómez-González v. Rural Opportunities, Inc., 626 F.3d 654, 664 (1st Cir. 2010).
Plaintiff has submitted evidence of her requests for accommodation. Evidence has been presented that plaintiff disclosed  [*205]  her diabetes condition to Ayala on two occasions: during her pre-employment interview and when plaintiff began at the Paseos Store. On the first occasion, plaintiff explained that she needed to take breaks in order to monitor her blood sugar levels or ingest food, to leave if she felt ill, and "to eat at specific hours," but that her breaks would have to depend on her blood sugar level on any given day. ECF No.  [**43] 51-3, at 9. Ayala told plaintiff about Sears's scheduled breaks and indicated that, if plaintiff needed more, she could talk with her manager, who would refer the issue to the "Human Resources Manager." Id. at 10. On the second occasion, plaintiff told Ayala, who then was her supervisor, about her need to monitor her blood sugar level, eat snacks if it was too low, and inject insulin, and how to proceed if she fainted. Plaintiff also told Negrón that she needed to take breaks to eat, check her blood sugar, and go to the restroom frequently. Fonseca was aware that plaintiff needed to monitor her blood sugar, administer insulin, and take breaks. The first medical certificate provided to Sears, dated October 31, 2005, indicates that plaintiff "requires eating at her times." ECF No. 43-3, at 1. 12 The second medical certificate, dated March 23, 2010, states that plaintiff "requires strict diet and blood sugar monitoring" and that her "uncontrolled blood sugar ... requires special treatment and attention." ECF No. 35-21.
In support of her contention that defendants failed to accommodate her disability, plaintiff presents evidence pertaining to "negative attitude" by Negrón or Fonseca, ECF No. 58-1, at 61, Negrón's following plaintiff to the restroom, the assignment of the task of sign transmission, reduction of plaintiff's hours, the PPI, and the alleged delays in processing payments relating to sick leave and vacation liquidation.  [**45] Nevertheless, in the areas encompassed by plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation—using the restroom, measuring her blood sugar levels, and ingesting food—there is no evidence that, aside from April 5, 2010, plaintiff was ever prohibited from accomplishing such tasks. Plaintiff admits the proposed fact that "every time plaintiff had to go to the bathroom, measure her blood-sugar or do anything else related to her condition, she was, in fact able to do so." ECF Nos. 35-1, ¶ 60; 51-1, ¶ 62. Plaintiff also "admit[s] that that the only time that she was specifically prohibited from taking time to ingest food was on April 5, 2010." Id. ¶ 60. 13 As such,  [*206]  while the facts outlined above may relate to a potential hostile work environment or constructive discharge claim, they do not constitute failures to provide accommodations requested by plaintiff. "[T]he alleged harassment is actionable under the ADA, but not under a 'reasonable accommodation' analysis." Haysman v. Food Lion, Inc., 893 F. Supp. 1092, 1106 (S.D. Ga. 1995); see also, e.g., Gunderson v. Neiman-Marcus Grp., Inc., 982 F. Supp. 1231, 1235 (N.D. Tex. 1997) (analyzing evidence that plaintiff's superiors "questioned her  [**46] regularly concerning her work restrictions ... in a less than cordial manner or ma[king] skeptical or sarcastic remarks in response to her answers" as a hostile work environment claim and finding no hostile work environment). It is not readily apparent that any of the aforementioned facts, taken as true, would constitute a failure to afford plaintiff with reasonable "[m]odifications or adjustments ... to the manner or circumstances under which [her] position ... is customarily performed, that [would] enable [plaintiff] to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). Thus, the only instance of an alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation occurred on April 5, 2010.
Ultimately, plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim should be dismissed because no reasonable jury can conclude that defendants failed to reasonably accommodate her disability on April 5, 2010. On what ended up being plaintiff's last day of work, sometime after 11:58 a.m., she and Fonseca engaged in a conversation wherein she requested "several times" to leave for lunch because she was not feeling well, indicating that she would finish her assigned task of reconciliation of the cash registers afterwards. ECF No. 58-1, at 30. According to plaintiff, Fonseca initially responded to her requests, "You are not going to lunch,  [**48] when you finish balancing out the cash registers you can go." Id. at 59. Fonseca subsequently indicated, "[W]ell, do whatever you want," and left. Id. at 31. After giving Carmona change, accessing her personnel file, approaching Fonseca again in an attempt to converse, and bringing Tañón in another attempt to converse with Fonseca, plaintiff left. All of this took place over the course of twenty-five minutes or less. See ECF No. 35-10, at 29.
Plaintiff contends that "[i]t is certainly quite a leap ... to posit that th[e] evidence supports only one inference—that Ortiz was given permission to leave on lunch break." ECF No. 51, at 29. Nevertheless, plaintiff herself testified that Fonseca told her, "[W]ell, do whatever you want," and continued walking. ECF No. 58-1, at 31. Plaintiff subsequently left at 12:23 p.m. These facts clearly lead to the conclusion that Fonseca relented from his previous position allegedly prohibiting plaintiff from leaving for lunch. 14 It is not a reasonable inference that Fonseca continued to prohibit plaintiff from taking her lunch break. Even if Fonseca stated multiple times over the course of his conversation  [*207]  with plaintiff that "[she] c[ould] go" to lunch  [**49] "when [she] finish[ed] balancing out the cash registers," id. at 59, plaintiff's account of said conversation indicates that Fonseca no longer disallowed her from leaving by the end of the conversation. Within the very same exchange with plaintiff, Fonseca withdrew his prohibition on leaving for lunch.
Ultimately, plaintiff has not presented "cognizable and sufficiently strong" evidence, Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19, that the exchange leading up to Fonseca's concession was an "unreasonable delay[] in identifying and implementing reasonable accommodations ... constitut[ing] a lack of good faith for purposes of the interactive process ...." Crutcher v. Mobile Hous. Bd., Civ. No. 04-0499-WS-M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35402, 2005 WL 2675207, at *12 (S.D. Ala. Oct. 20, 2005). Although an "unreasonable delay may amount to a failure to provide reasonable accommodations," Valle-Arce v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 651 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir. 2011), where an employer "effectively short-circuit[s]  [**50] the interactive process," Astralis Condo. Ass'n v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban Dev., 620 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir. 2010), or "simply stonewall[s]" the process, Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 25, the record evidence in this case, as submitted to the court, does not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that such an unreasonable delay occurred here. 15 The uncontroverted evidence indicates that, over the course of the approximately five years that plaintiff worked for Sears, she was never denied a single request to use the restroom, measure her blood sugar level, take time to eat, or do anything else related to her condition, except that, on April 5, 2010, her lunch break was delayed no longer than twenty-five minutes. 16 Plaintiff has failed to present evidence such that a jury could conclude that a twenty-five-minute delay in taking her lunch break constituted an unreasonable course of action for purposes of the accommodation recommended by her physicians. See ECF Nos. 43-3, at 1; 35-21. Plaintiff was still permitted to "eat[ her lunch] at her times," ECF No. 43-3, at 1, considering that she was able to leave for lunch at 12:23 p.m., within a half hour after she initially requested to  [**51] leave—well within the one-hour period of time permitted by Sears for lunch breaks. Furthermore, plaintiff has provided no evidence that her condition was aggravated by the twenty-five-minute delay in taking her lunch break. Rather, it is uncontroverted that, after plaintiff drank juice, she measured her blood sugar level and it was normal. See Edlund v. St. Anthony Med. Ctr., No. 00 C 50216, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7248, 2002 WL 596358, at *5 n.2 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 16, 2002) (granting defendant's motion for summary judgment even where plaintiff presented evidence that, on eight different occasions, her supervisor "refused to allow her to immediately check her blood sugar level, but instead made her wait anywhere from five minutes to an hour to do so," because, inter alia, no reasonable inference could be made that "the delays caused her to  [*208]  experience hypoglycemic reactions" and plaintiff "ha[d] not pointed out any evidence showing the delays in checking her blood sugar level on those eight occasions affected her physically or in any way interfered with her ability to do her job"). Under such circumstances, no reasonable jury can determine that Fonseca failed to reasonably accommodate her disability on April 5, 2010.  [**52] 17 Although his approach to the situation on April 5, 2010, may reflect a lack of prudence and constitute unprofessional or even rude conduct, it does not rise to the level of a failure to provide reasonable accommodation pursuant to the ADA.
Plaintiff also argues that Fonseca's refusal to communicate with her further about his refusal to let her go to lunch until Negrón was present constitutes a failure to engage in an interactive process with her as required by the ADA. Nevertheless, it is not a reasonable inference that Fonseca was fully refusing to discuss plaintiff's requests for accommodation, merely that he did not want to talk about it until Negrón was present. See Gerton v. Verizon S. Inc., 145 F. App'x 159, 168 (6th Cir. 2005) ("[Plaintiff] has not cited any authority to support her argument that an employer must 'immediately' act on an accommodation request by an employee."). Plaintiff herself testified that Fonseca did not want to talk with her "at any time unless [Negrón] was there." ECF No. 58-1, 32. Moreover, as discussed above, plaintiff was eventually permitted to leave for lunch. Although, under certain circumstances, "it may  [**54] be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation" in order "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation," 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3), plaintiff on April 5, 2010, was indeed allowed the accommodation she requested. See Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 109 (1st Cir. 2005) ("This is not an instance where the employer ... simply rejected any request for accommodation without further discussion.... [Defendant] provided [plaintiff] with multiple accommodations."). Because no reasonable jury can determine that defendants failed to provide reasonable accommodation for plaintiff's disability, her failure-to-accommodate claim should be dismissed.

D. Hostile Work Environment and Constructive Discharge Claims
At least five circuits recognize claims of hostile work environment as actionable under the ADA. See Rodríguez-Fonseca v. Baxter Healthcare Corp. of Puerto Rico, 899 F. Supp. 2d 141, 152 (D.P.R. 2012). In order to establish a claim of hostile work environment under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove the following: "'(1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he  [**55] was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his disability; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) some factual basis exists to impute liability for the harassment to the employer.'" Id. (quoting Fox v. Gen. Motors Corp., 247 F.3d 169, 177 (4th Cir. 2001)). To establish a claim of constructive discharge, a plaintiff "must make a further showing ... that the abusive working environment became so intolerable  [*209]  that her resignation qualified as a fitting response." Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 134, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004) (Title VII context); see also Méndez-Martínez v. Caribbean Alliance Ins. Co., 851 F. Supp. 2d 336, 371 & n.5 (D.P.R. 2012). "Lest there be any doubt, the second standard sets the higher bar." Dykstra v. First Student, Inc., 324 F. Supp. 2d 54, 67 (D. Me. 2004).
Even if a plaintiff establishes prima facie cases of hostile work environment and constructive discharge, however, an employer may assert a defense under the Faragher-Ellerth doctrine. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998). 18 "The  [**56] defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Reed v. MBNA Mktg. Sys., Inc., 333 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2003). Summary judgment on these two elements is only appropriate where "no reasonable jury could decide [either of the issues] in the plaintiffs favor." Id. at 34.
Plaintiff makes two  [**57] preliminary arguments against the applicability of the Faragher-Ellerth defense. First, plaintiff contends that an employer may not rely on the defense when "the offenders, themselves, are high-level supervisors whose conduct is plainly imputable to the company." ECF No. 51, at 13. In support, plaintiff cites the portion of Faragher which states that "[a]n employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee." 524 U.S. at 807. This, however, does not indicate that an employer is automatically subject to liability merely upon a finding that an employee has been subject to a hostile environment created by her supervisor. Rather, the Faragher-Ellerth defense applies precisely when there has been alleged harassment by a supervisor. See Suders, 542 U.S. at 143 & n.6 ("Our starting point is the framework Ellerth and Faragher established to govern employer liability for sexual harassment by supervisors.... Ellerth and Faragher expressed no view on the employer liability standard for co-worker harassment." (emphasis added)). As such, the mere fact  [**58] that the alleged harassers in this case retained supervisory authority over plaintiff does not preclude the application of the Faragher-Ellerth defense. 19
 [*210]  Second, plaintiff contends that the Faragher-Ellerth defense does not apply in this case because there has been a tangible employment action, in the form of plaintiff's alleged constructive discharge. "No affirmative defense is available ... when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion,  [**59] or undesirable reassignment." Faragher, 524 U.S. at 808. A constructive discharge, however, "is not a per se 'tangible employment action.'" Arrieta-Colón v. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc., 434 F.3d 75, 86 (1st Cir. 2006); see Suders 542 U.S. at 152 (rejecting the proposition that the Faragher-Ellerth defense is "never available in constructive discharge cases"). A tangible employment action is "an 'official act,' that is, 'an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing [the employee's] employment status or situation, for example, a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which [the employee] would face unbearable working conditions.'" Arrieta-Colón, 434 F.3d at 87 (quoting Suders, 542 U.S. at 131, 134); see also Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761 ("A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status ....").
No evidence of such an official act has been brought to the attention of the court. For instance, plaintiff's PPI does not qualify as a tangible employment action. See Conatzer v. Med. Prof'l Bldg. Servs. Corp., 95 F. App'x 276, 280 (10th Cir. 2004) (holding that a reprimand not "accompanied by suspension, loss or reduction  [**60] of pay, or loss of benefits" did not constitute a tangible employment action for purposes of Faragher-Ellerth defense); cf. Bhatti v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 659 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 2011) (holding reprimands without "any tangible consequences" not to be materially adverse actions in the context of a Title VII retaliation claim). Although plaintiff contends that she had to submit a sick leave request form "two or three times" with respect to her absence of 2.05 hours on March 23, 2010, ECF No. 58-1, at 52, she was indeed paid for 2.05 hours of sick leave for said day on the Friday following the end of the relevant pay period. 20 As such, no reasonable jury could conclude that she received an "extreme cut in pay" rising to the level of a tangible employment action. Suders, 542 U.S. at 134. Similarly, no evidence has been presented indicating that any delay connected with plaintiff's liquidation pay following her resignation "exceeded that attributable to general workplace bureaucracy or administrative processing," particularly in light of Negrón's uncontroverted testimony regarding the processing of such payments within Sears's system. Colón-Fontanez v. Municipality of San Juan, 660 F.3d 17, 39 (1st Cir. 2011).  [**61] Nor does  [*211]  the assignment of the task of sign transmission, transferred to the HR Department early in 2010, constitute a tangible employment action. Although the task of sign transmission was a new task for employees within the HR Department, no evidence has been presented that plaintiff's duties as a whole increased over the course of Negrón's tenure as HR Lead. See Reinhold v. Com. of Va., 151 F.3d 172, 175 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding the assignment of "extra work" not to constitute "a 'tangible employment action'"); Loudermilk v. Stillwater Milling Co., 551 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1289 (N.D. Okla. 2008) (holding that "assignment to various undesirable work tasks is not a 'tangible employment action,'" even where "unpleasant and perhaps unfairly imposed"); cf. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761 (providing "reassignment with significantly different responsibilities" (emphasis added) as an example of a tangible employment action).
The alleged decrease in plaintiff's hours in this case also does not constitute a tangible employment action. In support of her contention that her hours were reduced, plaintiff selects as primary points of comparison the periods of January 3 to February 6, 2010, and February 14 and April 3, 2010. On average, plaintiff's weekly hours reduced from 16.6 to approximately 13.6. Nevertheless, no context has been provided regarding weekly schedules under previous supervisors. No evidence has been presented pertaining to the availability of the employee's primary coworker—Quiñones—over the same time periods. Moreover, no effect on the employee's other benefits has been shown. Under such circumstances, no reasonable jury cannot  [**63] find that a reduction in an employee's average weekly schedule by approximately three hours constitutes a significant change in her employment status, particularly when the only schedules made available to the court indicate oft-fluctuating hours. See Day v. Advance Stores Co., Inc., 1:09-CV-664, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30186, 2010 WL 1286666, at *7 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 29, 2010) (finding alleged harassment, including "reducing Plaintiff's hours," not to "rise to the level of tangible employment actions" for purposes of Faragher-Ellerth defense); Taylor v. CSX Transp., 418 F. Supp. 2d 1284, 1300 (M.D. Ala. 2006) ("The court ... is not convinced that the change in her work schedule between October 16, 2003, the date she reported the harassment, and November 25, 2003, rises to the level of a tangible employment action."); cf. Cham v. Station Operators, Inc., 685 F.3d 87, 94-95 (1st Cir. 2012) (finding that a "loss of three shifts during the weeks encompassing Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas" and an additional "one-week reduction" in May were not adverse employment actions, particularly "in the context of a workplace where schedules fluctuate and no employee is entitled to any given shift"). 21 None of the evidence  [**64] presented by plaintiff in the instant case constitutes  [*212]  a significant change in her employment status for purposes of the Faragher-Ellerth defense.
With respect to the merits of the Faragher-Ellerth defense, defendants contend  [**65] that they have proven both elements. In this case, it is uncontested that Sears has an Associates Manual, which details a complaint procedure for employees who believe they are victims of harassment. See ECF No. 43-9, at 2. Plaintiff was provided with a copy of the Associates Manual and signed receipt of the same. She testified that, as an HR employee, she was required to have knowledge regarding Sears's policies against discrimination. She was aware of the company's policy prohibiting harassment, the complaint procedure, and the availability of a hotline.
The only record evidence presented for plaintiff's failure to engage Sears's complaint procedure is that she "did not feel confident" that it would remain confidential. ECF No. 43-1, at 75. Certainly, "[r]eporting ... offensive conduct by a supervisor" may be "uncomfortable, scary or both." Reed, 333 F.3d at 35. Nevertheless, under "normal circumstances," an employee must "make this painful effort if the employee wants to impose vicarious liability on the employer and collect damages under [the ADA]." Id. (Title VII context) (emphasis in original). In other words, "more than ordinary fear or embarrassment is needed." Id. Here, plaintiff  [**66] has presented no evidence of anything more than ordinary inconvenience and skepticism to explain her failure to pursue Sears's specified complaint procedure.
Plaintiff claims that she did not "unreasonably fail[] to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Id. at 32. Although the incident is contested, plaintiff testified that, sometime in 2010, she told Juan Medero ("Medero"), one of the store managers, that she "want[ed] to speak about [a concern] with [Fonseca]" and that she "want[ed] [Medero] to be present so that [he] c[ould] be aware of it." ECF No. 58-1, at 69. 22 She also told him about Negrón's "hostility towards [her]" and that Negrón "had reduced [her] hours on the job." ECF No. 51-2, ¶ 14. Plaintiff told him, "Look, there's discomfort, there are attitudes, they're asking me to do a job that doesn't belong to my department." ECF No. 68-1, at 4. She also mentioned her PPI. Medero told plaintiff that "there wasn't any problem" and that "he was going to be with [her] when [she] had to speak with [Fonseca]." Id. She asked Fonseca to meet, but "[they] never met." Id. 23
As an initial matter, an employee need not follow a company's formal complaint procedure in order for a jury to conclude that she exercised reasonable care for purposes of the second element of the Faragher-Ellerth defense. See Agusty-Reyes v. Dep't of Educ. of Puerto Rico, 601 F.3d 45, 56 (1st Cir. 2010) ("A jury could easily reject the [defendant]'s apparent position that no reports of harassment short of formal notice of sexual assault are sufficient to satisfy an employee's obligation under Faragher-Ellerth's second prong."); see also Morales-Díaz v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth.,  [*213]  899 F. Supp. 2d 170, 178 (D.P.R. 2012); Talavera-Ibarrondo v. Municipality of San Sebastian, 824 F. Supp. 2d 254, 262 (D.P.R. 2011); but see Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 21 (1st Cir. 2002) ("Th[e second] prong is usually  [**68] addressed by proof that the plaintiff unreasonably ignored an established complaint procedure."). The issue is whether an employee has "ma[d]e 'reasonable' use of the reporting procedures provided by her employers." Agusty-Reyes, 601 F.3d at 56.
It is not necessary, however, to reach the question of whether plaintiff's conversation with Medero constitutes reasonable use of Sears's reporting procedures, because there is no evidence that said conversation involved plaintiff's disability. The ADA, like Title VII, "is neither a civility code nor a general anti-harassment code." Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe Inc., 354 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2003). Plaintiff's testimony regarding her conversation with Medero—even if it is afforded full controlling weight—does not indicate that her "concern" about Fonseca, ECF No. 58-1, at 69, or "Negrón's hostility towards [plaintiff]," ECF No. 51-2, ¶ 14, were on the basis of disability—or any other protected category, for that matter. No evidence has been presented to the court that Medero was even aware that plaintiff had diabetes or any other condition. Cf. Ortiz v. Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Hotel, Inc., 422 F. Supp. 2d 336, 345 (D.P.R. 2006)  [**69] (finding that defendant "did not know nor had reason to know of the alleged harassment" where "even though [plaintiff] might have informed her supervisors of 'being bothered' she never outright complained of sexual harassment to these supervisors until ... the eve of being transferred to the night shift").
Plaintiff lastly argues that "[i]t is ... obvious that with respect to the final incident—when Ortiz's life was literally in danger—filing an internal complaint at Sears would not have offered any relief." ECF No. 51, at 13. It is not readily apparent why this would be the case. Plaintiff has submitted no evidence that, after plaintiff drank juice and checked her blood sugar level on April 5, 2010, she could not initiate an internal complaint with Sears. In fact, it is uncontested that, on the very next day, she filed a complaint before the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor. The factfinder has not been placed in a position to conclude that plaintiff was prevented from filing an internal complaint. Moreover, as discussed above, aside from plaintiff's "ordinary fear," Reed, 333 F.3d at 35, unsupported by any other record evidence, that a formal complaint  [**70] would not remain confidential, there is no indication that a complaint concerning Fonseca's conduct would be futile or result in adverse consequences. See id. at 36 ("Claims of futility or adverse consequences have to be 'credible.'" (internal citation omitted)). Thus, as no reasonable jury could determine that defendants have not established both prongs of the Faragher-Ellerth defense, plaintiff's hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims should be dismissed. 24

E. Supplemental Claims
Plaintiff has also alleged claims of disability discrimination under Law 44 and wrongful discharge under Law  [*214]  80. Federal courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a plaintiff's state law claims when the federal claims that gave it original jurisdiction are dismissed.  [**71] See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); González-De-Blasini v. Family Dept., 377 F.3d 81, 89 (1st Cir. 2004); Camelio v. Am. Fed'n, 137 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir. 1998). If all federal claims are dismissed prior to trial, then the state law claims "'should be dismissed as well.'" Rodríguez v. Doral Mortg. Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966)). Because federal question jurisdiction is alleged in this case, rather than diversity jurisdiction, see ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 2.1-2.4, plaintiff's claims under Puerto Rico law should be dismissed.

IV. Conclusion
It is hereby recommended that defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 35) be GRANTED. Plaintiff's claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act with respect to all defendants, along with her claims under Puerto Rico Law 44 against defendants Melvin Fonseca and Melissa Negrón, should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Plaintiff's remaining claims under Puerto Rico law, however, should be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
Pursuant to the order of the court (ECF No. 71), the parties have five (5) business days to file any objections to this report and recommendation.  [**72] Failure to file same within the specified time waives the right to appeal this report and recommendation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2); Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(c)(1)(B); D.P.R. Civ. R. 72(d); see also 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-51 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Valencia, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986).
