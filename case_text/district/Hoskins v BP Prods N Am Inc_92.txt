CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS ORDER Re: Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [24]

I. INTRODUCTION
On January 25, 2013, Edsel Hoskins ("Plaintiff" or "Hoskins") filed a complaint against his former employer, BP Products North America, Inc. ("BP" or "Defendant"). (Dkt 1). The complaint sets forth claims of: (1) disability discrimination, (2) retaliation, (3) failure to engage in the interactive process, (4) failure to accommodate, and (5) wrongful termination, all under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code § 12940 et seq. The complaint includes a sixth claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (Id.). On September 20, 2013, BP filed a motion for summary judgement. (Dkt. 24). After review, the Court GRANTS BP's motion.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Hoskins worked as an operator at BP's Carson, California refinery. (Hoskins Decl., ¶ 2). On April 24, 2012, he obtained a medical note from his personal doctor, Dr. Rafaelito Victoria, requesting that he be excused from work until May 13, 2012 due to stress  [*2] and anxiety experienced in the workplace. (Meer Decl., Ex. D). BP granted Hoskins' request for a leave of absence. When his leave was set to expire, Hoskins met with Dr. Victoria again, who wrote a second note, requesting that Hoskins' leave be extended until June 10, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. E). BP granted the extension. Two more times BP extended Hoskins' leave of absence based on additional notes from Dr. Victoria—first granting an extension until August 26, 2012, and then until September 23, 2012. (Meer Decl., Exs. F, ).
Dr. Victoria's medical notes were sent to BP in compliance with BP's absence control policy. (SUF ¶ 26). Under that policy, an employee is required to provide a doctor's note covering time away from work for illness or injury that extends beyond four shifts. (SUF ¶ 6). The note needs to specify the date the illness or injury occurred, the dates the employee is unable to work, and an anticipated date of return to work. (Id.). If an extension is required, the employee is obligated to provide an updated note no later than the day the prior note expires. (Id. ¶ 7). If the employee's approved absence expires and the employee fails to submit an additional note within three  [*3] days, the absence policy states that the employee's continued absence will be deemed a voluntary resignation. (Id. ¶ 8). BP's absence policy was first put in place in 2008, and Hoskins was familiar with the policy. (Id. ¶¶ 9, 26).
Concurrent with his leave of absence for stress and anxiety, on May 2, 2012, Hoskins filed a workers' compensation claim for orthopedic injuries to his back, feet, and knees allegedly suffered at work. (Haag Decl., Ex. 2). On May 25, 2012, Hoskins saw Dr. Quesada at Pacific Coast Spine & Orthopaedic Group for these orthopedic injuries. (Id., Ex. 4). After an examination, Dr. Quesada concluded that it was medically reasonable that Hoskins sustained his orthopedic injuries at work. (Id., Ex. 4, at 9). Dr. Quesada included this finding in a report, which also noted that Hoskins was temporarily totally disabled because of his orthopedic injuries, that Hoskins was unable to return to his usual and customary job duties at that time, and that a further evaluation would be conducted in four to six weeks. (Id.). Hoskins met with Dr. Quesada again on July 6, September 27, and November 15, 2012. (Id., Exs. 5-8). Each time Dr. Quesada concluded that Hoskins was still  [*4] temporarily totally disabled and that a further evaluation would be conducted in four to six weeks. (Id.). Dr. Quesada sent each of his reports on Hoskins to ESIS, Inc., BP's workers' compensation insurer. (Id., Exs. 4-8). Hoskins was under the impression that Dr. Quesada's reports were also being submitted to BP; however, BP states that it never received the reports and the evidence only shows that the reports were sent to ESIS. (Hoskins Decl., ¶¶ 18-19; Haag Decl., Exs. 5-8). There is also no evidence that BP told Hoskins that it could submit medical notes for purposes of the absence policy to ESIS.
While Hoskins was under the care of Dr. Quesada for his orthopedic injuries, he eventually stopped seeing Dr. Victoria.1 As a result, the last medical note written by Dr. Victoria excusing Hoskins from work expired on September 23, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. G). After that date, Hoskins fell out of compliance with BP's absence policy given that the medical notes from Dr. Victoria were the only notes BP had received on Hoskins' behalf.
On October 30, 2012, BP sent Hoskins a letter, stating that since September 23, 2012—the date Dr. Victoria's last note expired—he had not been in compliance with BP's absence policy. (Meer Decl., Ex. H). The letter reminded Hoskins of the policy, and stated that he had until November 9, 2012 to provide a doctor's note covering his absence, or BP would consider his absence job abandonment. (Id.).2
By November 8, 2012, BP still had not heard from Hoskins. On that day, Michelle D'Orio, one of BP's human resource advisors, sent an email to Scott Fife, a safety manager at BP, inquiring into whether there was any workers' compensation justification for Hoskins' continued absence. (Haag Decl., Ex. 15). Mr. Fife responded that there was nothing BP's doctors had identified that would prevent Hoskins from returning to work.3 (Id.). The next day, on November 9, 2012, Ms. D'Orio called Hoskins and asked why he had not returned to work or submitted a doctor's note excusing his continued absence. (Hoskins Decl., ¶ 25). Hoskins told D'Orio that Dr. Quesada was treating him for orthopedic injuries through the workers' compensation case, and that Hoskins was under the impression that Dr. Quesada had been sending his medical reports  [*7] to BP. (Id. ¶ 25). In response, Ms. D'Orio told Hoskins that his workers' compensation claim had been denied. (SUF ¶¶ 18). She also told Hoskins that BP would not accept doctor's notes from his workers' compensation doctor. (Id. ¶ 19).4 Hoskins asked Ms. D'Orio if BP would accept a doctor's note from Dr. Victoria, extending his leave of absence. (AMF ¶ 20). Ms. D'Orio replied that BP would accept a note from Dr. Victoria, so long as Hoskins provided BP with the note by November 13, 2012. (Id.).
On November 12, 2012, Hoskins met with Dr. Victoria, who wrote a note extending his medical leave until November 14, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. J).5 Hoskins asked Dr. Victoria's receptionist if she could fax the note to BP. (AMF ¶ 22). Although Hoskins was under the impression that the fax was sent, it was later determined that the fax was sent to the wrong number. (Id. ¶ 25). As a result, BP did not receive the November 12, 2012 note from Dr. Victoria. (SUF ¶¶ 22-23). Hoskins continued to remain off work, and on November 20, 2012, he learned that BP had terminated his employment. (AMF ¶ 24). Hoskins then called Ms. D'Orio, who told him that BP had not received the November 12, 2012 note. (Id.).

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56(c) requires summary judgment for the moving party when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows that there is no genuine issue  [*9] as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Tarin v. County of Los Angeles, 123 F.3d 1259, 1263 (9th Cir.1997).
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). This burden may be satisfied by "'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 325. If the moving party fails to meet its initial burden, summary judgment must be denied and the court need not consider the nonmoving party's evidence. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).
If the moving party meets its initial burden, Rule 56(e) requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and identify specific facts—by affidavits or as otherwise provided in the rule—that show a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The nonmoving party cannot avoid summary judgment by relying solely on conclusory allegations that are. unsupported by factual data. See Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989).  [*10] A scintilla of evidence or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative does not present a genuine issue of material fact. Addisu v. Fred Meyer, 198 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir. 2000). Only genuine disputes "where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party" over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA

1. Legal Standard
Hoskins asserts that BP terminated him because of his disability—which is prohibited under FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a) ("It is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer, . . . because of physical disability [or] mental disability . . . to discharge the person from employment . . . ."). In evaluating FEHA discrimination claims on summary judgement, California courts apply the burden-shifting test outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000).
Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing  [*11] by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of improper discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. To establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he belongs in a protected class; (2) he was preforming according to his employer's legitimate expectations; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive, such as other employees with qualifications similar to his own being treated more favorably, or that other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action gives rise to an inference of discrimination. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355 (citing Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)); Hawn v. Executive Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010).
If plaintiff succeeds in proving a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56. If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must attack the employer's asserted reasons as a pretext for discrimination or offer other evidence  [*12] of discriminatory motive. Id. at 356. Pretext cannot be shown by "merely denying the credibility of the employer's proffered reasons." Munoz v. Mabus, 630 F.3d 856, 865 (9th Cir.2010). The plaintiff may establish pretext "'either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1062 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256). If the plaintiff offers direct evidence of pretext, "a triable issue as to the actual motivation of the employer is created even if the evidence is not substantial." Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1128 (9th Cir. 2000). Where direct evidence is unavailable, however, circumstantial evidence to show pretext must be both "specific and substantial." Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1062.

2. Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
In its motion for summary judgement, BP proceeds directly to the second step of McDonnell Douglas to justify its action. As such, the Court does not need to resolve whether Hoskins made a prima facie showing of discrimination  [*13] at this juncture. See Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 357, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (declining to rule on whether the prima facie burden under McDonnell Douglas was established on a motion for summary judgment because the issue could be resolved based on the defendant's proffered non-discriminatory reasons).

3. BP's Nondiscriminatory Reason for Hoskins' Termination
BP asserts that it terminated Hoskins' employment because he failed to comply with BP's leave of absence policy, not because of his disability. The record contains ample evidence in support of this contention. It is undisputed that BP had an absence notification policy that required employees to provide doctors' notes for absences from work related to illness or injury. (SUF ¶ 6). Hoskins was familiar with this policy, and complied with it during the first five months of his leave.6 (Id. 9, 26; Meer Decl., Exs. D-G). Dr. Victoria sent BP four doctor's notes on Hoskins' behalf, covering his leave of absence from April 24, 2012 until September 23, 2012. (Id.).
When BP did not receive additional notes covering Hoskins' absence after September 23, 2012, it sent him a letter on October 30, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. H). The letter explained that BP did not have any medical documentation on file extending his medical leave of absence, and that it was a requirement of his employment to provide medical notes supporting his leave. (Id.). In accordance with BP's  [*15] leave policy, the letter also reminded Hoskins that a failure to provide appropriate and timely documentation could be considered job abandonment. (Id.). The letter gave Hoskins until November 9, 2012 to submit a new doctor's note. (Id.). BP then enforced its deadline, calling Hoskins on November 9, 2012 and asking why he had not returned to work or submitted an additional doctor's note. (AMF ¶¶ 16-18). The undisputed evidence shows that although BP gave Hoskins an additional extension to submit a note, until November 13, 2012, that BP did not obtain a doctor's note from Hoskins by that date. (SUF ¶¶ 12-13). Shortly thereafter, Hoskins learned that BP had terminated his employment—on November 20, 2012. (AMF ¶ 24).
Courts have recognized that the violation of a company policy is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating an employee. See, e.g., Dumas v. New United Motor Mfg., Inc., 305 Fed. Appx. 445, 448 (9th Cir.2008) (finding that an employer had offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating an employee who failed to appear at work for six days and did not obtain a leave of absence as required by the employer's collective bargaining agreement); Elmore v. New Albertson's, Inc., No. CV 11-04802-ODW (JCx), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115994, 2012 WL 3542537, *4 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2012) [*16]  ("Albertson's has provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for [plaintiff's] termination. Specifically, [plaintiff] violated Albertson's company policy through her conduct."). In this case, BP's evidence shows that it had a formal absence notification policy in place, that it took multiple steps to warn Hoskins of his lack of compliance with the policy, and that it terminated Hoskins' employment shortly after Hoskins failed to comply with BP's final extension. Together, this evidence satisfies BP's burden of providing a nondiscriminatory reason for Hoskins' termination.

4. Evidence to Rebut BP's Non-Discriminatory Reason
Because BP has carried its burden of offering a non-discriminatory reason for Hoskins' termination, Hoskins must demonstrate that BP's asserted reason for his termination is pretextual. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 804. As noted above, Hoskins can show pretext "either by directly persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256;  [*17] Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1122.
Hoskins has not offered any direct evidence suggesting that BP terminated him because of his disability. Direct evidence is "evidence 'which, if believe, proves the fact of discriminatory . . . animus without inference or presumption.'" Coghlan v. American Seafoods Co. LLC, 413 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998)). Direct evidence can include, for example, "clearly sexist, racist, or similarly discriminatory statements or actions by the employer." Munoz, 630 F.3d at 865; see also, Cordova v. State Farm Ins., 124 F.3d 1145, 1150 (9th Cir. 1997) (finding direct evidence of race discrimination where the employer referred to a Mexican-American employee as a "dumb Mexican"); Lindahl v. Air France, 930 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir. 1991) (direct evidence of sexual stereotyping where employer believed that female job candidates got "nervous" and "easily upset"). There is no evidence that BP employees made discriminatory comments about Hoskins' physical or mental disabilities.
Hoskins' circumstantial evidence is also insufficient to establish pretext. He contends that BP must have known about his orthopedic  [*18] injuries because of his workers' compensation claim, and that BP must have had access to the medical reports sent by Dr. Quesada to ESIS. With this information in hand, Hoskins contends that BP should have realized Dr. Quesada had recommended a continued leave of absence for Hoskins' orthopedic injuries. However, because BP told Hoskins on November 9, 2012 that it had not received any medical reports from Dr. Quesada, and that it would not accept any future notes from his workers' compensation doctor, Hoskins argues that BP was trying to terminate him because of his disability.
There is no evidence, however, that BP received the medical reports prepared by Dr. Quesada. Rather, the reports themselves were only addressed to ESIS. (Haag Decl., Exs. 5-8). And even if BP could have obtained Dr. Quesada's reports from ESIS, its failure to do so does not establish a discriminatory motive. Hoskins' contention that BP purposely put him in a position to violate the absence notification policy is substantially outweighed by evidence showing that BP made multiple efforts to bring Hoskins into compliance with the absence policy. Hoskins became out of compliance with BP's absence policy on September  [*19] 23, 2012, yet BP sent Hoskins a letter on October 30, 2012 warning him of his noncompliance, and then called Hoskins on November 9, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. H). Ms. D'Orio also sought clarity on Hoskins' absence on November 8, 2012, double checking with Mr. Fife if there was anything on file to support Hoskins' continued leave. (Haag Decl., Ex. 15). None of these steps were required by BP's absence policy, and could have been avoided if BP was seeking to terminate Hoskins because of his disability.
Hoskins also has not submitted any evidence suggesting that BP did not follow its absence notification policy in this case, or any other case. Nor has Hoskins provided evidence suggesting that BP uses its absence notification policy as a means to terminate other disabled employees. To show that an employer's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating an employee are pretextual based on circumstantial evidence, the plaintiff must demonstrate "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence, . . . and hence  [*20] infer that the employer did not act for the [ . . . asserted] non-discriminatory reasons." Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 75, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000). Based on the record before the Court, Hoskins has not done so. As such, the Court GRANTS BP's motion for summary judgement as to Hoskins' disability claim.

B. Retaliation in Violation of FEHA
BP also seeks summary judgment on Hoskins' retaliation claim, which alleges that BP retaliated against Hoskins because he "asserted the existence of [] orthopaedic injuries" and "requested reasonable accommodations." (Compl. ¶ 42). Under FEHA, it is an unlawful employment practice for any employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under [FEHA] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [FEHA]." Cal. Gov't Code. § 12940(h). "In assessing the viability of FEHA retaliation claims in the context of motions for summary judgment, California courts apply the same burden-shifting analysis" used to analyze discrimination claims. Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1176 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)).
In  [*21] order to establish a prima facie case on his FEHA retaliation claim, Hoskins must demonstrate that (1) "he engaged in a protected activity," (2) that "his employer subjected him to [an] adverse employment action," and (3) that "there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Strother v. Southern Cal. Permanente Med. Group, 79 F.3d 859, 868 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting Flait v. N. American Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992)). If plaintiff succeeds in proving a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non retaliatory reason for the employment action. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56. If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must attack the employer's asserted reasons as a pretext for retaliation. See id. at 356.
As with Hoskins' discrimination claim, BP proceeds directly to the second step of this burden shifting framework. BP argues that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose for terminating Hoskins—noncompliance with BP's absence notification policy—and that Hoskins cannot cite to evidence sufficient to show that  [*22] BP's reason is pretexual.
As discussed above, the Court finds that BP has sufficiently carried its burden of showing that Hoskins did not comply with BP's absence notification policy, and that per the policy, BP could terminate Hoskins' employment for noncompliance. To survive BP's motion for summary judgment, Hoskins must point to evidence of either direct retaliation against him for requesting a reasonable accommodation, or "specific and substantial" indirect evidence that suggests that BP's proffered explanation for Hoskins' termination is unworthy of credence. See Chuang v. University of Cal. Davis, 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).
Hoskins relies on the same circumstantial evidence to support his retaliation claim that he did to support his discrimination claim. As noted above in the Court's discussion of Hoskins' discrimination claim, this evidence in insufficient to overcome BP's showing of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Hoskins termination. Given the lack of evidence supporting Hoskins' retaliation claim, Defendant's motion for summary judgement as to this claim is GRANTED.

C. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy and FEHA
Hoskins also asserts claims of  [*23] wrongful termination in violation of public policy and wrongful termination in violation of FEHA. (Compl. ¶ 60). The public policy Hoskins relies upon is FEHA's policy of prohibiting employers from discriminating and retaliating against employees on the basis of a disability. These claims are derivative of Hoskins' discrimination and retaliation claims, and Hoskins asserts no additional allegations beyond those asserted to support discrimination and retaliation. Because Hoskins has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support either the discrimination or retaliation claims under FEHA, the Court similarly finds that summary judgement must be GRANTED as to Hoskins' wrongful termination claims. See Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 664, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998) (standing for the proposition that if a plaintiff cannot sue the defendant for discrimination or retaliation under FEHA, the plaintiff cannot sue the defendant for wrongful termination in violation of FEHA or public policy).

D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Hoskins also contends that BP failed to engage in the interactive process when it terminated his employment. The interactive process is a "timely, good faith" process where the  [*24] employee and the employer engage in an attempt to determine "effective . . . accommodations, if any, in response to a[n] [employee's] request for reasonable accommodation" for a disability. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003. An employer fails to engage in an interactive process when (1) a reasonable accommodation would have been possible; and (2) the employer is responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1116, vacated on other grounds in U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). BP asserts that Hoskins was responsible for a breakdown in the interactive process, because Hoskins failed to provide BP with an updated medical note by the November 13, 2012 deadline. As such, BP contends it is entitled to summary judgement on this claim.
"[I]f the [interactive] process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006); see also Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 266, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) ("[I]t is the responsibility of both sides to keep communications open and neither side has a  [*25] right to obstruct the process."); Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1115 ("Liability . . . ensures only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown."). The duty to engage in the interactive process is a continuing duty that requires an employer to respond in good faith to repeated requests for reasonable accommodations. See Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001).
In this case, BP engaged in the interactive process with Hoskins on multiple occasions. Starting on April 24, 2012, BP granted Hoskins a medical leave of absence after it received a medical note from Dr. Victoria. (Meer Decl., Ex. D). Hoskins suffered from stress and anxiety at the time, and the leave of absence was the only accommodation he had requested. See Hoskins Dep. 93:21-94:1 ( Q: "And the accommodation that you were seeking for your disability was to have time off from work; correct? A: "Correct"; Q: "And you weren't asking for any other type of accommodation beyond having time off from work; right?" A: "At that time, no."). BP then extended Hoskins' leave of absence three separate times between April 24, 2012 and September 23, 2012. (Meer Decl., Ex. D-G). BP's willingness to accept  [*26] medical notes from Hoskins and to provide him with the accommodation he requested satisfied BP's duty to engage in the interactive process during this period.
BP also engaged in the interactive process with Hoskins after he fell out of compliance with BP's absence policy. BP showed a continued effort to communicate with Hoskins in good-faith during this period about his disability. The October 30, 2012 letter BP sent to Hoskins, Ms. D'Orio's internal November 8, 2012 email asking a colleague to check if BP was aware of a workers' compensation reason for Hoskins' absence, and Ms. D'Orio's November 9, 2012 phone call to Hoskins all showed a sustained effort by BP to determine why Hoskins had not yet returned from work, and whether continued accommodations should be provided. Even when BP had not received an updated medical note from Hoskins by November 9, 2012, the deadline BP set for Hoskins in its October 30, 2012 letter, BP granted Hoskins an additional extension—until November 13, 2012—when Hoskins told BP that he thought BP had received Dr. Quesada's medical reports.
It is undisputed that BP did not receive an updated medical note from Hoskins by November 13, 2012, as requested. Thereafter,  [*27] Hoskins did not contact BP until he learned on November 20, 2012 that BP had decided to terminate his employment. Hoskins contends, however, that although he did not submit an updated medical note as requested by November 13, 2012, that it was BP that failed to engage in the interactive process. Principally, Hoskins asserts that after he told BP on November 9, 2012 about Dr. Quesada's reports, which had been provided to ESIS since May 25, 2012, BP had a duty to examine these medical reports before its termination decision.
Hoskins has not cited to any authority to support the contention that BP had a duty to request medical reports from ESIS. Under California law, an employer is able to obtain an employee's medical information from a third-party insurer if the information pertains to the employee's ability to work. See Cal. Labor Code § 3762(c)(2); Rowe v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 186 F. Supp. 2d 1047, 1054 n.8 (N.D. Cal. 2002). However, BP's ability to examine Dr. Quesada's medical reports does not mean BP had a duty to do so. Rather, BP's duty was to engage in a good faith discussion with Hoskins about his disabilities and his need for continuing accommodations. See Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1112  [*28] (stating that the interactive process requires that "[b]oth sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process") (emphasis added). BP satisfied this duty, reaching out to Hoskins on multiple occasions to discuss his absence from work, and providing Hoskins with additional time to obtain a medical note covering his continued absence.
"The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). "A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith." Beck v. University of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir.1996). In the instant case, Hoskins has failed to produce sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that BP failed in engage in the interactive process in good faith. Rather, the evidence shows that it was Hoskins, rather than BP, that was responsible  [*29] for the breakdown in the interactive process. As such, BP's motion for summary judgment as to Hoskins' interactive process claim is GRANTED.

E. Failure to Accommodate
Hoskins' final claim is that BP failed to accommodate his disabilities in violation of FEHA by terminating his employment. "[W]hile a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). An employer fails to provide a reasonable accommodation when (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position; and (3) the employer fails to reasonably accommodate the disability. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10 (citing Wilson v. County of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009)). To establish that an employer failed to reasonably accommodate an employee's disability, the employee must establish that he requested an accommodation, and that the employee is not responsible for any breakdowns in the interactive process. See Gelfo, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 54. If the interactive process breaks  [*30] down because the employee fails to engage in discussions in good faith, the employee cannot establish a claim for failure to accommodate. See Wilcox, California Employment Law § 41.51[3][a] (2013).
Because the Court determined that Hoskins, rather than BP, was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process, Hoskins cannot establish that BP failed to accommodate his disabilities when it terminated his employment. Therefore, BP's motion for summary judgment as to Hoskins' failure to accommodate claim is GRANTED.

V. CONCLUSION
For the forgoing reasons, BP's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to all claims.
