ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT HYATT CORPORATION'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 57]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Patrick Cuffe brings three claims under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12900-99, against his former employer, Hyatt Corporation ("Hyatt"). (See Dkt. 47 [First Amended Complaint].) He asserts that Hyatt (1) discriminated against him by terminating his employment because of his disability, (2) failed to engage in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations for his disability, and (3) failed to provide him reasonable accommodations. (See id.) Now before the Court is Hyatt's motion for summary judgment. (See Dkt. 57 [Defendant Hyatt Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment].) For the following reasons, Hyatt's motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN PART and GRANTED IN PART.

II. BACKGROUND
Hyatt manages and operates the Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort & Spa ("Hyatt [*2]  Huntington Beach"). (See Dkt. 59 [Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Summary Judgment/Adjudication, hereinafter "RSUMF"] ¶ 1.)1 Cuffe used to work at the Hyatt Huntington Beach as the Associate Director of Sales under the direct supervision of Kay Cochran, the Director of Sales & Marketing. (See id. ¶¶ 3, 7; Dkt. 57-4 [Declaration of Kay Cochran, hereinafter "Cochran Decl."] ¶ 2.)
On February 14, 2020, Cuffe received a performance improvement plan regarding his employment with Hyatt. (See RSUMF ¶ 6.)2 As detailed in the plan, on that day and the day prior, Cuffe, Cochran, and other Hyatt staff—including Greg Cornwell, the Director of Human Resources—discussed several purported problems with Cuffe's conduct at work. (See Cochran Decl. Ex. B [ADOS Performance Improvement Plan, hereinafter "PIP"].) These problems ranged from being "[g]rossly late to a" training, a "[n]o call — no show on Monday, 2/3," non-interaction with the sales team, his "[d]istracted demeanor," his "jumbled thought process and speak[ing] in incomplete sentences," and so on. (Id.) Cuffe acknowledges that some allegations recited in the plan are true but [*3]  says others are not. (See Dkt. 57-3 [Declaration of David G. Hoiles, Jr. in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment], Ex. F [Videotaped Deposition of Patrick Cuffe] at 11.)3 The plan stated that "[i]f we do not see a dramatic and sustained improvement . . . , your employment with Hyatt is subject to termination at the end of the [sixty-day] period." (PIP.) It further stated that "if we experience breaches of judgment or credibility, poor decision-making, or failure to follow Hyatt and resort policies and procedures during the performance improvement plan, your employment will also be subject to termination without intermediate corrective action steps." (Id.)
Cuffe had not informed anyone at Hyatt Huntington Beach of a physical or mental health condition as of that February 14 meeting, although he claims to have previously reported general issues with his "personal wellbeing." (RSUMF ¶ 7.) And Cuffe claims that two days later, he sent Cochran and Peter Rice, the General Manager, a note from an urgent care provider requesting a three-day medical leave from February 17 to February 19 and enclosing a medical report stating that Cuffe was diagnosed with "anxiety" and referred to [*4]  "Psychiatry." (See id. ¶ 13; Dkt. 60 [Plaintiff's Compendium of Evidence in Support of Opposition to MSJ/MSA] at Ex. A [Deposition Transcript of Plaintiff Patrick Cuffe on April 30, 2021, hereinafter "Cuffe Dep. Tr."] 55:9-56:12; id. at Ex. K [Plaintiff's Doctor's Note Dated February 3, 2020, hereinafter "Ex. K"].)
Shortly thereafter, Dr. Joseph DeSanto diagnosed Cuffe with "opioid dependence with withdrawal" and determined that he should cease work until March 17, 2020. (RSUMF ¶ 8.) Dr. DeSanto submitted to Hyatt a request for medical leave from February 18 to March 17 for Cuffe, but the request did not specify the medical condition necessitating leave. (See id. ¶ 9.) Hyatt granted the request. (See id. ¶ 10.)
On February 25, 2020, while Cuffe was on leave, Cornwell and Rice learned that Cuffe had walked nude that same day through the Hyatt Regency Orange County hotel ("Hyatt Orange County"). (See id. ¶ 14.) Cornwell and Rice received from the Hyatt Orange County an incident report recounting the details. (See id.; Dkt. 57-5 [Declaration of Greg Cornwell, hereinafter "Cornwell Decl."] ¶ 14, Ex. D [Guest Incident Report]; Dkt. 57-6 [Declaration of Peter Rice, hereinafter "Rice Decl."] [*5]  ¶ 12, Ex. D [Guest Incident Report, hereinafter "GIR"].) Critically, that report stated that "Dr. Leonard Wayne Phy.D [sic] informed" hotel staff "that he is [Cuffe's] [p]sychologist," "that they were staying in room 875," and "that he was with [Cuffe] watching him as he detoxed from taking heroin a week ago." (GIR.) Cuffe claims that he has no recollection of the incident, as he was hallucinating. (See RSUMF ¶ 15.)
Rice and Cornwell decided to terminate Cuffe's employment at the Hyatt Huntington Beach. (See id. ¶ 16.) Hyatt asserts that their basis for termination was Cuffe's "behavior of walking through the hotel without any clothes on." (Id.) That behavior "was unacceptable" in their view "because it occurred at a Hyatt property in the presence of guests and employees of the hotel, was inconsistent with the conduct expected from a person holding a leadership position and occurred while he was [on] a performance improvement plan." (Id.) Cuffe disputes whether he was fired because of a non-discriminatory reason, which leads to the present case. (See id.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment on "each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary [*6]  judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. A factual issue is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and is determined by looking to the substantive law. Id. "Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 249.
Where the movant will bear the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant "must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). In contrast, where the nonmovant will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim [*7]  or defense, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970), or (2) showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. Once this burden is met, the party resisting the motion must set forth, by affidavit, or as otherwise provided under Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. A party opposing summary judgment must support its assertion that a material fact is genuinely disputed by (i) citing to materials in the record, (ii) showing the moving party's materials are inadequate to establish an absence of genuine dispute, or (iii) showing that the moving party lacks admissible evidence to support its factual position. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). The opposing party may also object to the material cited by the movant on the basis that it "cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). But the opposing party must show more than the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence"; rather, "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [opposing party]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all justifiable inferences in its favor. Id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The court [*8]  does not make credibility determinations, nor does it weigh conflicting evidence. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But conclusory and speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise triable issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979). The evidence the parties present must be admissible. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "If the court does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, it may enter an order stating any material fact—including an item of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g).

IV. DISCUSSION
Hyatt seeks summary judgment on all of Cuffe's claims. On the discrimination claim, Hyatt argues that the individuals who terminated Cuffe's employment were unaware that he had a disability and that they based their decision on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. (See Dkt. 57-1 [Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant Hyatt Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment, hereinafter "Mot."] at 11-13.) On the interactive process claim, Hyatt asserts that Cuffe did not initiate the process by identifying his disability as well as resulting limitations and requesting accommodations as required by the FEHA. (See id. at 13-14; [*9]  Reply at 4.) And on the reasonable accommodation claim, Hyatt asserts that it granted the only accommodation Cuffe ever requested. (See Mot. at 13-14.) Summary judgment is warranted on the interactive process and reasonable accommodations claims but not the discrimination claim.

A. Discrimination Claim
The FEHA makes it unlawful in general "[f]or an employer" to take adverse employment action against a person "because of the . . . physical disability, mental disability, [or] medical condition . . . of [that] person." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The FEHA does not, however, prohibit an employer from "refusing to hire or discharging an employee" if that person "is unable to perform the employee's essential duties" or "endanger[s] . . . the health or safety of" the employee or "others even with reasonable accommodations." Id. § 12940(a)(1)-(2).
A three-stage burden-shifting analysis, named after McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), governs claims under this provision. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, 1130 (Cal. 2005); Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729, 745 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007). Plaintiffs must establish prima facie cases of discrimination by showing that they (1) "suffer[ ] from [ ] disabilit[ies]," (2) are "otherwise qualified to do [their] job[s]," and (3) were "subjected to adverse employment action because of [their] disabilit[ies]." Faust, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 745 (citation omitted). If a plaintiff [*10]  proves a prime facie case, the defendant has the burden to articulate some "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. (citation omitted). If a defendant carries this burden, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the defendant's "stated reason is either false or pretextual." Faust, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 745 (citation omitted).
Hyatt argues that regardless of whether Cuffe can demonstrate a prima facie case, "the undisputed facts show that his employment was terminated for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, namely walking through the Hyatt Regency Orange County hotel without any clothes on." (Mot. at 12.) And Hyatt further argues that insufficient evidence exists to support a finding that the basis for termination was pretextual, as the decisionmakers did not even know of any disability. (See id. at 12-13.)
A genuine dispute exists on whether the decisionmakers were in fact aware that Cuffe had some mental health condition. Cuffe testified that he emailed Rice on February 16, 2020, a note from an urgent care provider requesting three days' leave along with a medical report stating a diagnosis of "anxiety," a referral to "Psychiatry," and an instruction to take hydroxyzine. (Ex. [*11]  K; see also Cuffe Dep. Tr. 55:9-56:12.) Rice and another decisionmaker—Cornwell—were also aware of the likelihood that Cuffe's behavior at the Hyatt Orange County was a result of mental health issues. For example, they knew that Cuffe was on medical leave at the time of the behavior. (See Cornwell Decl. ¶¶ 12-13; Rice Decl. ¶ 11.) And prior to Cuffe's termination, Rice and Cornwell had received an incident report on Cuffe's behavior at the Hyatt Orange County that stated that "Dr. Leonard Wayne Phy.D [sic]," Cuffe's "[p]sychologist," was "watching him" on site "as he detoxed." (Cornwell Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. D; Rice Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. D.) Based on this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Hyatt decisionmakers knew of Cuffe's mental health condition.
It is doubtful, moreover, that Cuffe's nudity is a "legitimate, non-discriminatory reason" to terminate his employment. Faust, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 745 (citation omitted). "'[L]egitimate' reasons in this context are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias, and which, if true, would thus preclude a finding of discrimination." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1115-16 (Cal. 2000) (emphasis omitted) (citation omitted). Firing an employee for gallivanting in the nude through a hotel (owned by the employer, [*12]  no less) may seem at first pass unrelated to disability bias—but the behavior here was "a consequence of" Cuffe's condition, "which the law protects as part and parcel of [his] disability. In those terms, if the law fails to protect the manifestations of [his] disability, there is no real protection in the law because it would protect the disabled in name only." Gambini v. Total Renal Care, Inc., 486 F.3d 1087, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 2007);4 see also Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting that, generally, "conduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination").5
To be sure, Hyatt is not precluded from showing that Cuffe cannot make out a prima facie case. Hyatt can argue, for example, that Cuffe now "is unable to perform the . . . essential duties" of his position or "cannot perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger . . . the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1)-(2); see also Mayo v. PCC Structurals, Inc., 795 F.3d 941, 944 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that "threaten[ing] to kill . . . co-workers in chilling detail and on multiple occasions . . . demonstrated that [the employee] could not perform an 'essential function' of his job"); Gonzalez v. Cal. State Pers. Bd., 33 Cal. App. 4th 422, 39 Cal. Rptr. 2d 282, 290 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995) (holding that a state employee was not "otherwise qualified" for his position under California Government Code § 19230 when his alcoholism [*13]  resulted in "egregious misconduct"). And Hyatt is free to address whether some exception permits deviating from the principle that disability-related misconduct is "part and parcel" of the disability. See Newland v. Dalton, 81 F.3d 904, 906 (9th Cir. 1996) ("Attempting to fire a weapon at individuals is the kind of egregious and criminal conduct which employees are responsible for regardless of any disability"—there, alcoholism.). But see Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139 n.18 (noting that an employer may discharge an employee "for misconduct or inadequate performance that may be caused by a 'disability' in only one category of cases—alcoholism and illegal drug use" and that "an additional exception might apply in the case of 'egregious and criminal conduct'" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)); Dark v. Curry Cnty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1084 n.3 (9th Cir. 2006) (noting that "that an additional exception might apply in the case of 'egregious and criminal conduct'" (emphasis added) (citation omitted)). Hyatt has not, however, made these arguments to date, so summary judgment on Cuffe's discrimination claim is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

B. Interactive Process Claim
The FEHA also makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with [an] employee" who has a known disability or condition [*14]  "to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). In general, "[i]t is the employee's 'burden to initiate the process,'" and "[t]he obligation to engage in the interactive process 'arises once the employer becomes aware of the need to consider an accommodation.'" Chisolm v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 383 F. Supp. 3d 1032, 1057 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (quoting Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 361 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009)). "Once the parties have engaged in the litigation process, to prevail, the employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." Id. at 1058 (quoting Scotch, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 365).
No genuine factual dispute exists to bar summary judgment on this claim. The only type of accommodation that Cuffe ever requested was medical leave, which Hyatt granted. (See RSUMF ¶ 10.) Cuffe complains that Hyatt "did not have conversations with [him] about how best to accommodate his disability," "look into other positions within the hotel [in] which [he] could work," or "consider other opportunities to accommodate [his] disability following his leave." (Dkt. 58 [Plaintiff Cuffe's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication, hereinafter "Opp."] at 13.) But nowhere in his opposition does Cuffe [*15]  even "identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced," Scotch, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 365, let alone an accommodation that he had requested or that should have been "apparent" to Hyatt, Doe v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 43 Cal. App. 5th 721, 255 Cal. Rptr. 3d 910, 925 (Cal. Ct. App. 2019). Simply put, Cuffe "cannot demand clairvoyance of his employer." Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, summary judgment on the interactive process claim is GRANTED.

C. Reasonable Accommodation Claim
The FEHA further requires "an employer . . . to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee" unless doing so would "produce undue hardship" for the employer. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1). Stated differently, "[t]he elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are (1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9, 19 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015). "Two principles underlie a cause of action for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874, 890 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006). "First, the employee must request an accommodation." Id. "Second, the parties must engage in an interactive process regarding the requested accommodation and, if the process fails, responsibility for the [*16]  failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Id. "While a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other." Id.
As with the interactive process claim, no genuine dispute exists to bar summary judgment on the reasonable accommodation claim. Cuffe claims that he "was not provided the sought accommodation," namely, "medical leave for a month." (Opp. at 14.) But Hyatt did grant him that accommodation—only after his leave had run its course did Hyatt terminate his employment. (See RSUMF ¶ 10; Cornwell Decl. ¶ 15; Rice Decl. ¶ 13.) Thus, summary judgment is GRANTED on this claim.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Hyatt's motion for summary judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE with respect to Cuffe's discrimination claim. Hyatt's motion is GRANTED with respect to Cuffe's interactive process and reasonable accommodation claims.
