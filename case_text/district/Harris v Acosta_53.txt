ORDER and NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court for review of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Doc. 32) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) & (ii) and for consideration of Plaintiff's Second Motion For Appointment Of Counsel (Doc. 34) and Defendant's Motion To Dismiss (Doc. 36).

Procedural History
Plaintiff, who is proceeding pro se, filed a complaint on January 6, 2016 (see Doc. 2), in which she alleges that her employer United States Department of Labor discriminated against her because of her race (black), religion (Christian), and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. (Title VII), and because of her age (born in 1964) in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. (ADEA). (Doc. 2 ¶ 1). Plaintiff also asserted claims for whistleblower reprisal, "PPP, concealing a crime, violation of [her] civil rights, violation of GA code 16-5-90 & 16-5-91, stalking & harassment." [*2]  (Id.). Plaintiff attached a five-page single-spaced narrative of the alleged acts of discrimination and harassment Plaintiff contends she was subjected to because of her race, age, religion (Christianity), and disability (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder). (Id. at 18-22). She also attached a copy of her "Formal EEO Complaint Affidavit," a 10-page single-spaced document in which she alleges that she was discriminated against because of her race, sex, age, religion, and disability and describes several events occurring from June 2013 until July 2014. (Id. at 5-14). The Court granted Plaintiff's application to proceed in forma pauperis (Doc. 1) and allowed Plaintiff's Complaint to proceed, but also explained that her "Complaint is far from a model of clarity" and that "[b]y allowing this action to proceed to service on Defendant, the Court makes no finding that Plaintiff's claims would necessarily withstand a motion to dismiss nor reaches any conclusions about possible defenses Defendant may assert." (Doc. 3 at 2-3).
Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to order Plaintiff to file a more definite [*3]  statement pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(e). (Doc. 19). Specifically, Defendant argued that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust her discrimination claims in good faith. (Doc. 19-1 at 4-5). Defendant also moved in the alternative for the Court "to order plaintiff to provide a more definite statement that complies with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure," pointing out that Plaintiff's attachments to her Complaint in which she appears to set out the factual basis for her claims, "at times describe incidents which appear to be immaterial to her claim, and do not comply with Rules 8(a) or Rule 10(b)." (Doc. 19-1 at 7-8). In an Order entered June 8, 2017, the Court granted Defendant's motion for a more definite statement but denied Defendant's motion to dismiss. (Doc. 30). The Court described multiple deficiencies in Plaintiff's original Complaint:
Clearly, Plaintiff has not presented her claims as separate counts, nor has she stated her claims in numbered paragraphs as required by Rule 10. (See Doc. 2). Turning to the substance of her Complaint, she alleges that Defendant discriminated against her because of her race, sex, age, religion, and disability, and that Defendant [*4]  retaliated against her, but she does not make clear which of the facts included in her two narrative attachments support each of her various potential claims. The jumbled structure of her attachments prevents Defendant from responding to each of her claims and allegations in any meaningful way. This difficulty would not be present if she had numbered the counts and supporting allegations as required by Rule 10. Nor has Plaintiff plausibly alleged that each of the complained-of actions described in her Complaint was taken because of each of the asserted protected characteristics or to retaliate against her because she engaged in statutorily protected activity.
(Id. at 7). The Court therefore directed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint "to clearly set out each of her claims and the factual basis for each claim." (Id. at 8). Specifically, the Court directed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint:
in which she sets out in separate counts each claim she is asserting, e.g. Title VII race discrimination, Title VII religion discrimination, Title VII sex discrimination, Rehabilitation Act disability discrimination, ADEA age discrimination, etc. With respect to her discrimination claims, she must describe the specific [*5]  employment action(s) she alleges to be discriminatory (e.g., disciplinary action, demotion, failure to promote, etc.), the date each action occurred, who took the action, whether that person was a co-worker or supervisor, and what facts support her belief that the action was taken because of her race, sex, age, religion, and/or disability. If Plaintiff contends that Defendant discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her disability, she must state the specific accommodation she requested, when and how she requested it, to whom she requested it, and Defendant's response to her request. Similarly, as to her retaliation claims, Plaintiff must describe her statutorily protected activity, the dates she engaged in it, the specific employment actions she contends were taken in retaliation for her statutorily protected activity, the dates of those actions, the identity of the person(s) who took those actions, and the facts that support her belief that the actions were taken to retaliate against him. Finally, as to each claim, Plaintiff must explain how and when she administratively exhausted that claim.
(Id. at 8-9). The Court cautioned Plaintiff "that she will not satisfy these pleading requirements [*6]  by simply attaching her prior EEO complaints and other documents and expect the Court and Defendant to sift and sort through them to determine what claims she wishes to assert in this action. Nor will it be sufficient to conclusorily allege that all of the challenged actions were taken because of her race, religion, age, or disability . . . ." (Id. at 9).
Plaintiff then filed an Amended Complaint (Doc. 32) in which she asserts that following claims: violations of Title VII based on race, color, religion, and sex discrimination (First Claim); violations of the Rehabilitation Act (Second Claim); violations of the ADEA for age discrimination (Third Claim); violations of Title VII for retaliation/reprisal (Fourth Claim); violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) (Fifth Claim); violations of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-5-90 and 16-5-91 for stalking and harassment (Sixth Claim); violations of "Constitutional Rights" (Seventh Claim), presumably brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985 (see Doc. 32 ¶ 3); violation of Title VII for hostile work environment (Eighth Claim); claims for "racism, defamation and slander" (Ninth Claim); and a claim for violation of "HIPAA/Privacy Act" (Tenth Claim). Plaintiff also filed a second motion for appointment [*7]  of counsel. (Doc. 34).
Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Doc. 36). Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to administratively exhaust her employment discrimination claims and the WPA, and her claims for civil rights violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985 and state law claims are preempted by other federal statutes. (Doc. 36-1 at 1-2). Plaintiff responded in opposition to Defendant's motion (Doc. 41), and Defendant has submitted a reply (Doc. 42).

Discussion

I. Review Of Plaintiff's Complaint Pursuant To 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) & (ii), the Court is required to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint at any time if the Court determines that the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." FED R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). That standard "does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). To state a claim that can survive a motion to dismiss, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible [*8]  on its face.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice," and "only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. To be plausible, the complaint must contain "well-pleaded facts" that "permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct." Id. at 679.
"Additionally, because Plaintiff [is] acting pro se, [her] 'pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.'" Shields v. Bank of Am., No. 2:11-CV-00267-RWS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30183, at * 3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 6, 2012) (quoting Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998)). "'This leniency, however, does not require or allow courts to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.'" Id. (quoting Thomas v. Pentagon Fed. Credit Union, 393 Fed. Appx. 635, 637 (11th Cir. 2010)). The undersigned is also mindful that in the Court's June 8, 2017 Order, the Court outlined what information Plaintiff needed to provide in support of her claims in her Amended Complaint (see Doc. 30 at 8-9) and will therefore review the adequacy of Plaintiff's amended pleading with those instructions in mind.

A. Title VII (First, Fourth, and Eighth Claims)

1. Title VII Discrimination (First and Eighth Claims)
In her First [*9]  Claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of race or color (Black), religion (Christian), and sex, in violation of Title VII. (See Doc. 32 ¶ 18). In her Eighth Claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected her to a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII, presumably because of her race, color, religion, and/or sex. (See Doc. 32 ¶¶ 79-87). Thus, it appears that Plaintiff's claims in her First Claim are premised on discrete employment actions while her Eighth Claim is based on a discriminatory hostile work environment.

a. Race Discrimination
"In order to state a claim for race discrimination under Title VII, Plaintiff must allege, at a minimum, facts that would 'allow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference,' Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949, that Defendant subjected [her] to an adverse employment action, such as a termination, failure to promote or demotion, because of [her] race, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), or to a discriminatorily hostile or abusive work environment based on his race, see, e.g., McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1378 (11th Cir.), cert denied, 555 U.S. 944, 129 S. Ct. 404, 172 L. Ed. 2d 286 (2008)." Moon v. UPS, No. 2:11-CV-032-RWS-SSC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10122, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 2, 2012), adopted by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10123 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 27, 2012). "In order to show a racially hostile work environment claim under Title VII, Plaintiff must allege facts that show that [s]he [*10]  belongs to a protected group, i.e., [s]he is African-American; that [s]he was subjected to unwanted harassment on the basis of that protected characteristic; that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of [her] employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and that there is a basis for holding [her] employer liable." Id. at *5-6.
Plaintiff alleges the following in support of her Title VII discrimination claim (First Claim): "On November 19, 2013 Plaintiff was physically and verbally assaulted and called a 'ni**er and stupid' by her acting supervisor Alfred Villoch"; on June 7, 2013 the Director of Operation wrote Plaintiff up "for a first time offense for a file that [she] did not process; [she] was the only staff member written up for this incident"; on June 26-27, 2013 Villoch "accused Plaintiff of falsifying sign in time"; and the Agency "violated Plaintiff[']s rights to union representation during a meeting with Villoch in July 2014." (Doc. 32 ¶ 18). Plaintiff makes the following allegations in support of her Title VII hostile work environment claim: from July to September 2013 Villoch "tried to put Plaintiff[] on Absent [*11]  Without Leave (AWOL) for July 8, 2013, when [she] had submitted a leave slip that he approved"; on August 5, 2013 someone stole Plaintiff's work from her desk and the work was eventually returned after she complained about it to Villoch; on August 13, 2013, Villoch "gave false information about Plaintiff's work to a customer in order to provoke Plaintiff to act unprofessional[ly]"; from August 12 to August 15, 2013, Villoch "directed other people to harass Plaintiff by following Plaintiff around or making negative comments to Plaintiff"; Plaintiff was reprimanded on September 27, 2013 for asking Villoch "for a report of Plaintiff's outgoing work"; on November 19, 2013, Villoch "assaulted and threatened Plaintiff's life by calling her 'ni**er' and 'stupid', walking behind her, yelling and putting his hands on Plaintiff"; on June 13, 2014 Plaintiff was denied additional leave without pay and placed on AWOL status; and on July 10, 2014 Villoch harassed her by denying her leave request. (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 79-87).
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of Title race (or color) discrimination in her First Claim based on discrete adverse employment actions because she has [*12]  not alleged that she was subjected to an adverse employment action such as a suspension, demotion, failure to promote, or termination. "[T]o prove adverse employment action in a case under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause, an employee must show a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001). "[T]he asserted impact cannot be speculative and must at least have a tangible adverse effect on the plaintiff's employment." Id. The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has not alleged that the actions described in her "First Claim" resulted in a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges, such as lost pay, benefits, or promotional opportunities.1 See Davis, 245 F.3d at 1241 (explaining that "courts are wisely reluctant to treat job performance memoranda as actionable under Title VII where they do not trigger any more tangible form of adverse action such as a loss in benefits, ineligibility for promotional opportunities, or more formal discipline"); see also Hooks v. Bank of Am., 183 Fed. Appx. 833, 836 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that "[n]one of the alleged incidents in Hooks complaint constitute an adverse employment action, within the meaning of Davis," where she alleged three customer complains, one oral reprimand, [*13]  one written reprimand, the withholding of a building key, and a restriction on cashing non-account-holder checks). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff alleges that Defendant subjected her to a discrete adverse employment action because of her race (or color) in violation of Title VII, it is RECOMMENDED that claim (part of First Claim) be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.
The undersigned notes, however, that the challenged actions Plaintiff describes in her First and Eighth Claims, viewed collectively, may support a discriminatorily hostile work environment. And the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has plausibly stated a claim for a racially discriminatorily hostile work environment (part of Eighth Claim) based on her allegations concerning the actions of Acting Supervisor Villoch. She alleges that Villoch called her a racially derogatory slur, which plausibly shows that Villoch bore a racial animus toward Plaintiff and took the alleged actions against her because of her race. In light of the leniency afforded pro se litigants' pleadings, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has stated a Title VII claim based on a racially hostile work environment. [*14]  The undersigned will discuss below Defendant's contention in its motion to dismiss that Plaintiff's Title VII claims should be dismissed because she failed to administratively exhaust them in good faith.

b. Religious Discrimination
Plaintiff's claim based on alleged religious discrimination does not fare as well. Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating "against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual's . . . religion[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Moreover, Title VII requires an employer to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious observances or practices unless to do so would impose an undue hardship on the employer's business. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). Therefore, a plaintiff alleging religious discrimination under Title VII has two theories available: disparate treatment and failure to accommodate. See, e.g., Burrows v. Coll. of Cent. Fla., No. 5:14-cv-197-Oc-30PRL, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174122, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2014) ("Title VII religious discrimination claims come in two forms: (1) 'reasonable accommodation' claims, and (2) disparate treatment claims . . . based on an allegation that an employer took an adverse action against an employee on the basis o[f] religion."). A plaintiff [*15]  may also bring a Title VII religious discrimination claim based on a discriminatorily hostile work environment. See, e.g., Richardson v. Doughtery Cnty., 185 Fed. Appx. 785, 790-91 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision).
Plaintiff's sole allegation in support of her religious discrimination claim is that sometime from August 28, 2013 to September 1, 2013, "all of the Plaintiff's religious signs were removed from Plaintiff's cubicle for no reason. No warning was given as to why the signs had to be moved." (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 18(b), 83). She has not alleged facts that plausibly show that she requested and was denied accommodation for a religious practice that conflicted with a work rule. See Dixon v. Palm Beach Cnty Parks & Rec., 343 Fed. Appx. 500, 502 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished decision) (explaining that in order to make a prima facie case of religious discrimination, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he had a bona fide religious belief that conflicted with an employment requirement; (2) he informed his employer of his belief; and (3) he was disciplined for failing to comply with the conflicting employment requirement." (citing Morrissette-Brown v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., 506 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2007)).
Nor has Plaintiff alleged that she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her religion. See, e.g., Dixon, 343 Fed. Appx. at 502 (finding that summary judgment was properly granted to plaintiff on his religious accommodation claim [*16]  because "[a]lthough evidence showed Dixon was given a written record of counseling, was initially denied his requests for Sunday off, and was transferred from the bicycle patrol unit, these were not adverse employment actions because they did not result in a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, and privileges of Dixon's employment"); Sanford v. Walmart, Inc., No. 1:13-CV-174(LJA), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134157, at *39 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 29, 2016) (finding that plaintiff's religious accommodation claim failed because he "was not disciplined for failing to comply with an employment requirement that conflicted with his religious beliefs").
Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiff claims a hostile work environment based on her religion, the undersigned finds that her allegation that her "religious signs" were removed by an unidentified employee on one occasion in 2013 is insufficient to plausibly demonstrate that she was subjected to a severe or pervasive discriminatorily hostile work environment based on her religion. See, e.g., Richardson, 185 Fed. Appx. at 791 (finding plaintiff's allegation that his supervisor referred to him as "preacher man" more than 50 times and other employees made comments regarding his religion and request for accommodation insufficient to support [*17]  hostile work environment claim). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Title VII discrimination and hostile work environment claims based on religion asserted in her First and Eighth Claims be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.

c. Sex Discrimination
Plaintiff's sex discrimination claim is similarly deficient. Plaintiff's sole allegation concerning sexual harassment is that on June 26, 2013, Acting Supervisor Villoch "sexually harassed the Plaintiff when he said 'Your Husband like (sic) it rough.'" (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 18(c)). Again, Plaintiff has not alleged facts that plausibly demonstrate that she was subjected to an adverse employment action, nor has she alleged facts that any such action was taken because of her sex. Moreover, her allegation that on one occasion in 2013 Villoch made an inappropriate and unprofessional statement about Plaintiff's husband is insufficient to plausibly show that Plaintiff was subjected to severe or pervasive sexual harassment that altered the terms and conditions of her employment. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Title VII sex discrimination and hostile work environment claims asserted in her First and [*18]  Eighth Claims be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

2. Title VII Retaliation (Fourth Claim)
"To state a claim for retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1) she participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse action." Arafat v. Sch. Bd., 549 Fed. Appx. 872, 874 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished decision). In support of her Title VII retaliation claim, Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to the following: from July to September 2013 Villoch tried to put her on AWOL status for July 8, 2013 even though he had approved a leave slip; on September 17, 2013 Plaintiff was reprimanded for asking for a report of her outgoing work; she was put on a Performance Improvement Plan in August or September 2013; her work was stolen from her desk on August 5, 2013; she was given "more complex assignments and work than a comparable co-worker" in August 2013; and Defendant refused to provide her a reasonable accommodation within her medical restriction to try to get her to resign. (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 64-69). Plaintiff then alleges, "I have been [*19]  retaliated against because I filed ULP [unfair labor practice complaint] and several EEO discrimination complaint[s]." (Id. ¶ 69). That is the entirety of her retaliation claim; she did not, as instructed in the Court's June 8, 2017 Order:
describe her statutorily protected activity, the dates she engaged in it, the specific employment actions she contends were taken in retaliation for her statutorily protected activity, the dates of those actions, the identity of the person(s) who took those actions, and the facts that support her belief that the actions were taken to retaliate against [her].
(Doc. 30 at 8-9). Elsewhere in her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she "filed three (3) complaints on August 20, 2014, December 18, 2014 and January 29, 2015" (Doc. 32 ¶ 8), but most of the actions she describes in her Title VII retaliation claim occurred in 2013, before she filed her first EEO complaint, and therefore could not have occurred because she engaged in statutorily protected activity. Although some of the events surrounding Defendant's alleged denial of her request for an accommodation, discussed below, allegedly occurred after Plaintiff began filing her EEO complaints (see [*20]  Doc. 32 ¶¶ 32-56), Plaintiff has not alleged "facts that support her belief that the actions were taken to retaliate against [her]" for filing her EEO complaints. Plaintiff's conclusory allegation that Defendant retaliated against her is insufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted. It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim (Fourth Claim) be DISMISSED.

B. Rehabilitation Act (Second Claim)
"The Rehabilitation Act 'prohibits federal agencies from discriminating in employment against otherwise qualified individuals with a disability.'" Dalton v. CDC, 602 Fed. Appx. 749, 754 (11th Cir. 2015) (unpublished decision) (quoting Mullins v. Crowell, 228 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir. 2000)). "An employer discriminates under the Rehabilitation Act when it fails to provide a 'reasonable accommodation' for an employee with a disability, unless the accommodation would cause undue hardship on the employer." Id. (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). "'To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Act, an individual must show that (1) [s]he has a disability; (2) [s]he is otherwise qualified for the position; and (3) [s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination as the result of his disability.'" Id. at 754 n.8 (quoting Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir. 1999)). "The standard for determining liability under the Rehabilitation Act is the [*21]  same as that under the ADA [Americans With Disabilities Act]." Id. (citing Sutton, 185 F.3d at 1208).
Plaintiff makes a number of allegations in support of this claim, and it is difficult to determine which actually support her claim, but it appears that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that: she was qualified for her position (see Doc. 32 ¶ 5); she has a disability, i.e., depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (id. ¶ 1); and she requested a reasonable accommodation, including requested leave, telework, a changed work schedule, and/or transfer from her work location, but Defendant denied her requests (see generally id. ¶¶ 19-62). Liberally construing Plaintiff's allegations, the undersigned finds that she has plausibly stated a claim for relief under the Rehabilitation Act. The undersigned will discuss below Defendant's contention in its motion to dismiss that Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim should be dismissed because she failed to administratively exhaust it in good faith.

C. ADEA (Third Claim)
To state a claim for age discrimination under the ADEA, a plaintiff must allege at a minimum that Defendant subjected her to an adverse employment action because of her age. 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). Plaintiff's entire [*22]  allegation in support of her ADEA claim is that "[o]n August 20, 2013, Plaintiff was told by a student-intern, Amanda McPherson[,] that Mr. Alfredo Villoch instructed staff members and student employees to watch and follow Plaintiff[] during work time." (Doc. 32 ¶ 63). Plaintiff did not allege any facts that plausibly show that this alleged adverse action was taken because of her age, and therefore she has failed to state a claim under the ADEA. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's ADEA claim be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

D. WPA (Fifth Claim)
5 U.S.C. § 2302 provides in relevant part:
(b) Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--(8) take or fail to take, or threaten or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant because of--(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) any violation (other than a violation of this section) of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, [*23]  or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety . . .; or (B) any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the Inspector General of any agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency such disclosures, of information which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) any violation (other than a violation of this section) of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety . . . .
5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8)(A) & (B).
Plaintiff alleges the following in support of her WPA claim:
70. Plaintiff had been reporting everything that has been happening to her to union. 71. Plaintiff reported stolen work to OIG Andrew Farland in August 2013. 72. Plaintiff filed an ULP [Unfair Labor Practice complaint].
(Doc. 32 ¶¶ 70-72). These conclusory allegations are insufficient to plausibly demonstrate that Defendant violated the WPA. Plaintiff did not identify with any specificity what disclosures she made that support her WPA claim, what action was then taken against her, who took the action, and when they took it. Critically, she has not alleged any facts in support of [*24]  this claim that plausibly demonstrate that the challenged action was taken because of disclosures protected by the WPA.
Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged facts or otherwise shown that she administratively exhausted her WPA claim. "Under the WPA, a federal employee must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"), which is required to investigate the complaint." Ivey v. Paulson, 222 Fed. Appx. 815, 818 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1214). "If the OSC finds a violation, it reports its findings to the Merit System Protection Board ('MSPB'); if it finds no violation, the employee himself may bring an action before the MSPB." Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(3), 1221(a)). "MSPB decisions are appealable only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, except for claims also alleging prohibited discrimination." Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b)(1) and (b)(2)). "Jurisdiction over 'mixed cases,' those also involving adverse employment action or discrimination, lies with the district court if the action appealed is a removal, a suspension of more than 14 days, a reduction in grade, a reduction in pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less." Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. § 7512). Here, Plaintiff has not alleged facts that plausibly show that she administratively exhausted her WPA claim, either by bringing an action before the [*25]  MSPB following an OSC investigation or by raising a WPA claim in her EEO filings, nor has she pointed to evidence in the record that shows that she has exhausted that claim.
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's WPA claim be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

E. Stalking And Harassment (Sixth Claim)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated O.C.G.A. §§ 16-5-90 and 16-5-91 through the actions of supervisor Villoch, who "instructed staff members and student employees to watch and follow Plaintiff[] during work time" and "stalked and harassed [Plaintiff] about [her] computer" on July 8, 2014 after he had been told "not to say anything to" Plaintiff. (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 73-74). Plaintiff further alleges that when she returned to work on August 28, 2015, she "was stalked again," though it is not clear by whom, and she "had to flee for her life again by calling the Atlanta Police," and on October 20, 2015, she "fled the office because of the continued stalking/harassment, and watching/surveillance from co-workers Clarence Merchant and Melvin Honeycutt." (Id. ¶ 75). Plaintiff's claim, premised on alleged violations of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-5-90 and 16-5-91, fails for at least two reasons. In the first place, these [*26]  are criminal statutes which do not create private causes of action. See Troncalli v. Jones, 237 Ga. App. 10, 514 S.E. 2d 478, 481 (Ga. Ct. App. 1999); Hopkinson v. Hopkinson, 239 Ga. App. 518, 521 S.E. 2d 453, 454 (Ga. Ct. App. 1999). Furthermore, Plaintiff's claims rest on wholly conclusory allegations of "stalking" and harassment," devoid of sufficient factual enhancement to demonstrate a plausible claim for relief.
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's claims for stalking and harassment (Sixth Claim) be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

F. Constitutional Violations (Seventh Claim)
Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant denied due process and Plaintiff's right to union representation and deny plaintiff representation," that "EEOC violate[d] Plaintiff's constitutional rights by failure to provide Freedom of Information Act upon request and within applicable time frame," and that "Agency violated my right to union representation during discussion of disciplinary action in August 2013 regarding approved leave for July 8, 2013." (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 76-78). She presumably brings these claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985. (See Doc. 32 at ¶ 3). Plaintiff has not stated a claim for relief for "violation of constitutional rights." She has not identified the constitutional provisions allegedly violated by Defendant, i.e., which [*27]  amendment to the Constitution purportedly gives rise to her claim. Her allegations are wholly conclusory, and are not even entirely asserted against this Defendant. Moreover, as Defendant argues in its motion to dismiss (Doc. 36-1 at 9-14), Plaintiff's employment-related constitutional claims are preempted by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). See Ivey, 222 Fed. Appx. at 820 ("Constitutional claims by federal employees are ordinarily preempted by the [CSRA] and must be addressed through the administrative procedures the CSRA establishes."); Pinson v. Rumsfeld, 192 Fed. Appx. 811, 819 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision); Gooden v. IRS, No. 1:13-CV-298-RWS-ECS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198720, at *19-20 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 24, 2014); Gryder v. Mineta, No. 1:00-CV-2437-GET, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27412, at *14-15, 21 (N.D. Ga. May 21, 2001).
It is therefore RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Seventh Claim for "violation of constitutional rights" be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

G. Racism, Defamation and Slander (Ninth Claim)
Plaintiff alleges that she "experienced racism, slander and defamation when her Acting Supervisor Villoch [on] or around September 2014 . . . called her a 'ni**er and stupid' on November 19, 2013." (Doc. 32 ¶ 88). She also alleges that "[i]n November 2014, Plaintiff was called crazy and hallucinating by Dr. Virginia Weaver, PHS, staff that conduct the Federal Occupational [*28]  Health Assessment." (Id. ¶ 89). Plaintiff presumably brings these "claims" pursuant to Georgia law, but "state law tort claims brought by a federal employee against a supervisor because of a personnel decision fall under and are preempted by the CSRA." Burl v. Principi, 181 Fed. Appx. 760, 762 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished decision) (affirming dismissal of state law invasion of privacy claim brought by federal employee); Wonders v. McHugh, No. 1:12-CV-817-WKW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58065, at *12-16 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 4, 2013) (finding state law defamation claims to be preempted by the CSRA where they were "based upon acts closely intertwined with [the plaintiff's] employment"), adopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57109 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 22, 2013). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Ninth Claim for "Racism, Defamation and Slander" be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.

H. HIPAA/Privacy Act (Tenth Claim)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the HIPAA and Privacy Acts "when her medical information was given to Carmen Gaffney, labor relations staff[,] from supervisor Sharlyn Simon in July 2014." (Doc. 32 ¶ 90). Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and its implementing regulations "generally prohibit covered entities from using or disclosing 'protected health information.'" Murphy v. Dulay, 768 F.3d 1360, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing 45 C.F.R. § 164.508(a)(1)). Plaintiff's [*29]  HIPAA claim fails, however, because "no private right of actions exists under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act." Crawford v. City of Tampa, 397 Fed. Appx. 621, 623 (11th Cir. 2010) (unpublished decision). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's HIPAA claim be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.
The undersigned also finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief under the Privacy Act. That Act provides in relevant part that "[n]o agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record would be - (1) to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties[.]" 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(1). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Act when supervisor Sharlyn Simon gave Plaintiff's medical information to Carman Gaffney, a labor relations specialist at the Department of Labor whose responsibilities included reviewing Plaintiff's request for medical leave. (Doc. 32 ¶¶ 28-29, 90). Plaintiff [*30]  has not alleged any facts to plausibly show that Gaffney did not "have a need for the record in the performance of [her] duties." 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b)(1). Accordingly, she has failed to state a claim for relief under the Privacy Act and it is therefore RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Privacy Act claim be DISMISSED.
To summarize, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that—pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)—all of Plaintiff's claims be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted except for her Rehabilitation Act claim (Second Claim) and her Title VII racially hostile work environment claim (part of Eighth Claim). The undersigned now considers Defendant's contention—made in its motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint—that Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act and Title VII claims should be dismissed because Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust them in good faith.

II. Defendant's Motion To Dismiss
Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's employment discrimination claims on the ground that Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust those claims in good faith. (Doc. 36-1 at 5-8). Defendant also contends that to the extent that Plaintiff's discrimination claims rest on any discrete act occurring prior to July 6, 2014, [*31]  those claims are not timely. (Id. at 8-9). Plaintiff also moves to dismiss Plaintiff's 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985 claims and her state law claims as preempted by the CSRA, moves to dismiss Plaintiff's WPA claim for failure to administratively exhaust it, and moves to dismiss her HIPAA and Privacy Act claims for failure to state a claim. (Id. at 9-18). As discussed above, the undersigned has recommended that with the exception of Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim (Second Claim) and her Title VII racially hostile work environment claim (part of Eighth Claim), all of her other claims be dismissed as discussed above, and therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion to dismiss be GRANTED as to those claims the undersigned has recommended be dismissed. The undersigned now considers whether Plaintiff has in good faith exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to her Rehabilitation Act and Title VII racially hostile work environment claims.

A. Administrative Exhaustion
"A federal employee must pursue and exhaust her administrative remedies as a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a Title VII action." Holland v. Sebelius, 51 F. Supp. 3d 1357, 1365 (N.D. Ga.), adopted by 51 F. Supp. 3d 1357, 1360 (N.D. Ga. 2014). That exhaustion requirement also applies to disability discrimination claims brought pursuant to [*32]  the Rehabilitation Act. See Gaillard v. Shinseki, 349 Fed. Appx. 391, 392 (11th Cir. 2009). "There is a theme in the Eleventh Circuit precedents that in determining whether an employee has exhausted h[er] administrative remedies, courts are to consider whether the complainant made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations and to provide all of the relevant, specific information available to her." Holland, 51 F. Supp. 3d at 1372. "The reasoning behind this is that the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to give the agency the information it needs to investigate and resolve the dispute between the employee and the employer." Id. When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, "'it is proper for a judge to consider facts outside of the pleadings and to resolve factual disputes so long as the factual disputes do not decide the merits and the parties have sufficient opportunity to develop a record.'" Tillery v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 402 Fed. Appx. 421, 424 (11th Cir. 2010) (unpublished decision) (quoting Bryant v. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1376 (11th Cir. 2008)).

B. Plaintiff's Efforts To Exhaust Administrative Remedies 2
In September 2014, Plaintiff filed her First Administrative Complaint, EEOC Case No. 430-2015-00298X, in which she alleged that she "suffered workplace harassment between June and November of 2013, perpetrated by Antonio Villoch, [*33]  her supervisor" based on her race, age, sex, religion, and/or disability. (See Doc. 36-2 at 6-7). The actions alleged in support of that complaint generally mirror those alleged in her Amended Complaint. (Compare Doc. 36-2 at 6-7 with Doc. 32). Plaintiff alleged that "this harassment culminated with an incident that occurred on November 19, 2013, where she had to be escorted from her workplace by the Atlanta Police Department because she was afraid for her life." (Doc. 36-2 at 7). She alleged that she became disabled as a result, and took Family Medical Leave through February 14, 2014, then sought leave without pay while she pursued a workers' compensation claim appeal. (Id.). She further alleged that she was denied additional leave in June and July 2014, which forced her to return to work. (Id. at 7-8). Plaintiff sent the Agency letters from her medical providers in June and July 2014 stating that she needed to be transferred to a different department as an accommodation for her Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD. (Id. at 8). She then filed her First Administrative Complaint. (Id.). The Agency issued a Report of Investigation on the First Administrative Complaint on June 11, 2015, and Plaintiff requested [*34]  a hearing with the EEOC on June 1, 2015. (Id.). The parties then engaged in discovery. (See Doc. 19-6; Doc. 19-7; Doc. 19-8; Doc. 41 at 81-115). Although Plaintiff responded to Defendant's discovery requests (see Doc. 19-7), Defendant asserts that Plaintiff "refused to provide relevant documents, and only partially answered DOL's interrogatories" (Doc. 36-1 at 3) and therefore filed a motion to compel on October 9, 2015 (Doc. 19-8). That motion was apparently never decided.
In the meantime, on December 18, 2014 Plaintiff sought counseling on her Second Administrative Complaint, EEOC Case No. 510-2015-00392X, and in January 2015 she emailed a formal complaint to the Agency's EEO Director, Samuel Rhames, even though the Agency had instructed her to send the complaint to the Director of the Civil Rights Center at the U.S. Department of Labor at a specified address. (Doc. 36-2 at 8-9). She alleged disability discrimination and failure to accommodate, she described her unsuccessful efforts to be transferred between June of 2014 and January 2015, and she asserted that she needed to be transferred away from Villoch. (Id. at 9). The Agency apparently overlooked Plaintiff's email to Rhames and did not [*35]  investigate that complaint. (Id.). Plaintiff resent her complaint to Rhames "several more times via email and once by mail, but she did not double-check the instructions she had received regarding where her complaint should be filed." (Id.). She then filed a request for a hearing with the EEOC's Miami office on August 3, 2015, after the 180-day investigatory period had expired. (Id.). On August 21, 2015, the Agency moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of administrative exhaustion and improper venue, but after Plaintiff provided proof that she had sent the complaint to Mr. Rhames, the Agency moved to withdraw its motion to dismiss and requested that it be allowed to investigate Plaintiff's complaint and to transfer venue to the Atlanta EEOC office. (Id. at 9-10). Plaintiff moved for default judgment. (Id. at 10). The Miami office transferred the case but did not rule on Plaintiff's motion for default judgment or the Agency's request for leave to investigate the complaint and neither did the Atlanta District Office following transfer. (Id.).
Nevertheless, the Agency processed the Second Administrative Complaint and on November 23, 2015 the Agency accepted the following issue:
Whether EEO officials in OASAM [*36]  harassed you and discriminated against you on the bases of race, color, disability, religion, age, sex, and national origin, and in reprisal for prior EEO activity when they denied your reasonable accommodation by forcing you to accept reassignment to a full-time position that would have violated your medical restrictions.
(Id.). During its investigation, the Agency's EEO investigator requested that Plaintiff provide an affidavit, but she refused to do so because the case was pending before the EEOC and therefore she believed that the Agency did not have authority to conduct the investigation. (See Doc. 19-10 at 6; Doc. 19-11 at 3-6; Doc. 19-12). The investigator obtained affidavits from other witnesses and reviewed exhibits and issued a Report of Investigation on March 3, 2016. (Doc. 19-10).
Plaintiff filed this action in federal court on January 6, 2016. (Docs. 1, 2). The Complaint "encompasses all of the claims in her two EEO cases [then] pending before the Atlanta EEOC." (Doc. 36-2 at 11). The Agency moved to dismiss Plaintiff's hearing requests "since the Complainant is trying to have the same claims heard in two different forums." (Id.). On March 27, 2017, an EEOC Administrative [*37]  Judge granted the Agency's motions and dismissed Plaintiff's requests for hearing because "29 C.F.R. 1614.107(a)(3) requires the dismissal of a complaint that presents the same issues as are pending in a complaint that is filed in federal court." (Id. at 13).

C. Analysis
Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to cooperate in good faith with the administrative proceedings by failing to respond fully to the Agency's discovery requests during the First Administrative Complaint proceedings before the EEOC, and by failing to cooperate with the Agency's investigation of her Second Administrative Complaint. (Doc. 36-1 at 6-7). The undersigned finds that Plaintiff has shown that she administratively exhausted both her First and her Second Administrative Complaints. As to her first complaint, Case No. 430-2015-00298X, the undersigned notes that Plaintiff did respond to the Agency's discovery requests (see Doc. 19-7), and while her responses were not entirely complete, the undersigned does not find that they were so deficient that they show that she failed to exhaust her remedies in good faith. The fact that Defendant filed a motion to compel is not dispositive, particularly where no ruling on that motion ever issued. The undersigned [*38]  observes that Plaintiff also provided a 10-page affidavit in support of her EEO complaint (Doc. 19-3), the Agency's EEO investigator was able to investigate her complaint, including reviewing affidavits provided by Plaintiff and other witnesses and numerous documents attached to those affidavits, and issue a Report of Investigation (ROI) (Doc. 19-4), which Plaintiff often referred to in her responses to Defendant's discovery requests (Doc. 19-7). Given the amount of information Plaintiff provided about her complaint as well as other information the Agency's investigator obtained, it appears the Agency was able to obtain "the information it needs to investigate and resolve the dispute between the employee and the employer." Holland, 51 F. Supp. 3d at 1372. The undersigned does not find that the deficiencies in Plaintiff's discovery responses warrant a finding that she failed to administratively exhaust her claims in good faith.
Plaintiff's refusal to provide an affidavit to the Agency's EEO investigator in connection with her second complaint, Case No. 510-2015-00392X, is more troubling. She does not dispute that she refused to provide the affidavit (see Doc. 19-12; Doc. 41 at 11), but in light of the procedural posture [*39]  of her EEOC case, the undersigned finds that that refusal does not evidence a failure to exhaust her remedies in good faith. According to the EEOC Administrative Judge who dismissed her EEOC cases, the Agency had requested leave to investigate her complaint which was then pending with the EEOC, but no ruling was ever issued on that request, either by the Miami EEOC or the Atlanta EEOC offices. (See Doc. 36-2 at 10). Plaintiff's belief that the Agency did not have the authority to investigate her complaint appears reasonable in light of the fact that Plaintiff had filed her request for hearing with the EEOC after the 180-day investigatory period expired with no action by the Agency, her complaint was pending before the EEOC when the Agency requested leave to investigate her complaint, and no such leave had been given when the Agency began investigating it and requested Plaintiff to provide an affidavit. (Id.). The undersigned also notes that even without the requested affidavit, the EEO investigator was able to review Plaintiff's formal complaint, including a 10-page affidavit and supporting documents (Doc. 19-9), as well as other witness affidavits and numerous documents, and she was [*40]  able to prepare a ROI about Plaintiff's complaint (Doc. 19-10). Accordingly, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff's refusal to provide an affidavit during the Agency investigation of her Second Administrative Complaint does not support a finding that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies in good faith.
Because the undersigned finds that Plaintiff administratively exhausted the claims raised in her First and Second Administrative Complaints, which include her Title VII racially hostile work environment and Rehabilitation Act claims, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion to dismiss those claims for lack of administrative exhaustion be DENIED.

III. Plaintiff's Second Motion For Appointment Of Counsel (Doc. 34)
Plaintiff previously requested appointment of counsel (Doc. 5), and the Court denied that motion (Doc. 7). Plaintiff renews her motion and asserts that she has diligently sought to obtain legal representation, she cannot afford to retain an attorney, the rigors of self-representation are harming her mental and physical health, and she lacks the legal skills to litigate her case. (Doc. 34). As the Court found in its previous Order, Plaintiff has not pointed to exceptional [*41]  circumstances which would justify the appointment of counsel in this case. Her allegations and claims do not appear to be "so novel and complex as to require the assistance of a trained practitioner." Fowler v. Jones, 899 F.2d 1088, 1096 (11th Cir. 1990). Nor has she shown that she lacks the "ability to gather and present crucial facts" about her case. Donohoe v. Food Lion Stores, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d 1319, 1323 (N.D. Ga. 2003). In fact, as discussed above, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has adequately stated a Title VII racially hostile work environment claim and a Rehabilitation Act claim and has recommended that those claims proceed, even in the face of Defendant's contentions as to lack of administrative exhaustion.
Therefore, Plaintiff's second motion to appoint counsel (Doc. 34) is DENIED. See Donohoe, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 1323 (denying motion to appoint counsel because "[t]he presentation of evidence and arguments on [the plaintiff's claim] are not so complex that Plaintiff cannot handle them on his own . . . . To this point, Plaintiff is adequately representing himself in this case, and the Court sees no reason why Plaintiff cannot continue to adequately represent himself").

Summary
It is ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion for appointment of counsel (Doc. 34) be DENIED.
It is RECOMMENDED that the following claims be DISMISSED pursuant [*42]  to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted: Title VII disparate treatment claims based on race, color, religion, and sex discrimination (First Claim); violations of the ADEA for age discrimination (Third Claim); violations of Title VII for retaliation/reprisal (Fourth Claim); violation of the WPA (Fifth Claim); violations of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-5-90 and 16-5-91 for stalking and harassment (Sixth Claim); violations of "Constitutional Rights" (Seventh Claim) (see Doc. 32 ¶ 3); violation of Title VII for hostile work environment based on sex or religion (part of Eight Claim); "racism, defamation and slander" (Ninth Claim); and violation of HIPAA/Privacy Act" (Tenth Claim).
It is further RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. 36) be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Specifically, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion to dismiss be DENIED as to Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim (Second Claim) and her Title VII racially hostile work environment claim (part of Eighth Claim) and that it be GRANTED as to all other claims in light of the undersigned's recommendation that all other claims be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). To make clear, if the District Judge adopts this Report and Recommendation, [*43]  the only claims proceeding in this case will be Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim (Second Claim) and her Title VII racially hostile work environment claim (part of Eighth Claim), and all other claims will be dismissed.
IT IS SO ORDERED, REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED this 9th day of January, 2018.
