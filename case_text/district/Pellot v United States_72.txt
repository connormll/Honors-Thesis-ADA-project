MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the court on motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, United States of America, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on December 7, 2009 (the "Motion"). (Docket Nos. 37, 38 and 39.) Plaintiff opposed the same on January 29, 2010. (Docket Nos. 44, 45 and 46.) The defendant filed a reply brief on February 25, 2010. (Docket No. 49.) Plaintiff filed a surreply to the defendant's arguments on March 23, 2010. (Docket No. 56.) This matter was referred to me for report and recommendation on April 12, 2010. (Docket No. 57.) Having considered the arguments of the parties and for the reasons set forth below, I recommend that the defendant's motion be GRANTED.
I. [*2]  FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff was employed by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service ("AAFES") beginning in 1993. (Docket No. 38, at 1-2, ¶ 3 and Docket No. 45, at 1, ¶ 3.) Plaintiff worked at Popeye's at the Fort Buchanan Exchange as Food Activity Foreman since 2001. (Docket No. 38, at 1-2, ¶ 3 and Docket No. 45, at 5, ¶ 2.) While other foremen were required to have rotating schedules, including night and weekend shifts, plaintiff had a consistent schedule, working the day shift exclusively, Mondays through Fridays from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.1 (Docket No. 38, at 2, ¶ 5 and Docket No. 45, at 1, ¶ 5.) Prior to November 2006, the Food Court Manager and plaintiff's second-line supervisor, Mr. Joseph Ferrera, allowed plaintiff to work only the day shift in order to be home at night to care for her husband who has a serious medical condition. (Docket No. 45, at 6, ¶ 11 and Docket No. 45-3, at 57-58.)
Plaintiff is diabetic. (Docket No. 45, at 5, ¶ 3 and Docket No. 49, at 2, ¶ 3.) Due to her condition, plaintiff took Metformin and needed to take meal and snack breaks at specific times during the day to help control her sugar level. (Docket No. 45, at 5, ¶ 4 and Docket No. 49, at 2, ¶ 4.) Prior [*3]  to December 2006, plaintiff was allowed to take frequent breaks throughout her shift.
In November 2006, Larry Bryant became the new Food Court Manager at Fort Buchanan. As manager, Mr. Bryant was responsible for overseeing multiple restaurants within the food court, including Popeye's. (Docket No. 38, at 2, ¶ 4 and Docket No. 45, at 1, ¶ 4.) Mr. Bryant thus became plaintiff's second-line supervisor. (Docket No. 38, at 2, ¶ 6 and Docket No. 45, at 1, ¶ 6.) Mr. Bryant observed that plaintiff did not have a rotating schedule, as required of all foremen, and was taking frequent breaks.2 (Docket No. 38, at 2, ¶ 5 and Docket No. 45, at 1, ¶ 6.) Mr. Bryant was told of plaintiff's diabetes between December 2006 and January 2007, but received no indication that plaintiff was unable to perform her work duties, only that she needed breaks at specific times to control her sugar level. (Docket No. 38, at 4, ¶ 9 and Docket No. 45, at 2, ¶ 9.)
Mr. Bryant discussed changing plaintiff to a rotating schedule, as required of all Food Activity Foremen, with plaintiff's first-line supervisor, Ms. Annelise Cusani, but never put plaintiff on a rotating schedule. Instead, he changed plaintiff's schedule to 8:00 [*4]  a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Plaintiff acknowledged that the one hour schedule change was not "a big change." (Docket No. 45-3, at 49-50.)
Following correct agency procedure, Mr. Bryant also requested that plaintiff submit a medical certification documenting her medical condition and her need for breaks in order to control her sugar level. (Docket No. 38, at 5, ¶¶ 13, 15 and Docket No. 45, at 2, ¶¶ 13, 15.) Plaintiff submitted a medical statement on January 8, 2007. (Docket No. 38-7.) The first medical statement failed to include specific times in which plaintiff needed breaks. Therefore Mr. Bryant requested another medical statement that included a time schedule of the required breaks. (Docket No. 45, at 6, ¶ 16.) Mr. Robert Baker, General Manager at Fort Buchanan and plaintiff's third-line supervisor, agreed with Mr. Bryant that the first medical statement was not sufficient because it did not include specific times. (Docket No. 38, at 3, ¶ 7 and Docket No. 45, at 2, ¶ 7.) Before receiving the medical statement documenting plaintiff's diabetic condition, Mr. Bryant required that plaintiff seek approval from him before taking any snack and meal breaks, instead of allowing her to continue with [*5]  the break schedule authorized by her prior supervisor. (Docket No. 1, at 4, ¶ 16.)
Ms. María Delgado was plaintiff's Human Resource Manager at Fort Buchanan. When Mr. Bryant asked plaintiff for medical documentation, plaintiff discussed that request with Ms. Delgado. Ms. Delgado informed plaintiff that Mr. Bryant was following procedures by requesting medical documentation and that all Food Activity Foremen were required to work a rotating schedule, including night shifts. (Docket No. 38, at 3-4, ¶ 8 and Docket No. 45-3, at 2.) Ms. Delgado called the doctor directly to request a second medical statement that included specific times of the required breaks, explaining to the physician that the defendant required a medical statement listing specific break times because plaintiff's position requires a rotating schedule. (Docket No. 38, at 6, ¶ 18 and Docket No. 45, at 3, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff's doctor provided a second medical note on February 5, 2007. (Docket No. 38, at 6, ¶ 19.)
On January 11, 2007, Mr. Bryant asked plaintiff to take a test. (Docket No. 45, at 7, ¶ 25 and Docket No. 49, at 3, ¶ 25.) At the time that plaintiff was asked to take the test, she informed Mr. Bryant that she had [*6]  not yet taken her break. Mr. Bryant allowed her to take a break, but when plaintiff returned to Mr. Bryant's office to take the test, Mr. Bryant told her to return to work and come back later. When she returned to work, she became very anxious and had to stop working. She called her husband to pick her up and left work to seek medical treatment for anxiety and stress. That day she went on sick leave and never returned to work. As of June 2, 2007, plaintiff was separated from AAFES employment because she had been on Leave Without Pay status for a period of one year. (Docket No. 38, at 7, ¶¶ 22-23 and Docket No. 45, at 3, ¶¶ 22-23.)
On April 19, 2007, plaintiff filed a formal complaint against the defendant with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). She claimed that she was discriminated against because of her disability by having her schedule changed, not being allowed breaks and being yelled at. (Docket No. 38-14.) On December 12, 2007, Barbara J. Sudbury, EEOC investigator, rendered her Report of Investigation finding no disability discrimination and "that defendant's actions were legitimate, non-discriminatory and non-pretextual." (Docket No. 38, at 7, ¶ 24.)
II. PROCEDURAL [*7]  BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed the instant action against the defendant on March 12, 2008. (Docket No. 1.) Plaintiff claimed that the defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., by discriminating against her due to her diabetic medical condition, and that based on her supervisor's alleged discrimination and harassment, she was subject to a hostile work environment.
On August 21, 2008, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (Docket Nos. 7-9.) Plaintiff received the EEOC's report on January 11, 2008 as well as a letter entitled "Notice of Right to Request a Hearing or Final AAFES Decision." (Docket No. 8, at 1-2, ¶ 2.) The Notice allowed plaintiff to take one of three actions: (1) request a hearing; (2) request an AAFES decision without a hearing; or (3) withdraw the complaint and waive any further right to appeal. (Docket No. 8, at 1-2, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff chose to withdraw the complaint. Therefore no final EEOC decision was rendered. The defendant unsuccessfully argued that because plaintiff chose option three, she voluntarily closed the case and terminated the administrative proceedings. (Docket No. 8, at 2, ¶ 3.)
On February 2, 2009, [*8]  the court denied the motion for summary judgment because, under 42 C.F.R. § 1614.407(b), an employee may commence judicial proceedings if after 180 days from filing an administrative complaint, the agency has not acted on the claim. (Docket No. 18.) The court held that because 180 days had elapsed from the time she filed her complaint with EEOC, on April 18, 2007, and the time she withdrew her claim on January 17, 2008, she had exhausted her administrative remedies. (Id. at 2); Pellot v. United States, No. 08-1297 (RLA), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7195, 2009 WL 273354 (D.P.R. Feb. 2, 2009).
The defendant also filed a motion to dismiss on August 26, 2008, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), respectively. (Docket No. 10.) The defendant claimed that plaintiff (1) did not have a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act that substantially limited a major life activity, or (2) that plaintiff failed to show that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The court rejected the defendant's arguments and instead held that diabetes is a disability within the meaning of the law and that the complaint showed that plaintiff was qualified [*9]  to perform the functions of her job. Furthermore, the court held that the complaint included sufficient allegations to show that plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation for her disability was not met. The motion to dismiss was also denied because plaintiff's pleading included sufficient allegations of harassment to support a hostile work environment claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See Pellot v. United States, No. 08-1297 (RLA), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7186, 2009 WL 273407 (D.P.R. Feb. 2, 2009).
III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). "A 'genuine' issue is one that could be resolved in favor of either party, and a 'material fact' is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case." Calero-Cerezo v. United States Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) ("Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.") To succeed on a motion for summary judgment, the moving party has the burden to show that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's position. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
Once a moving party has properly supported its motion, the burden shifts to the [*10]  nonmoving party to show "that a trial-worthy issue exists that would warrant [the] Court's denial of the motion for summary judgment." Maldonado v. Muncipality of Barceloneta, 682 F. Supp. 2d 109, 127 (D.P.R. 2010) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248). The nonmoving party "must present definite, competent evidence" and not merely rely on "conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation." Maldonado v. Muncipality of Barceloneta, 682 F. Supp. 2d at 127 (quoting United States v. Union Bank for Sav. & Inv. (Jordan), 487 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 2007) and Forestier Fradera v. Municipality of Mayagüez, 440 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2006)); see also Thompson v. Coca-Cola, 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Pagano v. Frank, 983 F.2d 343, 347 (1st Cir. 1993)) ("To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the evidence offered by the adverse party cannot be 'merely colorable' or speculative.")
The court however, must consider all facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Vineberg v. Bissonnette, 548 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2008) ("In prospecting for genuine issues of material fact, we resolve all conflicts and draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor.") Summary judgment will only be denied if "after reviewing the facts and making all inferences in favor of the non-moving party . . ., the evidence on record is 'sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational fact-finder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.'" Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995)).
IV. ANALYSIS
The defendant moves this court to grant summary judgment because plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to support a Rehabilitation Act claim or a hostile work environment claim.
A. [*11]  Rehabilitation Act
Plaintiff first alleges that she was discriminated against because of her disability and was not provided a reasonable accommodation. (Docket No. 1, at 7, ¶ 38.) The defendant argues that plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Alternatively, the defendant argues that even if the court determines that plaintiff established a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the defendant has "articulated legitimate non-discriminatory and non-pretextual grounds" for the employment actions. (Docket No. 39, at 14.)
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, . . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity . . . conducted by any Executive agency . . . . " 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). "[T]he Rehabilitation Act . . . 'impose[s] an affirmative duty on employers to offer a reasonable accommodation to a disabled employee.'" González-Rodríguez v. Potter, 605 F. Supp. 2d 349, 368 (D.P.R. 2009) (quoting Calero-Cerezo v. United States Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d at 19-20). Reasonable accommodation may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified [*12]  work schedules . . . . " 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B).
Absent direct evidence of discrimination, in order to determine if a prima facie disability discrimination case under the Rehabilitation Act has been established, we apply the burden-shifting framework as set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See González-Bermúdez v. Potter, 675 F. Supp. 2d 251, 256 (D.P.R. 2009). First, plaintiff must establish a prima facie case for failure to reasonably accommodate by proving three elements: (1) that plaintiff suffers from a disability within the meaning of the statute, (2) that she is a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation, and (3) that despite the employer's knowledge of the disability, the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 802; Calero-Cerezo v. United States Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d at 20. Next, once a prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision. Finally, "[i]f the defendant is able to offer such a reason, the burden then shifts back to [plaintiff] to establish that the proffered reason is pretext intended to conceal discriminatory intent." Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 804); see Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d 328, 338 (1st Cir. 2008).
1. Prima Facie Case for Reasonable Accommodation Claim
The defendant argues that summary judgment should be granted because [*13]  plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability.
In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court held that plaintiff suffered from a disability under the law, satisfying the first element of the prima facie case. (Docket No. 19, at 8.) ("In the complaint plaintiff indicates that she was diagnosed with diabetes which she controls with Metformin and which requires that she eat at regular intervals to avoid low sugar levels. Diabetes has specifically been found to constitute an impairment within the meaning of the statute.")
The court also determined that plaintiff established that she was a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of her job with a reasonable accommodation. The defendant's motion to dismiss was likewise denied because "[a]t ¶¶ 7, 8 and 9, the [complaint] specifically states that plaintiff had been employed with AAFES for 13 years and for about 5 years held the position of Food Activity Foreman at Popeye's in Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico." (Docket No. 19, at 9.) Plaintiff contends that she can perform the essential functions of her job as long as she is allowed to take meal and [*14]  snack breaks to control her sugar levels. Therefore, for purposes of opposing defendant's summary judgment motion, plaintiff has established that she has a disability under the statute and that with a reasonable accommodation she can perform the essential functions of her job. Moreover, the defendant does not dispute that the first two prongs of the prima facie case are met.
The defendant argues that plaintiff has not met the third element because plaintiff has not established that the defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. I agree.
"In determining whether an employer has failed to provide a reasonable accommodation, [the First Circuit] follow[s] the two-step analysis outlined in Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2001)." Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d at 338. First, a plaintiff must show that the proposed accommodation would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job and that the accommodation is feasible for the employer. See Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc. 244 F.3d at 259; see also Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d at 338. Next, a defendant has the burden to show that the proposed accommodation is not feasible and would impose an undue hardship. Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc. 244 F.3d at 259.
Here, plaintiff requested that she be allowed to take meal and snack breaks throughout her shift in order to control her sugar level3 . Plaintiff does not contend, [*15]  and the defendant does not dispute, that the requested accommodation of taking breaks to control her sugar levels is unreasonable. Prior to Mr. Bryant's arrival, plaintiff was provided such an accommodation. When Mr. Bryant became her second-line supervisor he inquired into the reasoning for her frequent breaks and required that she submit medical documentation outlining the times in which she needed to take breaks. The uncontested facts show that the defendant did not deny plaintiff from taking breaks, only that she seek Mr. Bryant's approval before doing so. Due to that approval, her breaks were often not at the same time as they had previously been before Mr. Bryant's arrival. Plaintiff alleges that the defendant changed her required breaks. However she offers no evidence to support such a conclusory statement. There is no evidence offered demonstrating what her breaks were before, and then changed to by Mr. Bryant.
The evidence that plaintiff provides to support her contention that the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability is her deposition testimony that her break schedule was changed. In addition, plaintiff contends that she was watched during her [*16]  breaks and relies on conclusory statements that she was "yelled at" and harassed when she took an unapproved break.4
The uncontested facts, however, show that Mr. Bryant reasonably accommodated her shift by changing her schedule from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., to 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., a change of one hour, instead of a rotating schedule as required of all Food Activity Foremen. There is no evidence provided by plaintiff to show that her accommodation was ever denied.
On the other hand, there is evidence that defendant engaged in an interactive process to find a reasonable accommodation. In determining what accommodation is reasonable, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)5 regulations provide that, in certain situations, "it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); see also Calero-Cerezo v. United States Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d at 23 (citing Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d at 262 n.11) ("In some cases, a request for a reasonable accommodation may trigger a responsibility on the part of the employer to [*17]  enter into an interactive process with the employee to determine an appropriate accommodation.")
Although it is not clear precisely what type of interaction is required, it is clear that "the process requires open communication by both parties . . . . " Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d at 339 (emphasis added); see Calero-Cerezo v. United States Dep't of Justice, 355 F.3d at 24 (quoting García-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 648 n.12 (1st Cir. 2000)) ("As this court has noted, this interactive process 'requires a great deal of communication between the employee and employer.'") (emphasis added).
"Where a breakdown in the process has been identified, 'courts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary.'" Enica v. Principi, 544 F.3d at 339 (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1137 (7th Cir. 1996)). An employee who causes the break down in the interactive process cannot inflict liability for failure to accommodate. See Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d at 1137 ("Liability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown. But where . . . the employer does not obstruct the process, but instead makes reasonable efforts both to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possessed, ADA liability simply does not follow."); [*18]  see also Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).
Over the course of approximately one month, plaintiff and the defendant engaged in an interactive process to determine the precise accommodations needed. It is uncontested that the defendant asked plaintiff to submit medical documentation for her disability. Plaintiff complied by submitting a medical statement from her doctor recommending meal and snack breaks in order to control her blood sugar. The defendant then requested a supplemental medical statement specifically listing the times at which the breaks should occur. The defendant even contacted the physician directly in order to ensure that the second statement included all necessary information. The second medical statement was received on February 5, 2007. However plaintiff did not return to work after January 11, 2007. The interactive process broke down because she never returned to work. Therefore, plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation because by not returning to work she prohibited the defendant from being able to provide her with a reasonable accommodation.6
2. Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action
Following [*19]  the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting approach, even if plaintiff established a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendant's motion should still be granted because the defendant has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for requiring medical documentation that provides specific times for breaks and for changing plaintiff's schedule. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 802. (After establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, "[t]he burden then . . . shift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [employment decision].")
Prior to Mr. Bryant's arrival, plaintiff was allowed meal and snack breaks without documentation of her disability. However, as confirmed by Ms. Delgado, the human resources manager, it is company policy to have a medical certification documenting an employee's disability and describing the type of accommodation he or she requires. Plaintiff was aware of this policy as well as the requirement that all foremen work rotating shifts. In fact, had company policy originally been followed, Mr. Bryant would have been aware of her disability and any accommodation she required. Mr. Bryant's actions were not discriminatory, but were complying with [*20]  company policy.
Under the McDonnell Douglas analysis, the next inquiry is whether or not plaintiff provided any evidence that would lead a fact-finder to determine that such actions were taken with discriminatory intent. See Fennel v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir. 1991)) ("On summary judgment, the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to pretext and discriminatory animus.") Plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of fact that the defendant's requirement that she provide medical documentation of her disability was pretext to any discriminatory intent.
Plaintiff provides insufficient evidence to establish that the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her, where the plaintiff offers no evidence that defendant denied her from taking breaks and where the interactive process of determining the specific times in which she could take breaks broke down because plaintiff did not return to work after her sick leave. Alternatively, plaintiff failed to adduce evidence which would lead a fact-finder to conclude that the [*21]  defendant's actions were discriminatory.
I, therefore recommend that the plaintiff's failure to reasonably accommodate claim be dismissed.
B. Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiff's second claim is based on an alleged hostile work environment. (Docket No. 46, at 9.) The defendant argues that plaintiff has not demonstrated that "she was subjected to an abusive working environment on account of her disability." (Docket No. 39, at 8.) The defendant argues that even if plaintiff's allegations are taken as true, "[n]othing submitted suggests [the acts] were sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment or create an abusive working environment." (Docket No. 49, at 7.)
This circuit has recognized a hostile work environment claim under the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d 1, 5 n.1 (1st Cir. 2006); Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d at 43. "To succeed on a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must show that her 'workplace [was] permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that [was] sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of . . . employment and create an abusive working environment." Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d at 43 (quoting Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d at 7); see also Mannie v. Potter, 394 F.3d 977, 982 (7th Cir. 2005).
To determine if the workplace was permeated with discrimination that was "sufficiently severe [*22]  or pervasive" the court considers "the severity of the conduct, its frequency, and whether it unreasonably interfered with the victim's work performance." Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d at 43 (quoting Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d at 7). The United States District Court of Massachusetts has held that "a plaintiff alleging hostile work environment must demonstrate that 'the offensive conduct is severe and pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.'" Tebo v. Potter, 345 F. Supp. 2d 61, 68 (D. Mass. 2004) (quoting Rivera-Rodríquez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 265 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir. 2001)). "An objectively hostile environment is one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive." Mannie v. Potter, 394 F.3d at 982 (citing Silk v. City of Chicago, 194 F.3d 788, 805 (7th Cir. 1999)).
In Ríos-Jiménez, the First Circuit upheld the granting of the employer's motion for summary judgment holding that the incidents plaintiff pointed to, to support her claim, were "clearly insufficient to establish a contested material issue of fact . . . ." Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d at 43. The plaintiff did not "provide any substantiation for her [claim]. Instead she cross-reference[d] factual allegations contained in her brief and simply assert[ed] in conclusory fashion that these allegations, as well as general statements of law," are sufficient, but "did not put forward any evidence regarding [her employer's] allegedly hostile attitude." Id. at 43-44. Moreover, the plaintiff "made no showing [*23]  that the threat was related to her . . . disability." Id. at 44; see also Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d at 7-8 ("an employee claiming harassment must demonstrate that the hostile conduct was directed at him because of a characteristic protected by a federal anti-discrimination statute.").
Likewise, this court has also denied a hostile work environment claim because the behavior the plaintiff alleged was not sufficient to rise to the level contemplated by the ADA. Colón-Fontánez v. Municipality of San Juan, 671 F. Supp. 2d 300, 338 (D.P.R. 2009). In Colón-Fontánez, the court held that "'simple teasing,' offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the 'terms and conditions of employment.'" Id. at 336 (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)); cf. Corujo-Martí v. Triple-S, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 2d 201, 221 (D.P.R. 2007).
In the instant action, plaintiff alleges three reasons to support her claim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment: (1) changing or not permitting her to take meal breaks to control her sugar, (2) harassment by Mr. Bryant yelling at her when she was taking a meal break if he had not approved of it and constantly watching her during her breaks causing her to take breaks in her car, and (3) the incident on January 11, which caused her to leave work, seek medical attention and not return to work.
Plaintiff's allegations all occur [*24]  within approximately a one month time period. Plaintiff alleges that within this period, she was yelled at for taking unapproved breaks and watched during her breaks. These are not probative of discriminatory pretext, however. Mr. Bryant changed her schedule by one hour, which she admits is minor and allowed her to take breaks, despite her not having proper medical documentation. Although Mr. Bryant may have created an unpleasant environment for plaintiff, that is not sufficient to establish "the kind of pervasive and severe hostility resulting from protected activity as required to sustain a hostile environment claim." Colón-Fontánez v. Municipality of San Juan, 671 F. Supp. 2d at 337.
Plaintiff does assert that Mr. Bryant's behavior on January 11 caused her to leave work and seek medical treatment. However, that isolated incident is not sufficient to establish a contested material issue of fact. Even assuming that Mr. Bryant behaved as alleged, this is not sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Bryant's behavior was severe or pervasive to enable a reasonable person to find a hostile or abusive work environment. See Ríos-Jiménez v. Principi, 520 F.3d at 44 (quoting Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d at 7) ("the federal employment discrimination laws do not establish 'a general civility code' for the workplace.").
Plaintiff's claim [*25]  of hostile work environment under the Rehabilitation Act is not sustainable since she failed to provide facts demonstrating the severity or frequency of the alleged harassment, the factors used to determine whether the harassment is severe or pervasive. See Mannie v. Potter, 394 F.3d at 983. (Seventh Circuit granted summary judgment on behalf of employer where employee "barely addressed the factors . . . crucial in evaluating whether harassment is pervasive or severe . . . . "). Plaintiff does not assert any facts which would qualify as severe or pervasive or which would interfere with her work environment.
I, therefore recommend plaintiff's claim of hostile work environment also be dismissed.
