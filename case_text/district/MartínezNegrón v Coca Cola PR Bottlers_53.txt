OPINION AND ORDER

I. Introduction and Procedural Background
Víctor Martínez-Negrón ("Martínez"), Noelia López-García, and their Conjugal Partnership (collectively, "plaintiffs") filed the present complaint against Martínez's current employer, Coca-Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers ("CCPRB" or "defendant"), alleging unlawful discrimination and retaliation in violation of numerous Federal and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ("Commonwealth") laws. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 1. The claims are brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12117 et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"). Id. at ¶ 2. Plaintiffs also invoke supplemental jurisdiction over violations of the following [*2]  laws: Law 100 of June 30, 1959, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 29, § 146 et seq. ("Law 100"); Law 45 of April 18, 1935, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 11, § 7 et seq. ("Law 45"); Law 44 of July 6, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 1, § 501 et seq. ("Law 44"); Law 115 of December 21, 1991, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 29, § 194 et seq. ("Law 115"); and Article 1802 of the Commonwealth of P.R. Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 31, § 5141 ("Article 1802"). ECF No. 1 at ¶ 2.
In essence, Martínez claims that defendant, his current employer, has discriminated and retaliated against him due to his age and disability, for having requested reasonable accommodation, and for filing a discrimination charge against the defendant before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and the Anti-discrimination Unit of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources ("ADU"). Martínez alleges that he has suffered a loss of self-esteem and dignity, and that his wife and their conjugal partnership have also suffered considerable mental, emotional, and economic damage due to defendant's different harassing, discriminatory, and retaliatory actions of the defendant. Id. at ¶ 39-40. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief as well as compensatory, punitive, and double damages. ECF No. 1 at 10, 11.
Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (ECF No. 9), which plaintiffs opposed (ECF No. 13). The [*3]  Court granted in part defendant's motion, specifically plaintiffs' hostile work environment claims under the statutes invoked and their claims under Title VII, Article 1802, and Law 45. ECF No. 16. Thus, the aforementioned claims were dismissed with prejudice, and the surviving claims are those of discrimination and retaliation under ADA and ADEA, plaintiffs' supplemental claims of retaliation and discrimination due to disability and age under Laws 100 and 44, respectively, and the supplemental claim of retaliation under Law 115.
Before the Court are the following motions thereof regarding the causes of action that survived dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) as summarized above: defendant's (1) motion for summary judgment and memorandum of law in support (ECF Nos. 33, 47); (2) statement of uncontested facts (ECF No. 34), and (3) reply brief (ECF Nos. 50); as well as plaintiffs' (4) memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment (ECF No. 44), (5) responses and objections to defendants' statement of uncontested facts (ECF Nos. 44-1),1 and (6) sur-reply brief (ECF Nos. 57).
In adjudicating the dispositive motion at hand, the Court has considered not only the related motions, but also all [*4]  the documents presented by the parties in support of the same, except for those that fail to meet the authentication requirements under Fed.R.Civ.P 56(e) and which were not admitted by the opposing party. Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir. 2000); Lugo v. Avon Products, Inc., 777 F. Supp.2d 275, 280-281 (D.P.R. 2011). Specifically, the Court did not consider an untitled document containing tables and data which defendant presented in support of its summary judgment motion ECF No. 33-1, p. 7. Defendant produced it as part of Martínez's personnel file that was authenticated as a whole with an affidavit by Juan del Valle Bigelow ("Del Valle"), defendant's Senior Human Resources Director, in his capacity as the custodian of said file. ECF No. 33-1. However, Del Valle's affidavit is insufficient to properly authenticate the document in question under Fed.R.Civ.P 56(e) standards, inasmuch as Del Valle did not indicate in his affidavit that he was the author of the document, which is being presented to demonstrate Martínez's alleged productivity deficiencies on the job. The document's admissibility and its contents are being contested by plaintiffs. ECF Nos. 33 at 19 at 34, 44, at 5, 50 at 4. Furthermore, the Court did not consider the progress notes from Martínez's medical records with Edgardo Prieto Agostini, M.D. ECF No. 58-1. [*5]  These progress notes were filed by plaintiffs in support of their sur-reply without the requisite authentication affidavit by the aforementioned treating physician. ECF Nos. 57, 58, 58-1.

II. Factual Background
The following relevant facts are derived from the filings mentioned above and their attachments insofar as they relate to the case's material facts for summary judgment purposes. Also consistent with the summary judgment standard, the Court states the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor. See Roman v. Potter, 604 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2010) and Acevedo-Parrilla v. Novartis Ex-Lax, Inc., 696 F.3d 128, 131-132 (1st Cir. 2012).
Moreover, the Court will consider at this summary judgment stage all material facts and admissible documents included in the summary judgment-related filings, which date up August 27, 2015, even though the specific facts alleged in the complaint and responded to in the answer to the complaint are prior to their filing on September 30, 2013, and November 29, 2013, respectively. See ECF Nos. 1, 8, 34, 44-2. Martínez continues to be employed by defendant, and as indicated by the former in his charge of discrimination before the ADU, he filed said claim under the continuing-violation classification. ECF Nos. [*6]  44-3, 53-1. The alleged facts contained in the case's record that are subsequent to the filing of the administrative charge fall within the causes of action raised before the ADU, and are reiterated in the instant complaint (age and disability discrimination and retaliation on a continuing basis). ECF No. 1.
Martínez, born on October 3, 1958, is currently fifty-seven years old. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 2, 44-1 ¶ 2. He began his employment with CCPRB on May 12, 1994, where he has remained continuously employed in various warehouse positions. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 3, 44-1 ¶ 3. CCPRB is a corporation authorized to do business in Puerto Rico and has continuously employed in excess of 20 persons at all times. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 1, 44-1 ¶ 1. Martínez's performance was rated highly by defendant for several years, as evidenced in company memoranda dated 1999, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. ECF Nos. 53-4, 44-6. In each of those memos, Martínez was informed of a salary raise resulting from his performance, and was commended for his effort and dedication to his work. Id.
Throughout Martínez's years at CCPRB, defendant's product portfolio grew considerably, from 9 products at the beginning of his employment, [*7]  to 32 in 2001, to 83 by 2012. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 10, 44-1 ¶ 10. Additionally, the stock-keeping unit of available products at CCPRB increased from 95 in 1995 to 1,280 in 2015. This represents an increase of over 852%, with annual sales of over 800 million dollars. ECF Nos. 34 ¶12 , 44-1 ¶ 12.
The dramatic increase in products required an expansion of CCPRB's warehouses and substantial changes in the manner, equipment and procedures used by the warehouse department and its supervisors to adequately manage the increased product volume and diversity. ECF Nos. 34 ¶10, 44-1 ¶ 10. CCPRB evaluates its procedures, systems and operations on an ongoing basis to maximize efficiency, reduce costs and increase profits. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 11 , 44-1 ¶ 11.
The case's record is devoid of information regarding plaintiff's job, including his performance, for the period corresponding with the aforementioned memo of 2010 until July of 2012. ECF Nos. 44-6, 33-1. During that time, he worked as Senior Warehouse Supervisor in the Bayamón warehouse under the supervision of Roberto Rivera ("Rivera"), Senior Operations Manager, who was responsible for the dispatch and handling of CCPRB products and supervising employees' [*8]  attendance and productivity. ECF Nos. 33-1 at14, 44-2 ¶ 16. On July 26, 2012, while Martínez worked as Senior Warehouse Supervisor in the Bayamón Warehouse under the supervision of Rivera, Martínez received a memo from Rivera that stated as follows:
[t]he company has decided to execute a re-organizational and transfer process for some of our positions within our Warehouse operations. As part of that process, your position as Sr. Warehouse Supervisor will be re-classified as Warehouse Lead and will be transferred to the Cayey warehouse, where your position shall report to Mr. Hector Carrillo (Sr. Warehouse Lead). This change does not entail any salary adjustment nor does it affect you (sic) other fringe benefits. This change shall become effective on Monday, July 30th of 2012.
ECF Nos. 47-3 at 1, 33-1 at 14.
Plaintiff contends that notwithstanding what was stated by defendant in the above-quoted memo, his former position in the Bayamón warehouse was not eliminated or reclassified. ECF No. 44-2 ¶19. Instead, he alleges to have been replaced in said position by Carlos Ortiz, another employee who was approximately 31 years old and had less seniority and experience than Martínez. Id. Defendant [*9]  did not rebut Martínez's allegations in that respect. ECF No. 50.
Defendant considers Martínez's transfer to the Warehouse Lead position in Cayey to have been a lateral move, not only because his salary and benefits remained the same, but also since it was a transfer from one supervisory warehouse position to another. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 14 , 44-1 ¶ 14, 44-2 ¶ 12. Martínez disagrees, and deems that the transfer in question was a demotion. 44-1 ¶ 14, 44-2 ¶ 12. It is Martínez's position that in comparison with his Senior Warehouse Supervisor position in Bayamón, and even though his salary and benefits remained the same, the Warehouse Lead position in Cayey did not have any supervisory functions and duties over supervisors, and had fewer supervisory functions over warehouse workers under his charge. Id. Martínez further considers that the transfer was adverse, because "four or five months after being transferred to the Cayey and assigned to the Warehouse Lead position, [he] was transferred to an overnight shift," even though he had always worked during the day in his prior years at CCPRB. Defendant does not rebut plaintiff's allegation about the transfer to an evening shift. 44-1 ¶ 15, 44-2 [*10]  ¶ 13.
On December 5, 2012, Martínez received a memo from his supervisor at his job in Cayey, Héctor Carrillo ("Carrillo"), who is 42 years old, under the subject "Written Admonishment (Deficient Performance)." ECF Nos. 47-5 at 1-5; 33-1 at 16-17; 34 ¶ 23. The memo begins with a statement about how during Martínez's final months as a supervisor at the Bayamón warehouse, it had problems with inventory, unfinished routes, product loss, employee absenteeism and productivity, all of which improved considerably in Bayamón since Martínez's transfer to Cayey. Id. Carrillo stated that Martínez's transfer to Cayey had been as a result of the aforementioned problems in the Bayamón warehouse and regarding which Martínez was being held accountable, and that under the operational structure of the Cayey warehouse, Martínez could be provided with better supervision, guidance and performance monitoring. Id. The memo further states that in spite of the job guidance provided by Carrillo to Martínez, the latter's performance at the Cayey warehouse was deficient, particularly his "lack of sense of urgency and follow-up on warehouse transactions," which in turn resulted in losses and expenses to the company [*11]  and noted in auditors' findings. Id. Carrillo included examples of some of the performance deficiencies, such as: errors in the preparation of delivery routes (out of 100 routes, 25 had errors), a box-handling rate of around 150 boxes of merchandise per hour when the Cayey average was around 190, and failure to dispatch "short pick" inventory. Id. Carrillo ends the December 5, 2012, memo by indicating that Martínez's deficiencies constituted a violation of company policies and procedures for below-average performance and negligence, which resulted in losses to the company. Accordingly, the memo was being issued as a disciplinary measure in the form of a written admonishment. Id.
Plaintiff emphatically denies the content of Carrillo's December 5, 2012, written-admonishment memo. ECF No. 44-1 ¶ 23, 44-2 ¶¶ 23-24. In support of his denial, plaintiff produced a copy of an e-mail that he received from Ms. Sylvia R. González on January 14, 2013, who identified herself in said correspondence as "Contractor-Audits Cayey." ECF Nos. 53-3, 44-5. In essence, it was a congratulatory e-mail to Martínez regarding his "effort, dedication, concern and positive attitude in organizing, maintaining, changing, [*12]  and cleaning" the picking area over which Martínez was in charge as Warehouse Lead in Cayey, "which was in conditions that were not very pleasant or comfortable to operate." Id. She also pointed out his "willingness to serve and attend to any need our department has. Thank you [Martínez], for always going the extra mile..." Id. In addition, Martínez produced a copy of a $1,000 productivity bonus payment issued to him by the company on February 6, 2013, which he alleges resulted from his performance as warehouse supervisor in 2012. ECF Nos. 53-2, 44-4, 44-1 ¶ 23, 44-2 ¶ 20.
Defendant rebutted González's e-mail through an affidavit by defendant's Senior Human Resources Director, José del Valle ("Del Valle"). ECF No. 50-1. In his affidavit, Del Valle undermined both González's role in the company, indicating that González was an "independent contractor of CCPRB's governance department, for which she "has no authority nor is qualified to evaluate Martínez' [sic] nor performance as a supervisor." ECF No. 50-1 ¶ 9. Del Valle further stated that the productivity bonus paid to Martínez was "based on the efficiency results of the warehouse as a whole, not his specific performance," and that [*13]  the bonus in question had been paid to all supervisory and managerial employees of the warehouse. Id.¶ 4.
Martínez alleges that on February 19, 2013, he was diagnosed with severe major depression by a psychiatrist, Dr. Edgardo Prieto Agostini. ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶9, 44-2, ¶2-3. He further alleges that his depression was caused by "my working environment as well as due to my terms and conditions of employment." Id. Moreover, he claims that due to his depression, he is substantially limited in the following life activities: "sleep, eat, house chores, relate with other persons, concentrate, long and short term memory process; nevertheless, [he] is able to perform the functions and duties of my position [at work]." Id.
According to Martínez, soon after being diagnosed with severe major depression, he requested Carrillo, as a reasonable accommodation, to be transferred back to his previous position in Bayamón, which Carrillo denied. ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶9, 44-2, ¶6.
Martínez asserts that:
Carrillo almost immediately after I was diagnosed of suffering from a severe major depression on February 2013, constantly, almost on a daily basis, told to me, even as of the day of the filing of the Complaint that: [*14]  I was old and crazy; that I should leave and seek social security benefits; that due to my mental and emotional condition I had become a problem for the defendant; and that if I started requesting leaves due [sic] my depression I was going to be discharged.
ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶9, 44-2 ¶ 7.
On April 2, 2013, Carrillo issued a memo to Martínez under the subject "Job Suspension & Final Written Admonishment." ECF Nos. 47-6 at 1-5; 33-1, at 18-20; 34 ¶¶ 25-26. As stated by Carrillo, Martínez was being suspended from his job without pay from April 2 to April 5, 2013, with a return to work date of Monday, April 8, 2013, for his continuing poor job performance in spite of the December 5, 2012, disciplinary memo and subsequent conversations regarding performance issues. Id. In the April 2, 2013, memo, Carrillo indicated to Martínez that "[w]e have not observe [sic] sufficient initiative on your part as to avoid recurrence of situations which are repeated within our department, provoking huge losses to our Company and for our clients." ECF Nos. 47-6 at 3.
As examples of the performance deficiencies for which Carrillo held Martínez accountable, Carrillo mentioned the following: (1) failure to dispatch [*15]  thousands of boxes during the months of December of 2012, February of 2013, and March of 2013; (2) hundreds of dispatch errors during each of the previously mentioned months; (3) high incidence of absenteeism and tardiness among the employees who Martínez supervised; and (4) failure to produce productivity reports requested by Carrillo. ECF Nos. 47-6.
Regarding Martínez's deficiencies in his supervisory duties in particular, Carrillo mentioned the following examples: (1) one of the workers under Martínez's supervision had accrued over 29 unjustified absences without Martínez having taken the corresponding disciplinary actions, for which Carrillo delegated attendance management to another supervisor; (2) worker José Rivera was out sick for seven days, but Martínez did not complete the related administrative process; and (3) Martínez failed to prepare, as per Carrillo's request, a draft counseling letter or corrective action to a worker who repeatedly failed to dispatch and committed other dispatching errors. Carrillo's suspension memo of April 2, 2013, ends with a notice that future performance deficiencies or other violations of company policies and procedures would be grounds for subsequent [*16]  disciplinary actions, including dismissal. ECF Nos. 47-6.
Plaintiff denies the content of the April 2, 2013, suspension memo by Carrillo, countering that the January of 2013 congratulatory e-mail by González and the February of 2013 performance bonus issued to him by the company contradict the poor-performance assertions in Carrillo's suspension memo. ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶¶ 25-26; 44-2, ¶ 28. Furthermore, Martínez indicates that Carrillo never met with him after the December 5, 2012, memo, and that the specific instances of poor performance contained in the suspension memo are unsupported by any documents and contrary to warehouse reports that Martínez reviewed daily. Martínez did not produce any reports in support of his statement under oath. Id.
Carrillo and Del Valle met with Martínez on April 2, 2013, to give him and discuss the suspension memo. Id. According to Martínez, at that meeting:
Del Valle told me that I should resign and sign a release agreement, in order to receive a severance payment, and that if I did not sign the release agreement, they would prepare a case against me to terminate me for just cause and not pay me anything. Del Valle also told me that my performance was not [*17]  100% due to my age, and because I was old and had many years in the Company. Del Valle told Martínez that because of my age, my skills had diminished and I was not the same as when I started working at the Company 20 years ago, thus, he told me that I should sign that settlement agreement before being discharged.
ECF No. 44-2 ¶ 31. (The case's record at this stage is devoid of any separation and/or release agreement, and of any evidence as to whether or not such a document was presented to Martínez.)
Martínez did not return to work from his suspension on April 8, 2013, as scheduled. ECF Nos. 34 ¶¶ 27-33, 34; 47-7, 47-8, 47-9, 47-10, 33-1 at 21-26. Instead, he provided defendant with a medical certificate issued by Dr. Edgardo Prieto Agostini ("Dr. Prieto"), Martínez's treating psychiatrist, stating that "patient will be recovering from today until April 22, 2013, due to the severity of his emotional condition." Id. The certificate included a diagnosis code of 296.23, which corresponds to major depression. Dr. Prieto issued subsequent medical certificates extending Martínez's sick leave under the same diagnosis until May 30, 2013. Id. Additionally, after having met with CCPRB's occupational [*18]  nurse, Martínez filed an application for non-occupational, short-term disability leave and benefits under defendant's policy for the same medical condition. Id. In said application, Dr. Prieto indicated that Martínez's period of disability leave under the aforementioned diagnosis would extend until July 7, 2013. Id. Subsequently, Dr. Prieto issued a certificate indicating that Martínez was fit to return to work without restrictions on July, 12, 2013, received by the company on that date, and Martínez requested to be reinstated. Id. Defendant reinstated him on July 23, 2013. Id.
Meanwhile, on April 9, 2013—that is, the day after Martínez went on leave as summarized above, he filed a charge of continuing-action, age—and disability-based discrimination and retaliation before the ADU. ECF Nos. 44-3, 53-1. In essence, Martínez alleged in his charge that after many years at defendant company with excellent performance and various promotions, he was demoted in July of 2012 by means of the transfer to the Lead Supervisor position at the Cayey warehouse. Id. Martínez alleges in his charge that he was replaced in his former position in Bayamón by a worker who is around 20 years his junior, and [*19]  since his transfer, defendant "has begun a campaign of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against [him] on the basis of [his] age, and later on the basis of [his] disability and opposition and participation against [defendant's] discriminatory practices." Id.
Upon Martínez's return to work on July 23, 2013, Carrillo provided him with a memo outlining changes in his duties and his division of the Cayey operations. ECF Nos. 34 ¶¶ 36-37; 47-11, 33-1 at 28-29, 31-44. Going forward, Martínez would be Route Process Lead in charge of the following: supervising administrative personnel; monitoring area productivity; assuring accuracy level of productivity in route process in order to minimize dispatch errors by thirty percent; correcting product delivery at expected times; monitoring headcount and progressive discipline at a monthly basis; enforcing cleanliness and GMP compliance; providing routes at expected times; providing productivity reports of boxes per hour, with a minimum of 170 boxes per hour; providing "OOS" and "not loaded" reports; and fostering teamwork. Id. According to Martínez, he informed Carrillo that based on his experience, the quotas imposed upon him were impossible [*20]  to achieve. ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶¶ 36-37; 44-2, ¶¶ 41-42.
On November 18, 2013, Carrillo issued Martínez a memo under the subject of "Deficient Performance and Change of Work Area," which he discussed with Martínez on that date. ECF Nos. 34 ¶¶ 38-39; 47-12, 33-1 at 45-48. In essence, the memo contains a summary by Carrillo of the history of performance-based disciplinary actions taken against Martínez, and an account of what Carrillo deemed to be continuing performance deficiencies. Id. Some of the deficiencies pointed out were: failure to use system tools that are established and required for completing tasks in Martínez's area, failure to provide a work plan that had been requested repeatedly to address deficiencies in Martínez's work area, and repeated failures to dispatch large amounts of products. Id. Carrillo indicated in the memo that Martínez's area had been operating much more efficiently during Martínez's leave of absence, just as the Bayamón operation improved after his transfer to Cayey. Id. Additionally, Carrillo indicated in the November 18, 2013, memo that:
instead of accepting self-responsibility and taking measures to improve your performance, you, on September 30th of 2013, [*21]  filed a Complaint against the Company. Since stated date, your hands-down attitude, resistance and non-compliance with our instructions and your blatant abandonment have scaled up dramatically. Which we think, arises from your desire to prompt your dismissal.
ECF Nos. 47-12 at 3, 33-1 at 46.
In the memo, Carrillo further indicated to Martínez that his negligence and deficient performance had been object of remarks during audit procedures, and had caused losses and unnecessary expenses to defendant. Carrillo concluded that even though the above-summarized issues justified a dismissal, in consideration for the time that Martínez had worked for CCPRB, he would be granted one last opportunity by means of a position transfer. Said transfer would be from the Picking Ramp to the Standard Ramp, where the volume of the products moved is lower. As stated in the memo, the transfer was "under the anticipation that [Martínez] would then be able to carry out the expectation of stated position in a satisfactory manner." ECF Nos. 47-12 at 5, 33-1 at 48.
Martínez considers the transfer to the Standard Ramp area a demotion, because it was a position of fewer responsibilities than the previous one in Cayey. [*22]  ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶¶ 38-40; 44-2, ¶44. He also denies as "false and incorrect" the account of the performance deficiencies noted by Carrillo in the November 18, 2013, memo, and alleges that he did not incur in any such deficiencies. ECF No. 44-2 ¶¶ 45-46.
On November 20, 2013, Armando Troche ("Troche"), Warehouse Dispatch Control Manager, provided a memo to Martínez under the subject of "Primary Responsibilities to be Effected during your Shift as to Maintain your Operation Efficient at Conventional P.M. Area." ECF Nos. 34 ¶¶ 42-43; 44-1 ¶¶ 42-43, 47-13, 33-2 at 1-3. It covered work and meal hours, route, merchandise, and loading verification, coordination and follow-up procedures, reports to be completed, Conventional Area conditions, and supervisory duties regarding management of overtime of administrative and union workers in his area. Id.
On October 6, 2014, Troche issued a memo to Martínez under the subject of "Final Written Admonishment (Deficient Performance, Crass Negligence, False Information, Improper Behavior and Attitude, Failing to comply with obligation to implement Company Norms & Policies)," which Troche discussed with Martínez the following day. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 44; 47-14, [*23]  33-2 at 4-8. In said memo, Troche stated that Martínez's performance problems continued, and were adversely affecting the company's operations. The issues addressed in the memo comprised the following: (1) unfinished routes that required unwarranted overtime by workers under Martínez's supervision; (2) continued improper attitude and conduct, and a lack of a sense of urgency or follow up regarding critical situations in merchandise deliver which resulted in loss of business and unnecessary expenses; (3) providing false information regarding a union employee under Martínez's supervision regarding absences that led to said employee's dismissal and subsequent re-hiring by defendant when the information provided by Martínez that led to said dismissal was subsequently disaffirmed; and (4) lack of supervision, orientation or discipline by Martínez regarding the absenteeism problem of a worker under his supervision. Id. The memo ends by outlining the six provisions of the employee handbook that Martínez had violated. Moreover, the memo indicated that this was the final written warning, and that future violations would lead to subsequent disciplinary measures, including dismissal. Id.
Plaintiffs [*24]  deny Troche's October 6, 2014, memo, alleging that it is "false and incorrect." ECF No. 44-1 ¶44. As evidenced in a copy of an e-mail sequence submitted by Martínez between Troche and him, on October 16, 2014, Martínez asked for fifteen days to respond to the memo. ECF Nos. 53-6, 44-8. Troche denied the request, stating that they had already discussed the memo on October 6, 2014, whereupon Martínez had a chance to share his position regarding the same. Id. Moreover, Troche indicated that the company has an open-door policy through which any employee is able to express any matter to a supervisor or to Human Resources, but that the October 6, 2014, memo was not subject to reconsideration, as it had already been discussed. Id. Martínez replied to Troche that when he was given the memo, he was not afforded the opportunity to discuss it, even though he had expressed that he needed to discuss it with them since he considered its contents to be false and incorrect. Id. Plaintiff further replied that when he was given the memo, he was told again that he would be discharged due to the complaint filed, that they had lost trust in him, and that he should resign before being discharged.
Martínez [*25]  received a copy of the CCPRB's employee handbook in January of 2009. ECF Nos. 34 ¶¶ 4-8; 44-1 ¶¶ 4-8, 47-2, 33-1 at 2-6. It contains both anti-discrimination and open-door policies wherein employees are required to inform as soon as possible to their supervisors or to the Human Resources Director any instance of perceived discrimination or harassment in employment. Id. Furthermore, the open door policy requires employees who seek a reasonable accommodation in employment to pursue the same through their immediate supervisors and the Human Resources Director. Id. According to defendant, Martínez never filed either a complaint for discrimination or a request for reasonable accommodation with the company. ECF No. 34 ¶9.
Plaintiff denies defendant's assertion (ECF No. 44-1 ¶9), and counters that:
[I] complained, since the summer of 2012, and even as of the day of the filing of the Complaint, approximately on a bi-weekly basis, to Del Valle at human resources, about the different discriminatory comments because of my age, disability and request for reasonable accommodation, and my discrimination complaints, nevertheless, Del Valle never took any type of corrective action nor conducted any [*26]  investigation. As a result, Carrillo and even Del Valle continued with their discriminatory actions against me.
ECF Nos. 44-1 ¶29, 44-2 ¶33.
Regarding requests for accommodation by Martínez, he requested, and defendant granted him, 12 leaves of absence under FMLA and non-occupational short-term disability from April 8 through June 22, 2015, ranging in length from one day to several weeks. ECF Nos. 34 ¶ 45, 47-15 to 47-26, 33-2 at 9-40. The aforementioned leaves were requested and granted pursuant to medical certificates by Dr. Prieto, Martínez's treating psychiatrist, appointments with said physician, and partial hospitalizations at San Juan Capestrano mental-health clinic as prescribed by Dr. Prieto. Id. Moreover, plaintiff alleges that upon being diagnosed with major depression in February of 2013, he requested from Carrillo, as reasonable accommodation, to be reassigned to his previous position in Bayamón, which was being occupied by Carlos Ortiz. ECF No. 44-1 ¶ 9; 44-2 ¶¶ 4-5. Martínez further alleges that Carrillo denied said accommodation, and that he has continued to work in Cayey after his transfer there in July of 2012 and continues working there presently. Id., ECF No. 44-2 [*27]  ¶ 55.

III. Summary Judgment Standard
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 ("Rule 56"), "[s]ummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits." Thompson v. Coca-Cola Co., 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting the former Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).2 When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court "must scrutinize the evidence in the light most agreeable to the nonmoving party, giving that party the benefit of any and all reasonable inferences." Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).
However, the non-movant "must point to competent evidence and specific facts to stave off summary judgment" in order to defeat a properly-supported motion for summary judgment. Tropigas de P.R., Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, 637 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 2011). Thus, the court may "afford no evidentiary weight to conclusory allegations, empty rhetoric, unsupported speculation, or evidence which, in the aggregate, is less than significantly probative." Id. (quoting Rogan v. City of Boston, 267 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2001)). In addition, the "absence of evidence on a critical issue weighs against the party—be it either the movant or nonmovant—who would bear the burden of proof on that issue at trial." Alamo-Rodríquez v. Pfizer Pharma., 286 F. Supp. 2d 144, 151 (D.P.R. 2003) (citing Pérez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 310 (1st Cir. 2001)).
"A dispute is genuine if the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable [*28]  jury could resolve the point in the favor of the non-moving party." Thompson, 522 F.3d at 175 (quoting Sánchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d 223, 227 (1st Cir. 1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "A fact is material if it has the potential of determining the outcome of the litigation." Maymí v. P.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008). To defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, evidence offered by the non-movant "must be significantly probative of specific facts." Pérez, 247 F.3d at 317 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986)). As a rule, "[e]vidence that is inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may not be considered on summary judgment." Vázquez v. López-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998). Finally, it is well settled that "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" is insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.

IV. Discussion
In the claims that survived the motion to dismiss, plaintiffs allege that CCBPR: (1) discriminated against Martínez because of his disability, (2) denied him reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA; (3) discriminated against him because of his age in violation of ADEA; and (4) retaliated against him in violation of ADA and ADEA for requesting reasonable accommodations and opposing the discrimination against him. In addition to bringing claims under the ADEA, ADA, and parallel Commonwealth statutes, plaintiffs also [*29]  allege that defendant is liable under Law 100 for age discrimination and retaliation, pursuant to Law 44 for disability discrimination and denial of reasonable accommodation and retaliation; and under Law 115 for retaliation. CCPRB seeks summary judgment on all the surviving claims.

A. Claims under ADEA
Martínez alleges that CCPRB has discriminated against him due to his age, in violation of ADEA. ECF No. 1. In essence, the discriminatory acts alleged are: (1) ageist remarks by three managers, (2) two position transfers, (3) a switch from a daytime to evening work schedule, (4) a suspension, and (5) several disciplinary memos. Defendant counters that age was not a factor in any employment action taken in relation to Martínez, which resulted instead from legitimate business/operational needs, Martínez's poor performance, and his repeated violation of company policies and procedures.

1. ADEA General Standards
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to "refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against [him] with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing [*30]  "that age was the 'but-for' cause of the employer's adverse action." Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 177 (2009); see also Acevedo-Parrilla, 696 F.3d at 138. Thus, in order to prevail in an ADEA claim, the plaintiff's age must have "actually played a role in [the employer's decision-making] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 141 (2000) (insertion in original); Hoffman v. Applicators Sales & Serv., Inc., 439 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2006). Plaintiff "shoulders the burden of proving that his age was the determinative factor in his discharge." Bonefont-Igaravidez v. International Shipping Corp., 659 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2011).
A claimant can establish a well-founded case of age discrimination by producing direct evidence of the same. Vesprini v. Shaw Contract Flooring Servs., Inc., 315 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 2002) "Although . . . somewhat murky, the term 'direct evidence' normally contemplates only those 'statements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear squarely on the contested employment decision.'" Vesprini, 315 F.3d at 41. When no direct evidence of discrimination exists, the plaintiff may prove his case through the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) ("McDonnell Douglas"). See Bennett v. Saint-Gobain Corp., 507 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir. 2007).
Under McDonnell Douglas, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination. The first step of this framework requires the employee to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that he/she: (1) was at least forty years old at the time of discharge [*31]  [or other adverse employment action]; (2) was qualified for his or her position; (3) was fired or otherwise subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) the employer either did not treat age neutrally or retained younger employees in the same position. Cruz v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., P.R., Inc., 699 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir. 2012); American Airlines v. Cardoza-Rodríguez, 133 F.3d 111 (1st Cir. 1998).
Once plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's termination. Cruz, 699 F.3d at 571. The defendant's burden at this stage is only a burden of production; the burden of proof always remains with the plaintiff. Domínguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 430 (1st Cir. 2000). If the defendant meets its burden, "the plaintiff no longer can rest on the initial inference of discrimination but, rather, must show that the defendant's articulated reason is pretextual." Bennett, 507 F.3d at 31 (citing Dávila v. Corporación de Puerto Rico para la Difusión Pública, 498 F.3d 9, 16(1st Cir. 2007)). Thus, at this stage, plaintiff "'must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but a pretext for discrimination.'" Reeves, 530 U.S. at 143; see Vélez v. Thermo King of Puerto Rico, Inc., 585 F.3d 441, 448 (1st Cir. 2009). Plaintiff's ultimate burden is to prove "that age was the 'but for' cause" of the adverse employment action. Id. (quoting Gross, 557 U.S. at 177); see also Torrech-Hernández v. Gen. Elec. Co., 519 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2008).

2. Ageist remarks
Martínez alleges that he has complained since [*32]  the summer of 2012, approximately on a bi-weekly basis, to the Human Resources Director (Del Valle), about the different discriminatory comments because of his age, disability, request for reasonable accommodation, and his discrimination-related filings. Further, Martínez contends that Del Valle has never taken any type of corrective action nor conducted any investigation, for which the comments have continued, particularly by Carrillo and even by Del Valle himself.
Defendant rebuts Martínez's contention by indicating that the company has in place anti-discrimination and open-door policies that are known by Martínez. Under those policies, employees are required to inform as soon as possible to their supervisors or to the Human Resources Director any instance of perceived discrimination or harassment in employment, which according to defendant, Martínez has never done.
As mentioned above, the Court dismissed plaintiff's claims of hostile work environment under all statutes invoked in the instant complaint. Thus, the Court will not consider at summary judgment those alleged remarks taken as a whole, since they could constitute a claim for hostile work environment. Quiles—Quiles v. Henderson, 439 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2006); Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).
However, as [*33]  discussed below, specific remarks in connection with other alleged adverse employment actions will be considered insofar as they may constitute "statements by a decisionmaker that directly reflect the alleged animus and bear squarely on the contested employment decision." Vesprini, 315 F.3d at 41. The alleged ageist remarks will also be considered as possible evidence of toleration of harassment regarding Martínez's claim of retaliation. Marrero v. Goya, 304 F.3d 7, 23 (1st Cir. 2002).

3. Transfer to Cayey position in July of 2012 and change to night shift were not adverse employment actions under the ADEA.3
Martínez received a memo on July 26, 2012, from Rivera, his Manager in Bayamón, informing him that pursuant to a re-organizational and transfer process for some of the positions in the company's warehouse operations, his position was to be re-classified and thus, Martínez would be transferred from his job as Senior Warehouse Supervisor in Bayamón. Specifically, Martínez was transferred to the Warehouse Lead position in Cayey under the supervision of Carrillo, the Cayey operation's Senior Warehouse Lead. Martínez alleges, in essence, that his position transfer was a discriminatory demotion due to his age, because in comparison with his Senior Warehouse [*34]  Supervisor position in Bayamón, he had fewer supervisory duties. Martínez further considers that the transfer was adverse because he was assigned to the evening shift, even though he had always worked a daytime shift for defendant. Additionally, Martínez points out that the position he held was not re-classified, and that he was replaced in the Bayamón position by Carlos Ortiz, a worker who was thirty-one years old with less experience than him.
According to defendant, Martínez's transfer was not a demotion but rather a lateral move, and as such, not an adverse employment action. Furthermore, defendant argues that Martínez's salary and benefits remained the same upon that transfer and to the present, and that the transfer was in effect a lateral move from one supervisory warehouse position to another.
After a careful review of the record and in light of applicable legal standards, the Court holds that Martínez is unable to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination regarding his transfer from the Senior Warehouse Supervisor position in Bayamón to the Warehouse Lead position in Cayey, and subsequently to the evening shift in Cayey. Specifically, he is unable to establish the third [*35]  prong of a prima facie case of age discrimination--having been subject to an adverse employment action. To be deemed adverse under applicable law, an employment action must substantially affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace, typically involving discrete changes in the terms of employment such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, and/or lower salary or benefits. Morales-Vallellanes v. Potter, 605 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2010). It must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities, but rather one in which the employee suffers a material harm or "tangible consequence." Bhatti v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 659 F.3d 64, 73 (1st Cir. 2011).
Thus, the First Circuit has held consistently that work schedule changes and lateral transfers in themselves do not constitute actionable adverse employment action unless these entail "a demotion in form or substance." Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23; see also: Gu v. Boston Police Dept., 312 F.3d 6, 14 (1st Cir. 2002) ("While Santoro did lose some responsibility because of the promotion of others, her essential job remained unchanged. When a general reorganization results in some reduction in job responsibilities without an accompanying decrease in salary, or grade, those changes cannot be dubbed adverse employment actions."); Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-40; Cham v. Station Operators, Inc., 685 F.3d 87, 94-95 (1st Cir. 2012); and Colón-Fontánez v. Municipality of San Juan, 660 F.3d 17, 41-43 (1st Cir. 2011) (alleged "elimination" of her supervisory position [*36]  did not rise to the level of material harm that amounted to an actionable adverse employment action). In fact, in Marrero, 304 F.3d at 25, a case where plaintiff was transferred from a secretarial position in Goya of Puerto Rico Inc.'s Sales and Export Division to a different secretarial position at the company's Human Resources Department, the First Court provided the following high standard for a transfer to be considered a demotion that amounts to an actionable adverse employment action:
It is not enough that Marrero felt stigmatized and punished by the transfer. A more "tangible change in duties or working conditions" is needed before we can conclude that the transfer was, in substance, a demotion. Phillips v. Collings, 256 F.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir.2001). As the Eighth Circuit recently explained, the sort of "intensified personal animus, hostility, disrespect, and ostracism" that Marrero alleged here "fails to constitute a material employment disadvantage" sufficient to transform an ostensibly lateral transfer into an adverse employment action. Jones, 285 F.3d at 714; see also Manning v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 127 F.3d 686, 693 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that evidence of "disrespect and ostracization by ... supervisors" did not establish an adverse employment action). Rather, in order to prove that the transfer was materially adverse, Marrero had [*37]  to show that Goya "[took] something of consequence from [her], say, by ... reducing her salary, or divesting her of significant responsibilities," or that it "withh[e]ld from [her] an accouterment of the employment relationship, say, by failing to follow a customary practice of considering her for promotion after a particular period of service." Blackie, 75 F.3d at 725.
In the case at hand, and in spite of Martínez's allegations to the contrary, the record shows that the Senior Warehouse Supervisor in Bayamón and the Warehouse Lead position in Cayey were substantially similar. Specifically, both positions' main duties entailed overseeing the dispatch and handling of CCPRB products and supervising warehouse employees' performance. Furthermore, Martínez's salary and benefits remained the same notwithstanding the transfer, and in February of 2013, around seven months after being transferred to Cayey, he received a performance bonus paid to warehouse supervisors. Moreover, company memoranda in the case's record discussing Martínez's performance issues in the Cayey position reveal that supervisory duties were a central part of his job as Warehouse Lead. Thus, even accepting arguendo, as alleged by Martínez, that [*38]  the Cayey position entailed fewer supervisory functions than his previous one in Bayamón, said change in duties does not meet the high standard under First Circuit case law to establish that the transfer amounted to a demotion. Thus, it does not constitute an actionable adverse employment action. Gu, 312 F.3d at 14.
Moreover, plaintiff's contention that the transfer was an adverse employment action because he was subsequently assigned to work an evening shift after being transferred fails under applicable legal standards as well. See Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-40; Gu, 312 F.3d at 14. As summarized above, a work schedule change in itself does not entail an adverse employment action absent a showing that due to that change, an employee suffered a material harm or tangible consequence that is far reaching enough to entail a demotion in form or substance. Here, Martínez fails to establish such material harm. In fact, Martínez does not provide any explanation as to how his assignment to an evening shift constituted an adverse employment action, besides stating that previously, he had always worked the day shift for defendant. "Work places are rarely idyllic retreats, and the mere fact that an employee is displeased by an employer's act or omission does [*39]  not elevate that act or omission to the level of a materially adverse employment action." Marrero, 304 F.3d at 23.
In short, Martínez fails to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADEA regarding the transfer from his Bayamón position to the Cayey job in July of 2012 and subsequent change to an evening work schedule. The transfer in question, and subsequent change in work schedule, do not constitute adverse employment actions in light of the material facts of the case and applicable legal standards. Thus, the Courts GRANTS summary judgment regarding the allegations of discrimination under the ADEA regarding plaintiffs' claims pertaining to Martínez's job transfer from Bayamón to Cayey in July of 2012, and subsequent change of work schedule to an evening shift.

4. Issues of material fact preclude summary judgment as to claim of discrimination under ADEA regarding written admonishment to Martínez of December 5, 2012, and the related disciplinary memo and suspension of April 2, 2013.
Martínez received a written admonishment memo on December 5, 2012, from Carrillo, pointing out multiple performance deficiencies, both in his previous position in Bayamón as well as his current one in Cayey. Plaintiff [*40]  rebuts the content of Carrillo's December 5, 2012, written-admonishment memo by producing a copy of González's congratulatory e-mail on January 14, 2013, as well as a copy of a $1,000 productivity bonus payment issued to him allegedly resulting from his job performance in 2012. Defendant rebutted González's e-mail through an affidavit by defendant's Human Resources Director, undermining the credibility of González's e-mail and the importance of the bonus check paid to Martínez in relation to his individual performance.
Plaintiff contends that there is a contradiction between defendant's proffered reason for his transfer from Cayey to Bayamón as stated in the July, 26, 2012, memo by Bayamón Manager, Rivera ("re-organizational and transfer process for some of our positions within our Warehouse operations"), and the reason stated by Cayey Manager, Carrillo, in his December 5, 2012, memo (Martínez's deficient performance in Bayamón). Plaintiff further alleges that the aforementioned contradiction constitutes a pretext by defendant to cover the true reason for the transfer, which according to Martínez, was his age, in violation of ADEA. Nonetheless, as discussed above, Martínez failed to [*41]  establish a prima facie case of discrimination under ADEA regarding the transfer from Bayamón to Cayey, because it does not constitute an adverse employment action under ADEA. As such, the alleged contradiction is not relevant in relation to the Bayamón-to-Cayey transfer itself, given that the transfer in question is not an actionable event under the aforementioned statute.
Notwithstanding the above, Martínez's job performance in 2012—both in Bayamón and in Cayey—is highly relevant in relation to the December 5, 2012, written admonishment that in turn led to the memo and suspension of April 2, 2013. Regarding the suspension, it is uncontested that Martínez meets the first prong of a prima facie case of discrimination under ADEA, given that he is fifty-seven years old. It is clear as well that he meets the third prong, since he was subject to an adverse employment action consisting of a temporary job suspension without pay following the December 5, 2012, and April 2, 2013 disciplinary memos.
However, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether plaintiffs can meet the second prong of the prima facie case—that is, whether or not Martínez's job performance was satisfactory. That, in turn, [*42]  raises an issue of material fact as to plaintiff's fourth prong—whether Martínez was not treated neutrally in terms of age regarding the suspension. While defendant's proffered reason for the suspension is entirely based on Martínez's alleged poor performance over the period in question, the evidence offered by plaintiff contradicts that offered by defendant regarding the quality of Martínez's performance that in turn led to his suspension. Moreover, Martínez points to a portion of his statement under penalty of perjury to demonstrate CCPRB's alleged discriminatory animus, specifically the statements allegedly made by Human Resources Director Del Valle to Martínez at the suspension-related meeting on April 2, 2013. If proven true, said statements would constitute direct evidence of age-based discriminatory animus by defendant in relation to Martínez's suspension, thus establishing the fourth prong of the prima facie case--disparate treatment due to age. Direct evidence includes "[c]omments which, fairly read, demonstrate that a decisionmaker made, or intended to make, employment decisions based on forbidden criteria." Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Vesprini, 315 F.3d at 41; and Lugo, 777 F. Supp.2d at 291 (citing Domínguez-Cruz, 202 F.3d at 433). At the summary judgment stage in claims [*43]  under ADEA, "the ultimate question...is whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired [or otherwise subject to an adverse employment action] because of his age." Vélez, 585 F.3d at 452; see also Dávila, 498 F.3d at 16 and Torrech-Hernández, 519 F.3d at 47. As further held by the First Circuit Court of Appeals regarding summary judgment adjudication in ADEA cases, "the need to order the presentation of proof is largely obviated, and a court may often dispense with strict attention to the burden-shifting framework, focusing instead on whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to make out a jury question as to pretext and discriminatory animus." Gómez-González v. Rural Opportunities, Inc., 626 F. 3d 654, 662 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 535 (1st Cir. 1996) (emphasis added).
In light of the above, the Court deems that there is a controversy of material fact that precludes summary judgment regarding Martínez's job performance in 2012 and defendant's proffered reasons for his suspension on April 2, 2013. The contradictions between the evidence presented by defendant and that presented by plaintiffs regarding Martínez's performance in 2012 would require that the Court and/or jury weigh the evidence and decide who is more credible. This, the Court is precluded from doing at this [*44]  stage. The same holds true for Martínez's statement under penalty of perjury regarding Del Valle's alleged expressions at the suspension meeting of April 2, 2103 ("Del Valle told me that I should resign and sign a release agreement, in order to receive a severance payment, and that if I did not sign the release agreement, they would prepare a case against me to terminate me for just cause and not pay me anything. Del Valle also told me that my performance was not 100% due to my age, and because I was old and had many years in the Company. Del Valle told Martínez that because of my age, my skills had diminished and I was not the same as when I started working at the Company 20 years ago, thus, he told me that I should sign that settlement agreement before being discharged." ECF No. 44-2 ¶ 31).
At the summary judgment stage, "[t]here is no room for credibility determinations, no room for the measured weighing of conflicting evidence such as the trial process entails, [and] no room for the judge to superimpose his own idea of probability and likelihood..." Greenburg v. P.R. Mar. Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir. 1987); Reeves, 530 U.S. at 135. Therefore, plaintiffs' evidence regarding Martínez's performance in 2012 and alleged statements by a decision-maker in his suspension [*45]  meeting on April 2, 2013, "establishes factual disagreements as to which reasonable minds may differ. No more is exigible...Right or wrong, the plaintiff is entitled to present her case to a jury". See Cortés-Irizarry v. Corporación Insular De Seguros, 111 F3.d at 189 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted).
Thus, the Court hereby DENIES defendant's request for summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claim of ADEA discrimination in relation to Martínez's job performance in 2012, the written admonishment of December 5, 2012, and the ensuing memo, meeting and suspension of April 2, 2013.

5. The performance standards required of Martínez by defendant upon his return from medical leave on July 23, 2013, did not constitute and adverse employment action under the ADEA.
Upon Martínez's return to work from medical leave on July 23, 2013, Carrillo provided him with a memo outlining changes in his duties and his division of the Cayey operations, including performance standards and productivity quotas. According to Martínez, he informed Carrillo that the standards and quotas imposed upon him were impossible to achieve based on his experience. As such, plaintiffs contend that the quotas and [*46]  performance standards required of Martínez upon return from his medical leave on July 23, 2013, constitute and adverse employment action due to his age, in violation of the ADEA.
However, plaintiffs bring forth no evidence to support their allegation in that respect. They also fail to provide an explanation of the concrete facts and circumstances for which they deem the quotas and performance standards are impossible to achieve, how is it that such quotas and standards rise to the level of an adverse employment action, and how age was defendant's motivating factor behind the quotas and performance standards in question. As such, the Court deems plaintiffs' allegations in that respect to be conclusory, and will disregard them in its analysis. A non-movant shall not rely on conclusory allegations, and instead "must point to competent evidence and specific facts to stave off summary judgment". Tropigas, 637 F.3d at 56.
Furthermore, it is uncontested that throughout Martínez's years at CCPRB, defendant's product portfolio grew considerably, and that said increase required an expansion of CCPRB's warehouses and substantial changes in the warehouse operations. Thus, a concomitant increase in defendant's productivity [*47]  quotas regarding Martínez in July of 2013 is supported by the case's record as a legitimate business decision given the considerable rise in merchandise that needed to be handled, especially in light of Martínez's job as Warehouse Lead.
It is well established that when adjudicating motions for summary judgments in employment discrimination claims, the Court's role is not to second-guess the business decisions of an employer, or to impose its subjective judgments of which person would best fulfill the responsibilities of a certain job. Petitti v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1990). "Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits—or even the rationality—of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions." Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d. 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991). For these reasons, the Court will not question in the instant case the performance standards and productivity quotas required by defendant of Martínez upon his return to work in July of 2013.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claims of age discrimination under ADEA regarding the productivity quotas and performance expectations required of Martínez by defendant upon his return from medical leave in July of 2013. Plaintiff are unable to establish a prima facie case of age-based [*48]  discrimination, inasmuch as the increase in quotas and performance standards in question do not amount to an actionable adverse employment action under the ADEA in light of the case's material facts and applicable law. Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23. See also Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-36, Cham, 685 F.3d at 94-95; and Hernández-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998) (employee's receipt of increased amount of electronic messages, which allegedly contained onerous assignments and critical reports on employee's productivity, did not rise to level of adverse employment action necessary to support claim of employment discrimination and retaliation).

6. Disciplinary memos of November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, as well as the transfer to the Conventional Ramp area, do not constitute adverse employment actions under the ADEA.
On November 18, 2013, Carrillo issued Martínez a memo containing a summary by Carrillo of the history of performance-based disciplinary actions taken with Martínez, and an account of what Carrillo deemed to be continuing performance deficiencies. Carrillo concluded that even though Martínez's continuing performance deficiencies justified a dismissal, and in consideration for the time that Martínez had worked for CCPRB, he would be granted one last opportunity by means of [*49]  a position transfer from the Picking Ramp to the Standard Ramp, where the volume of the products moved is significantly lower than in the former. On November 20, 2013, Troche, the Warehouse Dispatch Control Manager, provided a memo to Martínez outlining the main aspects of Martínez's job at the Conventional Area.
On October 6, 2014, Troche issued a memo to Martínez under the subject of "final written admonishment." In said memo, Troche detailed the continuing problems faced by Martínez regarding deficient performance, negligence in the execution of functions, providing false information, improper behavior and attitude, and failing to comply with obligation to implement company norms and policies. The memo ends by indicating that future violations would lead to subsequent disciplinary measures, including dismissal.
Martínez considers the transfer to the Standard Ramp area a demotion, because it was a position of fewer responsibilities than the previous one in Cayey. He also denies as "false and incorrect" the account of the performance deficiencies noted by Carrillo in the November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, memos (ECF No. 44-1 ¶¶ 38, 44; 44-2 ¶¶ 45,49), and alleges that he did not [*50]  incur in any such deficiencies. Meanwhile, defendant argues that the transfer in question did not constitute an adverse employment action, since it was a move from one supervisory warehouse position to another. Furthermore, defendant contends that the aforementioned performance memos did not constitute any adverse employment action either, since they had no tangible, adverse consequences on his employment, given that he continues to be employed to this day in a supervisory warehouse position with the same salary and benefits. Defendant argues as well that Martínez's negative performance evaluations resulted from his continued non-compliance with established policies and procedures.
A negative performance evaluation in itself does not constitute an actionable adverse employment action. As discussed above, to be deemed adverse under applicable law, an employment action must substantially affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace, typically involving discrete changes in the terms of employment such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, and/or lower salary or benefits. Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-36. It must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities, but [*51]  rather one in which the employee suffers a material harm or "tangible consequence." Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 73; see also: Shervin v. Partners Healthcare System, Inc., 804 F.3d 23 (1st Cir. 2015) (The fact that acts of an employer cause subjective feelings of disappointment or disillusionment on the part of an employee does not elevate that act or omission to the level of materially adverse employment action needed to support an employment discrimination claim). Moreover, the First Circuit has held consistently that work schedule changes and lateral transfers in themselves do not constitute actionable adverse employment action unless these entail "a demotion in form or substance." Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23; see also Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-36, Cham, 685 F.3d at 94-95; Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 43. In the case at hand, as with the previous transfer from Bayamón to Cayey, and in spite of Martínez's allegations to the contrary, the record shows that the transfer from the Picking Ramp to the Conventional Ramp constituted a lateral move from one area of the Cayey warehouse to another. In both areas, the position's main duties entailed overseeing the dispatch and handling of CCPRB products and supervising warehouse employees' performance, and entailed the same salary and benefits. Moreover, the lower merchandise volume handled in the Conventional Ramp, in comparison [*52]  to the Picking Ramp, did not turn the transfer into a demotion, since the move in no way adversely affected the terms and conditions of Martínez's employment. As such, plaintiffs fail to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination regarding the transfer from the Picking to the Conventional Ramp, given that the same did not constitute any adverse employment action under the case's facts and applicable law. Id.
Regarding plaintiffs' claim that the disciplinary memos of November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, constituted, in themselves, adverse employment actions in violation of the ADEA because their contents are "false and incorrect", the Court finds said allegation conclusory. Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence in support of said allegation, nor did plaintiffs provide an explanation as to how or why the detailed information contained in the memos in question is "false and incorrect." As such, the contents of the November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, memos are uncontested, and deemed as warranted performance evaluations. Consequently, plaintiffs are unable to meet the second prong of the prima facie case under ADEA for the time period covered by said memos, since it [*53]  is uncontested that Martínez's performance was unsatisfactory during that period. Cruz, 699 F.3d at 571.
Moreover, the memos in question do not amount to adverse employment actions under ADEA, since they have not affected the terms and conditions of Martínez's employment. Martínez has remained employed in a supervisory warehouse capacity with the same salary and benefits, notwithstanding the well documented performance deficiencies evidenced in the memos. Therefore, as with the transfer to the Conventional Ramp, plaintiffs are unable to establish the third prong of a prima facie case of discrimination under ADEA regarding the November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014 disciplinary memos. Id.; see also: Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23; Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35-36, Cham, 685 F.3d at 94-95; and Hernández-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47.
In light of the above, the Court GRANTS summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' allegations of discrimination under ADEA as to the November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, disciplinary memoranda to Martínez, and his transfer to the Conventional Ramp in Cayey.

B. Claims under the ADA

1. Plaintiff is a qualified disabled individual with a disability who can perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation under the ADA
The ADA defines a "qualified [*54]  individual with a disability" as an individual with a "disability" who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job. The cornerstone of the definition, and the sine qua non requirement for ADA protection, is whether the individual has a "disability" as defined by the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); see Sutton v. United Air Lines Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999). The statute lists three alternative definitions of "disability," of which a claimant must, at least, satisfy one: (a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of a person's major life activities; (b) a record of having such impairment; or (c) if the individual is being regarded as having such impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); see Sutton, 527 U.S. at 471.
Common to the definitions of a covered disability under the ADA is the requirement that the physical or mental impairment must "substantially limit one or more of the person's major life activities." See Lessard v. Osram Sylvania Inc., 175 F.3d 193, 199 (1st Cir.1999). The EEOC regulations define the term "substantially limits" as the (1) inability to perform a major life activity, or (2) a severe restriction on the ability to perform a major life activity as compared to the general population. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1). Three factors to consider in determining whether a person's impairment substantially limits [*55]  a life activity are: (1) the nature and severity of the impairment, (2) how long it will last or is expected to last, and (3) its permanent or long-term impact, or expected impact. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2); see Guzmán—Rosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 397 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.2005); Wright v. CompUSA, Inc., 352 F.3d 472, 475 (1st Cir.2003).
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C.A. §12102 et seq., and its subsequent regulatory provisions, "[t]he term 'substantially limits' shall be interpreted and applied to require a degree of functional limitation that is lower" than the pre-ADAAA standard. 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(j)(iv). Thus, "the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures." 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(j)(vi). In addition, "[a]n impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 29 C.F.R. App. §1630.2(j)(1)(vii), p. 387 (7-1-15 Ed.).
A "major life activity", as the term is used in the ADA's definition of disability, stands for the basic activities that the average person can perform with little or no difficulty. The EEOC has stated that "major life activities" include, but are not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, [*56]  reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communication, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(I). See Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 624.
Martínez alleges that he is a qualified individual with a disability. In support of his contention, he alleges that on February 19, 2013, he was diagnosed with severe major depression by a psychiatrist, Dr. Edgardo Prieto Agostini. He further alleges that his depression was caused by "my working environment as well as due to my terms and conditions of employment." ECF No. 44-2 ¶2. Moreover, he claims that due to his depression, he is substantially limited in the following life activities: "sleep, eat, house chores, relate with other persons, concentrate, long and short term memory process; nevertheless, is able to perform the functions and duties of my position [at work]." Id. ¶3.
Defendant asserts that Martínez has never informed the company that he suffers from a disability under the ADA, and that it first knew of Martínez's psychiatric condition on April 8, 2013, when he requested a leave of absence on that basis. Defendant further contends that Martínez's condition does not amount to a disability under the ADA, since it is not [*57]  severe enough under the ADA standards, and it does not impair his ability to perform the duties of his job. Additionally, defendant points to the fact that Martínez himself claims that his condition does not impair his ability to perform the duties of his job, and argues in his summary judgment motion that "[i]t is evident from the undisputed material facts in this case that Martínez can perform the duties and functions of his position, but he chooses not to do so in a consistently satisfactory manner." ECF No. 33 at17.
Notwithstanding defendant's assertions, the record indicates that Martínez requested, and defendant granted, twelve leaves of absence under sick, FMLA and non-occupational short-term disability from April 8 through June 22, 2015, ranging in length from one day to several weeks. The aforementioned leaves were requested and granted pursuant to medical certificates by Dr. Prieto, Martínez's treating psychiatrist, appointments with said physician, and partial hospitalizations at San Juan Capestrano mental-health clinic as prescribed by Dr. Prieto. Several of the aforementioned certificates by Dr. Prieto specify the medical diagnosis code for major depression (296.23), and [*58]  contain express references to the severity of Martínez's condition.
In light of the above, the Court holds that Martínez is a qualified disabled individual with a disability under the ADA. The First Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that depression is a mental impairment that may constitute a disability under federal law in cases where it is severe enough to substantially limits an individual's ability to perform one or more major life activities. Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dept. of J., 355 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 442 (1st Cir. 1998)). In the instant case, it is uncontested that Martínez is qualified for his position, and is able to perform the duties of his job with or without reasonable accommodation. Furthermore, a rational jury could infer that depression limits Martínez's capacity for several major life activities, based on the medical evidence of major depression in the case's record, including his personnel file with defendant, together with Martínez's subjective account of his difficulties. See Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 21 (accepting unchallenged evidence of depression's effects at summary judgment). Additionally, given Martínez's ongoing need for psychiatric treatment and related leaves, including multiple partial hospitalizations at a psychiatric clinic, a jury could also [*59]  find these limitations to be substantial, especially under the ADAAA standards summarized above.

2. Plaintiffs' claims of discrimination under the ADA
The standards for a prima facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA are very similar to those under the ADEA discussed above. As such, and in order to avoid repetition in our discussion of plaintiffs' claims of discrimination under the ADA, we incorporate by reference herein, whenever applicable, our previous discussion of the standards of law and the analysis of the case's facts covered above regarding plaintiffs's claims of discrimination under ADEA.

a) General Standards
A claimant may prevail in a disability discrimination claim under the ADA by demonstrating that she is a disabled person with a disability under the ADA who can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation as defined by said statute, and that she was subject to an adverse employment action due wholly or partly to her disability. Soto-Ocasio v. Federal Exp. Corp, 150 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1998). A qualified individual with a disability under the ADA may prove her disability-based employment discrimination with direct evidence, and absent the same, with circumstantial evidence under the [*60]  McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting test, as with age discrimination cases under ADEA discussed above. Thus, a plaintiff may establish an inference of disability discrimination under the ADA by showing that he: (1) had a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2) was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; (4) was replaced by or treated less favorably than a non-disabled person; and (5) suffered damages as a result. Ramos-Echevarría v. Pichis, Inc., 659 F.3d 182, 186 (1st Cir. 2011). If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer has the burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; "[i]f the employer does so, the focus shifts back to the plaintiff, who must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual and that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory." Gómez-González, 626 F.3d at 662 (quotations and citation omitted).
The threshold question of the third prong mentioned above is whether the acts or omissions alleged by a claimant amount to an adverse employment action. Ramos-Echevarría, 659 F.3d at 186. Because the meaning of an adverse employment action [*61]  applied by the First Circuit Court of Appeals is very similar in claims under Title VII, ADEA, ADA, and other federal laws regarding employment, we incorporate by reference the discussion of that meaning included above. Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 73; Gu, 312 F.3d at 14; Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716; Hernández-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47.
Furthermore, the fourth prong's central issue is whether an adverse employment action is due in whole or in part to a claimant's disability. Ramos-Echevarría, 659 F.3d at 186. In that respect, to survive summary judgment, a claimant "must establish that a causal connection exists between his disability and the adverse employment action. He must proffer sufficient evidence that his employers were motivated by discriminatory animus." Salamo Martínez v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., 272 F. Supp.2d 144 (D.P.R. 2003); see also Ramos-Echevarría, 659 F.3d at 186. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st Cir.1997). As such, the ADA standard is more liberal than the ADEA standard in terms of causation, since ADEA requires plaintiff to establish 'but-for' causation in relation to age. Gross, 557 U.S. at 177; see also Acevedo-Parrilla, 696 F.3d at 138.

b) Remarks Regarding Martínez's Disability
We incorporate by reference our discussion above regarding ageist remarks. In essence, plaintiff alleges that he was subject to derogatory remarks regarding his disability as well. Thus, and for the same reasons stated regarding the ageist remarks, the Court will not consider the claim of discrimination based on the alleged derogatory [*62]  remarks related to Martínez's disability taken as a whole, inasmuch as they could constitute a claim of hostile working environment, which was already dismissed by the Court. Nonetheless, the Court will consider specific alleged remarks regarding Martínez's disability in connection with other alleged adverse employment actions that may constitute direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus underlying an employment act or decision.

c) Allegations regarding events prior to February 19, 2013, are outside the scope of plaintiffs' claims of discrimination under the ADA.
According to plaintiff, he was first diagnosed with major depression on February 19, 2013. As such, allegations regarding events prior to February 19, 2013, are outside the scope of plaintiffs' ADA claims, unlike some material facts and alleged discriminatory acts under ADEA that preceded the aforementioned date and discussed above, such as Martínez's transfer from Bayamón to Cayey in July of 2012, his transfer to the evening shift in Cayey, and the written admonishment issued to him by defendant on December 5, 2012.

d) Disciplinary memo and suspension of April 2, 2013, lack any causal link to Martínez's disability [*63] .
As discussed above, according to defendant, the disciplinary memo and suspension of April 2, 2013, resulted from Martínez's continued performance deficiencies contained in the December 5, 2012, disciplinary memo. Thus, the April 2, 2013, suspension is not only factually removed, but also temporally removed from the facts pertaining to Martínez's disability, since the December 5, 2012, memo preceded Martínez's depression diagnosis by over two months. Moreover, as per Martínez's statement under penalty of perjury, the alleged statement by Del Valle at the April 2, 2013, meeting regarding the suspension pointed toward age-based discriminatory animus. Nothing in the case's record indicates that the April 2, 2013, disciplinary memo and suspension had anything to do with Martínez's disability. Thus, the Court holds that plaintiffs are unable to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination regarding the disciplinary memo and suspension of April 2, 2013, since they are unable to meet the fourth prong's central requirement — to demonstrate that the adverse employment action in question was due in whole or in part to Martínez's disability. See Ramos-Echevarría, 659 F.3d at 186; Gómez-González, 626 F. 3d at 662.

e) The performance standards required [*64]  of Martínez by defendant upon his return from medical leave on July 23, 2013, did not constitute and adverse employment action under the ADA.
We incorporate by reference our discussion above as to plaintiffs' claim of discrimination under the ADEA regarding the increase in quotas and other performance standards required of Martínez by defendant upon his return from medical leave on July 23, 2013. The Court holds that plaintiffs are unable to establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination regarding the increase in quotas and other performance standards in question. These do not amount to an adverse employment action under the ADA in light of the case's material facts and applicable law, while defendant has proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory operational and business needs for the required standards in question. See Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 43; Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35; Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 673; Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23; Gu, 312 F.3d at 14; and Cham, 685 F.3d at 94-95.

f) Disciplinary memos of November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, as well as the transfer to the Conventional Ramp area, do not constitute adverse employment actions under the ADA
We incorporate by reference the discussion of facts and law regarding plaintiffs' claim of discrimination under the ADEA regarding disciplinary [*65]  memos of November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014, as well as the transfer to the Conventional Ramp area. The Court holds that plaintiffs are unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under ADA regarding the November 18, 2013, and October 6, 2014 disciplinary memos, as well as Martínez's transfer to the Conventional Area. The memos in question do not constitute adverse employment actions under the ADA, while defendant has proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory business reasons for those actions (i.e. Martínez's poor performance and a lateral position transfer as additional opportunity to improve). See Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 43; Morales-Vallellanes, 605 F.3d at 35; Bhatti, 659 F.3d at 673; Marrero, 204, F.3d at 23; Gu, 312 F.3d at 14; and Cham, 685 F.3d at 94-95.

3. Defendant did not Deny Martínez Reasonable Accommodations under the ADA
Plaintiffs argue that defendant failed to provide Martínez with reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. Defendant counters that Martínez never requested any accommodations under the ADA, and that in any case, it granted all of Martínez's requests for sick, FMLA, and short-term disability leave.
To assert a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, Martínez would have to establish the following: (1) that he suffered from a disability within the [*66]  meaning of the statute; (2) that he was a qualified individual in that he was able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that, despite employer's knowledge of his disability, the employer did not offer a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Valle-Arce v. P.R. Ports. Auth., 651 F.3d 190, 198 (1st Cir. 2011). Reasonable accommodations may include job restructuring measures such as "part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices, adjustment or modification of examinations, training materials, or policies... and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o)(2). A careful, individualized review of an accommodation request in light of the specific facts of the case is needed to determine whether the request was reasonable. García-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 647 (1st Cir. 2000).
To show that a proposed accommodation is reasonable, a plaintiff must prove "not only that the proposed accommodation would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job, but also that, at least on the face of things, it is feasible for the employer under the circumstances." Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2001). The request for accommodation must be "sufficiently direct and specific, giving notice [*67]  that she needs a special accommodation." Id. at 261 (quoting Wynne v. Tufts Univ., 976 F.2d 791, 795 (1st Cir. 1992) (internal quotations omitted)).
In the instant case, defendant contends that Martínez never requested reasonable accommodation under the ADA. However, according to Martínez, after being diagnosed with severe major depression in February of 2013, he requested Carrillo, as reasonable accommodation: to be transferred back to his previous position in Bayamón. Carrillo denied said request. Nonetheless, Martínez fails to meet the third prong required to establish an actionable claim of denial of reasonable accommodation under the ADA—that the employer refused to grant him reasonable accommodation despite its knowledge of said disability.
Contrary to what is required of them, plaintiffs have offered neither argumentation nor evidence regarding how the transfer requested could have enabled Martínez to perform the essential functions of his job. Plaintiffs also failed to establish how the requested accommodation was feasible for defendant, given Martínez's admission that his previous position in Bayamón, and the object of his request, was being occupied by Carlos Ortiz. Moreover, plaintiffs failed to establish how the requested transfer was [*68]  reasonable, in light of Martínez's emphatic allegations that his performance at his Cayey position was excellent. In that respect, the transfer request as reasonable accommodation seems contradictory, because a worker with a disability under the ADA who is already performing well in a job position should not need any additional job-related accommodations under the ADA. As clearly established in ADA standards, the sole purpose of a reasonable accommodation is to enable a qualified individual with a disability to adequately perform the essential functions of his job. Reed, 244 F.3d at 259.
Thus, in light of the case's material facts and applicable law, all of plaintiffs' claims of disability discrimination and failure-to-accommodate under the ADA are without merit. Accordingly, the Court hereby GRANTS summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claims regarding the same.

3. Retaliation Claim under the ADA and ADEA
Plaintiffs claim that Martínez was the victim of retaliation for engaging in activities protected by the ADA and ADEA. Those statutes prohibit retaliation against an employee for, among other grounds, having "opposed any practice made unlawful" by either law. 29 U.S.C. § 623(d); 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). An ADEA retaliation claim is an independent [*69]  cause of action from plaintiffs' age discrimination claim. Hence, plaintiff "may assert such a [retaliation] claim even if the underlying claim of [discrimination] fails." Soileau v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997); see also Wright, 352 F.3d at 477; Vicenty-Martell v. Estado Libre Asociado De Puerto Rico, 48 F. Supp.2d 81, 89 (D.P.R.1999).
Likewise, the ADA also prohibits retaliation against an employee for having "opposed any act or practice made unlawful" by the act. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). As with ADEA, a plaintiff need not prevail on a discrimination suit to have an actionable claim for retaliation under the ADA. Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 36 (under ADA); see Bennett, 507 F.3d at 32 (under ADEA).
Requesting a reasonable accommodation is a protected activity under the ADA, as is "complaining of discrimination on the basis of disability." Valle-Arce, 651 F.3d at 198. No underlying discrimination need be proven; "[i]t is enough that the plaintiff had a reasonable, good-faith belief that a violation occurred; that he acted on it; that the employer knew of the plaintiff's conduct; and that the employer lashed out in consequence of it." Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 827.
A claimant may establish an actionable claim of retaliation with either direct or circumstantial evidence. Absent direct evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under either ADA or ADEA, the plaintiff must show under the McDonell Douglas burden-shifting test, that: (1) she was engaged in [*70]  protected conduct; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action." Colón-Fontánez, 660 F.3d at 36 (under ADA), see Bennet v. Saint-Gobain Corp., 507 F.3d at 32 (under ADEA). The defendant in turn must articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action, in which case, plaintiff must established that the proffered reason was pretextual. Collazo. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Mfg., Inc., 617 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 2010). Moreover, "[t]o defeat summary judgment in a retaliation case, a plaintiff must point to some evidence of retaliation by a pertinent decisionmaker." Sánchez-Rodríguez v. AT &T Mobility P.R., Inc., 673 F.3d 1,15 (1st Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).

(a) Genuine issues of material facts precludes summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claims of age- and disability-based retaliation claims.
In its summary judgment motion and statement of uncontested facts, defendant asserts that Martínez received a copy of the CCPRB's employee handbook in January of 2009. It contains both an anti-discrimination and open-door policies wherein employees are required to inform as soon as possible to their supervisors or to the Human Resources Director any instance of perceived discrimination or harassment in employment. Furthermore, the open-door policy requires employees who seek a reasonable accommodation in employment [*71]  to pursue the same through their immediate supervisors and the Human Resources Director. According to defendant, Martínez never filed with the company either a complaint for discrimination or a request for reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, defendant argues that Martínez is impeded from seeking relief for retaliation as a matter of fact and law.
Plaintiff denies defendant's assertion, and counters in Martínez's statement under penalty of perjury that:
I complained, since the summer of 2012, and even as of the day of the filing of the Complaint, approximately on a bi-weekly basis, to Del Valle at human resources, about the different discriminatory comments because of my age, disability and request for reasonable accommodation, and my discrimination complaints, nevertheless, Del Valle never took any type of corrective action nor conducted any investigation. As a result, Carrillo and even Del Valle continued with their discriminatory actions against me.
ECF No. 44-2, ¶ 33.
We incorporate by reference the discussion above about the meaning of adverse employment actions in ADA and ADEA claims, which apply to claims of retaliation under those statutes as well. In that respect, under First [*72]  Circuit Court case law, an employer's toleration of harassment by other employees may constitute an adverse employment action in relation to a retaliation claim. Marrero, 304 F.3d at 23; White v. New Hampshire Department of Corrections, 221 F.3d 254, 262 (1st Cir. 2000); Hernández-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47.
In the instant case, it is uncontested that Martínez filed a charge of continuing-violation age and disability discrimination and retaliation before the pertinent state agency, and subsequently filed the instant complaint. As such, he clearly meets the first prong of a prima facie case of retaliation under the standards summarized above, as he undoubtedly engaged in protected conduct regarding the alleged discriminatory acts against him.
However, there is a genuine issue of fact regarding the second and third prongs of his prima facie case, particularly as to whether or not Martínez suffered an adverse employment action in the form of toleration of harassment by defendant in retaliation of his complaints of alleged denial of reasonable accommodation and disability discrimination. The contradictory allegations by the parties respecting the related material facts warrant credibility determinations and weighing of the evidence by a jury at trial, not by the Court at the summary judgment stage. Greenburg, 835 F.2d at 936; Reeves, 530 U.S. at 135; Cortés-Irizarry, 111 F3.d [*73]  at 189.
In addition to Martínez's generalized allegation of derogatory comments quoted above, his statement under penalty of perjury contains several alleged statements by company managers that if proven true, would constitute direct evidence of retaliation in violation of ADEA and ADA. Specifically, Martínez declares as follows:
I) "Carrillo almost immediately after I was diagnosed of suffering from a severe major depression on February 2013, constantly, almost on a daily basis, told to me, even as of the day of the filing of the Complaint that: I was old and crazy; that I should leave and seek social security benefits; that due to my mental and emotional condition I had become a problem for the defendant; and that if I started requesting leaves due [sic] my depression I was going to be discharged." ECF No. 44-2, ¶ 7, 53.
ii) "Carrillo also told me that the discrimination charge was not going to save me from my termination and that if I continue complaining, it was going to become worst." ECF No. 44-2 ¶ 42.
iii) "Carrillo, after I reported back to work on July 23, 2013, constantly told me that I was going to be discharged due [sic] the Discrimination Charge filed. ECF No. 44-2 ¶ 43.
iv) [*74]  "Troche also told me at the time that he issued the [October 6, 2014] warning to me, that I was going to be discharged due to the Complaint filed, that due to the Complaint filed by me they had lose [sic] confidence and trust in me, and that I should resign before being discharged."ECF No. 44-2 ¶ 49.
As discussed above regarding alleged statements by defendant's Human Resources Director in Martínez's suspension meeting of April 2, 2013, the purported disability-related statements by company managers quoted above, who were Martínez's direct supervisors, create a controversy of material facts that entail credibility determinations and weighing of conflicting evidence that belongs to a jury at trial, not to the Court at the summary judgment stage. See Cortés-Irizarry, 111 F.3d at 189; Greenburg, 835 F.2d at 936; Reeves, 530 U.S. at 135. Cortes-Irizarry, 111 F3.d at 189.
In light of the above, the Court DENIES summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claim of retaliation under the ADA and the ADEA.

4. Supplemental Jurisdiction
As held in its Opinion and Order adjudicating defendant's motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (ECF No. 9), the Court has retained supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' Commonwealth claims, because plaintiffs' Commonwealth and Federal claims "derive from [*75]  the same nucleus of operative facts." See 28 U.S.C. §1367(a); United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725 (1966). ECF No. 16 at 13. As such, the Court hereby exercises supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims at summary judgment.

a) Law 44
Plaintiffs assert a retaliation claim under Law 44, which is Puerto Rico's counterpart to the ADA. See Arce v. Aramark Corp., 239 F.Supp.2d 153, 169 (D.P.R. 2003). However, contrary to the ADA, "Law 44 lacks a retaliation component." Torres-Alman v. Verizon Wireless Puerto Rico, Inc., 522 F. Supp. 2d 367, 401 (D.P.R. 2007) (citing P.R. Laws Ann., tit. 1, § 502). Therefore, because the only remaining ADA claim is a retaliation claim, the Court GRANTS defendant's summary judgment motion regarding plaintiffs' claim under Law 44.

b) Law 100
Law 100 is Puerto Rico's general employment discrimination statute, and seeks to prevent discrimination in employment by reason of age, race, color, religion, sex, social or national origin or social condition. P.R. Laws Ann., tit 29, § 146. It offers a "significantly more favorable" standard to plaintiffs than does the ADEA. Cardona-Jiménez v. Bancomercio de Puerto Rico, 174 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1999). However, because the Court hereby denies summary judgment regarding part of plaintiffs' claims of discrimination and under ADEA, defendant's summary judgment motion under Law 100 is also DENIED.

c) Law 115
Plaintiffs also assert a retaliation claim under Puerto Rico Law 115, which makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge or discriminate against [*76]  employees because "they offer or attempt to offer, verbally or in writing, any testimony, expression or information before a legislative, administrative or judicial forum in Puerto Rico." P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 § 194(a). On September 29, 2014, Law 115 was amended and expanded by Law 169 to protect employees from relation for offering testimony, providing or attempting to provide information, or otherwise participating in an internal investigation in the workplace, or offering this information to any company employee or representative in a position of authority. See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29 § 194(a). In this case, the Court hereby denies summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' retaliation claims related to the alleged internal complaints of age- and disability-based discrimination and retaliation, the filing of a charge for the same allegations before the ADU, and the filing of the instant complaint. Therefore, defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding plaintiffs' claim under Law 115 is also DENIED.

V. Conclusion
Based upon the foregoing, defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 33) and its supplemental motion (ECF No. 34) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. In summary, the Court rules as follows:
1. The Court DENIES defendants' motion [*77]  for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim of age discrimination under ADEA regarding defendant's written admonishment to Martínez of December 5, 2012, and the subsequent disciplinary memorandum and suspension of April 2, 2013.
2. The Court GRANTS defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all other claims by plaintiffs of age discrimination under ADEA.
3. The Court GRANTS defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claims of disability discrimination under the ADA, including the claims of denial of reasonable accommodation.
4. The Court DENIES defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claims of retaliation under ADA and ADEA.
5. The Court GRANTS defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' retaliation claim under Law 44;
6. The Court DENIES defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claim of age discrimination under Law 100; and
7. The Court DENIES defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' retaliation claim under Law 115.
SO ORDERED.
At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 31st day of March, 2016.
