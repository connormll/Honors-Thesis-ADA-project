Opinion



MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is currently before the Court on a Motion for Summary Judgment ([Doc. 48]) filed by Defendant State Farm Fire and Casualty Company ("State Farm") and a Motion to Exclude the Declaration of Leslie Anderson ([Doc. 56]) filed by Plaintiff Garrett Eugene Franklin Henry, Jr. ("Plaintiff"). For the reasons detailed below, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and the undersigned RECOMMENDS that State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED. [Doc. 48].

PRELIMINARY EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
As mentioned above, Plaintiff has filed a Motion to Exclude the Declaration of Leslie Anderson. The Court addresses this Motion first, since it bears on the evidentiary record that can be considered [*2]  in determining the undisputed factual background underlying this case. Likewise, the Court addresses several of Plaintiff's objections to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts. Last, the Court addresses Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's declaration.

I. Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude
In his Motion to Exclude the Declaration of Leslie Anderson, Plaintiff argues the Declaration should be excluded because it asserts facts outside of Anderson's personal knowledge. [Doc. 56, at 8-12]. Plaintiff also contends the Declaration contains facts outside the scope of Anderson's Rule 30(b)(6) designation. [Id. at 12-14]. Last, Plaintiff argues Anderson's Declaration should be excluded because Defendant failed to disclose Anderson as a fact witness. [Id. at 14-17].
In response, Defendant asserts that Anderson's Declaration is admissible because she testified on subjects within her personal knowledge and relied on otherwise admissible evidence. [Doc. 65, at 6-9]. Defendant further argues the facts in the Declaration are within the scope of Anderson's Rule 30(b)(6) designation and the topics discussed at her deposition. [Id. at 9-11]. Last, Defendant argues Plaintiff was not prejudiced by any alleged failure of Defendant to supplement its disclosures. [Id. at 12-13].
In [*3]  Reply, Plaintiff concedes that paragraphs six through ten and paragraph thirteen of Anderson's Declaration fall within the scope of the topics designated for her Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, and thus those paragraphs will be considered. [Doc. 68, at 3 n.1]. Although not mentioned by Plaintiff, paragraphs one through five of the Declaration are indisputably admissible as mere background information. [Doc. 48-3, at 2-3, ¶¶1-5]. Paragraph twenty-one merely declares that the preceding paragraphs are true. [Id. at 5, ¶21]. Thus, the disputed portions of Anderson's Declaration are paragraphs eleven, twelve, and fourteen through twenty.
To the extent that Plaintiff objects that some of the topics discussed by Anderson are "in the purview of other designees," nothing in Rule 30(b)(6) prevents multiple designees from testifying regarding overlapping topics. See [Doc. 68, at 3-5]; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) (authorizing corporations to "designate one or more" witnesses to "testify on its behalf" and "set out the matters on which each person designated will testify"). Anderson was designated to testify regarding, inter alia, Defendant's return-to-work policies and procedures. [Doc. 56-2, at 2]. Paragraphs fourteen and fifteen of Anderson's Declaration [*4]  fall well within the scope of this topic because they deal with the procedures Defendant's Employee Health Services ("EHS") uses to "confirm that [an] employee is fit to return to work." [Doc. 48-3, at 4, ¶¶14-15]. Contrary to Plaintiff's suggestion, the fact that Donna Malinowski also testified about EHS policies does not prevent Anderson from testifying about those same policies to the extent they fall within the scope of her designated topics. See [Doc. 68, at 4]. Plaintiff offers no other reason why paragraphs fourteen and fifteen of Anderson's Declaration should be excluded, and the Court can see none. See [Doc. 56, 68].1
Paragraphs nineteen and twenty of Anderson's Declaration, by contrast, deal with leave requests under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), which do not fall within any of Anderson's designated topics. [Doc. 48-3, at 5, ¶¶19-20]; [Doc. 56-2, at 2]. Paragraphs eleven, twelve, and sixteen through nineteen of Anderson's Declaration all pertain to largely unspecified "internal [human resource ("HR")] documents." [Doc. 48-3, at 4-5; ¶¶11-12; 16-19]. Such documents might be found in Plaintiff's Shield or in certain drop memos, but Anderson [*5]  was not designated to testify regarding the documents in Plaintiff's Shield or such drop memos. Instead, Anderson was designated to testify regarding "Shield policies and procedures" and "Drop memo policies and procedures." [Doc. 56-2, at 2].
This discrepancy might be irrelevant if, as Defendant asserts, the Declaration merely pertained to "topics discussed at [Anderson's] deposition." See [Doc. 65, at 10]. But that is not so. Anderson testified generally about the system that contains HR documents and the kind of information she can pull up. See, e.g., [Doc. 50, at 59:4-16]. Anderson, however, never testified regarding the particular documents in Plaintiff's file. For example, during her deposition, Anderson never mentioned the Compliance and Ethics Hotline, Plaintiff's complaint made on the hotline, or any documents relating to State Farm's investigation into the complaint. See [Doc. 50]. None of the "internal HR documents" mentioned in paragraphs sixteen through nineteen of Anderson's Declaration were discussed in her deposition either. See [Doc. 50].
Anderson was designated to testify regarding various policies and procedures and that was what was discussed during her deposition. [*6]  [Doc. 56-2, at 2]; see [Doc. 50]. If Defendant intended for Anderson to testify regarding State Farm's "internal HR documents" relating to Plaintiff, it should have designated her as such. Defendant contends that, even if Anderson was not properly disclosed as a witness, her Declaration is not unfairly prejudicial to Plaintiff because he "does not contend the facts contained therein are incorrect, in dispute, or based on untrustworthy or previously unproduced records." [Doc. 65, at 12]. But Plaintiff does dispute several of the paragraphs in Anderson's Declaration.
Based exclusively on Anderson's Declaration, Defendant asserts it did not receive notice that Cigna had approved Plaintiff's FMLA request until ten days after he was terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 13, ¶73]. Plaintiff, however, points to the leave approval itself, which is dated April 2, 2016—just before Plaintiff's termination. As Plaintiff argues, without knowing what documents Anderson is relying on, he cannot adequately respond to her Declaration. [Doc. 68, at 6]. Plaintiff did not have an opportunity to depose Anderson regarding such documents as Defendant argues. Anderson was not designated to discuss FMLA leave, much less [*7]  Plaintiff's particular requests for FMLA leave. [Doc. 56-2, at 2]. It is not surprising then that the FMLA and Plaintiff's FMLA leave requests were not discussed during Anderson's deposition. See [Doc. 50]. Defendant cannot now use Anderson as a witness to prove that it did not receive the FMLA leave approval until after Plaintiff was terminated.
Based on the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude the Declaration of Leslie Anderson ([Doc. 56]) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The Court will consider paragraphs one through ten, thirteen through fifteen, and twenty-one of Anderson's Declaration. Paragraphs eleven, twelve, and sixteen through twenty of the Declaration will not be considered.

II. Plaintiff's Objections to Certain Statements of Material Fact
Plaintiff purports to deny many of Defendant's statements of material fact based solely on his contention that the facts are "stated as an 'issue.'" See [Doc. 58, at 4-6, 11, 13; ¶¶18, 22, 24, 27, 31, 59, 60, 63, 66]. Simply using the word "allegedly" in a statement of material facts does not mean the fact is in dispute. See, e.g., [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶18]. Indeed, other than objecting to Defendant's phrasing, Plaintiff does [*8]  not dispute the factual content of such statements, and the evidence cited by Defendant supports the facts asserted. Compare [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶18], with [Doc. 55, at 43:7-11]. To the extent Plaintiff purports to deny various statements of material fact based solely on his contention they are "stated as an 'issue,'" the Court has considered those facts to the extent the factual material itself is undisputed and supported by the record.
Plaintiff also objects to the admissibility of a threat report filed by one of his supervisor's Ron Grider. Specifically, Plaintiff argues the document is "uanauthenticated" and "inadmissible hearsay." [Doc. 58, at 8, ¶43]. The Court will not disregard documents in the record unless the party challenging that evidence demonstrates that the material "cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56©(2) (emphasis added); see also J&J Sports Productions, Inc. v. Mega Taco, Inc., No. 1:17-CV-1863, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141997, 2018 WL 2760318, *3 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 5, 2018) ("Rule 56 merely requires that materials used to support or dispute a fact be capable of presentation at trial as admissible evidence.").
The authentication burden, particularly at summary judgment, is light, and generally requires only some evidence to make [*9]  out a prima facie case that the documents are what they purport to be. See MKT Reps S.A. de C.V. v. Standard Chartered Bank Int'l (Americas) Ltd., 520 F. App'x 951, 954 (11th Cir. 2013). Plaintiff points to nothing indicating Grider's threat report is anything other than what it purports to be, and thus his objection that the document is "unauthenticated" is unavailing.
Nor is the document inadmissible hearsay. The Eleventh Circuit has explained that, "[t]o be admitted under [the business-record hearsay] exception, the person who actually prepared the documents need not have testified so long as other circumstantial evidence and testimony suggest their trustworthiness." United States v. Parker, 749 F.2d 628, 633 (11th Cir. 1984). The document, on its face, bears sufficient indicia of reliability demonstrating it is a business record of State Farm. See [Doc. 55, at 282-84]. To the extent Plaintiff is objecting to the statements within the document itself as hearsay, such statements are not hearsay because they are not offered "to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement[s]." See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2). Rather, the statements in the threat report "explain why [State Farm] has or has not taken a particular action" and as such are not hearsay. See Rogers v. S. Star Logistics, Inc., 661 F. App'x 667, 674 n.5 (11th Cir. 2016). In particular, the statements in the threat report explain why State Farm took the actions that it did after Grider's [*10]  meeting with Plaintiff. Grider's threat report is not admissible to prove the truth of any particular statements contained in the report but is admissible to explain State Farm's subsequent actions.

III. Plaintiff's Declaration
Last, Defendant argues Plaintiff's own declaration should be disregarded to the extent that it "directly contradicts his prior, sworn testimony." [Doc. 63, at 12 n.9]. A party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by offering a declaration that "merely contradicts his prior testimony without giving any valid explanation." Van T. Junkins & Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Indus., Inc., 736 F.2d 656, 656 (11th Cir. 1984). Plaintiff's declaration does exactly that on several key points.
For example, Plaintiff's FMLA claims center around a leave request he submitted on March 9, 2016. See [Doc. 64, at 17 ¶34]. Plaintiff knew, on that date, that his leave would end on April 13, 2016. See [Doc. 57-18, at 3]. In his declaration Plaintiff states that during a March 18, 2016 meeting his supervisor told him he would be on administrative leave "until [his] FMLA request was processed and approved." [Doc. 57-3, at 7 ¶40]. But during his deposition, Plaintiff never suggested that his FMLA request was discussed during the meeting. See [Doc. 55, at 87:3-91:15]. Instead, [*11]  when asked if there was "any discussion about when [he] would come back," Plaintiff said, "No." [Id. at 91:3-5]. Defense counsel then explicitly asked if there was "any discussion about what would be needed in order for [him] to come back" to work, and Plaintiff said there "was no discussion like that at all." [Id. at 91:6-8]. In his own, contemporaneous account of the meeting, Plaintiff stated that he was told he would "be on administrative paid leave until further notice." [Id. at 287]. Now, at summary judgment, Plaintiff argues he was told he would be "on administrative leave pending his FMLA approval." [Doc. 64, at 24 ¶47].
The Court credits Plaintiff's sworn testimony that, during the March 18, 2016 meeting, he did not discuss when his administrative leave would end and that there was no discussion "at all" regarding "what would be needed in order for [him] to come back." [Doc. 55, at 91:3-8]. Plaintiff cannot attempt to create a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment by directly contradicting this sworn testimony without any explanation. See Van T. Junkins, 736 F.2d at 656. Likewise, in his declaration Plaintiff claims that his "schizophrenia disorder required [him] to take different medications that often [*12]  left [him] debilitated, tired, and fatigued." [Doc. 57-3, at 5 ¶37]. But when asked about the medications he was taking "in the month of March" 2016, the month of Plaintiff's schizophrenia diagnosis, Plaintiff stated that the medications did not interfere with his "ability to work in any way." See [Doc. 55, at 130:22-131:4]. Plaintiff cannot now attempt to create a genuine issue of material fact by asserting that those same medications "often left [him] debilitated, tired, and fatigued." [Doc. 57-3, at 5 ¶37].
So too with Plaintiff's human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV") diagnosis. In his declaration, Plaintiff states that his "HIV status has caused complications with [his] ability to perform daily activities due to debilitating body pain and fatigue." [Id., at 2 ¶7]. During his deposition, when asked if any of his "health concerns affect [his] daily activities," Plaintiff never suggested that his HIV status caused "body pain and fatigue" or had any impact on his daily activities. [Doc. 55, at 159:11-161:8]. To the extent Plaintiff's declaration "merely contradicts his prior testimony without giving any valid explanation," the declaration cannot be used to create a genuine issue of material fact [*13]  to defeat summary judgment. See Van T. Junkins, 736 F.2d at 656.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The below factual background is drawn from the parties' statements of material facts to the extent such facts are undisputed. When a fact is disputed and both parties have cited to evidence in the record in support of their version of events, the Court draws on the evidence itself and has viewed all evidence and made all factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).

I. Defendant's Policies and Procedures
During Plaintiff's employment, State Farm had a code of conduct the State Farm employees reviewed each year. [Doc. 48-1, at 2 ¶3]; see also [Doc. 58, at 2 ¶3]. Pursuant to the Code of Conduct, if an employee knows or suspects improper conduct, they have an obligation to speak with a member of management, an HR representative, or they can call the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. [Doc. 48-1, at 2 ¶4]; see also [Doc. 58, at 2 ¶4]. State Farm's code of conduct states: "Threats and violent or intimidating Behavior will not be tolerated. Employees must comply with State Farm's internal security policies and procedures." [Doc. 48-1, at 2 ¶6]; see also [Doc. 58, at 2 ¶6]. In January 2015, Plaintiff signed acknowledgement [*14]  of his receipt and understanding of State Farm's code of conduct. [Doc. 48-1, at 2-3; ¶7]; see also [Doc. 58, at 2 ¶7].
During his employment, Plaintiff also read State Farm's Workplace Security Policy, which prohibits intimidation, making threats, and exhibiting threatening behavior. [Doc. 48-1, at 3 ¶¶8, 10]; see also [Doc. 58, at 2 ¶¶8, 10]. The policy states, "Anyone who acts in a threatening or violent manner should be requested to leave the premises immediately. That person is to remain off State Farm premises pending the outcome of an investigation . . . ." [Doc. 48-1, at 3-4 ¶12]; see also [Doc. 58, at 3 ¶12]. A violation of the workplace security policy could result in termination of employment. [Doc. 48-1, at 4 ¶13]; see also [Doc. 58, at 3 ¶13].
Defendant has a contractual relationship with Cigna, whereby Cigna processes FMLA leave requests on behalf of Defendant's employees. [Doc. 64, at 16 ¶31]. Defendant's employees must contact Cigna for any sick leave, medical leave, or FMLA requests. [Id., ¶32]. Defendant's EHS conducts a fitness for work/duty evaluation when there is concern about an employee's fitness for duty and/or the safety of the employee to himself or other employees. [*15]  [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46]. Employees are required to cooperate EHS, which includes signing an authorization form so State Farm can confirm that the employee is fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶47]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶47].

II. Plaintiff's Employment with Defendant
Plaintiff began working for Defendant on June 17, 2013. [Doc. 64, at 1 ¶1]. In the Fall of 2014, Plaintiff was promoted to underwriting service assistant in the Contact Center at Defendant's Ravinia Park location. [Id. at 1-2, ¶2]. On January 15, 2015, Plaintiff's then-supervisor, Katie Carr, marked Plaintiff absent without leave ("AWOL"). [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶18]; see also [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶18]. Plaintiff disputed the January 15, 2015 coding, and it was changed. [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶21]; see also [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶21]. On August 26, 2015, Carr coded Plaintiff late-no-pay, saying he was not at his desk at the correct time. [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶22]; see also [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶22]. Again, Plaintiff disputed the coding, and it was changed. [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶23]; see also [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶23]. Plaintiff stated that he believed Carr "retaliated" against him because they did not talk to each other in person, and he felt [*16]  he did not get assistance during training. [Doc. 48-1, at 5 ¶24]; see also [Doc. 58, at 4 ¶24].
In early October 2015, Carr went out on maternity leave after applying for and receiving FMLA leave, at which point Michaela Randolph took over certain supervisory responsibilities. See [Doc. 55, at 64:2-65:24]. On October 22, 2015, Randolph "malicious[ly]" coded Plaintiff late-no-pay even though his "badge was not working," making him "late to enter inside the building." [Id. at 71:24-72:11]. In December 2015, Plaintiff called State Farm's Compliance and Ethics Hotline and reported that he felt he was being discriminated against based on his race and sexuality. [Doc. 48-1, at 6 ¶29]; see also [Doc. 58, at 5 ¶29]. Plaintiff stated there was "no other reason that [he] would receive this type of treatment." [Id.]; see also [Doc. 55, at 278].
From March 9, 2016, to March 11, 2016, Plaintiff was hospitalized. [Doc. 64, at 12-13, ¶23]. Plaintiff testified that he attempted suicide "around this timeframe of March 2016" and that "was some of the concern that led to the hospitalization." [Doc. 55, 128:2-16]. On March 17, 2016, Plaintiff requested a meeting with Katie Carr and Ron Grider to discuss [*17]  a pay shortage following the coding of AWOL during his hospitalization. [Doc. 64, at 13, ¶24]; see also [Doc. 48-3, at 4 ¶13]. The requested meeting took place on March 18, 2016, and only Plaintiff, Carr, and Grider were present. [Doc. 64, at 13, ¶¶25-26].
Plaintiff began the meeting by swallowing several pills, telling Carr and Grider that he had been institutionalized, and stating that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia had been diagnosed. [Doc. 48-1, at 7 ¶36]; see also [Doc. 58, at 7 ¶36]. Plaintiff then said he could not be in the same room as Carr, that she made the back of his neck hot, and that he believed she was to blame for his mental conditions. [Doc. 48-1, at 8 ¶37]; see also [Doc. 58, at 7 ¶37]. According to Carr, Plaintiff said that his doctors "told him that he was a threat to himself and others in the workplace." [Doc. 51, at 44:6-7]. Plaintiff testified that he told Carr and Grider that his doctors were "worried that [he] could become suicidal," but insists he "never said [he would] be a threat to a workplace." [Doc. 55, at 89:9-13; 135:23-25].
After the meeting, Carr filed a threat report against Plaintiff. [Doc. 51, at 45:3-5]. Carr had no further interactions with [*18]  Plaintiff after the meeting except that Plaintiff sent her a Facebook friend request, which she did not accept. [Id. at 46:18-47:14]. After consulting with HR, Grider asked Plaintiff to leave work and placed him on paid administrative leave until further notice. [Doc. 48-1, at 8 ¶41]; see also [Doc. 58, at 8 ¶41]. State Farm security escorted Plaintiff off the property and collected his badge. [Doc. 48-1, at 8 ¶42]; see also [Doc. 58, at 8 ¶42]. Grider then filed a threat report about Plaintiff's conduct in the meeting. [Doc. 55, at 282-84].
On March 21, 2016, an EHS nurse requested Plaintiff fully complete and return a form authorizing the release of medical information from his physician. [Doc. 55, at 285]. The form stated that the information would be used, in part, to determine Plaintiff's ability to perform the essential functions of his job. [Id. at 286]. During his deposition, Plaintiff stated that the EHS nurse told him that he "[did] not have to" sign the release form, but that State Farm management "want[ed] him to sign it. [Id., 91:20-92:4]. Plaintiff said he was "not signing over anything to them," and suggested State Farm could "contact Cigna or talk to [his] doctors directly" without [*19]  a release. [Id., 91:20-92:20]. However, Plaintiff understood that the EHS fitness-for-duty and Cigna FMLA processes were two distinct and separate processes and that he must show fitness for duty before returning to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 10 ¶50]; see also [Doc. 58, at 10 ¶50]. Several days after receiving the form, Plaintiff sent his supervisor an email stating he would "absolutely not" sign the form and that State Farm "management need[ed] to stop inquiring about [his] medical history period." [Doc. 55, at 287].
Brian Lancaster—a State Farm Section Manager and Plaintiff's second line leader—recommended Plaintiff's employment be terminated, in part, due to his refusal to sign over the medical release form. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶¶55-57]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶¶55-57]. The Operations Manager, Marci Thomas, approved the recommendation to terminate Plaintiff. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶55]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶55]. Plaintiff is unaware of anyone who refused to sign an authorization form under similar circumstances and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58].
Additionally, on March 25, 2016, Plaintiff arrived at Defendant's Ravinia location to retrieve personal [*20]  items he had left at work but was informed by security that he was not allowed on the premises. [Doc. 64, at 26, ¶¶49-50]. Plaintiff's attempt to return to the office when he was not allowed on the premises was part of the reason Brian Lancaster believed Plaintiff "created a concern for the safety of State Farm employees" and recommended Plaintiff's termination. [Id. at 31, ¶64]; [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff was terminated on or about April 5, 2016. [Doc. 64, at 29, ¶57].

III. Plaintiff's Illnesses
In addition to stating that he told Carr and Grider that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, Plaintiff also testified that he previously told Carr he is HIV-positive. [Doc. 55, at 41:6-11]. Plaintiff testified that knowledge of his "HIV status . . . spread through State Farm like wildfire." [Id. 163:2-4]. In June 2015, Plaintiff was having "difficulties at work" and sent an email to a person in State Farm's Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") requesting an unspecified accommodation. [Doc. 55, 56:16-57:11]. Plaintiff's request was granted. [Id. 57:12-14].
Due to Plaintiff's illness, he was approved for FMLA leave on at least three occasions between 2014 and 2016. [Doc. 48-1, [*21]  at 13 ¶70]; see also [Doc. 58, at 13 ¶70]. On March 9, 2016, Plaintiff requested FMLA leave relating to the mental-health issues discussed above. [Doc. 64, at 17 ¶34]. That request, like all of Plaintiff's other FMLA leave requests, was approved. See [id. at 18 ¶36]; see also [Doc. 48-1, at 13 ¶71]; [Doc. 58, at 13 ¶71]. Lancaster was aware of Plaintiff's March 2016 FMLA leave request at the time he recommended Plaintiff's termination. [Doc. 64, at 31, ¶62].

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears the initial responsibility of asserting the basis for her motion. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Apcoa, Inc. v. Fid. Nat'l Bank, 906 F.2d 610, 611 (11th Cir. 1990). The movant can discharge this burden by merely "'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. After the movant has carried her burden, the non-moving party is then required to "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating specific facts showing a genuine disputed issue for trial. Id. at 324.
While the court is to view all evidence and factual inferences in a light most favorable [*22]  to the non-moving party, Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003), "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (emphasis in original). A fact is material when it is identified as such by the controlling substantive law. Id. at 248.
Moreover, the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts . . . . Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citations omitted). An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50. To the extent one party's version of events "is blatantly contradicted by the record," the "court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 379-81, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).

LEGAL ANALYSIS
Plaintiff brings claims under the FMLA and the ADA alleging that he was discriminated against, retaliated against, and that Defendant interfered with his FMLA rights. [Doc. 24, [*23]  at 15-19, ¶¶69-90]. In moving for summary judgment, Defendant first argues Plaintiff's FMLA claims are barred by the statute of limitations. [Doc. 48-19, at 2-3]. Defendant then argues Plaintiff's FMLA claims fail on their merits. [Id. at 3-20]. Last, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's ADA claims fail as well. [Id. at 6-24]. The below analysis is broken into five sections: (I) whether Plaintiff's FMLA claims are time-barred, (II) the merits of Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, (III) the merits of Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim, (IV) Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim, and (V) Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.2

I. Whether Plaintiff's FMLA Claims are Time-Barred
Generally, a claim under the FMLA "may be brought . . . no later than 2 years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1). The last event that could have constituted a violation of the FMLA was Plaintiff's termination in April 2016. [Doc. 64, at 29, ¶57]. This suit was filed in December 2018, more than two years later. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff does not contend that he filed suit within two years of the last event constituting an alleged violation of the FMLA. [Doc. 57, at 9-11]. [*24]  Instead, Plaintiff points out that claims for a "wilful" violation of the FMLA may be brought within three years. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1).
"The FMLA does not define 'willful,' and neither the Supreme Court nor [the Eleventh Circuit] has expressly defined that term in the context of the FMLA." Smith v. St. Joseph's/Candler Health Sys., Inc., 770 F. App'x 523, 526 (11th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1140 (2020), reh'g denied sub nom. Smith v. St. Joseph's/Candler Health, No. 19-6794, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2314, 2020 WL 1906751 (U.S. Apr. 20, 2020). But a panel of the Eleventh Circuit and various district courts in this Circuit have used the Supreme Court's definition of the term "willful" from McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 108 S.Ct. 1677, 100 L.Ed.2d 115 (1988). See Smith, 770 F. App'x at 526-27; Liu v. Univ. of Miami, 138 F. Supp. 3d 1360, 1373-74 (S.D. Fla. 2015); Copeland v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., No. 1:08-cv-1300-WSD, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162209, 2011 WL 13174550, at *2 (N.D. Ga. May 3, 2011); Majors v. Morgan Tire & Auto, Inc., No. CV 104-047, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35163, 2005 WL 2709634, at *11 (S.D. Ga. Oct. 21, 2005). In the absence of binding authority on point, the Court is persuaded that the Supreme Court's definition of the term "willful" in McLaughlin is appropriate. Under that definition, a violation is "willful" if "the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute." McLaughlin, 486 U.S. at 133.
In support of his argument that Defendant's alleged violations of the FMLA were willful, Plaintiff cites two cases which are not persuasive. [Doc. 57, at 10-11]. First, Plaintiff cites Majors to argue Defendant willfully disregarded Plaintiff's rights because he was terminated [*25]  even though his managers knew "of his recent hospitalization and new schizophrenia diagnosis that would require additional FMLA leave." [Doc. 57, at 10]. But Majors does not stand for such a broad proposition. The manager in Majors knew the plaintiff "was suffering from a serious medical condition that justified FMLA leave," but that alone did not make his alleged violation of the FMLA willful. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35163, 2005 WL 2709634, at *12. Instead, the manager's actions were willful because he "was familiar with FMLA," knew that he should call the regional manager regarding the handling of the plaintiff's medical leave, and "allegedly threatened to terminate [Majors] if she failed to return to work." Id.
Here, by contrast, Plaintiff points to no evidence that his supervisors were "familiar with FMLA" or knowingly failed to consult with a higher-up regarding Plaintiff's leave. [Doc. 57, at 9-11]. Instead, Plaintiff's supervisor did consult with HR about asking Plaintiff to leave and placing him on paid administrative leave. [Doc. 48-1, at 8 ¶41]; see also [Doc. 58, at 8 ¶41]. Plaintiff's supervisor then took his concern regarding Plaintiff's comments to his superior—the Section Manager—who then consulted with his superior—the [*26]  Operations Manager, Marci Thomas—before the ultimate decision to terminate Plaintiff was made. See [Doc. 55, at 282-84]; [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶¶55-57]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶¶55-57]. Nor was Plaintiff threatened with termination for taking leave like the plaintiff in Majors was. Quite the opposite. Grider made the affirmative decision to put Plaintiff on paid leave ([Doc. 48-1, at 8 ¶41]; see also [Doc. 58, at 8 ¶41]), and nowhere in the recommendation to terminate Plaintiff does Lancaster mention Plaintiff's decision to take FMLA leave. [Doc. 52, at 39].
The other case relied on by Plaintiff is not persuasive. In Copeland, the plaintiff's employer tried to force her to sign an agreement that "designated the time that [she] would be relieved from work as FMLA leave time, and stated that [her] failure to return to duty within six weeks would result in [her] termination." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149401, 2010 WL 11500065, at *4. As Copeland argued, there were "FMLA violations apparent on the face of the agreement." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149401, [WL] at *7.3 The Copeland Court did cite the employer's failure to have its in-house review the agreement as evidence of willfulness, but only because of "the express reference to the FMLA in the [a]greement." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149401, [WL] at *7. The Copeland Court "acknowledge[d] [*27]  that the failure to consult with legal counsel is insufficient, by itself, to show willfulness." 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149401, [WL] at *7 n.11.
Here, the release form never mentions the FMLA. [Doc. 55, at 286]. Instead, the accompanying letter from the EHS nurse told Plaintiff that he needed to "contact Cigna" regarding any "request [for] FMLA protection." [Id. at 285]. Plaintiff fully understood that the EHS fitness-for-duty process was separate and distinct from Cigna's FMLA process. [Doc. 48-1, at 10 ¶50]; see also [Doc. 58, at 10 ¶50]. Plaintiff does not demonstrate a willful violation of the FMLA by arguing his employer required him to sign a document that never mentions the FMLA and was part of a totally different process.
In his response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff contends that "Defendant has made no showing that its requirement for Plaintiff to sign an additional release of all medical history complies with FMLA." [Doc. 57, at 11]. But this misstates the burden at summary judgment. The movant is not required to negate its opponent's claim. Instead, the movant can discharge its burden by merely "'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving [*28]  party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Defendant did that by pointing out that Plaintiff presents no evidence the alleged FMLA violations were willful. [Doc. 48-19, at 2-3]. Thus, "Plaintiff is required to demonstrate willfulness to avoid summary judgment." See Copeland, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149401, 2010 WL 11500065, at *7. As discussed above, none of the evidence offered by Plaintiff is enough to demonstrate a willful violation of the FMLA, and his FMLA claims are barred by the statute of limitations. See 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1)). Even if Plaintiff's FMLA claims were not barred by the statute of limitations, they would fail on the merits.

II. Plaintiff's FMLA Retaliation Claim
In the absence of direct evidence, the Eleventh Circuit applies the McDonnell Douglas4 framework for "evaluating a claim of retaliation under the FMLA." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000). Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff first has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination/retaliation. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). If the plaintiff meets her burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254; Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). The plaintiff is then given an opportunity to show that the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reason was merely a pretext [*29]  for discriminatory intent. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253; Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024.5
A. Prima Facie Case
A prima facie case of retaliatory discharge requires a plaintiff to "show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action." Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. Both leave and requests in advance of said leave are protected under the FMLA. See Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2012). "Termination is an ultimate employment action that is undeniably adverse." Freytes-Torres v. City of Sanford, 270 F. App'x 885, 894 (11th Cir. 2008). Plaintiff is correct that, as a "general rule" the "close temporal proximity between the employee's protected conduct and the adverse employment action is sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact of a causal connection." Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799.
But the "close temporal proximity between two events, standing alone, is not a panacea, absent any other evidence that the employment decision was causally related to the protected activity." Hankins v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 237 F. App'x 513, 520 (11th Cir. 2007). Defendant argues there is "no evidence that the ultimate approver of [Plaintiff's] termination, Marci Thomas, had any knowledge of [Plaintiff's] request for FMLA leave." [Doc. 48-19, at 5]. Plaintiff [*30]  suggests that the members of his "supervisory team knew he had a pending FMLA request," but nowhere argues Thomas knew of his FMLA request. See [Doc. 57, at 6 n.1]. Nor does the evidence cited by Plaintiff indicate that Thomas had any knowledge of Plaintiff's FMLA leave. See [Docs. 57-16, 57-18]; see also [Docs. 57-6, 57-7].
By pointing to a lack of evidence that Thomas ever knew of Plaintiff's FMLA leave/request, Defendant has satisfied its burden at summary judgment by defeating any causal inference created by sheer temporal proximity. Lockaby v. United Testing Grp., Inc., 986 F. Supp. 1400, 1404 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (holding that "'suspicious' timing cannot logically lead to an inference of discrimination where it is undisputed that the decision makers had no knowledge of plaintiff's protected activity, and so could not possibly have been motivated by the protected activity in terminating plaintiff's employment"). Plaintiff failed to come forward with any evidence Thomas knew of his 2016 FMLA leave/request. [Doc. 57].6
Plaintiff does show Thomas knew of his complaint to the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. [Docs. 57-6, 57-7]. But Plaintiff points to no evidence that complaint is protected activity within the meaning of the FMLA. See [Doc. 57]. Instead, [*31]  Plaintiff complained that he was being discriminated against based on his race and sexuality and explicitly stated there was "no other reason that [he] would receive this type of treatment." [Doc. 48-1, at 6 ¶29]; see also [Doc. 58, at 5 ¶29]. In any event, "mere temporal proximity, without more, must be 'very close'" to establish a causal inference. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007). "A three to four-month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough." Id. Plaintiff's complaint to the Compliance and Ethics Hotline was made on December 14, 2015, just under four months before his termination, eliminating any inference of causation. See [Doc. 48-1, at 6 ¶28]; see also [Doc. 58, at 5 ¶28]. Plaintiff presents no other evidence that his Compliance and Ethics Hotline complaint had anything to do with his termination. See [Doc. 57, at 16-20].
Even if the State Farm decisionmaker(s) were aware of all of Plaintiff's protected activities7 and even if those activities were in sufficiently close temporal proximity to his termination, that alone does not establish causation because Plaintiff engaged in "[i]ntervening acts of misconduct. Henderson v. FedEx Express, 442 F. App'x 502, 507 (11th Cir. 2011). Plaintiff argues his misconduct cannot [*32]  sever any causal inference because "to do so requires fact determinations in the purview of the jury." [Doc. 57, at 19-20]. To the clear, juries are for resolving disputes of material fact. Here, there is no dispute of material fact that Plaintiff engaged in terminable misconduct after submitting his FMLA leave request.
Plaintiff "disputes what Defendant alleges was said during the March 18, 2016 meeting," and contends this is "a material fact that must be determined (by a jury)." [Doc. 57, at 19]. But what exactly Plaintiff said during the March 18, 2016 meeting is irrelevant and thus does not present a dispute of material fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 ("the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment") (emphasis in original). Both of Plaintiff's supervisors filed threat reports indicating that "he is a threat to the workplace." See [Doc. 55, at 282-84]; [Doc. 51, at 45:3-5]. The truth or falsity of that assertion is immaterial; Plaintiff was not terminated because State Farm management simply accepted Plaintiff's supervisors' reports as true.
Instead, State Farm's EHS began a fitness-for-duty evaluation, [*33]  which was required because a concern had been raised about the safety of the employee to himself8 or other employees. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46]. That evaluation includes signing an authorization form so State Farm can confirm that the employee is fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶47]; see also [Doc. 55, at 286]. Plaintiff repeatedly refused to cooperate with EHS as it attempted to determine whether he was fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9-10 ¶¶48, 52]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9-12 ¶¶48, 52]. Plaintiff's refusal to cooperate with EHS was one of Defendant's proffered reasons for Plaintiff's termination. [Doc. 64, at 30 ¶60]. Plaintiff is unaware of anyone who similarly refused to cooperate in an EHS evaluation and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58].
None of these facts are in dispute. Instead, Plaintiff argues, "A jury must determine whether the [EHS] release was necessary or pretext for discrimination." [Doc. 57, at 20]. But employees are required to do things they believe are not "necessary" every day. The question is not, as Plaintiff suggests, whether the EHS release was "necessary" in some abstract sense. [*34]  As will be discussed more below, to show that an employer's proffered reason for a termination was pretextual, the employee must show "that the reason was false." Brooks v. Cty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cty., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (emphasis added). Plaintiff "cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030.
Plaintiff points to the deposition of Defendant's Benefits Analyst, who testified that State Farm's Medical Director "could have" requested "information from Cigna to do the return-to-work assessment." [Doc. 54, at 48:3-18]. Even if Plaintiff's prior release form "could have" authorized the release of medical information under normal circumstances, Plaintiff indisputably sent his supervisor an email stating he would "absolutely not" sign a release and demanding that State Farm management "stop inquiring about [his] medical history period." See [Doc. 55, at 287]. Given such an apparent revocation of any prior release, it is little wonder that State Farm's Medical Director did not request Plaintiff's medical records without Plaintiff's permission.
But a jury need not decide if State Farm "could have" obtained Plaintiff's medical records some other way. Plaintiff points to no evidence that State Farm's Medical Director ever personally [*35]  requested the records needed to conduct a return-to-work assessment, even if he theoretically "could have." [Doc. 57, at 23-24]. Instead, the undisputed evidence is that EHS is responsible for asking employees to sign a release form so State Farm can confirm the employee is fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶47].9 Plaintiff was asked to sign such a form and refused to do so. [Doc. 48-1, at 9-10 ¶¶48, 52]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9-12 ¶¶48, 52]. There is no evidence that any employee similarly refused to cooperate in an EHS evaluation and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58]. Such an intervening act of misconduct "break[s] any causal link between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action." Henderson, 442 F. App'x at 506. Because Plaintiff fails to establish a causal connection between his termination and any of his alleged protected activities, Plaintiff has not presented even a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation. See Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798.

B. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Even if Plaintiff had presented a prima facie case of retaliation, that would not end the inquiry. The burden then shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse [*36]  employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. This burden is one of production, not persuasion, and is "exceedingly light." Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, N.A., 36 F.3d 1057, 1061 (11th Cir. 1994); Perryman v. Johnson Prod. Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1141 (11th Cir. 1983). Defendant offered a slew of non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination. See [Doc. 52, at 39]. Because such reasons "might motivate a reasonable employer," Defendant met its burden of showing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination. Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030. The burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to show "both that the reason[s were] false, and that discrimination [or retaliation] was the real reason" for his termination. Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163.

C. Pretext
To show Defendant's proffered reasons for the termination were pretextual, Plaintiff must show "both that the reason was false, and that discrimination [or retaliation] was the real reason." Brooks, 446 F.3d at 1163. Where an employer offers more than one reason for an adverse employment action, the plaintiff must rebut "each of the proffered reasons of the employer." Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., 482 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2007). An employee must meet the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons "head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030. To show pretext, the plaintiff must demonstrate "such weaknesses, implausibilities, incoherencies, or contradictions [*37]  in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)).
Plaintiff argues "that one of the three reasons for Plaintiff's termination was due to Plaintiff making a 'threat' in the workplace." [Doc. 57, at 21]. But the evidence Plaintiff cites fails to support his assertion. Lancaster merely reiterated that his memo recommending Plaintiff's termination concluded that Plaintiff should be terminated for "misconduct because of the workplace security policy." [Doc. 52, at 32:17-33:2]. Looking to the memo itself, it does not say Plaintiff was being terminated for making a threat in the workplace. Instead, it says that Plaintiff's "statements on March 18th" created "a concern for the safety of State Farm employees." [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff disputes one of those statements,10 namely that his "doctor told him . . . he was a threat to the workplace." Compare [id.] with [Doc. 55, at 88:23-89:5]. But Lancaster's memo was not based on his personal knowledge; he did not attend the March 18, 2016 meeting. [Doc. 64, at 13, ¶26].
Instead, Lancaster was sent a copy of the threat report filed by Ron Grider. [*38]  [Doc. 57-6, at 2]. That report says that Plaintiff said his doctor told him he was "a threat to the company." [Doc. 55, at 283]. Plaintiff disputes that the statement was actually made. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, for the purposes of this motion, the Court assumes the statement was never made. The fact, however, remains that Grider reported that the statement was made.11 Lancaster recommended Plaintiff's termination, in part, based on what Grider claims was said during the March 18, 2016 meeting. See [Doc. 52, at 39].
Plaintiff cannot show Lancaster's reason for recommending termination was pretextual simply by arguing Grider's account of the meeting was inaccurate. An employer's decision to act "because of a mistaken belief in the existence of a neutral reason does not" constitute retaliation or discrimination. See Silvera v. Orange Cty. Sch. Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir. 2001) (dealing with Title VII); see also Lee v. GTE Florida, Inc., 226 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir. 2000) ("A plaintiff must show not merely that the defendant's employment decisions were mistaken, but that they were in fact motivated by sex."). Plaintiff cannot simply impute Grider's knowledge of what was said during the March 18, 2016 meeting to Lancaster. Because there is no evidence at all that Grider, [*39]  Carr, or Plaintiff—the only people present at the March 18, 2016 meeting—told Lancaster what Plaintiff contends was really said during the meeting, Plaintiff cannot show that Lancaster was lying when he said he thought Plaintiff's "statements on March 18th . . . created a concern for the safety of State Farm employees." See [Doc. 52, at 39]; see also Silvera, 244 F.3d at 1262 ("Discrimination is about actual knowledge, and real intent, not constructive knowledge and assumed intent."). Even if Lancaster "was mistaken" about what was really said during the meeting, this does not demonstrate pretext absent any evidence that he knew Grider's account of the events was false. See Silvera, 244 F.3d at 1261-62.
The same logic applies to Plaintiff's arguments regarding Lancaster's second reason for recommending Plaintiff's termination. Plaintiff contends he did not know "that he was not allowed on the premises" until "March 25, 2016 when he arrived at the office to gather personal belongings." [Doc. 57, at 23]. Again, there is no evidence Lancaster knew Plaintiff thought he could return to the building. Instead, Lancaster knew, based on Grider's threat report, that Plaintiff was "escorted off of the property [by security] and his badge was collected." [*40]  See [Doc. 55, at 284]. Lancaster further knew that Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave, and that "many times, maybe most times," when an employee is placed on administrative leave the employee is also added to a do-not-admit list. See [Doc. 52, at 23:7-12]. Even if Lancaster "was mistaken" in believing Plaintiff was told he was not allowed on the premises when he was placed on administrative leave, this alone does not establish pretext. See Silvera, 244 F.3d at 1261-62.
Although Plaintiff asserts Defendant's reason for his termination was based, in part, on his returning to work on two occasions, that is not the case. See [Doc. 57, at 24]. Instead, Lancaster stated that Plaintiff later "called, stating he was going to come into the office" and was "told not to come in." [Doc. 52, at 39] (emphasis added). There is no dispute Plaintiff "did not physically [return] to the Ravinia park location after March 25, 2016." See [Doc. 57-13, at 17]. Plaintiff does not dispute that this phone call took place, but rather objects to the admissibility of Defendant's evidence in support of the alleged call. See [Doc. 48-1, at 10 ¶53]; see also [Doc. 58, at 10-11 ¶53]. The Court agrees that the evidence is inadmissible, [*41]  but that is of no moment. The question is not what was said during the call or even whether the phone call took place. The question is whether Lancaster believed that Plaintiff called "stating he was going to come into the office" after being explicitly told not to do so. See [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff offers no evidence to support such a position, and thus fails to show Lancaster's second reason for recommending Plaintiff's termination was pretextual.
Last, Lancaster recommended that Plaintiff be terminated for "his refusal to cooperate" with EHS as it attempted "to complete a fit-for-duty assessment." [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff argues he believed "the medical release form was optional" and that his medical records were "otherwise already accessible to Defendant." [Doc. 57, at 24-25]. As discussed above, Plaintiff's assertion that his medical records were "otherwise already accessible" is dubious under the facts of this case. But in any event Plaintiff was not fired for refusing to sign a release that was necessary, he was fired for "his refusal to cooperate." [Doc. 52, at 39]. Cooperation means acting "in compliance." See Cooperate, Merriam-Webster Dictionary (available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cooperate) [*42]  (Last accessed May 12, 2020).
Even accepting Plaintiff's contention that he "[did] not have to" sign the release, he understood full-well that Lancaster was "requesting" that he sign it and "want[ed]" him to sign it. [Doc. 55, at 91:16-25]. In his own words, Plaintiff responded that he was "not signing over anything," which is by definition refusing to cooperate—i.e. refusing to act "in compliance" with the request of another. See [Id. at 91:16-92:1]. Plaintiff then sent an email to his supervisor stating that he would "absolutely not" sign the form and that State Farm "management need[ed] to stop inquiring about [his] medical history period." [Doc. 55, at 287]. There is no evidence another employee ever engaged in such conduct and was not fired. See [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58].
Plaintiff's arguments that the medical release was "optional", and that State Farm could have obtained his medical records some other way fail to show Defendant's reason for Plaintiff's termination was pretextual. The undisputed facts show that Lancaster "want[ed]" Plaintiff to sign an EHS release form so that State Farm could conduct a fitness-for-duty evaluation. [Doc. 55, at 91:16-25]. [*43]  Plaintiff repeatedly refused to sign the form. [Doc. 48-1, at 9-10 ¶¶48, 52]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9-12 ¶¶48, 52]. Lancaster then recommended Plaintiff be terminated for "his refusal to cooperate." [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff presents no evidence that anyone else ever refused to sign a release form under similar circumstances and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58]. As such, Plaintiff fails to show Lancaster's reason for recommending Plaintiff be terminated was pretextual. Plaintiff cannot just quibble with Lancaster's decision to obtain medical records one way and not another. Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030.

III. Plaintiff's FMLA Interference Claim
Plaintiff's claim for interference with an FMLA right, on the other hand, only requires he "demonstrate that he was entitled to but denied the right." Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir. 2001). Thus, the above concerns about who knew what and when are moot because the "employer's motives are irrelevant." Id. A refusal to reinstate an employee returning from covered leave can constitute interference with a substantive FMLA right, but the employer "can deny the right to reinstatement . . . if it can demonstrate that it would have discharged the employee had he not been on [*44]  FMLA leave." Id. The question is whether the plaintiff's FMLA leave "was the proximate cause" of the adverse employment action. Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original). Thus, the plaintiff must show that the adverse action occurred "because (i.e. for the reason that) she took FMLA leave," not simply that the adverse action is somehow tangentially related to the FMLA leave. Id. at 1243 (emphasis in original).
Plaintiff relies entirely on Strickland to support his FMLA interference claim, but that case is readily distinguishable. See [Doc. 57, at 11-13].12 In that case, Strickland was terminated for "walking off the job," but he contended "he was having a diabetic attack that day which prevented him from doing his job." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. There was a factual dispute regarding whether Strickland gave "notice of a need for unforeseeable leave sufficient to shift to the employer the burden of making further inquiry into whether the absence truly qualifies for FMLA protection." Id. at 1209. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit held summary judgment was inappropriate because there was a genuine dispute regarding whether the conduct that directly caused the plaintiff's termination—being absent from work—was protected under the FMLA.
 [*45] Here, by contrast, Plaintiff was not terminated for being absent from work or for any other conduct protected by the FMLA. Instead, the reasons given for Plaintiff's termination are discussed above; he violated State Farm's "Workplace Security policy" by creating "a concern for the safety of State Farm employees." [Doc. 52, at 39]. The fact that "Plaintiff asserts that he never made a threat" is irrelevant. See [Doc. 57, at 12]. As with Plaintiff's retaliation claim, the question is not whether Lancaster's reasons for recommending Plaintiff's termination were mistaken. The question is whether Lancaster recommended Plaintiff's termination "because (i.e. for the reason that) [Plaintiff] took FMLA leave." Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1242. The undisputed facts demonstrate that did not happen.
Regardless of whether Plaintiff made the statement or not, both of his supervisors filed threat reports indicating that "he is a threat to the workplace." See [Doc. 55, at 282-84]; [Doc. 51, at 45:3-5]. And Plaintiff admits that he told his supervisors that his doctors were "worried that [he] could become suicidal." [Doc. 55, at 89:9-13]. State Farm's EHS conducts a fitness-for-duty evaluation if there is concern about the safety of the employee to himself or other employees. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46]. That evaluation includes signing an authorization form so State Farm can confirm that the employee is fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶47]; see also [Doc. 55, at 286]. [*46]  Plaintiff repeatedly refused to cooperate with EHS in its attempt to determine whether he was fit to return to work. [Doc. 48-1, at 9-10 ¶¶48, 52]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9-12 ¶¶48, 52]. There is no evidence another State Farm employee similarly refused to cooperate in an EHS evaluation and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58].
The mere fact Plaintiff had a pending request for FMLA leave when all these events occurred does not mean that these events occurred because of Plaintiff's leave request. Lancaster did not recommend terminating Plaintiff because he was absent from work or because he requested leave. [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff points to no evidence that Lancaster's recommendation was secretly motivated by a desire to terminate Plaintiff for his FMLA activity. [Doc. 57, at 11-13]. Plaintiff disputes the accuracy of Lancaster's first two reasons for recommending Plaintiff's termination, but never suggests those reasons had anything to do with whether Plaintiff took or requested FMLA leave. [Id. at 11-12]. Plaintiff suggests Lancaster's third reason, his refusal to sign the EHS release, "is wholly related to his FMLA leave," but cites no evidence in support [*47]  of such an assertion. [Id. at 12-13]. (emphasis in original).
The undisputed facts show the opposite. The EHS fitness-for-duty evaluation had nothing to do with the FMLA process. See [Doc. 48-1, at 10 ¶50]; see also [Doc. 58, at 10 ¶50]. The EHS fitness-for-duty evaluation might occur after an employee has requested FMLA leave, but the evaluation does not occur because the employee requested FMLA leave. Rather, EHS conducts a fitness-for-duty evaluation "when there is concern about an employee's fitness for duty and/or the safety of the employee to himself and/or [other] employees." [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46].
In other words, Defendant was "motivated not by the taking of the leave itself, but rather by [concerns Plaintiff was unfit] that, whenever they were discovered, would have [led to a fitness-for-duty evaluation] whether or not [Plaintiff] took FMLA leave. " Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1242. As part of that fitness-for-duty evaluation, Lancaster "want[ed]" Plaintiff to sign a release, and Plaintiff refused. [Doc. 55, at 91:16-92:1]. Lancaster then recommended Plaintiff be terminated for "his refusal to cooperate" during the fitness-for-duty process. [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff points to no evidence [*48]  that another State Farm employee—regardless of whether the employee engaged in protected FMLA activity—similarly refused to cooperate in a fitness-for-duty evaluation and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58].
The mere fact that Plaintiff did request FMLA leave does not insulate his conduct. The undisputed evidence is that Lancaster did not recommend Plaintiff's termination "because (i.e. for the reason that) [Plaintiff] took FMLA leave," and thus Defendant did not interfere with Plaintiff's FMLA rights by refusing to reinstate him. See id. at 1242. Plaintiff's misconduct was not protected FMLA activity and warranted termination regardless of whether Plaintiff took FMLA leave or not. For each of the foregoing reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's FMLA claims.

IV. Plaintiff's ADA Discrimination Claim
The parties disagree regarding what actually is Plaintiff's first ADA claim. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts that he "was subjected to unwelcome harassment and discrimination on the basis of his disability, including derogatory comments and demeaning disparate treatment that materially [*49]  altered the conditions of his employment and created a discriminatorily abusive working environment." [Doc. 24, at 15 ¶71]. Nowhere in this claim, however, does Plaintiff mention his termination or suggest that the decision to terminate him was due to his disability. [Id. at 15-16 ¶¶69-74]. Therefore, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to this claim focuses on whether Plaintiff can show he was subjected to the kind of "harassment" that would materially alter the terms and conditions of his "work[ing] environment." [Doc. 48-19, at 20-24]. But Plaintiff does not engage with Defendant's arguments regarding "a hostile work environment claim" and instead insists he is claiming that his termination "was 'because of' [his] disability." [Doc. 57, at 13 n.2]; [Id. at 14-15] (emphasis omitted). To the extent Plaintiff's Amended Complaint could be construed as asserting a hostile work environment claim under the ADA, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on such a claim for the reasons set forth in its brief. See [Doc. 48-19, at 20-24].
To the extent Plaintiff now contends he was alleging a discriminatory termination in his first ADA claim, Defendant is still entitled to summary judgment. Again, the claim [*50]  at issue only complains of "harassment and discrimination on the basis of his disability, including derogatory comments and demeaning disparate treatment that materially altered the conditions of his employment and created a discriminatorily abusive working environment." [Doc. 24, at 15 ¶71]. No mention is made of Plaintiff's termination and no allegation is made that the decision to terminate him was based on his disability. [Id. at 15-16 ¶¶69-74].13 Now, Plaintiff makes no effort to show the kinds of "harassment," "derogatory comments and demeaning disparate treatment" that would constitute a material change to the terms and conditions of his employment and "create[ ] a discriminatorily abusive working environment." See [Doc. 24, at 15 ¶71]. Instead, Plaintiff argues this claim was really alleging a discriminatory termination all along, even though it never mentions his termination. "In this circuit, a plaintiff cannot amend his complaint through argument made in his brief in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment." Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 716 F.3d 535, 559 (11th Cir. 2013). Because neither of Plaintiff's ADA claims allege that his termination was due to a discriminatory animus, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's [*51]  purported discriminatory termination claim. See [Doc. 57, at 14-15].
Even if Plaintiff had brought such a claim, it would fail as a matter of law. "To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). The Court addresses each of these elements in turn.

A. Whether Plaintiff has a "disability"
The ADA defines "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); 34 C.F.R. § 104.3(j)(1); see also Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 518-20 (11th Cir. 1996). A mere diagnosable impairment "is not enough" to be disabled under the ADA "because the other half of the definition requires that the impairment substantially limit one or more of his major life activities [and] that determination must be made on a case-by-case basis." Collado v. United Parcel Serv., Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1155 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding the plaintiff "was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA" even though her condition "constitute[d] a physical impairment under the ADA"); Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that "the impairment [must] substantially [*52]  limit one or more of the individual's major life activities").
As discussed above, Plaintiff's declaration states that his "HIV status has caused complications with [his] ability to perform daily activities due to debilitating body pain and fatigue." [Doc. 57-3, at 2 ¶7]. During his deposition, however, Plaintiff was asked if his "health concerns," which he understood to include his "HIV status," had any "affect [on his] daily activities." See [Doc. 55, at 159:15-23]. In response, Plaintiff never suggested that his HIV status had any impact on his daily activities. [Doc. 55, at 159:11-161:8]. As the Court has already held, Plaintiff cannot now contradict his own sworn testimony in an attempt to create an issue of material fact. Other than his declaration contradicting his deposition testimony, Plaintiff cites no evidence demonstrating his HIV substantially limited one or more of his major life activities. See [Doc. 57].
Plaintiff suggests that taking "leaves of absence[ ]" demonstrates a disability. See [Doc. 57, at 14-15]. Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot establish a diagnosable impairment without "expert opinion testimony." See [Doc. 64, at 2-3, ¶4]. "A plaintiff's own testimony may [*53]  be sufficient [to establish a disability] when the alleged impairment is within the comprehension of a jury." McCoy v. Geico Gen. Ins. Co., 510 F. Supp. 2d 739, 749 n.12 (M.D. Fla. 2007). But Plaintiff cites—and the Court has found—no authority suggesting that simply taking leave approximately once a year constitutes a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA, especially when there is no expert evidence the leave was medically necessary. See [Doc. 57]. Because Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence that his HIV status substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, he has not shown that it constitutes a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA. Gordon, 100 F.3d at 911.
Plaintiff did testify that his mental health issues affect his daily activities by making him "fearful of certain people" and causing him to "just kind of want to stay in the house." [Doc. 55, 159:17-160:5]. Occasionally, his "mind will play a trick on [him] and make [him] believe a person is out to get [him]." [Id. 160:6-11]. Assuming without deciding that Plaintiff's mental health issues constitute a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA, the Court turns to the next element of the claim.

B. Whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual"
A plaintiff is not covered by the ADA simply because [*54]  he has a disability. Rather, he must also be a "qualified individual" within the meaning of the ADA, which is someone "with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). While Plaintiff asserts that his illnesses "impacted his ability to perform his job," he points to no evidence that he can actually perform the essential functions of that job with or without a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 57, at 14-15].14
The mere fact that Plaintiff worked at State Farm for years before his hospitalization and diagnoses of schizophrenia is not evidence that he could perform the essential functions of that job after he had the condition. Based on Plaintiff's work history after he was diagnosed, he had four different jobs in less than four years. See [Doc. 55, at 152:12-19]. The "longest one [he] was able to keep" lasted only "about three months." [Id. at 153:3-7]. Plaintiff testified that he "walked out" in the middle of the workday from all of those different jobs because his mind would "start playing tricks" and he could not "handle it." [Id. at 153:8-154:4].
"Whether a function [*55]  is essential is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining a number of factors." Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). But not walking off the job without notice is essential to most positions. Unless Plaintiff can show "either that he can perform the essential functions of [the State Farm position] without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of [the] job with a reasonable accommodation," he is not a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA. Id. Plaintiff offers no evidence that he can perform the essential functions of the State Farm position, reasonable accommodation or not. See [Doc. 57, at 14-15]. Assuming without deciding that Plaintiff was a "qualified individual," the Court turns to the issue of whether he has presented evidence of disability discrimination.

C. Whether Plaintiff's termination was discriminatory
Plaintiff asserts that each of the reasons "proffered by Defendant entangles Plaintiff's disability" and thus a jury could find he was terminated because of his disability. [Doc. 57, at 15]. For example, because Plaintiff was "on protected leave" when he showed up at work after being placed on administrative leave, Plaintiff contends terminating [*56]  him for "returning to work" is discriminatory because it "entangles Plaintiff's disability." [Id.]. That, however, is not the standard. As discussed above, the mere fact that Plaintiff was on "protected leave" when he engaged in purported misconduct does not mean that terminating him for the misconduct is discrimination. Plaintiff must show he was terminated "because of his disability" and not because of the purported misconduct. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56. Lancaster recommended terminating Plaintiff, in part, for attempting "to return to the office against management direction." [Doc. 52, at 39]. Plaintiff points to no evidence Lancaster would have recommended Plaintiff's termination simply because Plaintiff was on "protected leave" or because of Plaintiff's disability had Plaintiff not purportedly engaged in that misconduct. See [Doc. 57, at 14-15]. As such, Lancaster's termination recommendation is not discriminatory simply because Plaintiff was disabled when he attempted "to return to the office against management direction." See [Doc. 52, at 39].
One of Lancaster's other reasons for recommending Plaintiff's termination was Plaintiff's "refusal to cooperate" with EHS as it attempted "to complete a fit-for-duty [*57]  assessment." [Doc. 52, at 39]. The fitness-for-duty evaluation was prompted by threat reports indicating Plaintiff's doctor told him he was "a threat to the company." See [Doc. 55, at 283]. Making a reasonable inference in favor of Plaintiff, even if Plaintiff's doctor did believe Plaintiff was "a threat," the doctor only thought that because of Plaintiff's mental illnesses. Therefore, Plaintiff's mental illnesses prompted the alleged statement, which prompted the threat report, which prompted the fitness-for-duty evaluation, which led to Plaintiff's termination. Plaintiff suggests the termination must then be discriminatory because the first step in the chain related to his disabilities. See [Doc. 57, at 14-15].
Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, the fitness-for-duty evaluation was prompted by the threat report, not any alleged disability, severing the purported causal connection. The undisputed evidence is that EHS conducts an evaluation "when there is concern about an employee's fitness for duty." [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46]. There is no evidence EHS only conducts such an evaluation when the "concern about an employee's fitness for duty" is due to a disability. [*58]  In other words, the fitness-for-duty process began because there was a concern Plaintiff might be a threat to the workplace, not because Plaintiff's disabilities created a concern he might be a threat to the workplace. Thus, even if Plaintiff's disabilities were a but-for cause for the evaluation, they were not a proximate cause.
Because there was a concern Plaintiff might be a threat to himself or others, a fitness-for-duty evaluation was needed. [Doc. 48-1, at 9 ¶46]; see also [Doc. 58, at 9 ¶46]. As part of that process, Lancaster "want[ed]" Plaintiff to sign a release, and Plaintiff refused. [Doc. 55, at 91:16-92:1]. Lancaster then recommended Plaintiff be terminated for "his refusal to cooperate" during the fitness-for-duty process. [Doc. 52, at 39].
Even if the reason for the recommendation was, in an abstract sense, related to Plaintiff's disabilities, that does not make the recommendation discriminatory. "The law is well settled that the ADA is not violated when an employer discharges an individual based upon the employee's misconduct, even if the misconduct is related to a disability." Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir. 1999). Even if Plaintiff's misconduct had been directly caused by his disabilities, as opposed [*59]  to simply related to his disabilities, Defendant does not violate the ADA by terminating Plaintiff for the misconduct itself. Ray v. Kroger Co., 264 F. Supp. 2d 1221, 1229 (S.D. Ga. 2003) ("Even though Ray's constant blurting out of vulgar language and racial slurs was caused by Ray's Tourette's Syndrome, Kroger had a legitimate basis for terminating his employment. Summary judgment for Kroger is therefore appropriate.") (footnote omitted); see also McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 1:08-CV-024-CAP, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138246, 2009 WL 10666056, at *17 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 24, 2009), report and recommendation adopted, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138244, 2009 WL 10671829 (N.D. Ga. May 13, 2009) (collecting "cases applying the ADA [that] consistently reject claims made by persons terminated following misconduct caused by their disabilities").
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") is charged with administering the ADA's antidiscrimination provisions and has issued guidance directly on this point. Employers "may discipline an employee with a disability for engaging" in misconduct such as "threats of violence," so long as the employer "would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability." EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation & Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2002 WL 31994335, at *25 (Oct. 17, 2002); see also  [*60]  EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: The Americans With Disabilities Act: Applying Performance & Conduct Standards to Employees with Disabilities, 2008 WL 4786697, at *10 (Sept. 25, 2008) ("The ADA does not protect employees from the consequences of violating conduct requirements even where the conduct is caused by the disability.").
There is no evidence any other State Farm employee—regardless of whether the employee had a disability—similarly refused to cooperate in a fitness-for-duty evaluation and was not terminated. [Doc. 48-1, at 11 ¶58]; see also [Doc. 58, at 11 ¶58]. Thus, Plaintiff fails to show that his termination occurred because of his disability, as opposed to his misconduct, and his purported discriminatory termination claim fails as a matter of law. See Ray., 264 F. Supp. 2d at 1229.

V. Plaintiff's ADA Retaliation Claim
Last, Plaintiff asserts Defendant retaliated "against him in violation of the ADA." See [Doc. 24, at 18 ¶87]. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a Plaintiff "must show (1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff cannot just show he engaged in "protected activities" to state an ADA retaliation claim, he must show he engaged in activities protected by the [*61]  ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) (No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.") (emphasis added).
Thus, the mere fact that "Plaintiff filed a complaint with Defendant's Compliance and Ethics Hotline alleging discriminatory and retaliatory actions by supervisors" is meaningless. See [Doc. 57, at 16]. Plaintiff complained that he was being discriminated against based on his race and sexuality and said there was "no other reason that [he] would receive this type of treatment." [Doc. 55, at 278]. Plaintiff cites no legal authority suggesting that complaining of race/sex discrimination is protected activity under the ADA. See [Doc. 57, at 16-20]. Plaintiff also states he was "improperly coded" as AWOL, but cites no authority suggesting that is protected activity either. See [Id.].15
Plaintiff then discusses his "requested FMLA leave" and cites authority demonstrating such requests are protected under the FMLA. [Doc. 57, at 17] (citing Pereda, 666 F.3d at 127). But Plaintiff cites no authority [*62]  demonstrating the requests were protected activity under the ADA. See [Doc. 57, at 17]. The FMLA deals with employee's requests for leave and prohibits employers from interfering with "the exercise of or the attempt to exercise" those rights. See 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). The ADA prohibits discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability," which includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known . . . mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), (b)(5)(A).
While "a leave of absence can be a reasonable accommodation," requesting leave does not ipso facto mean an individual is protected by the ADA. Carroll v. City of Stone Mountain, 544 F. App'x 926, 927 (11th Cir. 2013). If, for example, an employee "would not have been able to perform the essential functions of" his prior position "at the end of his requested leave of absence," then he is not a qualified individual entitled to the protections of the ADA. Id. As discussed above, Plaintiff testified that he was not "able to keep" a job for longer than "about three months" after his hospitalization due to his schizophrenia. [Doc. 55, at 152:12-153:7]. Instead, Plaintiff's mind would "start playing tricks," and he "just walked out" on four different jobs because he could not [*63]  "handle it." [Id. at 153:8-154:4]. Plaintiff points to no evidence that he could still perform the essential functions of his State Farm position after his 2016 FMLA leave, and as such does not show that leave is protected by the ADA. See Carroll, 544 F. App'x at 927.
Plaintiff also fails to explain why his 2014/2015 FMLA leave requests would be activity protected under the ADA. See [Doc. 57, at 17]. Even if Plaintiff's 2014/2015 leave requests were protected by the ADA, the latest of the requests Plaintiff mentions occurred on November 18, 2015. [Id.]. That request actually only covered leave through October 31, 2015, but even using the November 18, 2015 date it is too temporally remote to establish any inference his termination was in retaliation for that request. See [Doc. 57-10, at 4]; see also Thomas, 506 F.3d at 1364. Nor does Plaintiff cite any evidence that the decisionmakers who terminated him were aware of any of Plaintiff's 2014/2015 FMLA leave requests, negating any inference they retaliated against him for those requests. Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 (holding that a "decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him").16
Furthermore, as discussed above, even if Plaintiff showed he engaged in protected activity [*64]  and showed the State Farm decisionmakers knew of the activity, Plaintiff engaged in intervening acts of misconduct that "break any causal link between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action." Henderson, 442 F. App'x at 506. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff has not pointed to sufficient evidence to present a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Plaintiff does not show "he engaged in statutorily protected activity," and, even if he did, he has not shown "a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328.
Even if Plaintiff could make out a prima facie case of retaliation, the Court would apply the McDonnell Douglas framework because Plaintiff's claim is based on circumstantial evidence. See Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. As discussed above with respect to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, Defendant has offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination, and Plaintiff failed to show those reasons were pretext for a retaliatory motive. The same reasoning applies with equal force to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim, as the evidence Plaintiff cites in support of each claim is the same. See [Doc. 57, at 20-25]. As such, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary [*65]  Judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims under the ADA as well.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons explained above, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude ([Doc. 56) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Specifically, the undersigned decided not to consider Paragraphs eleven, twelve, and sixteen through twenty of Anderson's Declaration. The undersigned RECOMMENDS that State Farm's Motion for Summary Judgment be GRANTED. [Doc. 48]. As this is a final Report and Recommendation and there are no other matters pending before this Court, the Clerk is directed to terminate the reference to the undersigned.
SO ORDERED AND REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 20 of May, 2020.
