ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS; DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE; AND TERMINATING AS MOOT MOTION TO STAY DISCOVERY
Before the Court is Defendant Federal Express Services Inc. ("FedEx")'s Amended Motion to Dismiss filed on November 15, 2018. (ECF No. 34.) FedEx seeks to dismiss Reed's claims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and the Fair Labor Standards Act. (Id. at PageID 370.) For the below reasons FedEx's motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. Background

A. Factual Background
This is an action for race discrimination pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981, unlawful employment practices, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. (Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 31 at ¶ 1.) Plaintiff Reed alleges that as a FedEx employee he was subjected to a hostile work environment [*2]  beginning in January 11, 2016 when Andy Pittman became Reed's manager. (Id. at ¶ 14.) Reed argues his coworkers threatened him at work and at the parking lot because of signs he posted in the office about standing for the national anthem. (Id. at ¶¶ 18-25.) Reed told the police that his car was egged. (Id. at ¶¶ 34-38.) Reed was charged and arrested for making a false claim which was eventually expunged. (Id. at ¶¶ 45-47, 57.) Plaintiff claims he was suspended without pay for several months after he made a claim to the police. (Id. at ¶¶ 46-48.) Reed also alleges he suffered from a disability, was refused reasonable accommodations, suffered a stroke, and needed heart surgery because of stress and anxiety caused by his managers' refusal to accommodate. (Id. at ¶¶ 92-102.) Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC before being suspended without pay. (Id. at ¶ 163.)

B. Procedural Background
The Complaint was filed on July 23, 2018. (ECF No. 1.) An Amended Complaint was filed on August 30, 2018. (ECF No. 16.) FedEx filed its initial Motion to Dismiss on September 25, 2018. (ECF No. 24.) Reed filed a Motion to Strike Exhibit B of the Motion to Dismiss on October 16, 2018. (ECF [*3]  No. 28.) Reed filed his Second Amended Complaint on October 17, 2018. (ECF No. 31.) FedEx filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on November 7, 2018. (ECF No. 33.) FedEx filed its Amended Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on November 15, 2018. (ECF No. 34.) Reed filed a Response to the Amended Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2018. (ECF No. 39.) FedEx filed its Reply on December 26, 2018. (ECF No. 40.)
Reed filed a Motion to Strike part of the Amended Motion to Dismiss on November 28, 2018. (ECF No. 35.) FedEx filed a response on December 12, 2018. (ECF No. 38.) FedEx filed a Motion to Stay Discovery until resolution of the pending Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Strike on March 18, 2019. (ECF No. 45.)

II. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows dismissal of a complaint that "fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." A Rule 12(b)(6) motion permits the "defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to legal relief even if everything alleged in the complaint is true." Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir. 1993) (citing Nishiyama v. Dickson Cnty., 814 F.2d 277, 279 (6th Cir. 1987)). A motion to dismiss only tests whether the plaintiff has pleaded a cognizable claim and allows the court to dismiss meritless cases which [*4]  would waste judicial resources and result in unnecessary discovery. Brown v. City of Memphis, 440 F.Supp.2d 868, 872 (W.D. Tenn. 2006).
When evaluating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must determine whether the complaint alleges "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). If a court decides that the claim is not plausible, the case may be dismissed at the pleading stage. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. "[A] formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above [a] speculative level." Ass'n of Cleveland Fire Fighters v. City of Cleveland, 502 F.3d 545, 548 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). A claim is plausible on its face if "the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). A complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. A plaintiff without facts who is "armed with nothing more than conclusions," however, cannot "unlock the doors of discovery." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79; Green v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co., No. 10-2487, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3538, 2011 WL 112735, at *3 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 13, 2011), aff 'd 481 F. App'x 252 (6th Cir. 2012).
Assessing the facial sufficiency of a complaint ordinarily must be undertaken without resort to matters outside the pleadings. Wysocki v. Int'l Bus. Mach. Corp., 607 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir. 2010). "[D]ocuments attached to the pleadings become part of the pleadings and [*5]  may be considered on a motion to dismiss." Commercial Money Ctr., Inc. v. Illinois Union Ins. Co., 508 F.3d 327, 335 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c)); see also Koubriti v. Convertino, 593 F.3d 459, 463 n.1 (6th Cir. 2010). Even if a document is not attached to a complaint or answer, "when a document is referred to in the pleadings and is integral to the claims, it may be considered without converting a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment." Commercial Money Ctr., 508 F.3d at 335-36.

III. Analysis for Motion to Dismiss
FedEx argues that Reed's Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed with respect to all claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1981, the ADA, and the FLSA. (Memo in Support, ECF No. 34-1.) In FedEx's Reply FedEx "finds that Plaintiff adequately pled a claim of discrimination and retaliation" under 28 U.S.C. § 1981. (Reply, ECF No. 40 at PageID 522.) The Amended Motion to Dismiss with respect to claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1981 is DENIED.

A. ADA Claims

Failure to Accommodate
In order to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, "a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) her employer knew or had reason to know about her disability; (4) she requested an accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide the necessary accommodation." Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Dist., 443 F. App'x 974, 982-83 (6th Cir. 2011). "The employee also bears [*6]  the burden of proposing reasonable accommodations; an employee's claim must be dismissed if the employee fails to identify and request such reasonable accommodations." Id.
FedEx argues that "Plaintiff fails to allege what essential functions he could not perform for his current manager, but would be able to perform if he had a different boss." (Memo in Support, ECF No. 34-1 at PageID 380.) FedEx claims that Reed is "not qualified for his position because working for one's assigned supervisor is an essential function of Plaintiff's position and reassignment was not a reasonable accommodation." (Id.) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has explained that an employer does not have to provide an employee with a new supervisor as a reasonable accommodation. (See EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, ECF No. 34-1 at PageID 417.)
Reed responds that "Defendant violated the ADA[] when it did not engage in the interactive process in response to Mr. Reed's repeated requests for accommodation to determine if there was a way to allow Mr. Reed to work without future risk of stroke caused by stress." (Response, ECF No. 39-1 at PageID 484.)
"Once an [*7]  employee requests an accommodation, the employer has a duty to engage in an interactive process. Specifically, the employer must identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. Employers must engage in a good faith process and an individualized inquiry to determine whether a reasonable accommodation can be made." Hostettler v. Coll. of Wooster, 895 F.3d 844, 857 (6th Cir. 2018) (internal citations omitted).
In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he "was able to perform the work as he had done for the Defendant since rejoining the Defendant in 2010 without reasonable accommodation." (Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 31 at ¶ 90.) Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant did not respond to Mr. Reed's requests for accommodation by inquiring if there were other options available besides transfer to a different manager or project." (Id. at ¶ 91.) Reed claims that on several other occasions his requests for reasonable accommodations were denied without engaging in any interactive process. (Id. at ¶¶ 106-109.)
The allegations of the Second Amended Complaint, taken as true, show that Plaintiff could perform the work without reasonable accommodation and [*8]  that FedEx did not engage in an interactive process when Reed made requests for reasonable accommodations. Although a request of a new supervisor is not a reasonable accommodation, the required interactive process could have helped FedEx develop a reasonable accommodation for his disability.

Retaliation Under the ADA
To prove ADA retaliation a plaintiff is required to establish "that [he] engaged in protected activity; that the exercise of [his] civil rights was known by the defendant; that defendant thereafter took adverse employment action; and that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Baker v. Windsor Republic Doors, 414 F. App'x 764, 776 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing Walborn v. Erie Cnty. Care Facility, 150 F.3d 584, 588-89 (6th Cir. 1998)).
FedEx argues that "Plaintiff has not pled facts to support the fourth element of retaliation under the ADA in his Second Amended Complaint." (Memo in Support, ECF No. 34-1 at PageID 381.) FedEx argues that "Plaintiff was suspended without pay because he was arrested by the Collierville Police Department for filing a false police report." (Id.)
Reed alleges in his Second Amended Complaint that "FedEx retaliated against Mr. Reed by placing him on suspension for filing racial discrimination complaints and for seeking medical accommodations." [*9]  (ECF No. 31 at ¶ 160.) Reed further alleges that "FedEx did not take the actions against Mr. Reed for his alleged filing of a false police report, a matter that was expunged and should not have been considered by FedEx." (Id. at ¶ 161.) Reed also claims that "[t]he negative performance evaluation that Pittman gave to Mr. Reed...was in retaliation for Mr. Reed's requests for accommodation and to be moved to a different manager." (Id. at ¶171.)
There is a factual dispute as to why Plaintiff was suspended and given negative performance evaluations. At the motion to dismiss stage all facts Plaintiff alleges must be accepted as true. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Defendant's Motion to Dismiss with respect to Plaintiff's ADA claims is DENIED.

B. FLSA Claims

Violation of FLSA
Plaintiff's claim under the FLSA is "one of unlawful taking or conversion of Mr. Reed's status from exempt to non-exempt." (Response, ECF No. 39-1 at PageID 488.) Reed argues that he "was an exempt employee who was suspended without pay for an offense that occurred away from work that did not pertain to the performance of his job." (Id.) Plaintiff argues that without a specific rule covering conduct that occurs off the employer's property, [*10]  disciplinary suspension without pay puts his exempt status at issue. (Id. at PageIDs 489-490.)
FedEx argues that "Plaintiff failed to state [a] claim upon which relief can be granted because he has not sufficiently pled that he was engaged in activities covered by the FLSA." (Reply, ECF No. 40 at PageID 523.) FedEx argues Reed's arrest for filing a false police report was related to his job at FedEx and that Reed's factual account "begins in his workplace and allegedly involved his co-workers." (Id. at PageID 524.)
The portions of the FLSA Plaintiff cites are exceptions to when an exempt employee must receive full salary "for any week in which the employee performs any work." (See Response, ECF No. 39-1 at PageIDs 488-491; 29 C.F.R. § 541.602 ("Exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they perform no work.").) Plaintiff does not claim that he worked during a period of time for which he was not paid his salary. (See Response, ECF No. 39-1.) Plaintiff was suspended without pay, during which time he did not perform work for FedEx. (Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 31 at ¶¶ 47-54.) Plaintiff offers no legal support that such an action is an "unlawful taking or conversion of Mr. Reed's status [*11]  from exempt to non-exempt." (Response, ECF No. 39-1 at PageID 488.) Plaintiff, therefore, does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the FLSA.

Retaliation under the FLSA
The Sixth Circuit has long held that "it is the assertion of statutory rights" that triggers the FLSA's protection against retaliation. Fox v. Eagle Distrib. Co., 510 F.3d 587, 591 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Romeo Cmty. Sch., 976 F.2d 985, 989 (6th Cir. 1992)). There is no language in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint indicating that Plaintiff challenged FedEx's suspension without pay as a violation of the FLSA or invoked his statutory right to pay in such a way that a reasonable employer would understand his challenge to be an assertion of a right "under or related to" the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). Defendant's Motion to Dismiss with respect to Plaintiff's claims under the FLSA is GRANTED.

IV. Motion to Strike
Also before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion to Strike ECF No. 33-1 Exhibit B and ECF No. 34-1 Exhibit B filed November 28, 2018. (ECF No. 35.) Defendant's Response was filed on December 12, 2018. (ECF No. 38.)
Plaintiff argues that "the Defendant knowingly attached a document that is part of an expunged file and nothing regarding the matter is available to the Plaintiff or the public. Defendant should not be able to use [*12]  the document, in accordance with the intent of the legislature in drafting the expungement law." (ECF No. 35 at PageID 445.) Plaintiff seeks for the expunged files to be stricken from the record. (Id.)
Defendant responds that a Court may only strike a pleading under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) and that an attachment to a Motion to Dismiss is not a pleading. (Response to Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 38 at PageIDs 462-63.) Defendant also argues that the Tennessee Expungement Statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-32-101, does not preclude private at-will employers "from using documents gathered prior to expungement for any purpose." (Id. at PageIDs 463-64.) FedEx claims that Reed's actions before his records were expunged are a non-discriminatory reason for suspending Reed without pay that counters Plaintiff's argument that it was a pretextual reason to suspend Reed without pay. (Id. at PageIDs 464-66.)
Testimony and evidence of criminal acts preceding the arrest of an individual are admissible as evidence of prior bad acts or evidence of social history, even if expungement is later obtained. State v. Schindler, 986 S.W.2d 209, 211-12 (Tenn. 1999); State v. Lane, 3 S.W.3d 456, 462 (Tenn. 1999) (stating that "expungement does not erase the underlying conduct or behavior" and that, therefore, "the criminal acts underlying an expunged conviction may properly be considered"); Wright v. Tenn. Peace Officer Standards & Training Comm'n, 277 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008) (noting [*13]  that "the key point is the distinction between the underlying acts, which are not erased by expungement, and the legally operative facts resulting from those acts," like a conviction or a guilty plea, "which are erased by expungement"). Motions to strike should be denied unless the challenged allegations have no possible relation or logical connection to the subject matter of the controversy and may cause some form of prejudice. Horner v. Klein, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142169, 2010 WL 6239893 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 23, 2010).
Exhibit B attached to Defendant's Amended Motion to Dismiss does not include any conviction or guilty plea. (ECF No. 34-1 at PageIDs 389-398.) Exhibit B details the incident report that Reed made to the police officers and the police officers' narrative of the event. (See ECF No. 34-1 Exhibit B.) That exhibit is logically connected to the subject matter of this case because FedEx asserts it was the basis for a non-pretextual suspension without pay. (Response to Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 38 at PageIDs 465-66.) Plaintiff's Motion to Strike is, therefore, DENIED.

V. Motion to Stay Discovery
FedEx filed a Motion to Stay Discovery pending the ruling of its Amended Motion to Dismiss on March 18, 2019. (ECF No. 45.) This order addresses the Amended Motion to Dismiss. [*14]  The Motion to Stay Discovery is TERMINATED AS MOOT.
SO ORDERED, this 8th day of April, 2019.
