CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (In Chambers) Order DENYING Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication of Issues (Docket No. 31)
Before the Court is Defendant VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System's ("VA")1 Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication of Issues. Plaintiff William Wirshing alleges unlawful discrimination and failure to accommodate in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
For the following reasons, the Court DENIES the Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication of Issues.

I. FACTS2
Wirshing was employed as a Staff Physician in the Department of Psychiatry at the VA from 1986 to 2006. (Separate Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law ("SOUF") ¶ 1.) In May 2006, Plaintiff's wife informed Dr. Dean Norman, Chief of Staff of the VA, that Plaintiff was illegally writing prescriptions in Plaintiff's brother-in-law's name for Plaintiff's personal use. (Id. ¶ 2.) On May 24, 2006, Dr. Norman informed Plaintiff that he was [*2]  being placed on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of a criminal investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and the VA Police into his alleged illegal prescribing of drugs for personal use. (Id. ¶ 3.)
During the DEA investigation, Plaintiff agreed to enter the State Medical Board of California Physician Diversion Program ("Diversion Program"). (Id. ¶ 4.) The Diversion Program was designed to monitor physicians who had drug and alcohol problems and to ensure compliance with treatment programs. (Id. ¶ 5.) On or about June 26, 2006, Plaintiff executed a Statement of Understanding with the State Medical Board of California ("Medical Board") in which he admitted to "illegal prescribing of drugs for self-administration." (Id. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff also signed a DEA form in which he voluntarily surrendered his ability to prescribe controlled substances. (Id. ¶ 7.)
On or about July 28, 2006, Dr. Norman requested that Plaintiff grant the VA access to all Medical Board documents regarding Plaintiff's application and acceptance into the Diversion Program. (Id. ¶ 8.) The VA sought documents related to any restrictions on Plaintiff's ability to practice medicine and prescribe [*3]  drugs to patients. (Id. ¶ 9.)
On or about August 24, 2006, Paul Booth, Plaintiff's case manager in the Diversion Program, told Dr. Norman that Plaintiff was restricted from prescribing any medication or seeing any patients until Plaintiff met with the Diversion Evaluation Committee. (Id. ¶¶ 10-11.) The same day, Booth informed Dr. Norman that the date for Plaintiff's meeting with the Diversion Evaluation Committee was uncertain and that it would likely occur in one to two months. (Id. ¶ 12.) Booth also told Dr. Norman that if Plaintiff were to prescribe medication or see patients during this evaluation period, Plaintiff would be dropped from consideration for admission to the Diversion Program. (Id. ¶ 13.) If Plaintiff were dropped from consideration for the Diversion Program, Plaintiff could be subject to criminal charges. (Id. ¶ 14; Corrected Decl. of Attorney Carl Botterud and Evidence Supporting Pl.'s Opp. to the Mot. for Summ. J. ("Botterud Decl.") Ex. 1 at 79:13-80:2.)
On or about August 25, 2006, Frank Valine, the head of the Diversion Program and its legal representative, told Dr. Norman that Plaintiff "agreed to suspend any practice whatsoever" of seeing patients or prescribing [*4]  medications to be considered for admission to the Diversion Program. (SOUF ¶¶ 15-16.) Dr. Norman believed that Plaintiff's license to practice medicine was restricted pending evaluation by the Diversion Evaluation Committee. (Id. ¶ 17.)3
On or about September 7, 2006, Charles Dorman, Director of the VA, terminated Plaintiff's employment because he had determined that Plaintiff had failed to maintain an unrestricted medical license as required by VA regulations. (Id. ¶¶ 18, 25-27.)
In a letter sent to Dorman dated September 20, 2006, Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of the termination letter, requested post-separation review, and asked that he be accommodated by being placed on sick leave pending the completion of his Diversion Program evaluation. (Id. ¶ 19; Botterud Decl. Ex. 13 at 3, 5.) On or about September 29, 2006, Dorman granted the post-separation review and gave Plaintiff 15 additional days to respond to the termination letter. (SOUF ¶ 20.)
In a letter sent to Dorman dated September 29, 2006, Plaintiff again asked to be accommodated by being placed on medical leave pending the completion of the Diversion Program evaluation. (Botterud Decl. Ex. 14 at 2.) In a letter sent to Dorman [*5]  dated October 13, 2006, Plaintiff requested reconsideration of the separation decision, provided a further response to Dorman's September 29, 2006 letter, and yet again asked to be placed on medical leave pending completion of the evaluation. (SOUF ¶ 21; Botterud Decl. Ex. 15 at 4.)
On or about October 17, 2006, Dorman submitted all correspondence, regulations, and other documents to Kenneth J. Clark, Director of VISN, for a post-separation review of Plaintiff's termination. (SOUF ¶ 22.) In a letter dated November 22, 2006, Clark informed Plaintiff that he upheld the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. (Id. ¶ 23) Clark's letter did not address Plaintiff's accommodation requests. (See Botterud Decl. Ex. 16.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted where "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A non-moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial as to an element essential to its case must make [*6]  a showing sufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact with respect to the existence of that element of the case or be subject to summary judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
An issue of fact is a genuine issue if it reasonably can be resolved in favor of either party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51. "[M]ere disagreement or the bald assertion that a genuine issue of material fact exists" does not preclude summary judgment. See Harper v. Wallingford, 877 F.2d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 1989). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury . . . could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [non-movant] is entitled to a verdict . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. at 248.
"[A] district court is not entitled to weigh the evidence and resolve disputed underlying factual issues." Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992). Rather, "the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts . . . must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Burden Shifting Framework Applies to Claims Under the Rehabilitation Act
"[C]ourts have applied the same analysis to claims brought under both [the [*7]  Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act] . . . ." Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of California, 166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n.11 (9th Cir. 1999). To make a prima facie case under the Rehabilitation Act Wirshing "must show that (1) [he] is disabled under the Act; (2) [he] is 'otherwise qualified' to remain a [doctor] . . . with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) [he] was dismissed solely because of [his] disability; and (4) the [VA] receives federal financial assistance . . . ."4 Id. at 1045.
If "an employee establishes a prima facie case of discrimination because of a disability, and the employer provides a non-discriminatory reason for that discharge which disclaims any reliance on the employee's disability in having taken the employment action," the burden shifts to the employee to show that the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for disability discrimination. Snead v. Metropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).
The employee can show pretext "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Id. at 1093-94. In "making such showing, [the employee] does not necessarily have to introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination." [*8]  Id. at 1094. A plaintiff "can survive summary judgment without producing any evidence of discrimination beyond that constituting [his] prima facie case, if that evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truth of the employer's proffered reasons." Id.

B. Disabled Under the Rehabilitation Act
"While the term 'qualified individual with a disability' does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, the ADA [and therefore also the Rehabilitation Act do] protect individuals who . . . are participating in a supervised drug rehabilitation program and are no longer using illegal drugs, as well as individuals who are erroneously regarded as using drugs when they are not." Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2002).
It is unclear whether Plaintiff was admitted into the Diversion Program or whether Plaintiff was terminated before a decision was reached on Plaintiff's application to join the Diversion Program. In any event, as noted, the VA concedes that Plaintiff is disabled under the Rehabilitation Act.

C. Qualified With or Without Reasonable Accommodation
Only a qualified individual with a disability may state a claim for discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. See Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994)).
"Department [*9]  of Veteran[s] Affairs . . . regulations implementing [the Rehabilitation Act] define a handicapped individual as . . . a handicapped person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question . . . ." Jackson, 22 F.3d at 278 (citing 38 C.F.R. § 18.403(k)(1)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (in the ADA context, a qualified individual is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires."). Plaintiff bears the burden of showing that he can perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation. Kennedy, 90 F.3d at 1481.
"A leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation . . . . " Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001) (discussing the ADA). "[W]here a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon his return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee is otherwise qualified . . . ." Id. at 1135-36. Also, an employee is not required "to show that a leave of absence is certain or even likely to be successful to prove that it is a reasonable accommodation." Id. at 1136. As "long as a reasonable accommodation available to the employer could have plausibly enabled a handicapped employee to adequately [*10]  perform his job, an employer is liable for failing to attempt that accommodation." Id.
"[T]he requirement to grant a leave where there are plausible reasons to believe that it would accommodate the employee's disability can not be repeatedly invoked [because such a practice would] permit[ ] an unqualified employee to avoid termination by requesting a leave of absence each time he is about to be fired. [T]he fact that a prior leave was granted and was unsuccessful may be a relevant consideration in determining whether additional leave would be a reasonable accommodation." Id. n.13. And an employer need not make an accommodation, including granting a leave of absence, if it poses an undue hardship. Id. n.14.
However, the duty to reasonably accommodate is broad. "The essence of the concept of reasonable accommodation is that, in certain instances, employers must make special adjustments to their policies for individuals with disabilities. . . . Moreover, this is a continuing duty that is not exhausted by one effort." McAlindin v. County of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1237 (9th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In fact, reasonable accommodation "in the service of equal opportunity may require preferential treatment of the disabled . . . ." [*11]  Giebeler v. M&B Associates, 343 F.3d 1143, 1150 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing U.S. Airways v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002)).
Here, the VA again contends that Plaintiff was no longer an employee when Plaintiff requested an accommodation. But Plaintiff contends that the VA finalized Plaintiff's termination on November 22, 2006.5 (Botterud Decl. Ex. 16.) Up to this point, Plaintiff made three requests to be accommodated by being placed on medical leave by letters dated September 20, 2006, September 29, 2006, and October 13, 2006. (Id. Exs. 13-15.) The VA has not submitted evidence that it responded to these accommodation requests. (See Botterud Decl. Ex. 16.)
Also, on August 24, 2006, the VA knew that Plaintiff was restricted from prescribing any medication or seeing any patients until Plaintiff met with the Diversion Evaluation Committee. (SOUF ¶ 11.) The VA also knew that this meeting would likely occur in one to two months. (Id. ¶ 12.) In short, it was plausible that the Diversion Evaluation Committee could lift any restrictions on Plaintiff's ability to practice medicine by late October 2006 or earlier and allow Plaintiff to return to work.6 Yet the VA made its preliminary decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment on or about September 7, 2006. (Id. ¶¶ 18, 25-27.)
Given the VA's preliminary decision [*12]  to terminate Plaintiff before the conclusion of the Diversion Evaluation Committee's evaluation of Plaintiff, the VA's failure to address Plaintiff's requests for medical leave, and the plausibility of Plaintiff adequately performing his job once the restrictions on his medical license were lifted, there is a triable issue as to whether Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of his job on his return after a reasonable accommodation in the form of a medical leave of absence.7 Thus, Plaintiff has met his burden (at least for the purpose of summary judgment) to show that there is a triable issue as to whether he is "otherwise qualified to remain a VA doctor with a reasonable accommodation" under the Rehabilitation Act.

D. Termination Because of Disability
Based on the facts discussed above, a jury could reasonably find that Plaintiff was terminated because of his disability.

E. Non-Discriminatory Reason for Discharge
As Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disability discrimination (for the purpose of this motion), the VA must proffer a non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's discharge. The VA provides evidence that it had terminated Plaintiff's employment pursuant [*13]  to VA regulations that require terminating the employment of doctors whose ability to practice medicine becomes restricted. (SOUF ¶¶ 18, 25-27.)

F. Pretext
The burden, therefore, shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for disability discrimination. As noted, Plaintiff can survive summary judgment without producing any evidence of discrimination beyond that constituting his prima facie case, if that evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truth of the employer's proffered reasons. Snead, 237 F.3d at 1094.
Plaintiff made three accommodation requests; the VA did not respond. (Botterud Decl. Exs. 13-16.) In addition, the VA made its preliminary decision to terminate Plaintiff before finding out whether the restrictions placed on Plaintiff's medical license would be lifted. (SOUF ¶¶ 10-13.)
Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truth of the VA's proffered reason.

IV. CONCLUSION
For these reasons, the Court DENIES the Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication of Issues.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
