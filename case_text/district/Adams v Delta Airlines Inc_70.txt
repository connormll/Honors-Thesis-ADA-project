REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
BLOOM, United States Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Bahji Adams ("Adams") bring this pro se civil action pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. ("Title VII"), the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12112, et seq. ("ADA"), the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290, et seq. ("NYSHRL").1 Plaintiff also brings claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346, 2671-2680 ("FTCA"). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges, inter alia, that defendants Delta Airlines, Inc. ("Delta") and its former CEO, Richard Anderson, (collectively, the "defendants") failed to provide her a reasonable accommodation, retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation, and subjected her to a hostile work environment. See Plaintiff's Amended Complaint ("Amended Complaint"), ECF No. 11. The defendants move to dismiss plaintiff's Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief [*2]  can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defendants' Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), ECF No. 18. The Honorable Kiyo A. Matsumoto referred defendants' motion to me for a Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C § 636(b). For the reasons set forth below, it is respectfully recommended that defendants' motion to dismiss should be granted in part and denied in part.

BACKGROUND

A. Facts
In April of 2013, Delta hired Adams as a "ready-reserve" seasonal agent at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. Amended Complaint, Facts Section, ¶ 8.2 Adams worked as a greeter in charge of "direct[ing] passengers to the proper security lines[.]" Id. ¶ 9. As part of her job, Delta required Adams to stand in one position "for 2 or more hours at a time." Id. ¶ 12.
In May of 2014, Adams "began to develop [a] repetitive-strain on her left knee due to the weight-bearing and prolonged standing in one position[.]" Id. Specifically, Adams alleges that she was "diagnosed with left knee pain and swelling, left synovitis of uncertain etiology, mild left knee sprain and strain, anterior crucial ligament knee [*3]  pain of uncertain etiology, anterior crucial ligament, left medial meniscus tear, and [a] possible synovial cyst of popliteal space." Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 20. Adams alleges that these impairments are "permanent and will last for the duration of [her] life." Id. On May 31, 2014, Adams informed her supervisor about her left knee pain. Amended Complaint, Facts Section, ¶ 13. Adams alleges that she filed a workers' compensation claim which Delta denied. Id. At some point, Adams sought medical attention for her knee.3 Id. ¶ 14. Adams alleges that a doctor recommended that she limit her "prolonged standing" and that she "be able to walk around" at work. Id. In addition, the doctor recommended that it "would help to change/rotate duty stations regularly." Orthodpaedic Report. Adams brought these work restrictions to Delta's attention.4 Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 21. Adams continued to work at Delta after she told her supervisor about her knee pain until June 20, 2014. Amended Complaint, Facts Section, ¶¶ 15-16. Adams alleges that during this period, Delta denied her "breaks on different occasions." Id. ¶ 15.
On or about June 20, 2014, Adams "requested the [*4]  ability to be able to sit-down to get off her knee[.]" Id. ¶ 16. In response, Adams alleges that "she was sent home from work, with no return date." Id. After this incident, Adams alleges that she "made an official workers['] comp[ensation] filing and ADA request with supervisor Kevin McCarthy."5 Id. Plaintiff alleges that Delta decided that she "would remain on leave, without any accommodations, until she had no work restrictions." Id.
On August 21, 2014, Adams attended a meeting with Delta representatives to discuss reasonable accommodations. Id. ¶ 17. Adams requested the use of a chair and a desk, which she alleges are available at other Delta airport locations.6 Id. ¶ 19. Adams also requested "a vacant position of flight attendant[.]" Id. Adams alleges that the flight attendant position would allow her to "sit, stand, stretch, [and] take breaks." Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 23. Plaintiff's requests were denied. Amended Complaint, Facts Section, ¶ 19. Delta placed "Adams on short-term disability leave which was [then] converted to [unpaid] medical leave[,]" effective September 2014. Id. ¶ 18; see also id. ¶ 25. While on leave, plaintiff applied to be a Delta flight attendant; [*5]  however she was denied the position.7 Id. ¶¶ 20, 24.
Plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC and received a right to sue letter on January 19, 2016.8 See Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 25; see also EEOC Dismissal and Notice of Rights, annexed to Plaintiff's Complaint, ECF No. 1, at 29.

B. Procedural History
Plaintiff filed her federal Complaint on April 19, 2016. ECF No. 1. The defendants requested a pre-motion conference to move to dismiss the Complaint and plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. ECF No. 11. The defendants now move to dismiss the Amended Complaint and filed the fully briefed motion on March 8, 2017.9 ECF Nos. 18-23. On March 22, 2017, plaintiff filed a document entitled "Reply to Motion to Dismiss/Answer to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike", which the Court liberally construes as a sur-reply. ECF No. 24. The instant motion to dismiss was referred to me for a Report and Recommendation on October 3, 2017.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor. Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter ... to [*6]  'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); see Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (permitting dismissal of a complaint that does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted). Assuming the facts as pleaded are true, there should be enough factual support laid out in plaintiff's complaint to "raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.
As a general rule, courts "do not consider matters outside the pleadings in deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim." Nakahata v. New York-Presbyterian Healthcare Sys, Inc., 723 F.3d 192, 202 (2d Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). Moreover, courts "do not look beyond 'facts stated on the face of the complaint, . . . documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and... matters of which judicial notice may be taken.'" Goel v. Bunge, Ltd., 820 F.3d 554, 559 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Concord Associates. L.P. v. Entm't Props. Tr., 817 F.3d 46, 51 n.2 (2d Cir. 2016)).
The Court is obliged to construe a pro se plaintiff's complaint liberally, while examining the complaint for "factual allegations sufficient to meet the plausibility requirement." Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). The Court must therefore interpret the complaint "to raise the strongest arguments that [it] suggest[s]." Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Burgos v. Hopkins, 14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal quotations and other citations omitted)). Nevertheless, while the Court must accept[] all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw[] all [*7]  reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor[,]" Capital Mgmt. Select Fund Ltd. v. Bennett, 680 F.3d 214, 219 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing Chambers, 282 F.3d at 152), this "tenet... is inapplicable to legal conclusions." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Moreover, the Court "cannot invent factual allegations that [plaintiff] has not pled." Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162, 170 (2d Cir. 2010).

DISCUSSION

A. Failure to Accommodate
The crux of plaintiff's complaint is that she suffered a left knee injury and that the defendants failed to provide her a reasonable accommodation as required under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the NYSHRL.10
1. Legal Standard
Title I of the ADA requires that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual" is defined as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. §§12111(2), (8). The Rehabilitation Act is similar to the ADA in that it '"prohibits disability-based discrimination,' but it applies specifically to 'government agencies and other recipients of federal funds.'" Castro v. City of New York, 24 F. Supp. 3d 250, 260 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Lyons v. Legal Aid Society, 68 F.3d 1512, 1514-15 (2d Cir. 1995)).
"[T]he Rehabilitation [*8]  Act and the ADA impose identical requirements," accordingly, courts consider the claims "in tandem." Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197 F.3d 611, 618 (2d Cir. 1999) (citing Lincoln Cercpac v. Health & Hosps. Corp., 147 F.3d 165, 167 (2d Cir. 1998)). "The only significant difference between the two statutes is that the Rehabilitation Act, unlike the ADA, requires that the alleged discrimination take place 'solely due to an individual's disability.'" Kelly v. New York State Office of Mental Health, 200 F. Supp. 3d 378, 390 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting Amie v. Shinseki, 806 F. Supp. 2d 641, 644 (W.D.N.Y. 2011) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original)). In addition, "[a]side from the broader scope of covered disabilities under New York Executive Law § 296, [a plaintiff's] state law reasonable accommodation claim is governed by the same legal standards as federal ADA claims." Hong Yin v. N. Shore LIJ Health Sys., 20 F. Supp. 3d 359, 376 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) ("For the most part, the ADA and the NYSHRL are construed similarly, and the clear legislative purpose in drafting the NYSHRL was to enact a definition of disability coextensive with comparable federal statutes.").
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: "(1) [she] is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of [her] disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, [she] could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) [*9]  the employer has refused to make such accommodations."11 McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125-26 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009)); see also Lyons, 68 F.3d at 1515 (applying the same standard to the Rehabilitation Act); Yin, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 376 (applying the same standard under the NYSHRL).
Here, the defendants argue that plaintiff fails to allege that she is a person with a disability. In addition, defendants argue that plaintiff's accommodation requests were unreasonable.
2. Plaintiff Alleges She is a Person With a Disability
The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act define "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual [.]"12 Kelly, 200 F. Supp. 3d at 390-91 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 29 U.S.C. §705(20)(B)). "[M]ajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (2)(A). The NYSHRL defines disability more broadly. Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 723 (2d Cir. 2002); Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., 140 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir. 1998) ("[U]nlike the federal statute, the state statute does not require [plaintiff] to identify a major life activity that is substantially limited by [her] impairment."); see also Glaser v. Gap Inc., 994 F. Supp. 2d 569, 573 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (explaining that the ADA has a "more rigorous standard" than the NYSHRL.).
Liberally [*10]  construing plaintiff's Amended Complaint, she alleges that she suffers from left knee pain related to ligament sprains, strains, and tears. Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 20. Defendants argue that plaintiff's allegations are generalized and vague. Defendants' Memorandum at 9. However, in construing the definition of disability "in favor of broad coverage[,]" the Court finds that plaintiff's Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads a physical impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (4)(A); see e.g. Bonnen, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145171, 2017 WL 4325703, at *1 ("The revised statute directs courts that 'the definition of disability in [the ADA] shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under [the ADA], to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of [the ADA].'" (quoting 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A)) (alterations in original)); Glenn v. Kaleida Health, No. 17 CV 0025 (LJV)(JJM), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106229, 2017 WL 3727313, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. July 7, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137931, 2017 WL 3713468 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2017) (same).13
Defendants argue that even if plaintiff has sufficiently pled a physical impairment, which they dispute, her alleged injury was temporary and therefore, did not substantially limit her in a major life activity. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Strike ("Defendants' [*11]  Reply"), ECF No. 22, at 4. In support, defendants cite to several cases dismissing ADA claims where courts found the alleged injury to be temporary in nature. See Defendants' Memorandum at 8 n.4. However, under the "ADA Amendment Act of 2008 and resulting regulations,... the 'effects of an impairment lasting or expected to last fewer than six months can be substantially limiting.'" Urena v. Swiss Post Sols., Inc., No. 16 Civ. 1998 (LGS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128856, 2016 WL 5173389, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2016) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix)); see also ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2, 122 Stat. 3553. Regardless, here, plaintiff specifically alleges that her left knee pain is permanent and "will last the duration of [her] life." Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 20; see also Orthopaedic Report (noting that plaintiff has a "Partial Disability" and not listing an end date).
Plaintiff further alleges that the injury prevents her from standing and walking for "more than 30 min[utes] without a break[.]" Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 21; see also Orthopaedic Report (listing plaintiff's physical limitations). Defendants argue that "courts within this Circuit have dismissed claims under Rule 12 where a plaintiff alleges an inability to 'sit[] or stand[] for an indeterminate amount of time' because such allegations do not establish a substantial limitation in the ability to stand."14 Defendants' Reply at 5 (quoting De La Noval v. Papa's Dodge, No. 14 CV 460 (VLB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38736, 2015 WL 1402010, at *5 (D. Conn. Mar. 26, 2015)). However, [*12]  "nothing in the [Amended] Complaint suggests that [Adams'] impairment was not substantially limiting."15 Urena, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128856, 2016 WL 5173389, at *5 (finding that plaintiff's knee injury, which limited her ability to "stand or sit for prolonged periods of time[,]" to be substantially limiting).
"Drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the [Amended] Complaint sufficiently pleads a 'physical... impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.'" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. 12102(1)). Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims on the ground that she fails to sufficiently plead a disability should be denied.16
3. Reasonable Accommodation
"An employer must make 'reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity."' Kelly, 200 F. Supp. 3d. at 398 (quoting 42 U.S.C § 12112(b)(5)(A)). "At the motion to dismiss stage, the [defendant] bears the weighty burden of showing that the fact-intensive inquiry prerequisite to a finding of reasonable accommodation falls completely [*13]  in its favor." Goonan v. FRB of N.Y., 916 F. Supp. 2d 470, 482 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).
Plaintiff alleges that she requested a chair and a desk as an accommodation for her disability. Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 19. In the alternative, plaintiff also alleges that she requested "a vacant position of flight attendant[.]" Id. Defendants denied plaintiff's requests but granted her medical leave. Id. ¶¶ 20, 24. Defendants argue that plaintiff cannot show that she was denied a reasonable accommodation as granting her medical leave was a reasonable accommodation. Defendants' Memorandum at 13. However, "[w]hether an accommodation is 'reasonable' is more appropriately determined on summary judgment or by the factfinder at trial."17 Vale v. Great Neck Water Pollution Control Dist., 80 F. Supp. 3d 426, 438 (E.D.N.Y. 2015); see also Bonnen, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145171, 2017 WL 4325703, at * 10 (After "[a]ccepting as true plaintiff's contention that defendant's proposed accommodations were unreasonable, the Court recommend[ed] a finding that plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that defendant refused to make reasonable accommodations for plaintiff's disability.").
In addition, defendants argue that plaintiff's requests for both a chair and desk, or in the alternative, for a flight attendant position, were unreasonable. The Court agrees that transferring plaintiff to a flight attendant position is beyond what the law requires. "In this [*14]  Circuit, in order to recover under the ADA for a failure to reasonably accommodate by transfer, a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that a vacancy existed into which he or she might have been transferred, and that [she] possessed the requisite skills for that position." Needle v. Alling & Cory, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 2d 100, 106-07 (W.D.N.Y. 2000) (citing Jackan v. New York State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 567 (2d Cir. 2000) (Plaintiff "bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion on the question whether a suitable vacancy existed at the time [s]he sought transfer."). Further, "the identified position cannot be such that reassignment to it would have involved a promotion."18 McBride, 583 F.3d at 98. Here, plaintiff's allegations regarding a flight attendant position are insufficient to show that "there existed a vacant position at [Delta] for which she was qualified and reassignment to which would not have involved her promotion." Id. at 99. Although the Court should grant defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim regarding a flight attendant position, the Court should deny defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim based on her request for a desk and chair. See e.g. Urena, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128856, 2016 WL 5173389, at *5 (finding a sufficiently plead reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA and the NYSHRL where plaintiff was fired after requesting to [*15]  avoid "sit[ting] or stand[ing] for more than an hour at a time and that she would need to avoid lifting objects of more than 15 pounds.").
Accordingly, as plaintiff's Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads that she is a person with a disability and that she requested but was denied a reasonable accommodation, the defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim should be granted in part and denied in part.19

B. Retaliation
Plaintiff also alleges a claim for retaliation under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, Title VII, and the NYSHRL. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that (1) she was engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of that activity; (3) the employee suffered a materially adverse action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action." Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, 157 (2d Cir. 2012); Smith v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 808 F. Supp. 2d 569, 581 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) ("Retaliation claims under the ADA... are subject to the same burden-shifting analysis as claims arising under Title VII." (citations omitted)); see also Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 287 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2002) ("The elements of a retaliation claim under either Section 504 or the ADA" are the same); Weissman v. Dawn Joy Fashions, Inc., 214 F.3d 224, 234 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting that the NYSHRL "anti-retaliation provisions are substantially similar to the ADA's provision."); [*16]  Yin, 20 F. Supp. 3d at 374 ("Retaliation claims under the ADA and the NYSHRL are analyzed under the same McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework as discrimination claims.").
Defendants assert that plaintiff's Amended Complaint is "devoid of any allegations to suggest she suffered from an adverse employment action after engaging in any protected activity." Defendants' Memorandum at 17. At the outset, the Court agrees that plaintiff's Amended Complaint is devoid of any allegations that she was retaliated against based on her gender. Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claim under Title VII should be granted. However, plaintiff does allege that she was retaliated against based on her request for an accommodation. Therefore, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claim under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the NYSHRL should be denied.
Defendants argue that plaintiff's Amended Complaint contains "only vague assertion[s] of any [protected] activity[.]" Id. However, liberally construed, plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges that her request for a reasonable accommodation was her protected activity. As alleged by plaintiff, "upon [her] request for reasonable accommodations, [*17]  [she], was subjected to [an] adverse employment decision" as she was "placed on medical leave" and denied an accommodation. Amended Complaint, Parties Section, ¶ 12. "A request for reasonable accommodation is an ADA-protected activity."20 Ugactz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., No. 10 CV 1247 (MKB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43481, 2013 WL 1232355, at *19 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2013) (citing Weixel, 287 F.3d at 149; Rodriguez v. Atria Sr. Living Group, Inc., 887 F. Supp. 2d 503, 512 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)). Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claims pursuant to the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the NYSHRL should be denied.21
C. Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiff also alleges a claim for a hostile work environment under the ADA, Title VII, and the Rehabilitation Act. Amended Complaint, Count VI. "A hostile work environment claim requires a plaintiff to prove two principal elements. First, she must show that 'the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult. . . that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment."'22 Kelly, 200 F. Supp. 3d at 399 (quoting Lekettey v. City of New York, 637 F. App'x 659, 661 (2d Cir. 2016) (summary order)). "Second, a plaintiff must show that 'a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer.'" Id. (quoting Lekettey, 637 F. App'x at 661).
Here, even liberally construed, plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to state a claim [*18]  for a hostile work environment. Outside of plaintiff's allegation that a supervisor referred to her as the actress Amy Adams, there are no facts to support plaintiff's claim of a hostile work environment.23 Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's hostile work environment claim should be granted.

D. Claims against Defendant Richard Anderson
The defendants also move to dismiss the claims brought against Richard Anderson, the former CEO of Delta. Defendants' Memorandum at 18. Plaintiff asserts that she has named "Richard Anderson, as case law states that the acting CEO must be listed in his official and individual capacity [.]" Plaintiff's Opposition at 14. However, plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to allege any facts specific to Anderson.
There is no right of recovery against individuals under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or Title VII. See Bahr v. City Univ. of New York/York Coll., No. 15 CV 4380 (MKB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171492, 2016 WL 8711060, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2016) ("Individuals are not subject to liability under Title VII, the ADA, and the ADEA." (collecting cases)); Cohn v. Keyspan Corp., 713 F. Supp. 2d 143, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) ("Individuals may not be sued in their individual or personal capacity under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act."). Accordingly, any claims brought against defendant Anderson under Title VII, the ADA, or the Rehabilitation [*19]  Act should be dismissed.
However, individual defendants may be sued in their individual capacities under the New York State Human Rights Law. Lopes v. Caffe Centrale LLC, 548 F. Supp. 2d 47, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 157-59 (2d Cir. 2004)). "There are two bases for holding an individual liable under the NYSHRL—as an employer under Section 296(1) or as an 'aider or abettor' under Section 296(6)." Prince v. Madison Square Garden, 427 F. Supp. 2d 372, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (citing N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 296(1), (6)). As there are no allegations that Anderson aided or abetted the allegedly discriminatory conduct, the Court only considers liability under Section 296(1).
"Individuals are liable as employers under Section 296(1) only if they have an ownership interest, or if they themselves have the authority to hire and fire employees." Edwards v. Jericho Union Free Sch. Dist., 904 F. Supp. 2d 294, 304 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal quotations omitted). In addition, a "plaintiff must establish that the defendant 'had some . . . connection [to] the underlying [claim].'"24 Olsen v. Suffolk County, No. 15 CV 4064 (JS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132519, 2016 WL 5395846, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2016) (quoting Magnotti v. Crossroads Healthcare Mgmt, LLC, No. 14 CV 6679 (ILG), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69929, 2016 WL 3080801, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 27, 2016)). Here, as the former CEO of Delta, Anderson likely qualifies as an employer who had an ownership interest or had the authority to hire and fire employees. Gorman v. Covidien, LLC, 146 F. Supp. 3d 509, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir. 1995)); Valcarcel v. First Quality Maint., 41 Misc. 3d 1222(A), 981 N.Y.S.2d 639 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2013) (denying defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's NYSHRL claims against the CEO). However, plaintiff fails to show that Anderson, besides being the former CEO, "ha[s] any connection to Plaintiff's underlying claims." Olsen, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132519, 2016 WL 5395846 at *16 (granting defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's NYSHRL claims alleged [*20]  against a CEO where the complaint failed to allege any involvement of the CEO in the alleged discrimination); see also Magnotti, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69929, 2016 WL 3080801, at *3 (denying defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's NYSHRL claims after finding that it was "plausible that [the individual defendant] was involved in, or at least condoned," the actions against plaintiff.).
As there is no basis alleged in the Amended Complaint for any federal claim against defendant Anderson, I respectfully recommend that defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims against Anderson should be granted. However, any claims against defendant Anderson under the NYSHRL should be dismissed without prejudice.

E. Additional Claims
Liberally construed plaintiff's Amended Complaint also alleges claims under Section 1983 and the Federal Torts Claims Act. However, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim under these statutes. Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss these claims should be granted.
1. Section 1983
To state a claim pursuant to Section 1983, a plaintiff must allege that "[t]he conduct at issue 'must have been committed by a person acting under color of state law' and 'must have deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the [*21]  United States.'" Cornejo v. Bell, 592 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Pitchell v. Callan, 13 F.3d 545, 547 (2d Cir. 1994)). Here, plaintiff's Section 1983 claim should be dismissed as Adams "has not alleged that ... the airline or any of [its] staff members are state actors, were acting in concert with state actors, or were serving as an instrumentality of the state. Mallgren v. New York City, No. 13 CV 724 (MKB), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32286, 2014 WL 988838, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2014) (dismissing plaintiff's Section 1983 claims against Delta Airlines).
2. Federal Tort Claims Act
"Under the Federal Tort Claims Act [], a person may bring a claim against the United States for personal injury 'caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.'" Wright v. United States, No. 09 CV 5411 (NGG), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110677, 2012 WL 3249694, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2012) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(1)). Here, plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to state a claim that she was injured by an employee of the United States Government during her employment with Delta. See id. (dismissing plaintiff's FTCA claim as defendant was not an employee of the US Government). Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's FTCA claim should be granted.

F. Leave to Amend
Plaintiff requests leave to amend the complaint.25 Plaintiff's Opposition at 36. Defendants ask this Court to deny plaintiff leave to amend as she has already filed an amended complaint. Defendants' Reply at 9-10. Although [*22]  the Court would generally afford plaintiff an opportunity to amend her complaint, courts may deny leave to replead where amendment would be futile. Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000) ("the court should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated."); see also Herbert v. Delta Airlines, No. 12 CV 1250 (SLT), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140320, 2014 WL 4923100, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) (denying pro se plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint).
Here, plaintiff has already filed an amended complaint. Moreover, plaintiff cannot state a plausible Section 1983 or FTCA claim. Thus, any attempt to replead by plaintiff would be futile. See Cuoco, 222 F.3d at 112 ("The problem with [plaintiff's] causes of action [are] substantive; better pleading will not cure [them]. Repleading would thus be futile. Such a futile request to replead should be denied."). Accordingly, the Court should not be grant plaintiff leave to amend again.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that the defendants' motion to dismiss should be granted in part and denied in part. Defendants' motion to dismiss should be granted with respect to plaintiff's federal claims against defendant Anderson, plaintiff's claims under Title VII, plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim pertaining [*23]  to her request to transfer to a flight attendant position, plaintiff's hostile work environment claims, and plaintiff's claims under Section 1983 and the FTCA. Plaintiff's state law claim against CEO Anderson should be dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiff's claims against Delta alleging that it failed to accommodate her request for a desk and chair and retaliated against her in violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the NYSHRL should proceed.

FILING OF OBJECTIONS TO REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties shall have fourteen days from service of this Report to file written objections. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6. Such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court. Any request for an extension of time to file objections must be made within the fourteen-day period. Failure to file a timely objection to this Report generally waives any further judicial review. Marcella v. Capital Dist. Physicians' Health Plan, Inc., 293 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2002); Small v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 892 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1989); see Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435(1985).
SO ORDERED.
