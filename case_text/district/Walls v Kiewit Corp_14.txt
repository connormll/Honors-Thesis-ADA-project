CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court GRANTS the motion to dismiss
Before the Court is a motion to dismiss brought by Defendant Kiewit Power Constructors Co., sued as Kiewit Corporation ("Defendant"). See Dkt. # 11 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Kevin Walls ("Plaintiff") opposes the motion, see Dkt. # 12 ("Opp."), and Defendant replied, see Dkt. # 13 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matters appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); L.R. 7-15. After considering the moving, opposing, and reply papers, the Court GRANTS the motion.
I. Background
Plaintiff makes the following factual allegations. Defendant hired Plaintiff to work at the Alamitos Generating Station in Long Beach, California, on February 22, 2018. See Complaint, Dkt. # 1-1 ("Compl."), ¶ 10. Plaintiff was hired as a union boilermaker, and his job duties included crane-use rigging. Id. Plaintiff was scheduled to work four 10-hour days, and two 8-hour days. Id. One day later, on February 23, Plaintiff requested leather protective gloves, and his request was declined by his [*2]  supervisor. Id. ¶ 12. Plaintiff was assigned to dismantle steel using a torch, and on eleven occasions he requested protective leather gloves, but was denied. Id. ¶ 13. Plaintiff's hands were "getting burned," and he showed them to his supervisor. Id. ¶ 14.
Additionally, when Plaintiff was hired, he was told by onsite foreman Jason that he was "an old man," and "that he needed to 'slow down.'" Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff was fifty-nine years old at the time, and almost forty years older than several of his co-workers. Id.
Later, Plaintiff overheard someone saying "There is a guy in the south yard asking for leather gloves." Id. ¶ 16. "Soon thereafter," Jason told Plaintiff that "management decided to terminate him," and that they "did not want to see [Plaintiff] get hurt," which was "a reference to [Plaintiff's] age." Id.
On August 19, 2019 Plaintiff sued Defendant in Los Angeles Superior Court. See generally id. On September 25, 2019 Defendant removed the action to this Court, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1. Plaintiff brings the following causes of action:
First Cause of Action: Disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing [*3]  Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code §§ 12940 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 19-34.
Second Cause of Action: Age discrimination in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 35-49.
Third Cause of Action: Failure to accommodate disability in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 50-64.
Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 65-79.
Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA, on the basis of disability, age, and protected conduct. Id. ¶¶ 80-87.
Sixth Cause of Action: Retaliation in violation of FEHA. Id. ¶¶ 88-94.
Seventh Cause of Action: Wrongful termination. Id. ¶¶ 95-104.
Eighth Cause of Action: Violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. Id. ¶¶ 105-111.
Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff's first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action on the grounds that Plaintiff has not alleged any specific facts to support a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See generally Mot.
II. Legal Standard
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In assessing the adequacy of the complaint, the court must accept all pleaded facts as true and construe them [*4]  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Turner v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 788 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009). The court then determines whether the complaint "allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. However, "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. Accordingly, "for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory factual content, and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief." Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).
III. Discussion
Defendant moves to dismiss: (1) Plaintiff's first cause of action, disability discrimination, and fifth cause of action, failure to prevent discrimination, to the extent it is based on disability; (2) third cause of action, failure to accommodate disability; (3) fourth cause of action, failure to engage in the interactive process; (4) sixth cause of action for retaliation in violation of FEHA, and (5) seventh cause of action for wrongful termination to the extent its underlying claims fail. See generally Mot. The Court takes each argument in turn.
A. First and Fifth Causes of Action [*5] 
FEHA protects employees from discrimination based on a wide variety of grounds, including disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). To establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he: "(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159-60, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011). To satisfy the third element of a disability discrimination claim, the plaintiff's disability must have been a "substantial motivating factor in the particular employment decision." Harris v. Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013).
A failure to prevent discrimination claim is a derivative claim based on disability discrimination; and thus, if there is a factual finding that there is no discrimination, it cannot survive. Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("'[T]here's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not preventing discrimination that didn't happen, for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred . . .' Employers should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent [*6]  such conduct, except where the actions took place and were not prevented."); Jaffe v. Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Servs., Inc., No. 2:17-cv-03421-ODW (Ex), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116445, 2017 WL 3160561, at *6 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 2017) (granting motion to dismiss failure to prevent discrimination claim after finding that plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to state a disability discrimination claim).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to establish any element of his prima facie disability discrimination claim. See Mot. 4-8.

i. Disability
To qualify as a protected individual, a plaintiff "must demonstrate his impairment constitutes a disability according to the statutory definition." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 47, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). Under FEHA, a physical disability is defined as: "[h]aving any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss" that both (1) "affects" one or more defined body systems, and (2) "limits a major life activity." Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(m)(1)(A)-(B). "A physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss limits a major life activity if it makes the achievement of the major life activity difficult." Id. at § 12926(m)(1)(B)(ii). It is insufficient for a plaintiff "simply to allege a disability or to identify an injury or physical condition," instead, [*7]  "[t]o proceed as a physically disabled person under the first prong of the statutory definition, [a plaintiff] must demonstrate his injury or physical condition . . . makes 'difficult' the achievement of work or some other major life activity." Gelfo, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 47. In addition, a person is physically disabled if the person is "regarded or treated by the individual's employer as having, or having had, any condition that makes achievement of a major life activity difficult, or as having, or having had, a physiological condition that is not presently disabling, but that may become so." Id. at 46; Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(m)(4)-(5).
For instance, in Zessi v. Ameripride Services, a plaintiff alleged that she had a hand injury, and a doctor told her the hand was broken and provided a note explaining her disability and including work modifications. Zessi v. Ameripride Servs., Inc., No. 19-CV-03384-SI, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135811, 2019 WL 3779775, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2019). However, the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the disability discrimination claim because the complaint did "not actually allege that plaintiff's broken hand limited any major life activity (including working), and the complaint [did] not contain any facts showing that plaintiff's injury impeded her ability to perform her job." Id.
Here, Plaintiff [*8]  alleged that he sustained injuries and burned his hand. See Compl. ¶¶ 13-14. However, Plaintiff does not allege any facts to indicate how severe the injury was, the duration of the condition, the specific medical condition from which he suffered, or any facts indicating if or how Plaintiff's injury "limited any major life activity," or what major life activities were limited. See Mot. 5:22-28; Zessi, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135811, 2019 WL 3779775, at *3. "Without allegation of such factual details, the court is unable to determine whether plaintiff's alleged condition makes achievement of a major life activity difficult and thus constitute a protected condition under FEHA." Jaco v. Winco Holdings, Inc., No. 1:18-cv-00301-DAD-EPG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55882, 2019 WL 1438069, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2019).
In opposition, Plaintiff points to the section of FEHA that defines disability to include when a plaintiff is "regarded or treated" as having a disability by the employer. See Opp. 3-4; Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(m)(4)-(5). But Plaintiff's complaint does not contain any factual allegation that his employer treated him as disabled, under the statutory definition. See Reply 1-2.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish that he suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability.

ii. Essential Duties
A plaintiff must allege that he could [*9]  perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations; and "essential functions" are defined as "fundamental job duties of the employment position," not "marginal functions" of the position. Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(f).
In King v. C&K Market, Inc., the plaintiff had merely speculated that "she would be able to return to work with reasonable accommodations and perform the essential functions of her job" after an unspecified duration of medical leave is simply a legal conclusion cast in the form of a factual allegation. King v. C&K Mkt., Inc., No. 2:16-cv-00559-TLN-CMK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25352, 2018 WL 934551, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2018). But the court concluded that such legal conclusions were insufficient to state facts demonstrating her ability to perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation, "or even what the essential functions of her job are." Id.
Similarly, here, Plaintiff merely states that he "was qualified for the position . . . and was able to perform the essential functions of the job." Compl. ¶ 23. But this conclusory statement is insufficient. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Estrada v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., No. CV 17-1100-MWF(FFMX), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86846, 2017 WL 2468773, at *5 (C.D. Cal. June 6, 2017) (holding that the complaint's statement that the plaintiff was "able to perform the essential duties required of [*10]  him" was a "recitation of the statutory language [that] is insufficient under the Iqbal standard to state a claim"). Moreover, Plaintiff does not allege what the essential functions of his job were. Without such factual allegations as to: (1) what the essential functions of the job were, and (2) whether Plaintiff could perform them with or without a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff does not state a plausible claim for relief.

iii. Substantial Motivating Factor
Finally, even if Plaintiff had otherwise sufficiently pleaded a disability, Plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to infer that the disability was a substantial motivating factor in the employment decision. See Harris, 56 Cal. 4th at 232. Plaintiff alleges that he "overheard someone" saying that he was asking for gloves, and that "soon thereafter" the "management decided to terminate him." Compl. ¶ 16. However, Plaintiff does not allege facts that would raise the reasonable inference that he was terminated because of his disability; such as whether the person who made the statement about the gloves played a role in his termination decision, or what connection there was between his termination and his request for gloves and/or burned hands. Plaintiff [*11]  alleges "as a direct and proximate result of [Plaintiff's] disability" he suffered adverse employment actions," id. ¶ 24, but this conclusory allegation, without more, is insufficient. See Jaffe, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116445, 2017 WL 3160561, at *6 ("Jaffe has alleged no facts showing any connection between Sedgwick's conduct and his disability. To state a claim, Jaffe must sufficiently plead that the adverse employment actions taken against him were substantially motivated by disability discrimination."). In fact, the only factual allegation he makes with regard to his termination is in connection with his age: that the management said they "did not want to see you get hurt," which was a "reference to [Plaintiff's] age." Compl. ¶ 16.
For these reasons, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief for disability discrimination. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's first cause of action for disability discrimination, and GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fifth cause of action to the extent it is based on disability discrimination.
B. Third and Fourth Causes of Action
It is an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental [*12]  disability of an applicant or employee" unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). The essential elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009).
As discussed above, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that he has a disability covered by the FEHA. In addition, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged facts showing that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodation. For instance, Plaintiff does not state if and how his burned hands affected his ability to perform the unspecified essential functions of his position, and whether a reasonable accommodation, whether the gloves or something else, would have made him qualified to perform those functions. See Weaver v. Bimbo Bakeries, USA, Inc., No. 2:18-cv-00303-MCE-EFB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54696, 2019 WL 1426327, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2019) (granting a motion to dismiss a failure to accommodate claim where the plaintiff's complaint was "devoid of factual allegations that he was physically [*13]  able to return to work with reasonable accommodation, or that he could perform the essential job functions as a delivery person, or that he could have worked in an alternate position," or "which working conditions or essential duties made working as a delivery person 'intolerable or impossible' for Plaintiff, or what particular conduct by Defendant constitutes a failure to reasonably accommodate"). Instead Plaintiff states legal conclusions which are insufficient to state a claim. See Compl. ¶¶ 53-54 ("Defendant failed and refused to accommodate Plaintiff's needs" and "Plaintiff was qualified for the position of employment that he held with Defendant and was able to perform the essential functions of that job if such reasonable accommodation had been made by Defendant"); Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79.
Similarly, it is unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). FEHA imposes a separate duty on an employer to engage in the interactive [*14]  process, to determine reasonable accommodations. Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).
For the same reasons as discussed above, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged facts to show that he had a disability covered by FEHA, or that he requested a reasonable accommodation.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's third cause of action for failure to accommodate disability in violation of FEHA, and GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for failure to engage in the interactive process.
C. Sixth Cause of Action
It is unlawful for an employer to "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part [FEHA] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(h). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show "(1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) [an employer] subjected him to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the [employer's] action." Dinslage v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 5 Cal. App. 5th 368, 380-81, 209 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2016). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not satisfied the first or third element.

i. Engaged in a Protected Activity
For protection [*15]  under the "opposition" clause, "an employee must have opposed an employment practice made unlawful by the statute." Id. at 381 "[W]hile a plaintiff need not have invoked magic words in order for his complaints to constitute protected activity, he must have alerted his employer to his belief that discrimination, not merely unfair personnel treatment, had occurred." Gutierrez v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., Inc., No. C 11-3428 CW, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155462, 2012 WL 5372607, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 30, 2012) (internal quotations omitted). A plaintiff "must not only show that he subjectively (that is, in good faith) believed that his employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices, but also that his belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented," and the "objective reasonableness of an employee's belief that his employer has engaged in a prohibited employment practice must be measured against existing substantive law." Dinslage, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 381-82 (internal quotations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff has alleged that he suffered an injury to his hands on the job, that he requested protective equipment (leather gloves), that his supervisor "failed to accommodate him" or engage "in a good faith interactive process," and that he was [*16]  terminated. See Compl. ¶¶ 12-14, 17. Plaintiff also alleges the following boilerplate allegations: "Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that as a consequence of lodging complaints with Defendants about the harassing and discriminatory acts being committed against Plaintiff, coupled with Plaintiff's disability sustained while on-the-job . . . Defendant took retaliatory action against Plaintiff by failing to conduct a good faith interactive process aimed at reuniting Plaintiff with Plaintiff job, failing to determine the essential functions of Plaintiffs job, mistreat [sic] Plaintiff, and deny [sic] Plaintiff advancement and promotion." Id. ¶ 90. The complaint also alleges that Defendant "unlawfully retaliated against Plaintiff after he engaged in protected activity after being injured on the job, such a without limitation, filing or intending to file for workers' compensation benefits due to safety concerns and requesting accommodation, and, lodging workplace complaints related to harassment. . ." Id. ¶ 91. Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to conclude that Plaintiff opposed an employment practice made unlawful by the statute; and to the extent he argues [*17]  that he was retaliated against for requesting leather gloves, he does not adequately explain why this constitutes an opposition to an employment practice unlawful under FEHA. See Kull v. Home Depot U.S.A, Inc., No. 18CV933 JM (JLB), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114860, 2019 WL 3006472, at *9 (S.D. Cal. July 10, 2019) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that "he engaged in a protected activity when he sent an email to AACG complaining about safety violations"). His allegations that he "lodged workplace complaints related to the harassment and discrimination that he was facing," are conclusory. See Compl. ¶ 91.

ii. Causation
The "decision maker's knowledge of protected activity [is] necessary for causation." Soares v. California, No. 2:16-00128 WBS EFB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84044, 2016 WL 3519411, at *5 (E.D. Cal. June 28, 2016) (quoting Billberry v. Brennan, 608 Fed. App'x. 553, 554 (9th Cir. 2015)). "In the absence of direct evidence, a causal link requires showing that the defendant knew of the protected activity and that the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action was 'very close.'" Gutierrez, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155462, 2012 WL 5372607, at *5.
Plaintiff alleges that Jason communicated to him that "management decided to terminate him," but does not allege that anyone involved in making the decision to terminate him knew about any allegedly protected activity. See Compl. ¶ 16. Instead, Jason seemed to indicate that he was being terminated because of his age. [*18]  Id. The complaint does not allege any facts indicating who decided to terminate him, or whether that person knew of any allegedly protected activity. See Soares, 2016 WL 3519411, at *5 (granting motion to dismiss retaliation claim because "plaintiff's FAC is silent as to who made the decision to terminate her and whether the individual or individuals responsible for that decision even knew she had made complaints about harassment and discrimination"). These allegations are insufficient to state a claim for relief.
Because Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity and that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for relief for retaliation. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's sixth cause of action.
D. Seventh Cause of Action
Plaintiff alleges a claim for wrongful termination for labor code and government code violations. See Compl. ¶¶ 95-104. In order to sustain a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy, a plaintiff must prove "that his dismissal violated a policy that is (1) fundamental, (2) beneficial for the public, and (3) [*19]  embodied in a statute or constitutional provision." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994).
To the extent that this cause of action rests on Plaintiff's FEHA claim for disability discrimination and retaliation, it fails because the underlying claims fail. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) ("[B]ecause Hanson's FEHA claim fails, his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails."). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's seventh cause of action, to the extent that the alleged public policy violations rest on violations of FEHA for disability discrimination and retaliation.
E. Leave to Amend
Whether to grant leave to amend rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. See Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir. 1995). The Court considers whether leave to amend would cause undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, and whether granting leave to amend would be futile. See Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe v. United States, 90 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 1996). Generally, dismissal without leave to amend is improper "unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment." Jackson v. Carey, 353 F.3d 750, 758 (9th Cir. 2003).
Here, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims because Plaintiff inadequately pleaded them. However, the Court does not believe, at this point in the proceedings, that amendment would be futile. The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff leave to [*20]  amend.
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss, as follows:
• The Court GRANTS the motion and DISMISSES Plaintiff's first cause of action for disability discrimination; fifth cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination to the extent it is based on disability; third cause of action for failure to accommodate disability; fourth cause of action for failure to engage in the interactive process; sixth cause of action for retaliation in violation of FEHA; and seventh cause of action for wrongful termination to the extent its underlying claims fail. The Court GRANTS leave to amend.
• Plaintiff's second cause of action for age discrimination, and eighth cause of action for violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., are unaffected.
Because the Court also GRANTS Plaintiff leave to amend, Plaintiff must file an amended complaint by January 29, 2020. Failure to file an amended complaint by that date will result in dismissal of Plaintiff's claims with prejudice.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
