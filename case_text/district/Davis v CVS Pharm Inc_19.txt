Opinion



ORDER RE DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY [*2]  JUDGMENT [31]
Before the Court is Defendants CVS Pharmacy, Inc., CVS Health Solutions LLC, and Garfield Beach CVS, L.L.C.'s ("CVS") Motion for Summary Judgment ("MSJ"). [Doc. # 31.] The MSJ is fully briefed. [Doc. ## 36 ("Opp."), 43 ("Reply).] Having carefully considered the parties' written arguments, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the MSJ.

I.

RELEVANT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Anthony Davis filed his Complaint in Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 3, 2021. Compl. [Doc. # 1-1]. He asserts claims against CVS under California law for (1) disability discrimination under California Government Code section 12940(a); (2) failure to make a reasonable accommodation under section 12940(m); (3) failure to engage in the interactive process under section 12940(n); (4) failure to prevent disability discrimination under section 12940(k); (5) retaliation under section 12940(h); (6) violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2; (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Compl. ¶¶ 51-107. On March 22, 2021, CVS filed its Answer, then removed to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. [Doc. ## 1-2, 1.] CVS now moves for summary judgment on all of Davis's claims.

II.

EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
Davis seeks to exclude the testimony of three [*3]  witnesses pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c). CVS seeks to rely on declarations from (a) Paul Broadus, an expert witness who has presented evidence regarding whether Davis could perform the essential duties of a Store Team Leader or Store Manager position at the Artesia store where he worked [Doc. # 31-9], (b) Kim Blodgett, a fact witness who attests to her own duties as a Store Team Leader [Doc. # 31-6], and (c) Elizabeth Jesse, a CVS employee who provides evidence regarding CVS's Transitional Duty Program ("TRD") [Doc. # 31-7].1 CVS apparently disclosed Broadus as a witness just one day prior to filing its MSJ, and did not disclose Blodgett or Jesse. CVS did not file a response to Davis's request to exclude these witnesses.
Rule 37(c) prohibits a party from using information or a witness that was not timely disclosed during the discovery process to supply evidence on a motion, unless the failure to disclose was substantially justified or harmless. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). Sanctions are "automatic" and "self-executing," and "[c]ourts have upheld the use of the sanction even when a litigant's entire cause of action or defense has been precluded." Yeti by Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp., 259 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001).
Davis objects that CVS did not disclose Broadus until November 10, 2022, and filed its [*4]  MSJ on November 11, 2022. But November 10, 2022 was the initial expert disclosure deadline, to which the parties stipulated. [See Doc. # 23.] CVS's disclosure was therefore timely. To the extent that the disclosure occurred uncomfortably close to the deadline for the parties to file their dispositive motions, the Court notes that the parties themselves stipulated to this date. The Court therefore declines to exclude Broadus's testimony.
Blodgett and Jesse were not disclosed at all before the MSJ was filed, and CVS apparently refused to make Blodgett or Jesse available to be deposed before Davis's Opposition was due. Still, the fact discovery deadline did not expire until December 1, 2022, after the MSJ was filed and after Davis's Opposition was due. The Court does not condone CVS's apparent decision to ambush Davis with these witnesses and refusal to allow them to be deposed. But because the witnesses were disclosed within the discovery period, Rule 37(c) does not prevent CVS from relying on their testimony in support of this motion. The Court therefore declines to exclude their testimony. Given CVS's tardiness in disclosing Blodgett and Jesse, however, the Court will extend the discovery deadline [*5]  solely for the purpose of allowing Davis to depose them if he so chooses.

III.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND2
Davis began working for CVS in 1985, and served as a Store Manager from 1986 to 2016. AMF 1-2. In 2016, he transferred (at his request) to a new store in Artesia, California, and moved from a salaried position as a Store Manager to an hourly position as a Store Team Leader. AMF 3-4. He worked as a Store Team Leader from 2016 until March 2020. SUF 1. Working as a Store Team Leader in Artesia included receiving a delivery approximately once a week, which involved lifting boxes, removing product from them, and staging the products around the store. SUF 2; AMF 64. The current Store Team Leader for the store, Kim Blodgett, attests that the job is "physically demanding and requires constant movement throughout [her] shift." Blodgett Decl. ¶ 5.

A. First Work Restrictions
While working for CVS, Davis suffered a cumulative trauma injury to his cervical spine. AMF 6. He underwent spinal surgery for the injury on January 25, 2017. AMF 7. He took a leave of absence, which was extended several times, and returned to work on July 3, 2017. SUF 4-5; AMF 8. His work restrictions from his surgeon, [*6]  Dr. Payam Farjoodi, provided that he could not lift over 20 pounds. He provided these restrictions to CVS upon his return. AMF 8; SUF 6-7. A member of CVS's centralized Reasonable Accommodations department, Terri Chhay, determined that this restriction could be accommodated, and approved Davis's request for duty modifications. SUF 3, 8. But when Chhay reached out to Michael Ibrahim, then a District Manager and Davis's direct supervisor, to determine whether the restrictions were being accommodated, Ibrahim appeared confused.3 He responded: "I thought the [Reasonable Accommodations] department should take care of this! I didn't think the field managers have that kind of authority to give these kind of decisions any more." AMF 10.
Davis provided regular updates regarding his work restrictions to Ibrahim. AMF 11. Still, Davis testified that he was nevertheless required to continue to perform his regular duties because "it was only at the time two people at the store, me and a clerk." Davis Depo. at 308:15-17. CVS did not provide any additional coverage for the store. Davis Decl. ¶ 3 [Doc. # 36-2].
On October 25, 2017, Davis was evaluated by another healthcare provider, Beverly J. Lassiter-Brown, [*7]  who placed him on the following restrictions:
No climbing, patient should work in a sit down job and frequent changes of position as tolerated, SIT AND STAND AS TOLERATED Limited standing or walking up to 8 hours per day, limited overhead work to 8 hours per day, limited lift, limited push and limited pull up to 10 lbs. The patient has been advised not to drive or operate heavy equipment. Other restrictions: CAN CLIMB STAIRS, CANNOT CLIMB LADDERS.
Maloney Decl., Ex. B at 39 [Doc. # 31-2] (emphasis added). Davis submitted a Work Status Report to the Reasonable Accommodations department with these restrictions. SUF 10; AMF 14. When a Reasonable Accommodations department employee asked Ibrahim, he informed her that these restrictions were being accommodated and that Davis had been placed on TRD effective October 30, 2017. Maloney Decl., Ex. B at 23-24; AMF 17. TRD was a program administered by CVS's Risk Management department from 2012 to 2020, and provided that employees who were temporarily unable to perform all their normal job functions could receive up to 8 weeks of TRD benefits, and assigned different duties for that period. Jesse Decl. ¶ 5 [Doc. # 31-7]. CVS internal records reflect [*8]  that from November 2017 to January 2018, Davis received eight weeks of TRD. Id. at ¶ 8. Davis disputes the accuracy of these records. On November 1, 2017, Davis contacted the Reasonable Accommodations department, apparently to explain that he was supposed to be on TRD. He asked his Reasonable Accommodations contact how to report TRD hours, and was told that his manager would need to report the hours to workers compensation. AMF 15. Yet, his manager, Ibrahim, testified that he believed Davis was responsible for reporting his own TRD hours. AMF 16. As previously stated, on November 9, 2017, Ibrahim represented to the Reasonable Accommodations department that Davis's restrictions were being accommodated, because he was on TRD. AMF 17. But Davis asserts that Ibrahim had done nothing to accommodate his restrictions. Davis Decl. ¶¶ 5-6. He also attests that he complained to Ibrahim multiple times that his work restrictions were not being accommodated. Id. at ¶ 4; see also Davis Depo. at 312:11-24. Ibrahim also witnessed him violating his work restrictions. AMF 20. Davis did not inform the Reasonable Accommodations department that he was violating his work restrictions. See Davis Depo. at [*9]  312:11-12.
Davis received a letter dated November 29, 2017 stating that his TRD would expire in approximately four weeks. AMF 22. Reasonable Accommodations Partner Christine Arsenault's records show that, on December 6, 2017, Davis contacted her because he had received a packet in the mail regarding TRD "and he had some questions." Arsenault Decl., Ex. E at 82 [Doc. # 31-3]. He told her he believed he "would still have the same restrictions after 12/25 (sedentary work only)" and asked what would happen if those restrictions could not be accommodated. Id. Those same records reflect that, on December 18, 2017, she contacted him and left him a voicemail "to see if he agrees with the permanent restrictions." She spoke to him on December 19, 2017, and he said he agreed with the weight restrictions and said he would have a permanent sit-down restriction. Id. Her records show that he said he "realizes in the role he is in the requirement is 35 lbs," and that he "realized that he probably will not be accommodated." Id.

B. Revised Work Restrictions
On December 26, 2017, Davis was evaluated by a health care provider who identified the following limitations:
Limited stand/walk/overhead work up to [*10]  8 hours as tolerated
No climbing
Limited lift/push/pull up to 15 pounds
Sit and stand as tolerated
Arsenault Decl., Ex. E at 87. These limitations were expected to last for eight weeks. Id. The same health care provider identified the following accommodations:
No lift/push/pull over 15 pounds
Limited stand/walk/overhead work
Rest as needed
Sit and stand as tolerated
The provider recommended these accommodations last for eight weeks. Id. On January 7, 2018, Davis's treating physician prepared a supplemental report that imposed a "no push/pull lift of weight greater than 15 lbs" restriction. SUF 16. On January 11, 2018, Arsenault's records reflect that she spoke to Ibrahim and he told her the accommodations could likely be approved. Arsenault Decl., Ex. E at 84.4 In fact, he said that Davis's store was in a "very good place," even though Davis's restrictions had been in place for a while. AMF 28. On April 2, 2018, CVS records show that Davis was approved for an accommodation of "no lifting more than 15 lbs," starting on March 5, 2018. Maloney Decl., Ex. C at 47.

C. "Sedentary Work Only" Restriction and Leave
On August 9, 2018, Davis was evaluated by a different treating physician, Dr. Saeed Nick, [*11]  who imposed a "sedentary work only" restriction. SUF 18. On August 23, 2018, Davis submitted a document reflecting this restriction to the Reasonable Accommodations department. SUF 19. Davis called Arsenault on September 5, 2018 to see if she had received this note. AMF 29. On September 13, 2018, Arsenault spoke to Ibrahim, who told her that Davis's store could not accommodate sit-down work only for a Store Manager. AMF 32. On September 18, 2018, Arsenault's records reflect that CVS determined it was unable to accommodate this request. Arsenault Decl., Ex. F at 102. Davis was thus placed on another leave of absence until the "sedentary work only" restriction was lifted. Id. Arsenault's records show the "sedentary work only" restriction as temporary, until December 13, 2018, and state that "the business is able to accommodate [Davis's] permanent restrictions." Id. at 103. Davis was approved for a three-month leave. SUF 21.5
On October 1, 2018, Davis submitted a document to the Reasonable Accommodations department stating "Permanent Sedentary" and reiterating the "sedentary work only" restriction. Arsenault Decl., Ex. G at 121. Davis also emailed Arsenault requesting an interactive meeting [*12]  to discuss possible accommodations. AMF 35. Arsenault did not respond. AMF 36.6 Between October 1 and October 16, 2018, Davis called Arsenault four times to follow up, but she did not respond. He wrote to her again on October 16, 2018, and she again did not respond. AMF 39.
In November and December 2018, Davis did speak with Arsenault several times regarding his leave. He apparently told Arsenault he believed the "sedentary work only" restrictions might be lifted, and that he would learn more when he returned to see a specialist in May 2019. Davis's leave was extended to the end of February 2019. Arsenault Decl. at 118-19; see also id. at 60. On November 27, 2018, Arsenault emailed another CVS employee to ask if she should proceed with discussing Davis's termination with CVS's "legal partner."7 AMF 43. CVS received another update as of March 25, 2019, confirming that Dr. Nick continued to restrict Davis to "sedentary work only." Maloney Decl. at 54. Davis's leave was extended through May 21, 2019, then July 28, 2019, then through September 18, 2019. SUF 26.

D. Termination
On September 19, 2019, Davis was evaluated by Dr. Nick, who again prescribed a "sedentary work only" restriction. [*13]  See SUF 27.8 A different Reasonable Accommodations department employee, Thomas Maloney, spoke with Davis regarding his restrictions on September 24, 2019. SUF 28. Maloney spoke with the then-current District Leader, Vinh Nguyen, regarding Davis on October 4, 2019. Id. Nguyen apparently told Maloney he would be unable to accommodate Davis's restrictions. Id.
Maloney conducted a search for alternative open positions for Davis, and identified three that could accommodate his sedentary work restrictions. SUF 29-30; AMF 71-72 (describing available jobs). He received information about those positions from another CVS employee on October 31, 2019. AMF 41. CVS records show Maloney left voicemails for Davis on December 11, 2019; January 22, 2020; and February 4, 2020. Maloney Decl. at 70. But Davis attests that he never received "a phone call, voice message, e-mail, or letter from Thomas Maloney, or anyone else at CVS, regarding any potential open positions" that could have accommodated his restrictions. Davis Decl. ¶ 9.9 On March 13, 2020, Maloney spoke to Nguyen, and "told him he will need to call the employee since the employee is not calling him [sic] back." Maloney Decl. at 70. On February [*14]  6, 2020, Maloney sent Davis a letter, stating that Maloney had tried to reach Davis "on 2 occasions . . . to inform [Davis] of the decision" that CVS is unable to accommodate Davis's permanent restrictions. Maloney Decl. at 87. CVS records do not indicate that Davis responded. At his deposition, Maloney testified that he was attempting to contact Davis to discuss the available jobs. See Hardy Decl., Ex. H at 7 [Doc. # 37-8].
On March 13, 2020, Nguyen called Davis and informed him that he was being terminated. AMF 47. Nguyen did not tell Davis about any alternative open positions. Davis Decl. ¶ 10. On March 17, 2020, Davis received a letter stating that no reasonable accommodation could be found. AMF 48. During this litigation, Maloney testified that Nguyen had decided both that CVS would be unable to accommodate Davis, and to terminate Davis. AMF 51-52. Nguyen testified, however, that Maloney and the Reasonable Accommodation department had made the decision. AMF 53. Arsenault testified that Maloney had made the decision. AMF 54. Davis has not applied for any other jobs with CVS. Suppl. Jones Decl., Ex. B at 14 [Doc. # 44-2].
Arsenault understood Davis's "sedentary work only" restriction [*15]  to mean that he needed to sit 100 percent of the time. AMF 57. She believed CVS could not support this type of work, and Ibrahim agreed. AMF 57. By contrast, Dr. Nick's testimony indicates that an individual on a "sedentary work only" restriction is permitted to stand and walk as tolerated, including walking the store periodically and performing light lifting. AMF 61-63. Dr. Nick also testified that Davis's "sedentary work only" restriction is not necessarily permanent, although it has not been lifted. AMF 60. Davis has reported to his physicians that his pain has worsened since 2020. See Jones Decl., Ex. E at 32.

IV.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving [*16]  party to "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial."). "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

V.

DISCUSSION
Davis alleges that CVS failed to accommodate his initial restrictions, which required him to limit lifting. He also alleges that CVS misunderstood his later "sedentary work only" restriction, and failed to work with him to find a reasonable accommodation for that restriction.

A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
In order to bring a civil action under FEHA, "a claimant must exhaust his or her administrative remedies." See Dornell v. City of Mateo, 19 F. Supp. 3d 900, 905 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2001)). To properly exhaust administrative remedies, a plaintiff must, before initiating suit, file an administrative complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") within [*17]  one year of the alleged unlawful conduct and receive a right to sue letter from the agency. See id. (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d)).10 Davis did not file any complaint with DFEH until July 31, 2020. CVS thus contends that Davis's claims for conduct that occurred before July 31, 2019—one year before he filed his DFEH complaint—are barred because Davis failed to timely exhaust his administrative remedies as to those claims.
The California Supreme Court has held, however, that FEHA claims premised on actions that occurred more than one year before the filing of the administrative complaint may nonetheless be timely if the "continuing violation doctrine" is applicable—i.e., the "actions that [took] place outside the limitations period . . . are sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct that occurred within the limitations period." See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1056, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). This doctrine is triggered if "the employer's actions were (1) sufficiently similar in kind—recognizing . . . that similar kinds of unlawful employer conduct, such as acts of harassment or failures to reasonably accommodate disability, may take a number of different forms[;] . . . (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence." See [*18]  id. at 1059 (quoting Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Davis argues that CVS engaged in a continuous course of discriminatory conduct that culminated when he was terminated from his employment in 2020.
The California Supreme Court has recognized that "reasonable accommodation is often an ongoing process rather than a single action." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 821. That Court has emphasized the importance of interpreting the continuing violations doctrine, and the FEHA statute of limitations, "in a way that does not short-circuit the reasonable accommodation process." Id. at 822. CVS argues that the nature of the allegedly discriminatory conduct changed in September 2018, when Davis's healthcare providers recommended he perform only sedentary work, after which he was placed on an extended leave. As CVS would have it, any alleged discrimination relating to CVS's failure to accommodate Davis's lifting restrictions "ended" when Davis was placed on leave. But under California law, discriminatory conduct (and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation in particular) "ends" when "an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation [*19]  . . . will be futile." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Davis, it was reasonable—based on his understanding of his doctors' restrictions and the likelihood he would improve, and his continuing efforts to engage with CVS to find an accommodation—for him to believe that further efforts at informal conciliation might be fruitful. The statute of limitations therefore does not bar his pre-September 2018 claims.

B. Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
A plaintiff making a claim for failure to accommodate must prove that: "(1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 255-256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Although failure to provide a reasonable accommodation gives rise to a claim under FEHA, the statute also requires that an employer and employee engage in a "timely, good faith, interactive process" to find a reasonable accommodation. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); see also Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014), as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 23, 2014). Failure to properly engage in that process gives rise to a separate cause of action. Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 971. The elements of a claim for failure to engage in the interactive [*20]  process are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability or medical condition that was known to the employer, (2) the plaintiff requested that his employer make a reasonable accommodation for that disability so that he could perform his job duties, (3) the employer failed to participate in a timely, good faith interactive process with the plaintiff, and (4) the employer's failure to engage in a good faith interactive process was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's harm. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 61, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
CVS argues that Davis's claims fail because he has not identified a reasonable accommodation, and because Davis—not CVS—caused a breakdown in the interactive process designed to find such an accommodation. It is Davis's burden to prove that a reasonable accommodation was available. See Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (burden to prove availability of a reasonable accommodation lies with plaintiff). CVS also cannot be liable for a breakdown in the interactive process if Davis was responsible for the breakdown in that process. Id. at 984-85.
A "reasonable accommodation" under FEHA is a modification that still allows the employee to perform "the essential functions of the job held or desired." Atkins v. City of Los Angeles, 8 Cal. App. 5th 696, 719, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017), as modified on denial of reh'g (Mar. 13, 2017). It is not reasonable [*21]  to require an employer to eliminate an essential function of a job. Id. at 719-20. Reassignment to a vacant position, however, may constitute a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 721 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p)(2)). In fact, the governing regulations require an employer to "ascertain through the interactive process suitable alternate, vacant positions and offer an employee such positions, for which the employee is qualified," if the employee cannot be accommodated in his or her current position. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(d)(1)(A). An employer is not entitled to summary judgment on an employee's failure to accommodate claim unless the employer establishes that (a) "reasonable accommodation was offered and refused," (b) "there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation," or (c) "the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith." Dep't of Fair Empl. & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).
Davis suggests two possible reasonable accommodations existed. First, Davis contends that his "sedentary work only" restriction [*22]  did not necessarily prevent him from performing the essential functions of his Store Team Leader job. Second, Davis contends that he could have performed other jobs at CVS.
It is uncontroverted that from at least October 30, 2017 to December 26, 2017, Davis's healthcare providers imposed a "sit down only" restriction on his work. See Maloney Decl., Ex. B at 39; SUF 10; AMF 14. CVS maintains that it accommodated that restriction. See AMF 17 (Ibrahim reported to the Reasonable Accommodations department that these restrictions were being accommodated in November 2017). But the only evidence in the record to show that the restrictions were actually accommodated was Ibrahim's representation to the Reasonable Accommodations department that they were being accommodated. Ibrahim submitted a declaration in support of CVS's MSJ in which he attests that a Store Team Leader like Davis would be responsible for staffing and task delegation, and that if he had restrictions, he would be the person best positioned to ensure those restrictions were not violated. Ibrahim Decl. ¶ 5 [Doc. # 31-4]. Davis attests that there was no change to his position. Davis Decl. ¶¶ 5-6. CVS points to no evidence of how [*23]  it accommodated that restriction in 2017. Accordingly, a factual dispute exists regarding whether Davis's 2017 restrictions were actually accommodated.
A factual dispute also remains as to whether Davis's permanent "sedentary work only" restriction could have been accommodated. CVS has not explained why, if indeed Davis's "sit down" restrictions were accommodated in 2017 (when CVS did not hire additional store employees), similar restrictions could not have been accommodated on a long-term basis. If those restrictions were not actually accommodated in 2017 (as Davis contends they were not), that suggests a deficiency in the interactive process about whether it would be possible to accommodate those restrictions in 2018 or thereafter. In addition, it is uncontroverted that in 2015, Davis injured his foot, but was able to continue his role as a Store Manager by sitting down most of the time. AMF 55. Although Davis moved to a different store and into a slightly different role between 2015 and 2017, construing the facts in the light most favorable to Davis, the Court cannot say as a matter of law that Davis was unable to perform the essential functions of his Store Team Leader job.11
With regard to CVS's defense that Davis failed to participate in the interactive process, CVS argues primarily that Davis's failure to respond to Maloney's voicemails regarding potential alternative positions at CVS established that Davis was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process. But Davis attests that he never received any voicemail or phone call from Maloney or anyone else at CVS regarding alternative positions. See Davis Decl. ¶ 9. Although CVS argues that Maloney's contemporaneous notes contradict Davis's testimony, whether Davis actually received a phone call or message from Maloney is a credibility issue that cannot be resolved on summary judgment. If Davis did not receive a call from Maloney regarding potential alternative positions at CVS, then CVS failed in its responsibility to identify and offer alternative positions for Davis. Likewise, if Davis did not receive any message from Maloney (and thus Davis did not fail to return Maloney's call), then Davis was not responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process. Moreover, CVS's own evidence is internally inconsistent. Although Maloney's notes indicate that he called Davis three times, [*25]  his letter to Davis states that he tried to call him twice. A jury could find that this undermines the accuracy of Maloney's notes.
CVS employees' confusion as to who should (and did) determine whether Davis could be accommodated also gives rise to an inference that the interactive process broke down on CVS's part. For example, Nguyen and Maloney point fingers at each other as the individual who determined that Davis could not be accommodated. In addition, Ibrahim had previously expressed confusion regarding who was responsible for ensuring that Davis's 2017 restrictions were accommodated. Even the fact that CVS asked Ibrahim whether those restrictions were being accommodated, when Ibrahim attests in support of this motion that it was Davis who was responsible for ensuring they were accommodated, indicates a breakdown in the interactive process. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Davis, a reasonable jury could conclude that CVS was responsible for the breakdown in the process because, after Davis was placed on leave, Davis attempted to communicate with Arsenault regarding reasonable accommodations, but Arsenault failed to respond.12
The Court therefore finds that [*26]  disputed issues of material fact exist as to whether (a) CVS made appropriate efforts to identify a reasonable accommodation for Davis and (b) CVS or Davis was responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process. Accordingly, CVS's MSJ is DENIED as to those claims.

C. Disability Discrimination Claim
Under FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability . . . of any person . . . to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). California courts have adopted the three-part burden-shifting framework enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for FEHA claims. Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). CVS seeks summary judgment on Davis's disability discrimination claim on the bases that (a) Davis cannot make a prima facie case that he was discharged because of his disability and (b) even if he could, he cannot show that CVS's alternative reasons for discharging him were untrue or pretextual.
CVS relies on cases applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to discrimination cases in which the plaintiff alleges racial, gender, and other types of discrimination. But as the California Court of Appeal has recognized, [*27]  disability discrimination cases are different from these other types of employment discrimination cases, in part because "discrimination cases involving race, religion, national origin, age and sex, often involve pretexts for the adverse employment action—an issue about motivation that appears less frequently in disability discrimination cases." Wallace v. Cnty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 122, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016). For this reason, courts "should not automatically apply" the McDonnell Douglas framework in disability discrimination cases, but should instead first examine "whether there is direct evidence that the motive for the employer's conduct was related to the employee's physical or mental condition." Id.13
In this case, it is uncontroverted that Davis was terminated because of his physical condition: he was deemed unable to perform his job. The Court has already concluded that factual disputes remain as to whether that determination was correct. Terminating an employee based on a mistaken belief that he is totally unable to perform his job, even with reasonable accommodations, is direct evidence of disability discrimination. See Glynn, 42 Cal. App. 5th at 54 (reversing grant of summary judgment on disability discrimination claim because "[the plaintiff] provided direct evidence of disability [*28]  discrimination—[his employer] terminated him because [his supervisor] mistakenly believed he was totally disabled and unable to work"). Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Davis, that is just what occurred here. The Court therefore DENIES CVS's MSJ as to this claim.

D. Retaliation Claims
CVS also argues that Davis cannot establish that he was fired in retaliation either for seeking accommodations or for taking leave under the CFRA. To establish a prima facie claim for retaliation under FEHA, a plaintiff must prove that he (1) "engaged in a protected activity," (2) was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a "causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042 (2005). The CFRA is a separate portion of FEHA that makes it unlawful for an employer "to refuse to grant a request by any employee . . . to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a). It additionally makes it unlawful "for an employer to refuse to hire, or to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against, any individual because of . . . [a]n individual's exercise of the right to family care and medical leave." Id. [*29]  at § 12945.2(l). The elements of a CFRA retaliation claim are "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001).
In his Opposition, Davis argues only that, if he avoids summary judgment on his discrimination claim, he should avoid summary judgment on his retaliation claims. Yet, showing that he was terminated because of his disability is an altogether different question than showing he was terminated in retaliation for taking a leave, or because he sought accommodations for his disability. Nonetheless, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Davis, a reasonable jury could find that CVS retaliated against him for taking too much leave or persisting in his requests for what it perceived as unreasonable accommodations. The Court therefore DENIES CVS's MSJ as to these claims.

E. Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Claims
CVS's request for summary judgment on Davis's failure to prevent discrimination and wrongful termination claims is premised on its contention that Davis has failed to create a dispute of fact as to his discrimination claim. Because the Court concludes that Davis has demonstrated the existence of controverted material facts as to the discrimination claim, and because CVS provides no other basis for summary judgment [*30]  on Davis's failure to prevent and wrongful termination claims, the Court DENIES CVS's MSJ as to those claims.

F. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress ("IIED")
To make out a claim for IIED, Davis must show "(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Ess v. Eskaton Properties, Inc., 97 Cal. App. 4th 240, 129 (2002) (quoting Cervantez v. J.C. Penney Co., 24 Cal. 3d 579, 593, 156 Cal. Rptr. 198, 595 P.2d 975 (1979)). "An essential element of such a claim is a pleading of outrageous conduct beyond the bounds of human decency." Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996). "Managing personnel is not outrageous conduct" and is insufficient to establish outrageous conduct "even if improper motivation is alleged." Id.14
CVS first argues that the claim is preempted by California's workers' compensation system. This argument fails because Davis's IIED claim is based in part on unlawful discrimination, and California courts have a "long-standing view that unlawful discrimination and retaliation in violation of FEHA falls outside the compensation bargain and therefore claims of intentional infliction of [*31]  emotion distress based on such discrimination and relation are not subject to workers' compensation exclusivity." Light v. Dep't of Parks & Recreation, 14 Cal. App. 5th 75, 101, 221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 668 (2017). CVS appears to abandon this argument in its Reply.
Nonetheless, Davis's IIED claim fails because CVS's decision to terminate his employment is not extreme or outrageous. Such action is considered a function of managing personnel and is not considered outrageous even when motivated by discrimination. See Janken, 46 Cal. App. 5th at 80. Nor is there any evidence presented that Davis's emotional distress was severe or extreme. See Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1246 (9th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) (anxiety, sleeplessness, upset stomach and occasional muscle twitches do not rise to the level of "severe"); see also Wong v. Tai Jing, 189 Cal. App. 4th 1354, 117 Cal. Rptr. 3d 747 (2010) (lost sleep, upset stomach, and general anxiety do not constitute severe emotional distress). The Court therefore GRANTS CVS's MSJ on the IIED claim.

G. Punitive Damages
Punitive damages are available where "proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). Such actions must have been either perpetrated or ratified by an "officer, director, or managing agent" of the company. Id. at § 3294(b). CVS contends both that none of the actors at CVS who were involved in Davis's case or termination were [*32]  "officer[s], director[s], or managing agent[s]," and that Davis cannot establish "oppression, fraud, or malice."
Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Davis, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that CVS did not act with "oppression, fraud, or malice" in terminating him. A reasonable jury could conclude, based on the contradictory testimony provided by CVS's employees and the direct evidence of discrimination presented here, that those employees acted with malice in failing to accommodate and terminating Davis. In addition, the California Supreme Court has instructed courts to determine whether a supervisory employee is a managing agent based on "the extent to which they exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 564, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999). Davis argues that Ibrahim and Nguyen were "managing agents," based on their supervisory authority over a relatively large number of CVS stores. The Court finds that this is a factual issue for the jury. See White, 21 Cal. 4th at 576-77 ("[P]rincipal liability for punitive damages [does] not depend on employees' managerial level, but on the extent to which they exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions [*33]  that ultimately determine corporate policy.").
Accordingly, the Court DENIES CVS's MSJ as to the availability of punitive damages.

VI.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, CVS's MSJ is GRANTED as to Davis's IIED claim. CVS's MSJ is otherwise DENIED. The December 16, 2022 hearing is VACATED. The discovery deadline is EXTENDED, solely for the purpose of allowing Davis to depose Kim Blodgett and Elizabeth Jesse, if he so chooses.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
