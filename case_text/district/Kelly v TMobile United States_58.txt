Tentative Ruling on Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment

I. Background

A. Factual Background
Nichole Kelly ("Plaintiff") sues T-Mobile USA, Inc. ("Defendant") for (1) disability discrimination in violation of California Government Code § 12940(a); (2) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of California Government Code § 12940(m); (3) failure to provide a timely, good faith interactive process in violation of California Government Code § 12940(h); (4) retaliation in violation [*2]  of California Government Code § 12940(h); (5) wrongful termination in violation of California Government Code § 12940(a); (6) retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (7) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k); and (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"). See generally Complaint, Docket No. 1-1.
The Complaint alleges as follows: Defendant is a nationwide cellular telephone and wireless services provider and retailer with stores and offices throughout California. Id. ¶ 14. Plaintiff was employed by Defendant from November 2004 until July 6, 2016. Id. ¶ 15. While employed by Defendant, Plaintiff alleges that she received good performance evaluations and was promoted on several occasions. Id. ¶¶ 16-19.
On June 2, 2014, Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident and suffered a severe injury to her back, which caused Plaintiff to experience significant back pain. Id. ¶ 19. As a result, Plaintiff took disability/medical leave from June 2014 through September 2014 in order to recover from her injuries. Id. ¶ 20. On September 8, 2014, Plaintiff returned to work at Defendant's office in Irvine, but, pursuant to a note from her doctor, was only permitted to work four hours per [*3]  day. Id. ¶ 21. Thereafter, on October 9, 2014, Plaintiff's doctor signed a new note stating that Plaintiff was only permitted to work from home, not to exceed six hours per day. Id. ¶ 22. On November 6, 2014, Plaintiff's doctor raised the maximum number of hours that Plaintiff could work to 8 hours per day. Id. Plaintiff alleges that other employees of Defendant work remotely or from home during at least a portion of their work week, and that Plaintiff had been permitted to work from home prior to her disability. Id. ¶ 23.
On July 29, 2015, Defendant's Human Resources ("HR") Manager notified Plaintiff via email that Plaintiff was required to submit updated medical documentation in order to continue to work from home. Id. ¶ 24. Plaintiff alleges that she provided HR with the required documentation on August 18, 2015, which stated that she was required to work from home for one additional month. Id. ¶ 25. On August 28, 2015, Plaintiff received an email from HR stating that HR had sent the required paperwork directly to Plaintiff's doctor, which the doctor would need to fill out and return within four business days or Plaintiff's request to continue working from home would be denied.  [*4] Id. Plaintiff's doctor sent the completed paperwork to HR on August 31, 2015, but HR claimed it did not receive the paperwork, which caused Plaintiff to become anxious and fearful that her accommodation would not be approved. Id. ¶ 29. However, the following day, HR informed Plaintiff it had received the paperwork. Id.
On September 7, 2015, Plaintiff received correspondence from her supervisor around 7:52 pm indicating that Plaintiff's request to continue working from home had been denied and that Plaintiff was required to report to the Irvine office the next morning. Id. ¶ 30. Plaintiff reported for work the next morning, and as a result alleges that she suffered additional injury, including extreme back pain. Id. ¶ 31. Plaintiff alleges that due to Defendant's refusal to grant her request to continue working from home, Plaintiff was forced to again go to her doctor, who placed her on disability leave. Id. ¶ 33. Plaintiff was on disability leave from September 8, 2015 to November 22, 2015. Id.
While Plaintiff was on leave, Plaintiff's medical benefits were allegedly terminated by Defendant. Id. ¶ 35. On November 23, 2015, Plaintiff attempted to return from leave and resume working from [*5]  home. Id. However, Defendant informed her that she could not return to work without the approval of John Mavers, an HR vice president. Id. ¶ 36. Plaintiff contacted Mavers, who requested additional information from Plaintiff's doctor by December 1, 2016. Id. ¶ 36. Due to the short time frame to provide the requested paperwork, Plaintiff alleges that she consulted with a new doctor, who provided HR with the completed paperwork. Id. ¶ 38. However, Plaintiff alleges that the doctor accidentally checked "no" on the portion of the form asking whether Plaintiff's condition limited "major life activity." Id. ¶ 38. As a result, Defendant rejected the paperwork and provided Plaintiff an extremely short deadline to obtain a new doctor's note. Id. ¶ 39. On December 4, 2015, Plaintiff provided HR with a new doctor's note, which recommended that Plaintiff be placed on disability leave from November 25, 2015 to January 3, 2016. Id. ¶ 40. On December 24, 2016, Plaintiff provided HR with a revised letter stating that Plaintiff needed to remain on leave until January 20, 2016. Id. On January 12, 2016, Plaintiff alleges that she received a letter form Defendant informing her that Defendant could accommodate [*6]  her by providing a standing desk for her work station at the Irvine office. Id. ¶ 41. However, Plaintiff alleges that this accommodation did not comply with her medical documentation, which stated that she could only sit or stand for a maximum of 60 minutes. Id. ¶ 41.
On February 9, 2016, Defendant allegedly threatened to terminate Plaintiff's employment on the grounds that she had failed to engage in the interactive process because her doctor had failed to produce additional documentation within Defendant's deadlines. Id. ¶ 42. Throughout February and March 2016, Defendant continued to send emails threatening to terminate Plaintiff's employment if she failed to complete additional documentation. Id. ¶ 43. On March 3, 2016, her doctor informed Plaintiff that she could return to work as long as she was provided with a standing desk, with a maximum standing time of three hours per day and a maximum sitting time of three hours per day. Id. ¶ 44. However, when Plaintiff returned to work on March 7, 2016, she alleges that her workstation did not have a standing desk, which Defendant had represented that it would provide. Id. ¶ 45. As a result, she alleges that she suffered extreme back pain [*7]  and was hospitalized on March 14, 2016. Id. ¶¶ 45-46. Plaintiff alleges that thereafter, Defendant repeatedly refused to allow her to work from home despite additional paperwork provided by her doctors. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. Plaintiff alleges that an MRI taken on May 5, 2016 indicated that her disability had worsened. Id. ¶ 54. Plaintiff thereafter requested continuous leave on May 9, 2016, which Defendant approved. Id. ¶ 54.
On June 27, 2016, Plaintiff received a call from Defendant informing her that she was being terminated. Id. ¶ 58. Defendant allegedly informed Plaintiff that it had provided reasonable accommodations to her, which had not helped Plaintiff, and that "nothing would help her." Id. ¶ 58.
Plaintiff seeks: (1) actual damages, including loss of past and future earnings; (2) general and special damages, including but not limited to pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of reputation; (3) consequential and incidental damages and expenses; (4) attorneys' fees and costs; (5) penalties provided by law; (6) damages for financial losses, medical bills, and emotional distress damages; (7) injunctive relief; (8) pre-and post-judgement interest; and (9) such other relief as the [*8]  Court deems just and proper. Id.at 26-27.

B. Procedural Background
Now pending before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. See Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("Motion"), Docket No. 40-1. In support of the Motion, Defendant filed what it believes to be a statement of uncontroverted facts, with Plaintiff responding and Defendant getting a chance to further respond. See Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Amended Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact ("DUSF"), Docket No. 115-2. Plaintiff's original counsel (Plaintiff now proceeds pro se) filed an opposition to the Motion, Docket No. 43, but the Court will disregard that opposition1 and will instead consider Plaintiff's newly filed opposition ("Opp'n") to the Motion, Docket No. 114. In support of the Opposition, Plaintiff filed what she believes to be uncontroverted facts, with Defendant responding to those facts. See Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Amended Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("PUSF"), Docket No. 115-3. Defendant filed a reply in support of the Motion and [*9]  in response to the Opposition.2 See Defendant T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s Supplemental Reply to Plaintiff Nichole Kelly's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Reply"), Docket No. 115.

II. Legal Standard
Summary judgment shall be granted when a movant "shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Miranda v. City of Cornelius, 429 F.3d 858, 860 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005). As to materiality, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute as to a material fact is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id.
To satisfy its burden at summary judgment, a moving party without the burden of persuasion "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, 212 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 2000).
If the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials [*10]  on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party may not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment[, but instead] must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence, and views all evidence and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See id. at 630-31 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)); see also Hrdlicka v. Reniff, 631 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir. 2011); Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072, 1075 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc).
The initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate an absence of a genuine issue of material fact or to demonstrate that the nonmoving party will be unable to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case for which it has the burden of proof. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Only if the moving party meets its burden must the non-moving party produce evidence to rebut the moving party's claim and create a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 322-23. If the non-moving party meets this burden, then the motion will be denied. Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 210 F.3d at 1103.

See Declaration of Nichole Kelly ("Kelly Decl.") Ex. 17, Docket No. 114-5 at CM/ECF pg. 192.
During at least part of Plaintiff's employment, she reported to Julian Martinez ("Martinez"), the system design & strategy manager. See DUSF ¶ 2. Defendant had multiple policies in place to combat discrimination and harassment during Plaintiff' employment, though it is disputed whether Defendant followed those policies in this instance. See id. ¶¶ 53-55.

A. Plaintiff's Leave of Absence for Anxiety and Depression
On March 29, 2014, Plaintiff's psychiatrist Dr. Hanaa Solimon ("Dr. Solimon") evaluated and diagnosed Plaintiff with depression and considered her temporarily totally disabled. See PUSF ¶ 10. Plaintiff required a leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") due to her depression and anxiety because she was unable to fulfill her work responsibilities [*14]  due to a serious medical condition. See DUSF ¶ 4. Defendant approved Plaintiff's leave of absence from March 24, 2014 until June 14, 2014. See id. ¶ 5.

B. Plaintiff Has a Car Accident, Resulting in Back Pain and a Roughly Three-Month Leave of Absence
On May 19, 2014, Dr. Solimon provided documentation to Defendant stating that Plaintiff was released to return to work on June 15, 2014 with no restrictions. See DUSF ¶ 6. But, on June 2, 2014 Plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident that caused her significant back pain. See DUSF ¶ 7; see also PUSF ¶ 13. As a result of that back pain, Plaintiff requested an extension of her existing leave of absence and she did not return to work on June 15, 2014. See DUSF ¶ 7; see also PUSF ¶ 13. Thereafter, Plaintiff followed up with her primary care provider, Dr. Anaida Melkumian ("Dr. Melkumian"), who assessed Plaintiff as totally disabled and determined that she severely decreased her lumbar range of motion and her ability to sit/stand/bend. See PUSF ¶ 14. Dr. Melkumian referred Plaintiff to orthopedic surgeon Dr. Philip Yuan ("Dr. Yuan"), who began evaluating Plaintiff's injuries and requested additional diagnostic examinations. See id. [*15]  ¶ 17. Defendant approved an extension of Plaintiff's leave of absence through September 7, 2014 based at least in part on medical documentation that Dr. Yuan sent to Defendant. See id. ¶¶ 18-19. Dr. Yuan released Plaintiff to return to work on September 8, 2014, with a restriction of four hours of work per day because he was concerned with Plaintiff's ability to sit, stating that he would reassess in 4-6 weeks. See id. ¶ 19.

C. After Plaintiff Returned from Her Leave of Absence, Defendant Allowed for Certain Accommodations and Ultimately Granted Another Leave of Absence
When Plaintiff returned to work on September 8, 2014, Defendant accommodated Dr. Yuan's request to limit Plaintiff's work to four hours per day. See DUSF ¶ 11. Upon returning to work on that day, Plaintiff discovered that the drive into the office and the prolonged sitting at the office workstation aggravated her back injury causing unbearable pain. See PUSF ¶ 20. Plaintiff could work from home periodically under certain conditions. See id. Starting on October 9, 2014, Defendant accommodated Dr. Yuan's request to allow Plaintiff to work from home and to limit her work to six hours per day, and on November 6, 2014, Dr. Yuan released Plaintiff to full-time duty with no restrictions other than the continued work from home accommodation. See DUSF ¶¶ 12, 14. From October 9, 2014 to September 7, 2015,4 Defendant approved Plaintiff's accommodation requests [*16]  to work from home. See id. ¶ 13.
On September 7, 2015 or September 8, 2015, Defendant rejected a continuation of Plaintiff working from home but offered Plaintiff a sit/stand desk. See DUSF ¶¶ 21-22. Plaintiff returned to work on September 8, 2015 at the Irvine office, but she did not complete the whole work day. See id. Defendant approved another leave of absence for Plaintiff through November 22, 2015. See id. ¶ 26. On November 19, 2015, Defendant received medical documentation from Dr. Yuan requesting that Plaintiff be allowed to work from home for six weeks due to prolonged sitting at work and also issues related to driving there. See id. ¶ 27. On November 23, 2015, Plaintiff returned to work with a work from home accommodation. See id. ¶ 28.
On or around November 25, 2015, based on Dr. Yuan's referral Plaintiff started also seeing Dr. Madhu Katakia ("Dr. Katakia"), a neurologist. See id. ¶ 29. Dr. Katakia submitted documentation requesting a leave of absence for Plaintiff due to continuing back pain. See id. ¶ 29. Defendant then approved Plaintiff's leave of absence through March 7, 2016. See id. ¶ 30. On January 6, 2016, the Leave and Accommodation Team sent Plaintiff [*17]  a letter indicating that Defendant would provide Plaintiff a sit/stand desk and a flex start time to avoid typical commute time and traffic volumes. See id. ¶ 34.

D. Business Model Restructuring and Further Accommodations
On or around January 2016, Defendant underwent a reorganization and restructured its business model. See id. ¶ 31. The reorganization significantly changed the structure of the Transport Engineering Team, as they were no longer supporting specific regions. See id. ¶ 31. Shortly after the reorganization, Defendant contracted with another senior engineer to complete Plaintiff's workload. See id. ¶ 33. That contractor was already working for Defendant. See PUSF ¶ 30. In January 2016, around the time of the reorganization and restructuring, the Leave and Accommodation Team told Plaintiff that it wanted to schedule an independent medical exam as part of the interactive process, but Plaintiff ultimately rejected this request. See DUSF ¶ 35. Dr. Katakia submitted answers to a Defendant questionnaire stating that Plaintiff could return to the workplace on March 7, 2016; that she could sit for three hours at one time; that she could stand for three hours at one time before needing [*18]  to sit; and that Plaintiff would need to take ten minute breaks every three hours. See id. ¶ 36; see Declaration of Jenny Lamb ("Lamb Decl.") Ex. KK, Docket No. 40-3 at CM/ECF pg. 161. In March 2016, Defendant provided Plaintiff with a sit/stand desk (which needed some additional installation work upon Plaintiff's return to work on March 7, 2016 and/or was not there at all upon her return to work) and she was allowed to take two breaks every two hours and lay down in the break room or her car should the need arise. See id. ¶¶ 38-39. In the time that the sit/stand desk was actually installed and properly working, Plaintiff stated that the sit-stand desk made it easier to work. See id. ¶ 40.
On March 21, 2016 Dr. Yuan sent a letter stating that he saw Plaintiff on that day and that she should be allowed to work from home (the letter says "work from work" but that is presumably a typographical error). See Lamb Dec. Ex. LL, Docket No. 40-3 at CM/ECF pg. 165. Dr. Yuan made a similar request on March 23, 2016, asking that Defendant allow Plaintiff to work from home while an accommodation request to work from home was evaluated. See id. at CM/ECF pg. 166. Plaintiff tried a flexible schedule [*19]  that would allow for attendance of physical therapy appointments. See DUSF ¶ 44; see Declaration of Robert Conti ("Conti Decl.") Ex. A (Plaintiff deposition transcript), Docket No. 40-2 at CM/ECF pg. 150. On days when Plaintiff had physical therapy appointments, she at times missed the rest of the work day due to pain from that those appointments. See DUSF ¶ 45. Martinez requested certain advanced notice from Plaintiff regarding her appointments. See id. ¶ 46.
On May 2, 2016 pursuant to Plaintiff's request for a reduced schedule, Dr. Katakia submitted documentation indicating to Defendant that Plaintiff was restricted to work for four hours per day for 45 days and that Plaintiff could not stand or walk for more than 60 minutes without taking a break. See id. ¶ 48. On May 23, 2016, Dr. Katakia submitted documentation requesting a leave of absence for Plaintiff until July 4, 2016. See id. ¶¶ 49-50. Defendant approved Plaintiff's leave of absence through July 4, 2016 with an expected return to work date on July 5, 2016. See id. ¶ 51. Dr. Katakia provided medical documentation to Defendant on June 28, 2016 to support Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence from July 4, 2016 to August [*20]  8, 2016. See PUSF ¶ 96. On July 5, 2016, Plaintiff did not return to work, and Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment on July 6, 2016. See DUSF ¶¶ 50, 52.

IV. Analysis

A. First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
In the first cause of action, Plaintiff brings a disability discrimination claim under California Government Code § 12940(a). See Complaint ¶¶ 61-77. Defendant moves for summary judgment regarding that claim. See Motion at 11-14.

1. Prima Facie Case
In moving for summary judgment, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job. See Motion at 12. Defendant asserts that it is undisputed that Plaintiff working from home prevented her from performing the essential duties of her job. See Reply at 3. Plaintiff rebuts, arguing that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodations, i.e. vis-à-vis working from home. See Opp'n at 4. She argues that her job functions did not require her to physically be at work because most of her tasks were sedentary and that working from home allowed her to avoid back pain and complete required work. See id. at 4-5. Plaintiff also points to her recognition award for performance, receipt of 100% of her [*21]  bonus, and other indicators of high performance during periods where she worked at least partially from home and/or had leaves of absence. See id. at 5.
Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), employers may not discharge an employee "because of" that employee's physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Courts must construe FEHA liberally, Cal. Gov't Code § 12993(a), to "protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgement," Cal. Gov't Code § 12920. See Robinson v. Fair Employment & Hous. Com., 2 Cal. 4th 226, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 782, 825 P.2d 767, 770 (1992) (addressing the broad construction of FEHA). For a plaintiff to establish a prima facie disability discrimination claim under FEHA, he or she must show that: (1) he or she suffered from a disability, (2) he or she could perform the essential duties of his or her job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) he or she was subjected to adverse employment action because of his or her disability. McInteer v. Ashley Distrib. Servs., Ltd., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115669, 2014 WL 4105262, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2014) (citing Sandell v. Taylor-Lustig, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310 (2010)). "Numerous courts note that '[t]he prima facie burden is light; the evidence necessary to sustain the burden is minimal.'" Id. at *9 (quoting Sandell, 188 Cal. App. 4th at 310). At the summary judgment stage, a plaintiff's initial burden does not "rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994), as amended on denial of reh'g [*22]  (July 14, 1994). To show a prima facie case, a plaintiff is required to produce "very little" evidence." Id. Furthermore, to show that a plaintiff was subjected to an adverse action because of his disability, that plaintiff may offer evidence suggesting that he was fired for conduct caused by his or her disability. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Walgreen Co., 34 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1058-59 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (citing Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001)).
Considering the evidence provided in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court would conclude that there is a dispute of material facts as to whether Plaintiff could perform the essential duties of her job with or without reasonable accommodation.5 Pursuant to California regulations, a "[r]easonable accommodation may include . . . [p]ermitting an employee to work from home." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11065(p), (p)(L). The Ninth Circuit has held the fact that "regular attendance is not necessary for all jobs is hardly remarkable when on-site presence is not required for all jobs, a point not lost on our sister circuits." Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1239 (9th Cir. 2012). For at least part of the time that Plaintiff had work from home accommodations and other accommodations, Plaintiff received a recognition award for her work performance from Clinton Kuper, the area manager of the markets in which Plaintiff worked. See PUSF ¶ 29. Kuper noted that [*23]  Plaintiff "works hard to ensure [Defendant's] transport orders are completed in a timely manner, challenges the service providers to move expansion efforts forward and helps us troubleshoot IP issues. Plaintiff does all these activities . . . [and] finds solutions for immediate needs. . . . [Plaintiff] practice[es] [Defendant's] values of 'Doing it the right way' and 'Results matter, Count on me to deliver.'" See Kelly Decl. Ex. 59, Docket No. 114-7 at CM/ECF pg. 23. Plaintiff also submits evidence that she received 100% of her individual bonus in 2014 and 2015 despite having work from home accommodations and leaves of absence at various points, and she received positive work performance ratings during much of her time at the company. See Kelly Decl. ¶¶ 14, Docket No. 114-2, 16; Kelly Decl. Exs. 14-16, Docket No. 114-5 at CM/ECF pgs. 20-190. On the other hand, Defendant has submitted no evidence of negative performance evaluations or anything concrete memorializing poor performance. Those facts indicate that Plaintiff could perform essential job functions with the work from home accommodation and that she in fact did so when given the chance. Rezvan v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp., No. 15-CV-04767-HSG, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173734, 2016 WL 8193160, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2016) (finding a genuine dispute as to whether [*24]  the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job with accommodations, "as evidenced by her receipt of a positive performance review for 2013 and subsequent raise and bonus.").
Defendant does not deserve summary judgment simply because Martinez may have received several complaints from Plaintiff's team members about issues related to Plaintiff working from home,6 because Defendant supposedly used a contractor to complete some of Plaintiff's work, and because the company decided to restructure and reorganize. See DUSF ¶¶ 15, 31, 33. Those facts are not enough for Defendant to prevail at this juncture. In fact, there is evidence that others working under Martinez were still allowed to work from home at least periodically when not feeling well or for personal reasons even after the restructuring in 2016, with Martinez testifying to that in his deposition and, as mentioned above, Plaintiff received a recognition award for her work as well as 100 percent of her individual bonus in 2014 and 2015. See Kelly Decl. Ex. 1 (Martinez deposition transcript), Docket No. 114-4 at CM/ECF pg. at 46:11-19; PUSF ¶ 29; Kelly Decl. ¶¶ 14, 16; Kelly Decl. Exs. 14-16, Docket No. 114-5 at CM/ECF pgs. 20-190. The presence of others working from home during [*27]  the relevant period cuts against granting summary judgment on this prong. See Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that "physical attendance at [the defendant's] offices is not an essential job duty; in fact, the record makes it clear that MHA permits some of its medical transcriptionists to work at home."). Ultimately, the reasonableness of an accommodation is usually an issue for the jury, and Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether she could perform the essential duties of her job with a work from home accommodation. Prilliman, 53 Cal. App. 4th at 954.7

2. False or Pretextual Nondiscriminatory Reason
As its purported reason for terminating Plaintiff, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's final leave of absence request was indefinite and that "[n]othing in the law requires T-Mobile to wait in hopes that someday Plaintiff would be able to return to work." See Motion at 13 (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-227, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)). Defendant argues that the company's restructuring prevented Plaintiff from working at home rather than discriminatory animus. See Motion at 13-14. In response, Plaintiff argues that Dr. Katakia told Defendant that Plaintiff was to be on a leave of absence for six weeks until August 8, 2016, rather than for an indefinite amount of time.  [*28] See Opp'n at 6-7. Plaintiff argues that Defendant demonstrated discriminatory animus in that other employees on Plaintiff's team could work from home whereas she could not. See id. at 9.
If a plaintiff successfully demonstrates a prima facie discrimination claim, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the plaintiff's termination. Deschene v. Pinole Point Steel Co., 76 Cal. App. 4th 33, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 15, 23 (1999), as modified, (Nov. 29, 1999). That demonstrated reason must "disclaim any reliance on the employee's disability," Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001), including conduct caused by the employee's disability, Walgreen, 34 F. Supp. 3d at 1059. "At the third step of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis, plaintiff must offer evidence suggesting that defendant's nondiscriminatory reason for the termination is either false or pretextual." Navarro v. DHL Glob. Forwarding, No. 2:15-CV-05510-CAS-(Ex), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32663, 2017 WL 901880, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2017). A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext either: (1) directly, as "by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer," or (2) indirectly, as "by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 68, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000). To create a triable issue of fact, circumstantial evidence must be "specific" and "substantial." Id. at 69.
Assuming termination for Plaintiff's failure to provide a definite return date [*29]  is a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for termination, Plaintiff has raised specific and substantial evidence of that reason's falsity. It is a triable issue of fact whether Plaintiff failed to provide a return to work date. Indeed, it is undisputed that Dr. Katakia, Plaintiff's neurologist, provided medical documentation to Defendant on June 28, 2016 to support Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence from July 4, 2016 to August 8, 2016. See PUSF ¶ 96. On the form Dr. Katakia provided, the doctor specifically wrote "6 weeks" and "8/8/16" in response to the question "[i]f a leave of absence is a possible accommodation for this employee, please provide an estimated duration for the leave." See Lamb Decl. Ex. QQ, Docket No. 40-3 at CM/ECF pg. 180. Therefore, the fact that Dr. Katakia testified later at deposition that there was not necessarily a definitive date for Plaintiff's return does not change the fact that what Dr. Katakia provided to Defendant during the relevant period did describe what appears to be at the very least a definitive date to reassess returning if not an actual date to return to work. See id.; see also Conti Decl. Ex. G (Dr. Katakia deposition transcript), [*30]  Docket No. 40-2 at 287-88. With Defendant using Plaintiff's failure to come to work on July 5, 2016 and Plaintiff's purportedly "indefinite" leave of absence request as its nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination addressed in the Motion, the Court would find substantial evidence of that reason's falsity. A reasonable jury could conclude that Dr. Katakia's request indicated a return to work date or that providing a date to reevaluate a return to work refutes any assertion that the request was indefinite in nature. Therefore, summary judgment is not warranted on this claim.

B. Second Cause of Action: Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations
In the second cause of action, Plaintiff alleges a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under violation of under California Government Code § 12940(m). See Complaint ¶¶ 78-87. Defendant moves for summary judgment on this claim, putting forward a short one-page argument. See Motion at 14-15. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show she was qualified to do her job or that Defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodations. See id. at 15. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff refused to participate in the interactive process in good faith because she purportedly [*31]  refused to be examined by an independent medical professional. See id. In addition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's requested accommodations created an undue burden on Defendant's operations. See id. Responding to those arguments, Plaintiff asserts that she rejected the independent medical examination because the only doctor Defendant offered lived 45 minutes to an hour driving distance away, which would cause her significant back pain. See Opp'n at 13-15. Plaintiff also takes issue with the fact she would have to see an independent doctor as part of the interactive process. See id. Plaintiff argues that working from home would not have created an undue burden or require a contract worker to take on her workload because she could perform the necessary tasks when working from home. See id. at 15.
The requirements to prevail on a reasonable accommodation claim are similar to those under a disability discrimination claim, but "there are important differences." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). For a plaintiff to establish a reasonable accommodation claim, the plaintiff employee must show that: (1) the employee bears a disability under FEHA, (2) the employee is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, [*32]  and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability. Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "FEHA does not obligate an employer to choose the best accommodation or the specific accommodation a disabled employee or applicant seeks," only a "reasonable" one. Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006). Courts construe a reasonable accommodation as "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Examples of such reasonable accommodations include job restructuring, modified work schedules, and reassignment to a vacant position. "Although the question of reasonable accommodation is ordinarily a question of fact, when the undisputed evidence leads to only one conclusion as to the reasonableness of the accommodation sought, summary judgment is proper." Raine, 135 Cal. App. 4th at 1227 n.11.
For similar reasons to the disability discrimination claim above, the Court would deny summary judgment as to this claim. There is evidence, as addressed above, creating a triable issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job and that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability vis-à-vis a work from home accommodation at certain points in [*33]  Plaintiff's employment.8 The Court would agree with Plaintiff that it is not dispositive that she failed to submit to an independent examination with a doctor 45 minutes to an hour away, given that her back pain was exacerbated from long drives, and there is insufficient evidence that such an accommodation would have placed an undue hardship on Defendant. Defendant cites to no case law that would support summary judgment based on the given facts.

C. Third Cause of Action: Failure to Provide a Timely Good Faith Interactive Process
In the third cause of action, Plaintiff alleges a failure to provide a timely and good faith interactive process under California Government Code § 12940(n). See Complaint ¶¶ 88-97. Defendant moves for summary judgment regarding this cause of action in a one-half page argument. See Motion at 15-16. Defendant briefly argues that Plaintiff cannot show a failure to engage in the interactive process "when time after time, T-Mobile accommodated her." See id. at 16. Even if Plaintiff could establish that Defendant failed to engage in a reasonable interactive process, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because there was no reasonable accommodation available. See Reply at 9. [*34]  In response, Plaintiff argues that Defendant at multiple points "inexplicably denied" requests to work from home and required her to go to the office, and she also argues that terminating her without discussing other options gives rise to a claim. See Opp'n at 18-19.
Under FEHA, an employer must not "fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). "The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively. For the process to work both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal.App.4th at 984-85 (internal quotation and alterations omitted). "[T]he fact that an employer took some steps to work with an employee to identify reasonable accommodations does not absolve the employer of liability under [*35]  section 12940(n). If the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process, it may be held liable." Id.
From the Court's evaluation of the evidence presented it "cannot as a matter of law, at this stage, isolate the breakdown of the interactive process or determine which party was to blame, so summary judgment is not warranted." Rezvan, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173734, 2016 WL 8193160, at *5 (citing Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 985). Dr. Katakia, Plaintiff's neurologist, provided medical documentation to Defendant on June 28, 2016 to support Plaintiff's request for a leave of absence from July 4, 2016 to August 8, 2016, but Defendant appears to have terminated Plaintiff without further discussing whether this request constituted an indefinite leave of absence or whether a further need to work at home was unreasonable, and whether a different accommodation could be made. See PUSF ¶ 96; see also Nadaf-Rahrov, (noting that there was a material dispute as to whether "Defendant denied [the accommodation] request without offering an alternative accommodation.").

D. Fourth Cause of Action: Retaliation
In the fourth cause of action, Plaintiff alleges retaliation in violation of Government Code §12940(h). See Complaint ¶¶ 98-107. Defendant submits a one-third page argument in support of summary judgment on this claim. [*36]  See Motion at 16. To demonstrate a FEHA retaliation claim, "a plaintiff must show (1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000). "'Protected activity' includes asserting one[']s civil rights by complaining of harassing conduct." Ludovico v. Kaiser Permanente, 57 F.Supp.3d 1176, 1197 (N.D. Cal. 2014). With Defendant arguing that Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails specifically because Plaintiff's first cause of action fails, the Court would deny summary judgment for the already stated above reasons. See Motion at 16.

E. Fifth Cause of Action: Wrongful Termination
In the fifth cause of action, Plaintiff brings a wrongful termination claim pursuant to California Government Code § 12940(a). See Complaint ¶¶ 108-22. Nowhere in the MSJ does Defendant discuss the fifth cause of action. See generally Motion. Though Defendant discusses the fifth claim for relief in the Reply, that is not the proper time to raise new arguments not discussed in the earlier motion. Therefore, that claim would go forward on that basis.

F. Sixth Cause of Action: Retaliation and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
In the sixth cause of action, Plaintiff alleges retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. See Complaint [*37]  ¶¶ 123-31. Defendant moves for summary judgment regarding this claim with a three-sentence argument, arguing that Plaintiff's sixth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is "entirely derivative and based solely upon her underlying claims for discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and retaliation." See Motion at 16-17. According to Defendant, because those other "claims are without merit, Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy also fails." See id. at 17. Under California law, "[t]he elements of a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an employer-employee relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff's employment, (3) the termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy, and (4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm." Nosal-Tabor v. Sharp Chula Vista Med. Ctr., 239 Cal. App. 4th 1224, 1234-35, 191 Cal. Rptr. 3d 651 (2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). With Defendant explicitly arguing that summary judgment is warranted because Plaintiff should lose on her other claims, the Court would deny summary judgment because the Court has denied summary judgment regarding those other claims.

G. Seventh Cause [*38]  of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation
In the seventh cause of action, Plaintiff alleges failure to prevent discrimination and harassment under California Government Code § 12940(k) ("Section 12940(k)"). See Complaint ¶¶ 132-39. Defendant moves for summary judgment on this claim, briefly arguing that FEHA does not provide a private right of action for failure to prevent discrimination, and that even if such a private right of action existed, this claim fails because the underlying discrimination claim fails. See Motion at 17. Pursuant to FEHA, it is unlawful "for an employer . . . to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring" in the workplace. Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(k). "When a plaintiff seeks to recover damages based on a claim of failure to prevent discrimination or harassment he must show three essential elements: 1) plaintiff was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; 2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and 3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Lelaind v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008).
The Court would disagree with Defendant's contention that no private right of action exists for a claim [*39]  alleging failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation. It is true that there is no private right of action when there is no viable underlying discrimination or harassment claim, but that is not the case here. See Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("[T]he statutory language [does not] support[ ] recovery on such a private right of action where there has been a specific factual finding that no such discrimination or harassment actually occurred.") (emphasis added); see also Miller v. Kowa Am. Corp., No. 2:15-CV-05671-CAS-(Ex), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112467, 2016 WL 4467880, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2016) (finding that where a plaintiff's underlying harassment claim survived summary judgment, the court was not persuaded that the plaintiff had no failure to prevent claim under Section 12940(k)). Because Defendant's only other basis for moving on this claim is that the underlying discrimination claim fails, the Court would deny summary judgment as to this cause of action for reasons described above.

H. Eighth Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
In the eighth cause of action, Plaintiff alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Complaint ¶¶ 140-46. Defendant moves for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that it is preempted by California Workers' Compensation Act ("WCA") and arguing that even if it were [*40]  not preempted, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the elements of such a claim. See Motion at 17-18. In response, Plaintiff asserts that it is not preempted in this instance and argues that there are disputed facts as to the elements of this claim. See id.
As to preemption, under California Supreme Court precedent, "where the alleged unlawful conduct occurs at the worksite in the normal course of an employer-employee relationship, worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for any injury that results." See McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1295 (citing Miklosy v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 44 Cal.4th 876, 902-03, 80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 690, 188 P.3d 629 (2008)). Though the WCA does not preempt a wrongful termination claim, "an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim premised on termination is preempted." See id. (citing Smith v. Lowe's Hiw, Inc., No. 2:13-CV-01713-WBS-(ACx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52671, 2014 WL 1419655, at *5-6 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2014)). Here, the IIED claim is premised on conduct beyond just Plaintiff's termination, but Plaintiff has not provided evidence of discriminatory conduct that is beyond the "employment relationship" or the "management of the employment relationship." Walleri v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of Seattle, 83 F.3d 1575, 1582 (9th Cir. 1996). Therefore, the Court would hold this claim is preempted because it involves conduct in the course of an employer-employee relationship.
Even if the Court did not find the IIED claim preempted, it would grant summary judgment regarding this claim because Plaintiff [*41]  fails to cite to any evidence in the half-page in which she argues a prima facie case for IIED. See Opp'n at 25 (citing evidence for why the claim is not preempted, but then failing to cite evidence when discussing the elements of the IIED claim). When Plaintiff previously filed a deficient opposition that lacked citations to evidence and/or undisputed facts, the Court specifically ordered Plaintiff to re-file an opposition with "citations to the specific numbered statement of undisputed fact . . . whenever making a factual assertion of any kind." See Nov. 13, 2018 Civil Minutes, Docket No. 108. Under California law, "[a] cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when there is (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). Without any evidence cited in Plaintiff's argument to deflect summary judgment and with the Court already allowing Plaintiff an additional opportunity to [*42]  do so in filing the most recent Opposition, the Court would find that summary judgment is warranted on this claim.

I. Punitive Damages
In the Complaint, Plaintiff requests punitive damages for various claims. See Complaint ¶¶ 85, 95, 106, 130, 138, 146. Defendant moves for summary judgment, asserting that Plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages because her underlying claims fail and because she cannot proffer clear and convincing evidence of malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent behavior. See Motion at 20. In response, Plaintiff mainly argues that because punitive damages is not a cause of action but instead a remedy Defendant cannot move for summary judgment on it. See Opp'n at 25-26. As the only substantive argument in favor of punitive damages, Plaintiff argues that "issues of material fact existed as to whether punitive damages were appropriate in employee's retaliatory discharge action against employer, precluding summary judgment." See id. at 26 (citing Sanjuan v. IBP, Inc., 919 F. Supp. 378 (D. Kan. 1996) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56).
The Court sees no reason why Defendant cannot move for summary judgment regarding punitive damages, so the Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that Defendant cannot procedurally do so. Plaza v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns Mgmt., LLC, No. 14-CV-5430 YGR, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162519, 2015 WL 7770215, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2015) (granting summary judgment regarding [*43]  punitive damages in FEHA case); Zapata v. Neil Jones Food Co., No. 1:14-CV-02027-EPG, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124316, 2016 WL 4764674, at *12 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2016) (same). As to Plaintiff's alternative argument that issues of material fact exist as to whether punitive damages are appropriate for the retaliation claim, the Court would conclude that Plaintiff cites to zero evidence demonstrating that punitive damages are warranted. See Opp'n at 25-26 (failing to cite to any evidence or undisputed facts in the punitive damages section). Though Plaintiff may seek punitive damages for FEHA violations, without any clear and convincing evidence cited demonstrating that the employer "has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice," the Court would grant Defendant's motion regarding punitive damages. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294; Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 214-15, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982). The Court makes this decision in light of the specific warning issued in the November 13, 2018 minute order to include such citations in any re-filed opposition. See Nov. 13, 2018 Civil Minutes, Docket No. 108.

V. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court would DENY the Motion regarding the challenged causes of action except for the IIED claim. The Court would GRANT the Motion as to punitive damages and the IIED claim.
