REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
LINDSAY, Magistrate Judge:
The plaintiff, Anjanette S. Peten ("Peten"), commenced this action on February 10, 2015, against her former employer, Stericycle, Inc., ("Stericycle"), alleging that Stericycle subjected her to racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to 2000e-17 ("Title VII") and disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disability Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12112-12117, as amended.1 Before the Court, on referral from District Judge Bianco, is the defendant's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. For the reasons that follow, the undersigned recommends that the defendant's motion be granted.

BACKGROUND

A. Local Rule 56.1
As an initial matter, it is important to note that Peten has not followed the directives of Rule 56.1 of the Local Civil Rules of the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York ("Local Rule 56.1"). Local Rule 56.1(a) requires a party moving for summary judgment [*2]  to submit a statement of the facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried, together with citation to the admissible evidence in the record supporting each such fact. See Local Rule 56.1(a), (d). The Local Rules also require a party opposing such a motion to submit a statement responding to each numbered paragraph in the movant's statement of facts, and if necessary, submitting additional paragraphs containing a separate, short and concise statement of additional material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried (the "Counterstatement").2 See Local Rule 56.1(b). The opposing party's Counterstatement must also be followed by citation to evidence that would be admissible. See Local Rule 56.1(d).
Where a party opposing a motion for summary judgment fails to submit a proper Counterstatement, the facts set forth in a moving party's Rule 56.1 statement are generally deemed to be admitted, see Local Rule 56.1(c), and in this case, the Court has applied that rule. However, mindful of the fact that "[a] district court has broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a party's failure to comply with local court rules" see Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001), the undersigned has also undertaken a comprehensive, independent review of [*3]  the record. As such, in instances where the Court has found no support for Peten's factual assertions, those averments have been disregarded. Nonetheless, the facts that follow are construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, except as otherwise noted. See Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 50 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005).
Stericycle is a company that provides call center services to doctors' offices and other commercial clients. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. at ¶ 1. On September 3, 2013, Peten was hired as a part-time customer service representative. Id. ¶ 2. Her duties consisted of processing customer service calls, including taking calls and dispatching messages. Id. ¶ 3. Peten was hired to work an eight hour shift on Saturdays and shifts of up to six hours during the weekdays. Id. ¶ 4. Peten was well aware of the shift requirements before she accepted the job and never informed Stericycle that she had any limitations with respect to the days of the week or hours she could work. Id. ¶¶ 5, 6. Nevertheless, after working for approximately one month, Peten sought a reduction in her Saturday work schedule from her supervisor, Jane Diana ("Diana"), claiming that she suffered .from mood instability. Id. ¶¶ 10, 13. According to Peten, the eight [*4]  hour shift made her exhausted and caused her to suffer stress and anxiety. Id.
Diana conveyed Peten's request to Moises Lopez ("Lopez"), who then relayed the information to Stericycle's Human Resources Manager, Dawn Johnson ('Johnson"), and Leave of Absence Program Manager, Vicki Kratohwil ("Kratohwil"). Id. ¶ 11. On October 11, 2013, Peten then participated in a conference call with Lopez, Johnson, and Kratohwil and repeated her request to work only six hours a day because the eight hour shift was causing her to suffer panic attacks and anxiety. Id. ¶¶ 12, 13, Ex. 13. She also requested the option to take "mini breaks" during all of her shifts — "a small break after every two hours." Id. ¶ 13, Ex. 13. In response, Stericycle offered to reduce Peten's Saturday shift to seven hours as a split shift, from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Id. ¶¶ 14-5. In addition, Stericycle indicated that she could take periodic breaks during each of the shifts. Id.; Kratohwil Aff. ¶ 11. Peten rejected the offer arguing that Stericycle had not addressed her need for breaks or a six hour shift on Saturdays.3 Id. ¶ 16, Ex. 13.
After she rejected Stericycle's offer, Kratohwil advised Peten [*5]  that if she wanted Stericycle to further consider her request to only work six hours on Saturdays, she would need her physician to complete an accommodation form. Id. ¶ 17. Lopez also advised Peten to have her physician recommend any accommodations that might allow her to perform her job. Id. ¶ 18. Following that discussion, Kratohwil sent Peten a letter along with a copy of her job description and the accommodation form for her medical provider to complete. Id. ¶ 19. Initially, the deadline to return the form was October 30, 2013, but it was extended to November 8, 2013. Id. ¶¶ 19-20. However, before she returned the form, Peten sent Lopez an email stating that she could work four to four and a half hours on Saturdays and another four and a half hours Sundays if she was given two days off during the week. Id. ¶ 21.
On or around November 11, 2013, Stericycle received a completed accommodation form from Peten's physician, which was dated November 7, 2013. Id. ¶ 22. Peten's physician, Dr. Rousseau, confirmed that Peten was suffering from mood instability and was being treated with medication and verbal therapy. Id. Ex. 10. Dr. Rousseau indicated that if Peten were allowed to work "less [*6]  than eight hour shifts" and to take "timeouts," Peten would be able to perform the essential functions of her job. Id. Upon receipt of Dr. Rousseau's form, Kratohwil and Johnson discussed his recommendations with the Job Accommodation Network, a third-party entity that provides employers with guidance on requests for disability accommodations, and all agreed that the accommodations previously offered, that being, a seven hour split shift and the option to take periodic breaks, were in line with Dr. Rousseau's suggestions and Peten's claimed restrictions. Id. ¶ 24.
Accordingly, on November 27, 2013, Kratohwil, Lopez, and Rich Scott, Stericycle's Contact Center Manager, had a follow-up conference call with Peten and advised her that the previously offered accommodations were consistent with the recommendations of her physician. Id. ¶ 26. Peten, once again, refused the offered accommodation arguing that her doctor had not been specific enough. Id. Exs. 11, 13. This time, she suggested that two hour breaks would be helpful. Id. Ex. 13. She also requested an opportunity to work from home, indicating that she often felt claustrophobic after a certain length of time. Id. ¶ 27, Ex. 13. Kratohwil [*7]  advised her that her physician's documentation did not support her new requests. Id. ¶ 28.
During that meeting, Peten also advised Lopez that she believed that the number of calls being routed to her station had increased and that more calls were being routed to her than to any other employee. Id. ¶ 30. In this regard, Peten stated that the calls had become so intense that she had to call Rich Scott to her desk because she became "very nervous, frustrated, and [her] stomach and head began to hurt." Id. Ex. 13. In addition, she complained that she had not been trained on the type of calls that she was receiving. Id. Peten says that as a result of the increased calls, she "became physically and mentally ill" and "had to leave work early." Id. According to Stericycle, call are routed to individuals randomly. Id. ¶ 37. In fact, there is no process to route calls to specific person. Id. In addition, all call center employees receive the same training. Id. ¶¶ 30, 37.
On December 12, 2014, Kratohwil sent Peten a follow-up letter summarizing her requests and Stericycle's response. Id. Ex. 11. The letter noted:
As stated to you in our November 27, 2013 response, you will continue to be expected [*8]  to perform all the functions and key activities of your position as a Customer Experience Expert. We want to support you and are more than willing to review and consider any future requests for accommodation. Please be advised that you will be required to provide medical documentation to support any new requests for accommodation.
Id. In response, Peten submitted a note from a new physician dated December 13, 2013, which indicated that Peten was suffering from neck pain, cervical disk bulges, migraines and lumbar pain-sciatica. Id. Ex. 12. The doctor indicated that Peten could not "sit or stand for long periods of time without breaks" and recommended that she be given an "ergonomically correct work station," "break-time," and "permission to stand and stretch." Id. The new accommodation form did not address Peten's mental disabilities, but Peten did send Kratohwil a follow-up letter in which she discussed her mental ailments, including her new assertion that she could not work longer than four or five hours on any day. Id. ¶ 35, Ex. 13. In this regard, Peten stated:
Your accommodation suggested that my Saturday schedule will be seven hours split in two shifts with an hour or two break [*9]  in between the shifts. I attempted to work a similar and approved arrangement on November 30 and was not feeling well at the end of my shift. I was extremely fatigued, in pain, and was suffering from lack of energy. I was concerned about my driving home. I am not able to work 7.5-8 hours on any day. I have been monitoring my health since my start date at Stericycle on 9/3/2013, and it seems as if I cannot work longer than 4-5 hours on any day without causing a medically related discomfort and for pain.
Id. Ex. 13. Finally, Peten noted several instances when she was required to leave work early and stated that she would not be reporting to work on December 23, 2013. Id. ¶ 36, Ex. 13.
Upon receipt of Peten's letter, Kratohwil scheduled a conference call with Peten, Johnson and Lopez for December 26, 2013, to address the new accommodations requested in the second physician's note. Id. ¶ 39. Peten was provided with the date and time of the call on December 24, 2013, but she called in sick on December 26, 2013. Id. ¶¶ 39-40. Peten continued to call in sick until December 30, 2013, when she notified Kratohwil by email that she would not be coming to work and did not know when she would be [*10]  able to return. Id. ¶¶ 40-1.
Stericycle attempted to schedule another conference call with Peten for January 14, 2014, to discuss her second letter and physician's note. Id. ¶ 43. Peten refused to participate. Id. Peten then filed a claim with Stericycle's third party administrator for short term disability leave and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). Id. ¶ 44. The third party administrator denied both requests on the grounds that Peten had not met the eligibility requirements. Id.
In early March of 2014, Peten then sent a note to Kratohwil and Johnson asking them to contact her regarding her return to work and attaching a doctor's note that stated Peten could return to work on her regular schedule. Id. ¶ 45. The doctor's note attached to the March letter provides, in pertinent part:
Anjanette was seen today (March 3, 2014) in our clinic for her regular medication evaluation. [Peten] appears calm, appropriate, in no acute stress and she says she is ready to go back to work on her regular schedule.
Id. Ex 15. On March 13, 2014, a representative from Stericycle tried reached her to no avail. Id. ¶ 46. Peten resigned from her position on March 17, 2014. Id. ¶ 47. Stericycle [*11]  formally accepted her resignation on March 18, 2014. Id. ¶ 49.

C. Procedural History
In January 2014, before she had resigned, Peten filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights alleging race and disability discrimination. ECF No. 1 at 4-20. On February 14, 2014, Peten filed a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging the same. Id. at 21-24. Almost a year to the day, Peten then filed her complaint in this action. ECF 1. On April 21, 2015, Stericycle filed an answer denying the race and disability claims. ECF No. 11. On June 21, 2017, Stericycle filed its fully briefed motion for summary judgment, the motion now before the Court.

DISCUSSION

A. Summary Judgment Standards
"'Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine disputes concerning any material facts, and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."' Puglisi v. Town of Hempstead, No. 10 CV 1928, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133281, 2012 WL 4172010, *6 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2012) (quoting In re Blackwood Assocs., L.P., 153 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) and citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In deciding a summary judgment motion, the district court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the opposing party. See Castle Rock Entm't, Inc v. Carol Publ'g Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 1998). If there is evidence in the record as to any material fact from which an inference could be drawn in favor of the [*12]  non-movant, summary judgment is unavailable. See Holt v. KMI-Continental, Inc., 95 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 1996), cert denied, 520 U.S. 1228, 117 S. Ct. 1819, 137 L. Ed. 2d 1027 (1997).
The trial court's responsibility is "'limited to discerning whether there are any genuine issues of material fact to be tried, not to deciding them. Its duty, in short, is confined at this point to issue-finding; it does not extend to issue-resolution.'" Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., L.P., 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994). When, however, there is nothing more than a "metaphysical doubt as to the material facts," summary judgment is proper. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "[T]here must exist 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial' in order to deny summary judgment as to a particular claim." Jamaica Ash & Rubbish v. Ferguson, 85 F. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322). A moving party may obtain summary judgment by demonstrating that little or no evidence may be found in support of the non-moving party's case. "When no rational jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight, there is no genuine issue of material fact and a grant of summary judgment is proper." Marks v. New York Univ., 61 F. Supp. 2d 81, 88 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).
Because Peten is proceeding pro se, the Court has read her papers liberally and interprets them "'to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.'" Ayazi v. United Fed'n of Teachers, Local 2, No. 99 CV 8222, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25734, 2011 WL 888053, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2011) (quoting McPherson v. Coombe, 174 F.3d 276, 280 (2d Cir. 1999)). "[H]owever, a pro se party's bald assertion, completely unsupported by evidence, is not sufficient [*13]  to overcome a motion for summary judgment." Ayazi, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25734, 2011 WL 888053, at *6 (citing Thompson v. Tracy, No. 00 CV 8360, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4228, 2008 WL 190449, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.17, 2008)). In addition, with respect to employment discrimination cases, the Second Circuit has advised that trial courts should "be cautious about granting summary judgment to an employer when . . . its intent is in issue," and that "affidavits and depositions must be carefully scrutinized for circumstantial proof which, if believed, would show discrimination." Gallo, 22 F.3d at 1223; see Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2010). Summary judgment is, however, "appropriate even in discrimination cases for . . . 'the salutary purposes of summary judgment — avoiding protracted, expensive and harassing trials — apply no less to . . . discrimination cases than to other areas of litigation.'" Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir. 1995)). With these standards in mind, the Court addresses the pending motion.

B. The McDonnell Douglas Framework
In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, claims brought under Title VII and the ADA are assessed under the framework articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Weinstock, 224 F.3d at 42. Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, for Title VII claims, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that: "(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she is qualified for her position; (3) [*14]  she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the circumstances give rise to an inference of discrimination." Id. For ADA claims, a plaintiff must show: "(1) her employer is subject to the ADA; (2) she was disabled [or regarded as disabled] within the meaning of the ADA; (3) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) she was fired or suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Jordan v. Forfeiture Support Assocs., 928 F. Supp. 2d 588, 605 (E.D.N.Y. 2013).
Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. See Weinstock, 224 F.3d at 42. "The defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for its actions which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 507, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original); see also Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., No. 12—CV-6158, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71302, 2014 WL 2157536, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2014) (citing St. Mary's, 509 U.S. at 507). "Upon the defendant's articulation of such a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, the presumption of discrimination arising with the establishment [*15]  of the prima facie case drops from the picture." Weinstock, 224 F.3d at 42. In order for the case to continue, the plaintiff must then come forward with evidence that the defendant's proffered, nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for actual discrimination. Id. Therefore, the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the articulated reason is untrue and that discrimination was the real reason for the employment action taken. Id.

C. Peten's Discrimination Claims under Title VII and the ADA
Read liberally, Peten's complaint asserts three separate discrimination claims against Stericycle. First, Peten maintains that Stericycle discriminated against her because she is black. Second, Peten claims that Stericycle discriminated against her after it was notified of her mental and physical disabilities. Lastly, Peten claims that she was denied a reasonable accommodation. Peten's burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under any of these theories is minimal. Abdu—Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 467 (2d Cir. 2001). Nonetheless, "[Peten] must proffer some admissible evidence of circumstances that would be sufficient to permit an inference of discriminatory motive and "cannot meet [her] burden through reliance on unsupported [*16]  assertions." Burnett v. Océ N. Am., No. 11 CV 6894, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133674, 2014 WL 4547037, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In other words, "[a] plaintiff's self-serving statement[s], without direct or circumstantial evidence to support the charge, is . . . insufficient" to meet this burden. Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the Court finds that Peten has failed to meet even the prima facie burden on her discrimination claims.

1. Title VII Race Discrimination Claim
With regard to her Title VII claim, Peten has failed to put forth any admissible evidence to establish that she suffered an adverse employment action. Nor has she established that her treatment occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of race discrimination. As best the Court can glean from the papers, Peten's sole race discrimination claim is that Stericycle "allowed a white female [with] a visible physical disability to take frequent breaks without harassment." ECF No. 1 at 4. Specifically, Peten contends that she observed a white female employee who uses a cane and walks with a limp taking breaks "every hour on the hour," while she was forced to remain in her seat.4 Id. at New York State Division of Human Rights Complaint Form. "A plaintiff suffers an [*17]  adverse employment action when she experiences a 'materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.' Weisbecker v. Sayville Union Free Sch. Dist., 890 F. Supp. 2d 215, 233 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Richardson v. N.Y. State Dept of Corr. Servcs., 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.1999), abrogated on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)). "Employment actions that have been deemed sufficiently disadvantageous to constitute an adverse employment action include 'a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation.' Williams v. R.H. Donnelley, Corp., 368 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000)). In contrast, "[c]hanges in assignments or duties that do not 'radical[ly] change' the nature of work are not typically adverse employment actions." Weisbecker, 890 F. Supp. 2d at 233 (E.D.N.Y. 2012)(citing Galabya, 202 F.3d at 641). Here, Peten's unsupported claim that she was "forced to remain in her seat" during her shift is not the type of action that would be typically considered adverse.
In addition, Peten has not offered a shred of evidence to suggest that her treatment occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of race discrimination. See Edwards v. New York State Unified Court Sys., No. 12 CIV. 46 WHP, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172207, 2012 WL 6101984, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2012) (plaintiff must do more than allege the familiar faulty syllogism: [*18]  something bad happened to me at work; I am (fill in the blank with one or more protected categories); therefore it must have happened because I am (fill in the blank with the applicable protected categories."). Peten's only support for her race discrimination claim is her claim that she was told by another employee that David Scott, her team leader, wanted her to remain in her seat. ECF No. 1 at New York State Division of Human Rights Complaint Form. This hearsay statement is far from sufficient to counter Kratohwil's sworn testimony that Peten was given the option of taking breaks and rejected the offer. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 1, Kratohwil Aff. ¶ 11.
Finally, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the unnamed white woman is a proper comparator. Ruiz v. County of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 494 (2d Cir. 2010) (the comparator must be similarly situated to the plaintiff "in all material respects."). Peten has offered no information about this women, the nature of her disability, or the accommodation she received. Des. Mem. at 16. In fact, at her deposition, Peten admitted that she has never interacted with her alleged comparator. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 4, Peten Dep. at 82:7-17, 83:2-5. Because Peten has failed to meet her burden to establish [*19]  a prima facie case of race discrimination, the Court need not address the balance of the McDonnell Douglas framework and respectfully recommends that Stericycle's motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim be granted.

2. Disability Discrimination Claims under the ADA
In a similar vein, Peten's discrimination claims under the ADA should be dismissed. The ADA was enacted by Congress to "provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). Discrimination claims under the ADA may be based on "three available theories: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation." Tsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dep 't, 352 F.3d 565, 573 (2d Cir. 2003). Under ADA, employers must make "reasonable accommodations" for qualified individuals with a disability, unless the employer can show that such an accommodation would impose an "undue hardship." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In this case, Peten alleges two separate ADA claims against Stericycle: (1) intentional discrimination based on mental and physical disability; and (2) failure to accommodate a need for a shorter work day and breaks. The Court will begin by addressing the intentional discrimination [*20]  claim.
a. Intentional Discrimination
Peten argues, in the complaint, that Stericycle increased her workload and failed to provide her with adequate training after they became aware of her disabilities. ECF No. 1 at New York State Division of Human Rights Complaint Form. To this end, Peten claims:
Managers and team leaders intentionally stressed me out by exponentially increasing my work load after being notified in writing by my doctor of my mental disability. I was a Level I customer service expert and at many times on many days I was answering as it appeared more calls than other employees on my level. On one specific occasion Belinda Harvey (same level employee) was reading a book and no calls were routed to her system while I was answering back to back calls and we received the same training for the same accounts. . . . I was left in the call center on occasions as the only Level I in the center answering high volume calls. . . . It was impossible to control the amount of calls I handled by myself. I did not receive proper training and or no training at all. I brought the matter to Rich Scott['s] and Moises Lopez['s] attention. I was verbally reprimanded . . . for taking a 5 minute [*21]  break and was told to remain in my seat. . . .
Id. (emphasis added). These allegations are entirely unsupported and no rational juror could find an inference of race discrimination based on the evidence in the summary judgment record.
To begin with, other than her own perceptions, Peten has failed to produce any evidence that could lead a reasonable fact finder to conclude that her disability was a consideration in the type of training she received or the number of calls that were routed to her during her shifts. See Olorode v. Steamingedge, Inc., No. 11 CV 6934, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59421, 2014 WL 1689039, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2014) ("[A] plaintiffs 'mere subjective belief that [s]he was discriminated against . . . does not sustain a . . . discrimination claim.") (quoting Gue v. Suleiman, No. 10 CV 8958, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141295, 2012 WL 4473283, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2012)). Indeed, it is clear from the record that Peten received the same amount of training that was received by every call center employee at Stericycle. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt., Ex. 5, Diana Aff. ¶ 7. In addition, Peten's training was complete before Stericycle became aware that she suffered from a disability. Moreover, nothing in the records support's Peten's perception that she received more calls than her co-workers. In fact, the opposite is true. Peten's supervisor testified that "[a]ll incoming calls at the call center are routed to individuals [*22]  randomly." Id. ¶ 5. Indeed, according to Diana, Stericycle does not have the ability to route a call to a particular employee. Id.
In addition, Peten has not shown that she suffered from an adverse action. Although Peten may have become "physically and mentally ill" as a result of the alleged increase in call volume, without more, an increase in workload is not cognizable as an adverse action. See Galabya, 202 F.3d at 640 (2d Cir. 2000) ("To be 'materially adverse' a change in working conditions must be 'more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.'")). In the same vein, Peten's claim that she was "verbally reprimanded . . . and told to remain in my seat" when she complained about the call volume is insufficient. "[D]isciplinary [actions] are adverse employment actions only if they affect ultimate employment decisions such as promotion, wages, or termination." Campbell v. New York City Transit Auth., 93 F. Supp. 3d 148, 168 (E.D.N.Y. 2015), motion for relief from judgment denied, No. 11-CV-2827 (MKB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157741, 2015 WL 7455842 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2015), and aff'd, 662 F. App'x 57 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1595, 197 L. Ed. 2d 722 (2017), reh'g denied, 137 S. Ct. 2236, 198 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2017) (citing Eldridge v. Rochester City Sch. Dist., 968 F.Supp.2d 546, 557 (W.D.N.Y.2013)).
Furthermore, to the extent Peten may be claiming that her decision to quit was not voluntary, her resignation cannot be considered a constructive discharge. "Constructive discharge occurs when the employer, rather than acting directly, [*23]  deliberately makes an employee's working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation." Id. (quoting Morris v. Schroder Capital Mgmt. Int'l, 481 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.2007)). However, "a constructive discharge cannot be proven merely by evidence that . . . 'the employee's working conditions were difficult or unpleasant.' Id. (citing Miller v. Praxair, Inc., 408 Fed. Appx. 408, 410 (2d Cir. 2010)). Nothing in the record suggests that Stericycle deliberately brought about the complained work conditions. Nor were the alleged conditions so intolerable that a reasonable juror could conclude that she was compelled to resign. Accordingly any claim for constructive discharge would also fail, and therefore, the plaintiff's claim for intentional discrimination under the ADA should be dismissed.
b. Failure to Accommodate
Finally, Peten asserts that Stericycle failed to accommodate her mental and physical disabilities. To this end, Peten claims that Stericycle failed to offer her a reduced work schedule on Saturdays and the opportunity to take periodic breaks to accommodate her stress and anxiety. ECF No. 1. Peten also claims that Stericycle failed to provide her with an ergonomically correct workstation to accommodate her back and neck issues. Id.
Under the ADA, the term "discriminate" includes: [*24] 
not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.
Jeffries v. Verizon, No. CV 10-2686 JFB AKT, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135543, 2012 WL 4344197, at *8-9 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2012), report and recommendation adopted, No. 10-CV-2686 JFB AKT, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135537, 2012 WL 4344188 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2012). "A reasonable accommodation is one that 'enable[s] an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position ... [or] to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.'" Noll v. IBM, 787 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii), (iii)). The reasonableness of an employer's accommodation is generally consider "a 'fact-specific' question. See id. However, where, as here, the undisputed record makes clear that "an employer has already taken (or offered) measures to accommodate the disability, the employer is entitled to summary judgment if, the existing accommodation is 'plainly reasonable.'" Id.
Peten maintains that Stericycle offered her an "unreasonable" accommodation to address her stress and anxiety, namely, a seven hour split shift. To support [*25]  her claim, Peten relies on the November 11, 2013 accommodation form completed by her physician, which stated that she was suffering from mood instability and was being treated with medication and verbal therapy. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 10. On that form, her doctor suggested that if Peten were allowed to work "less than eight hour shifts" and to take "timeouts," she would be able to perform the essential functions of her job. Id. Peten argues that Stericycle's determination that its split shift offer was in line with the doctor's recommendation is "ignorant and sarcastic." Pl's. Mem at 1. She contends, in this regard, that she needed to work a shift and then drive straight home because the medication she takes "keeps [her] drowsy." Working four hours, taking a break and working another three hours, she says, would have left her emotionally and physically drained. Id.
As an initial matter, the accommodation form completed by Dr. Rousseau did not, in any way, suggest that Peten was limited due to the medication she was taking for her disability. See Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006)("[G]enerally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed"). Nor did he suggest that a split [*26]  shift would be inappropriate. In fact, Dr. Rousseau simply stated that if Peten were allowed to work "less than eight hour shifts" and to take "timeouts," she could perform the essential functions of her job. While Peten may have preferred to work a shift and then drive home, "employers are not required to provide a perfect accommodation or the very accommodation most strongly preferred by the employee." Noll, 787 F.3d at 94 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630 app.).
Moreover, following her rejection of Stericycle's split shift offer, Peten was advised to have her physician complete a new accommodation form to address her varied, and ever-changing requests, including: (1) a six hour shift; (2) two hour breaks and (3) an opportunity to work from home. Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. ¶¶ 27-8, Ex. 13. She was also advised in a follow-up letter that Stericycle was more than willing to review and consider any future requests for accommodations. Id. Ex. 11. In response, Peten submitted an accommodation form from a new physician addressing her neck and back pain. No further documentation was submitted with respect to her mental disability.
'The ADA envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an [*27]  employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated.'" Jeffries, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135543, 2012 WL 4344197, at *16 (citing Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d. 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000)). Indeed, "[a]t least one court in this Circuit has adopted the view that if an employee withdraws from the interactive process, that employee is precluded from later alleging that the employer failed to accommodate him." Id. (citing Noel v. BNY—Mellon Corp., No. 10 Civ. 9143, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115828, 2011 WL 4633884, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.4, 2011)). Although Peten did send Stericycle a follow-up letter in December in which she discussed her physical and mental ailments, including her new assertion that she could not work longer than four or five hours on any day, she never submitted further documentation from a medical provider. Def.'s Rule 56.1 Stmt. Ex. 13. In addition, when Kratohwil tried to schedule a conference call with Peten to address her new accommodation requests, Peten would not participate. In fact, she did not return to work after mid-December. Peten acknowledges that Stericycle attempted to contact her to discuss an accommodation, but states that she found the "conference call" process stressful and humiliating. Pl.'s Mem. at 2. However, Stericycle cannot be held accountable for the fact that Peten found the interactive process difficult. Accordingly, [*28]  Peten cut off the interactive process with respect to her mental disability and cannot, therefore, argue in good faith that Stericycle failed to provide her with an accommodation.
The same is true for Peten's request for an accommodation due to her neck and back pain. Upon receipt of Peten's letter and new accommodation form, Kratohwil attempted to schedule a conference call with Peten, Johnson and Lopez for December 26, 2013. Id. ¶ 39. Peten was provided with the date and time of the call, but she called in sick on the day of the call. Id. ¶¶ 39-40. Stericycle attempted to reschedule the conference call for mid-January and, once again, Peten refused to participate. Id. ¶ 43. In fact, Peten did not go to work in January or February and then, in early March, she sent Kratohwil and Johnson a note indicating she was ready to return to work on her regular schedule, suggesting that no further accommodations were need at least with respect to work schedule. Id. Ex 15. Then, a few days later, Peten resigned from her position. Id. ¶ 47. As Stericycle was given no opportunity to further assess her disabilities or to offer a reasonable accommodation, Peten's failure to accommodate claim as it [*29]  relates to her neck and back pain should also be dismissed. Accordingly, the Court respectfully recommends that summary judgment be granted on the plaintiffs ADA claims as well.
