Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT NCR CORPORATION'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
[Doc. No. 32]
Plaintiff Glen R. Hagen brings this action against Defendant NCR Corporation alleging disability and age discrimination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov't Code § 12980 et seq. ("FEHA"), wrongful termination, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, defamation, negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Doc. No. 1.) Currently before the Court is Defendant NCR Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. No. 32.) Plaintiff opposes the motion (Doc. No. 41), and Defendant filed a reply (Doc. No. 44). On March 16, 2009, the Court found this motion suitable for decision on the papers and vacated the hearing pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1). Having considered the submissions, and for the reasons set forth [*2]  below, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion in its entirety.

Background
The following material facts are not in dispute.1 Hagen was employed as a computer programmer at NCR prior to the events that gave rise to the litigation. On March 10, 2006, NCR informed Hagen that his job was being eliminated due to a reduction in force. The letter informed Hagen that his official termination date was March 24, 2006. On March 20, 2006, Hagen informed his supervisor that he intended to file for disability. On March 23, 2006, Plaintiff was examined by neuropsychologist, Mark McDonough, Ph.D., who diagnosed Plaintiff with Dementia/Pre-Alzheimer's Disease. On March 27, 2006, Plaintiff's doctor, Mark Upton, M.D., responded to a MetLife request for information and stated that Plaintiff was unable to return to work.2 On April 1, 2006, Met Life approved Plaintiff's application for short-term disability benefits effective March 20, 2006.
On June 19, 2006, Plaintiff was approved for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. The benefits were provided because Plaintiff's doctors concluded he was disabled and unable to work. On August 10, 2006, Dr. McDonough responded to a request for information [*3]  from MetLife regarding the status of Plaintiff's ability to return to work, stating, "I do not anticipate a return to work given the patient's profound memory limitations."3 On August 24, 2006, Dr. Upton responded to a second MetLife request for information and attested that Plaintiff would not be able to gradually return to work until at least July 2007. On November 8, 2006, Plaintiff was re-examined by Dr. McDonough, and he confirmed his findings from his previous examination and noted the "continued significant memory decline."4 On November 17, 2006, MetLife approved Plaintiff's application for long-term disability benefits effective September 16, 2006 through September 17, 2007. As a condition of receiving long-term disability benefits under the MetLife plan, Plaintiff had a continuing obligation to provide proof of disability and evidence of continuing disability. On June 18, 2007, Dr. McDonough provided an updated assessment of Plaintiff to MetLife, stating that he did "not believe the patient to be able to work due to his significant ongoing limitations." When asked when he estimated Plaintiff could return to work based on the patient's response to treatment, Dr. McDonough responded, [*4]  "As noted, I do not anticipate Mr. Hagen returning to work in his prior capacity." On July 20, 2007, Plaintiff's treating neuropsychiatrist, Lisa Davidson, Ph.D., responded to a MetLife request for information, stating, "The patient is not able to return to work due to significant cognitive limitations." Dr. Davidson also noted that "It is estimated and anticipate that patient will not return to work in his previous capacity." On August 17, 2007, MetLife approved Plaintiff's continuing long-term disability status based on information provided to it by Plaintiff's doctors.
On April 10, 2008, MetLife responded to a request from Plaintiff to verify his long-term disability benefits. MetLife verified that Plaintiff "will continue to receive this monthly benefit through December 10, 2016 (Maximum duration under the terms of [his] Plan), provided [he] remain[s] totally disabled and continue[s] to meet the Plan provisions." On September 2, 2008, Plaintiff's current treating physician, Mark Sadoff, M.D., completed a MetLife form titled "Attending Physician's Statement of Functional Capacity." Dr. Sadoff described Plaintiff's symptoms as "progressive memory loss" and the primary [*5]  diagnosis affecting Plaintiff's work ability as "Alzheimer's Dementia." Dr. Sadoff also verified that Plaintiff is "totally disabled" both for his occupation at NCR and for any occupation, and that Plaintiff will "never" be able to resume work activities.
NCR's company policy5 on disability insurance states,
When short-term disability benefits end within the 26-week short-term disability period, you are expected to return to work immediately. If you are totally disabled at the end of the 26 weeks of short-term disability benefits, your employment status changes and you are no longer considered an employee. Your long-term disability benefits may begin.
The policy also states, "Long-term disability benefits may begin once you have been totally disabled due to a single disability for 26 weeks—in other words, once short-term disability benefits end. When short-term disability benefits end, your employment status changes and you are no longer considered an employee." Finally, the policy states, "If you recover from your long-term disability, you may apply for an open position at NCR and be rehired at the company's discretion." During his deposition, Plaintiff stated that he never asked any [*6]  of his doctors whether he might be able to work any other job and never explored in any way whether or not there was another job at NCR that he could have filled.

LEGAL STANDARD
A moving party is entitled to summary judgment only if she can demonstrate that (1) "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact," and (2) the moving party is "entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A material issue of fact is one that raises a question that a trier of fact must answer to determine the rights of the parties under the substantive law that applies. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute is genuine if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. The initial burden is on the moving party to show that both prongs are satisfied. Celotex, supra, 477 U.S. at 323. The moving party can satisfy this burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Id. at 322-23. If the moving party fails to discharge this initial burden, summary judgment must be denied, [*7]  and the court need not consider the nonmoving party's evidence. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).
If the moving party meets this initial burden, the nonmoving party cannot defeat summary judgment merely by demonstrating "that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252 ("The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party's position is not sufficient."). Rather, the nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings and by [his] own affidavits, or by 'the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Celotex, supra, 477 U.S. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). The inferences to be drawn from the facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Gibson v. County of Washoe, Nev., 290 F.3d 1175, 1180 (9th Cir. 2002). "Credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, [when] he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Anderson, supra, 477 U.S. at 255.

Discussion
NCR seeks summary judgment on all causes of action. Plaintiff states in his opposition that he does not oppose dismissal of his claims for age discrimination, defamation, and invasion of privacy. (Pl.'s Opp. [Doc. No. 41] at 1:4-5.) Accordingly, the [*8]  Court GRANTS NCR's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims for age discrimination, defamation, and invasion of privacy. The Court shall now address Plaintiff's remaining causes of action.

I. Disability Discrimination under California FEHA
Plaintiff seeks relief under three provisions of California FEHA. The first provision under which Plaintiff seeks relief is Section 12940(a), which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of a physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The second provision falls under Section 12940(m), which makes it unlawful for an employer to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). The third provision falls under Section 12940(n), which makes it unlawful for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with an employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical mental disability or known medical condition. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
Employment discrimination cases, including those brought under California FEHA, are analyzed [*9]  under an allocation of burdens of production and proof set forth in the Supreme Court case McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-804, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 357-58, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the Plaintiff has the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a rebuttable presumption of discrimination arises. St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). The burden then shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). If the employer meets this burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears. Hicks, supra, 509 U.S. at 510-11. The Plaintiff must then have the opportunity to attack the employer's proffered reasons as pretexts for discrimination, or to offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive. Id. at 515-18. The ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of actual discrimination remains with the Plaintiff. Id. at 518.

a. Prima Facie Case under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)
NCR contends that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case under subsection (a), thus entitling it to judgment as a matter of law. To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under section 12940(a), a plaintiff must show: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) he was subjected [*10]  to adverse employment action because of his disability." Faust v. Calif. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886-87, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). In order to be "qualified," the plaintiff must be able to show that he or she was able to do the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Green v. Calif., 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007).
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is disabled because of his Dementia/Pre-Alzheimer's Disease. NCR, however, contends that Plaintiff cannot establish that he was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his disability. On March 10, 2006, NCR sent Plaintiff a letter indicating that he was being terminated due to a reduction in force, and that his official termination date was March 24, 2006. (Def.'s Ex. 30.) The notice informed Plaintiff that he was eligible for separation benefits under the NCR Reduction in Force Plan if he elected to participate in the Plan, and that Plaintiff could take advantage of a program with Right Management Consultants if he wished to pursue alternative employment opportunities. Plaintiff contends that this letter constitutes an adverse employment action, and that the letter was the result of his disability. (Pl.'s Opp. at 7:8-8:17.) Defendant, however, contends that the termination never became effective because Plaintiff informed his [*11]  manager on March 20, 2006 that he intended to file for disability benefits. (Def.'s Ex. 1.) NCR contends that once Plaintiff advised it that he was seeking disability benefits, it was precluded from implementing the termination until MetLife approved or denied the application. (Def.'s Reply at 5:2-12.)
The Court does not find support for Plaintiff's assertion that the March 10, 2006 letter constituted an adverse employment action. The documentary evidence provided by NCR clearly shows that the proposed termination never took effect. (Def.'s Ex. 26, 36, 37; Pierce Aff. at ¶¶ 15, 16.) Plaintiff was categorized as an NCR employee up until he completely exhausted his short-term disability benefits, when he was automatically terminated and transitioned to long-term disability benefits pursuant to company policy. (Def.'s Ex. 26, at 21.) Indeed, had the March 10, 2006 letter been considered a termination, Plaintiff would not have been eligible for short-term disability benefits because short-term disability benefits were only available to employees. (Def.'s Ex. 26, at 6.)
Plaintiff provides no legal support for his contention that an unimplemented notice of termination constitutes an adverse [*12]  employment action under the statute. Although there does not appear to be a case with facts similar to those here, the Court does find analogous legal authority that appears to support NCR's position that the notice does not constitute an adverse employment action. In McRae v. Dept. of Corrections, the California Court of Appeals did not consider a decision to suspend an employee that was never actually implemented to constitute an adverse employment action in the context of a retaliation claim.142 Cal. App. 4th 377, 392, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313 (2006). In Brooks v. City of San Mateo, the Ninth Circuit found that an evaluation that was subject to modification by the employer was not an adverse employment action when the employee abandoned her job while her appeal of the evaluation was pending. 229 F.3d 917, 929-30 (9th Cir. 2000). The only adverse employment action here—Plaintiff's actual termination—occurred pursuant to company policy which requires the employee to be terminated upon the employee transitioning into the long-term disability plan. Plaintiff has presented no evidence that his actual termination was the result of disability discrimination. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-27, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established that he was the subject of an adverse employment action because [*13]  of his disability.
In addition, NCR argues that Plaintiff has not established that he is a "qualified individual" entitled to relief under subsection (a). The Court also finds this argument persuasive. In order to be considered a "qualified individual," a plaintiff must establish that he is capable of performing the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). NCR contends that Plaintiff cannot be considered a "qualified individual" because Plaintiff's doctors continuously confirmed that Plaintiff was unable to work because of his Dementia/Pre-Alzheimer's Disease. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 6:14-20. See Def.'s Ex. 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14.) Plaintiff concedes that his doctors did continuously confirm that he was unable to work because of his disability, but then offers affidavits from his doctors stating that when they confirmed to NCR that Plaintiff was unable to work, they were only considering whether Plaintiff could return to work in his previous capacity. In an attempt to show that NCR could have accommodated his disability, Plaintiff offers the Psychiatric Consultation Report and Findings which was prepared by his expert, Dr. Dominick Addario, M.D., and states [*14]  that Plaintiff, at the time of his termination, "could have been accommodated and assisted toward continuing gainful employment with NCR Corporation." (Pl.'s NOL Ex. E-A, at 8-11.) Plaintiff also offers the affidavit of one of the doctors who stated that Plaintiff was unable to return to work, Dr. Scott Upton, M.D. (Upton Decl., Pl.'s NOL Ex. D.) In his affidavit, Dr. Upton states that his diagnosis "did not preclude Mr. Hagen from working in a different position with different skill sets." (Id. at ¶5.) Dr. Upton, however, never indicated as much to NCR in his numerous confirmations that Plaintiff was unable to return to work at all, and to date has never elucidated what accommodations could have been made such that Plaintiff could have returned to work. Moreover, although Plaintiff identifies some positions that were available at the time (Pl.'s Opp. at 6:14-27; Pl.'s Aff., Pl.'s NOL Ex. A.), he fails to provide anything other than his own assertion that he was qualified to perform some of these positions with appropriate accommodations. (Pl.'s Aff., NOL Ex. A, at ¶ 16.) Plaintiff's assertion alone is insufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether Plaintiff was qualified to work. See Ott v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13986, at *6 (N.D. Cal. 1997) ("given the medical [*15]  evidence presented, plaintiff's subjective opinion concerning his ability to work is facially insufficient to establish that he was qualified to return to work."). Moreover, whether Plaintiff's medical providers are now of the opinion that Plaintiff could have been accommodated does not change the fact that Plaintiff's medical providers consistently confirmed to NCR that Plaintiff was "totally disabled" and unable to return to work at all.
The facts of this case are similar to those before the court in Swonke v. Sprint, Inc., 327 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (N.D. Cal. 2004). In Swonke, Plaintiff alleged disability discrimination under California FEHA on grounds that his employer, Sprint, Inc., failed to accommodate his knee injury. Id. at 1133. The facts, however, showed that Plaintiff's medical providers repeatedly stated that Plaintiff was unable to work and neither Plaintiff nor his medical providers ever indicated to Sprint that Plaintiff was capable of returning to work in any capacity. Id. The Court noted: "Even if a doctor were to testify later in deposition or at trial that plaintiff was physically able to have performed his work with modification, it would not alter the facts as they were plainly presented to Sprint at the time." Id. The Court stated that [*16]  ruling in favor of Plaintiff would be tantamount to holding that "the employer should have returned plaintiff to work when the professional medical judgment was that he was physically incapacitated." Id. at 1133-34. Plaintiff consistently acted in accordance with being totally disabled, and his doctors confirmed his total disability repeatedly and with no indication that Plaintiff could return to work in any capacity. Based on these facts, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was a qualified individual during the period of time he was on disability and prior to his termination.
Because Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he was the subject of an adverse employment action because of his disability or that he was a qualified individual, the Court hereby GRANTS NCR's motion for summary judgment on this claim.

b. Prima Facie Case under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)
Plaintiff's next cause of action under California FEHA arises under subsection (m). Subsection (m) confers a private right of action because "[t]he failure to provide an applicant or employee with reasonable accommodation in and of itself constitutes an unfair employment practice . . . ." Green v. State of Calif., 132 Cal. App. 4th 97, 111, 33 Cal. Rptr. 3d 254 (2005) (citing Bagatti v. Dept. of Rehab., 92 Cal. App. 4th 344, 360-61 (2002)). [*17]  In order to establish a prima facie case under subsection (m), plaintiff must show (1) that he had a known physical or mental disability and (2) that his employer failed to make reasonable accommodation for this known disability. Green, supra, 132 Cal. App. 4th at 112. If the employee fails to show that he is disabled under the statute, the employer may still be liable under subsection (m) if the employer regards the employee as disabled. Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). In addition to these requirements, plaintiff is still required to establish that he is a "qualified individual," or, in other words, that "the work environment could have been modified or adjusted in a manner that would have enabled the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 975-77, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Subsection (m), however, explicitly excuses the duty to accommodate if the accommodation would produce an undue hardship on the employer's operation. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m).
NCR contends that it was not obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation because Plaintiff was not a qualified individual. In light of the Court's foregoing analysis and determination that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case under subsection (m) and NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court [*18]  GRANTS NCR's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's cause of action under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m).

c. Prima Facie Case under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)
Plaintiff's final cause of action under California FEHA arises under subsection (n). In order to establish a prima facie case under subsection (n), plaintiff must show that (1) he has a known physical or mental disability, (2) he requested reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to engage in a "timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee" to determine a reasonable accommodation. Claudio v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 134 Cal. App. 4th 224, 228, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d 837 (2005).
Plaintiff asserts that NCR was obligated to engage him in the interactive process, and that its failure to do so establishes liability under subsection (n). Plaintiff, however, fails to produce any evidence that he requested reasonable accommodation. Indeed, Plaintiff concedes in his opposition that he "never informed Defendant of his disability or his need to be accommodated" because he was unaware of his memory loss. (Pl.'s Opp. at 10:25-26.) Plaintiff, however, argues that he was not obligated to request accommodation, citing to Barnett v. U.S. Air, 228 F.3d 1105, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000) in support of his position. The portion of the Barnett opinion cited by Plaintiff, however, addresses an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") regulation that suggests an employer [*19]  may want to initiate an informal, interactive process in order to determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation under the American with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Id. at 1111-12. Nowhere in the opinion does the Ninth Circuit even address California FEHA generally or subsection (n) specifically. Thus, this case does not provide any support to Plaintiff's position. Moreover, Plaintiff's position is completely contrary to the language set forth in the statute, which explicitly requires that the employee request accommodation before the requirement to engage in the interactive process is triggered. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). See also CACI 2546; BAJI 12.12.6. Finally, the Court finds that the evidence clearly demonstrates that no accommodations could have been made that were consistent with the multiple medical opinions that Plaintiff was totally disabled from any employment. "The Court cannot impose upon the employer an obligation to engage in a process that was guaranteed to be futile." Swonke, supra, 327 F. Supp. 2d at 1137.
Accordingly, NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Court GRANTS its motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's cause of action under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).

II. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
NCR contends that it is entitled to judgment as a [*20]  matter of law because NCR's termination of Plaintiff was "entirely consistent with the law and its own company policies." (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 10:6-8.) In Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980), the California Supreme Court recognized a common law tort action for employees who have been terminated for reasons that violate firmly established public policy. Plaintiff claims that the termination of his employment was a violation based on the public policy established in California FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. The California Supreme Court has found that a termination that violates California FEHA "can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." Stevenson v. Sup. Ct., 16 Cal. 4th 880, 885, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997). Here, Plaintiff has failed to establish that his termination violated California FEHA. Accordingly, NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Court GRANTS its motion for summary judgment on the wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim.

III. Breach of Implied Contract Not to Terminate Except for Just Cause
Plaintiff's fourth cause of action seeks relief for breach of an implied contract not to terminate employment except for just cause. The duty to only terminate an employee for just cause exists only if the totality of the circumstances of the employment [*21]  relationship give rise to "an implied-in-fact contract limiting the employer's termination rights." Stillwell v. Salvation Army, 167 Cal. App. 4th 360, 380, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 111 (2008). NCR has provided evidence that demonstrates Plaintiff was terminated pursuant to a company policy that called for an employee to be automatically terminated and transitioned into long term disability upon exhaustion of his short term disability benefits. Plaintiff has not produced any evidence that his termination was for any reason other than the terms of NCR's disability insurance policy. Accordingly, NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Court GRANTS its motion for summary judgment on this claim.

IV. Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
Plaintiff's fifth cause of action seeks relief for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Where an employee alleges that he was terminated without just cause, he may also allege breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if he can show that his employment was pursuant to an implied contract. Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 352, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Plaintiff's claim is completely derivative of his claim that he was terminated on March 10, 2006 because of his disability. As with Plaintiff's fourth cause of action, Plaintiff has not presented [*22]  any evidence that he was terminated for any reason other than the terms of NCR's disability insurance policy. Accordingly, NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Court GRANTS its motion for summary judgment on this claim.

V. Negligent Supervision
Plaintiff's next cause of action is for negligent supervision. Negligent supervision is a cause of action that is normally asserted by a third party against a tortfeasor's employer. See Frederico v. Superior Court 59 Cal. App. 4th 1207, 1214 (1997). A cause of action for negligent supervision exists if the employer engaged in conduct that steps outside of the employer's proper role or is of "questionable relationship to the employment." Fermino v. Fedco, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 701, 708, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 18, 872 P.2d 559 (1994).
Here, Plaintiff alleges that NCR is liable for negligent supervision because "Defendant's managers conspired to hide from Plaintiff a medical condition, memory loss, of which Defendant knew Plaintiff was unaware." (Pl.'s Opp. at 22:14-16.) Plaintiff contends that he was damaged because "had Defendant questioned Plaintiff about his memory loss, Plaintiff could have sought medical treatment two years sooner than he did." (Id. at 22:18-21.) NCR, however, contends that it was not responsible for Plaintiff's memory loss and holding it liable for not asking [*23]  Plaintiff about his memory loss would be akin to imposing a legal duty to act when it is well-established that there is generally no duty to act to protect others. (Def.'s Reply at 12:13-13:6.) The Court agrees. It is well settled that absent a special relationship, there is no duty to act to protect others who are endangered by the conduct of a third party or something other than that party's own conduct. Delgado v. Trax Bar & Grill, 36 Cal. 4th 224, 235, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 145, 113 P.3d 1159 (2005). Plaintiff's position seeks to circumvent this long-standing rule in American jurisprudence. In addition, such actions by an employee against his employer are specifically barred because of state worker's compensation laws which provide the exclusive remedies for workplace injuries. Vuillemainroy v. Am. Rock & Asphalt, 70 Cal. App. 4th 1280, 1283-84, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 269 (1999). Therefore, based on the foregoing, NCR is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the Court GRANTS its motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's negligent supervision claim.

VI. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Plaintiff's ninth and final cause of action is for intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"). Plaintiff concedes that in the absence of establishing that he was the subject of wrongful termination in violation of public policy, a claim for IIED is preempted by workers' [*24]  compensation laws. (Pl.'s Opp. at 23:18-23.) Plaintiff has failed to establish that he was the subject of a wrongful termination, thus his claim for IIED is barred. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS NCR's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's IIED claim.

Conclusion
For the reasons stated herein, the Court hereby GRANTS Defendant NCR Corporation's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. This order disposes of all claims. Accordingly, the Court ORDERS the Clerk of Court to enter judgment in favor of Defendant NCR Corporation, and to terminate the case.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
