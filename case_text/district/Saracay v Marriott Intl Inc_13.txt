PROCEEDINGS (in chambers): ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 17]
This matter is before the Court on Defendant Marriott International Inc.'s ("Defendants" or "Marriott") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"), filed May 6, 2019. Plaintiff Hailey Saracay ("Plaintiff' or "Saracay") opposed the Motion ("Opposition") on May 17, 2019. Defendant replied ("Reply") on May 20, 2019. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

A. Factual History
Unless noted otherwise, the following facts are either undisputed or supported by sufficient admissible evidence that they are "admitted to exist without controversy" for the purposes of this Motion. L.R. 56-3.1
1. Saracay's Employment by Marriot
Marriott employed Plaintiff from January 15, 2014 until June 1, 2016 as a housekeeping associate. (Deposition of Hailey Saracay ("Saracay Dep."), 74:18-23, Ex. A, ECF No. 17-3; Declaration of Cathy Ganz ("Ganz Dec.") ¶ 4, ECF No. 17-2.) The job description for the position of "Housekeeper [*2]  " states that " physical tasks required by this position " include:
" Move, lift, carry, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 55 pounds without assistance and in excess of 55 pounds with assistance.
" Ability to push and pull a loaded housekeeping cart over sloping and uneven surfaces.
" Reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stopping.
" Stand, sit kneel, or walk for an extended period across an entire work shift.
Saracay Dep. 96:20-98:8; Ganz Dec. ¶ 7, Ex. A.) These duties were major, primary, and essential job duties of a housekeeper. (Ganz Dec. ¶ 7, Ex. A.)
2. Plaintiff's Injuries
While employed by Marriott, on December 29, 2014, Plaintiff sustained an injury to her right hand, right elbow, right knee, and lower back. (Saracay Dep. 53:15-54:2; 98:19-24, 99:5-100:20; Declaration of Hailey Saracay ("Saracay Dec.") ¶ 4, Ex. 2, ECF No. 19-4.) On December 30, 2014, Plaintiff returned to work on the following modified job duties: no overhead work, lifting, pushing or pulling up to ten pounds, no kneeling or squatting, and must use a splint/support. (Saracay Dec ¶ 4.) Marriott accommodated Plaintiff's temporary work restrictions for sixty days [*3]  by having her complete various tasks in different departments throughout the hotel. (Saracay Dep. 100:14-20, 101:16-102:17; Ganz Dec. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff's modified duties consisted of taking towels to the rooms when needed, placing plastic cups in bags in the laundry room, hanging gowns on hangers, separating bed sheets from towels in the laundry area, cleaning tables in the balcony areas, refilling towels in the bathroom, assisting the person in the lobby with cleaning the bathroom sinks, refilling Kleenex, refilling toilet paper, and refilling toilet seat covers. (Saracay Dec ¶ 4; Saracay Dep. 100:14-20, 101:16-102:17; Ganz Dec. ¶ 7.)
After the sixty-day accommodation period ended, on April 2, 2015, Plaintiff was placed on disability and received workers' compensation benefits. (Saracay Dep. 100:9-20, 100:24-101:1, 120:3-8; Ganz Dec. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff did not return to work because her doctor modified Plaintiff's duties. (Saracay Dec. ¶¶ 5,9; Saracay Dep. 120: 3-121:11.) Plaintiff underwent surgery on November 24, 2015. (Saracay Dep. 50:8-11, 121:8-11, 122:13-18, Ex. 13; Ganz Dec. ¶ 9.)
Following her months-long recovery from surgery, Plaintiff's doctor placed her on permanent work restrictions [*4]  on May 16, 2016. (Saracay Dep. 123:18-125:3, 126:2-4; Ganz Dec. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff's doctor prohibited her from squatting, kneeling, and knee bending. (Saracay Dep. 123:18-125:3, 126:2-4; Ganz Dec. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff's doctor also restricted her from making repetitive right hand motions for more than thirty cumulative minutes per hour for more than eight hours per day, and from lifting, carrying pushing and pulling more than fifteen pounds. (Saracay Dep. 123:18-125:3, 126:2-4; Ganz Dec. ¶ 10.)
On June 1, 2016, Michelle Argumedo, Marriott's human resources manager, engaged in an interactive process to discuss Plaintiff's permanent work restrictions with her. (Saracay Dep. 126:5-128:5; 132:20-134:16, 135:8-137:12; Ganz Dec. ¶¶11-14, Ex. B and C.) Marriott informed Plaintiff that she could not be accommodated in her desired position as a housekeeper given the restrictions enumerated by Plaintiff's doctor. (Saracay Dep. 126:5-128:5; 132:20-134:16, 135:8-137:12, Ex. 15 and 16; Ganz Dec. ¶¶ 11-14, Ex. B and C.) However, Argumedo provided Plaintiff with a current job list and told Plaintiff that she was free to apply to a new position as long as her job restrictions permitted it. (Ganz Dec. ¶¶ [*5]  11-14, Ex. B and C.) The meeting concluded with Defendant terminating Plaintiff from her position, effective June 1, 2016. (Ganz Dec. ¶¶ 11-14, Ex. B and C.)
B. Procedural Background
After her termination from Marriott, Plaintiff brought this action in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles on February 1, 2018, alleging that Defendant Marriott wrongfully terminated her employment because she developed a physical disability that limited her ability to bend, kneel, lift, push, and pull weight. (Notice of Removal at 1, ECF No. 1; see generally Notice of Removal, Ex. 1 ("Complaint"), ECF No. 1.) On April 19, 2018, Defendant removed the action to this Court on diversity grounds. (See generally Notice of Removal at 1-4.)
Plaintiff brings nine causes of action related to her termination: (1) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq. ("FEHA"); (2) age discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq; (3) retaliation, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k); (5) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq; (6) failure to engage in the a good faith interactive process [*6]  in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq; (7) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (9) declaratory judgment. (See generally Compl.)
In the instant motion for summary judgment, Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to carry her burden of proof with respect to all of these causes of action. (See generally Mot, ECF No. 17.)
These proceedings followed.
II. LEGAL STANDARD Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) mandates that "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. In such a case, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case." C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In contrast, when the nonmoving [*7]  party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving part does not need to produce any evidence or prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Rather, the moving party's initial burden "may be discharged by 'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. "Summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff 'fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [his] case, and on which [he] will bear the burden of proof at trial.'" Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 805-06, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).
Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the "party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [nonmoving party]'s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving party]." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) ("[O]pponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."). Further, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit . . . will properly preclude the [*8]  entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. At the summary judgment stage, a court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See id. at 249. A court must draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.
III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff brings several causes of action against Defendant in relation to her termination. Having reviewed the undisputed material facts, the Court holds that for each these causes of action, Defendant prevails on the instant motion for summary judgment.
A. FEHA Disability Discrimination
The Court begins by addressing Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under FEHA. Under subsection 12940(a) of FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to discharge an employee because of "physical disability" unless the employee "is unable to perform the . . . essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), § 12940(a)(1). "A prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA requires the employee to show that he or she (1) suffered from a disability . . . ; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations[;] and (3) was subjected to adverse [*9]  employment action because of the disability." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (Ct. App. 2000)).
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff suffered a disability while Plaintiff was employed as a Marriott housekeeper. They also do not dispute that Plaintiff was placed on temporary work restrictions immediately after her injury on December 30, 2014. (See Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts ("PMF") ¶¶ 1-3, ECF No. 19-1; Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("DUMF") ¶¶ 1-3, 8, ECF No. 17.) Thus, summary adjudication turns on whether Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation. Defendant submits that squatting, kneeling, knee bending, repetitive right hand motions, and lifting, pushing, and pulling fifty-five pounds without assistance were essential functions of Plaintiff's job, and that the undisputed facts show that she could not perform these functions with or without reasonable accommodation.
1. Essential Functions of Plaintiff's Job
The Court begins by determining whether squatting, kneeling, knee bending, repetitive right hand motions, lifting, pushing, and pulling fifty-five pounds without assistance were essential functions [*10]  of Plaintiff's job.
"'Essential functions' means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires" and excludes "the marginal functions of the position." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Ct. App. 2015) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f) and Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e)(3)). Marginal functions are "those that, if not performed, would not eliminate the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an alternative way." Cal. Code. Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e)(3). "A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the following":
(A) . . . the reason the position exists is to perform that function.
(B) . . . the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed.
(C) . . . the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular [highly specialized] function.
Cal. Gov't Code, § 12926(f); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(A) The employer's or other covered entity's judgment as to which functions are essential.
(B) Accurate, current written job descriptions.
(C) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function. [*11] 
(D) The legitimate business consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function.
(E) Job descriptions or job functions contained in a collective bargaining agreement.
(F) The work experience of past incumbents in the job.
(G) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
(H) Reference to the importance of the performance of the job function in prior performance reviews.
Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e).
a. Squatting, Kneeling, Knee Bending, Repetitive Right Hand Motions, Lifting, Pushing, and Pulling Fifty-Five Pounds Without Assistance Were Essential Functions of Plaintiff's Job.
To support the contention that squatting, kneeling, knee bending, repetitive right hand motions, lifting, pushing, and pulling fifty-five pounds without assistance were essential functions of Plaintiff's job, Defendant points to the Marriott job description for the position of "housekeeper," which indicates that "physical requirements" of the position include: "mov[ing], lift[ing], carry[ing], and plac[ing] "objects weighing less than or equal to fifty-five pounds without assistance and in excess of fifty-five pounds with assistance." (Ganz Dec. ¶ 7, Ex. A.) A housekeeper must have the "ability to push and pull a loaded [*12]  housekeeping cart over sloping and uneven surfaces. Reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stopping. Stand, sit kneel, or walk for an extended period across an entire work shift." (Saracay Dep. 96:20-98:8; Ganz Dec. ¶ 7, Ex. A.)
In addition, the checklist indicates that the "critical tasks" of this job includes replacing dirty linens with clean items, following "correct bed making and folding standards, and clean[ing] bathrooms." (Saracay Dep. 96:20-98:8; Ganz Dec. ¶ 7, Ex. A.) Moreover, Plaintiff testified that during her employment, she would have to squat very low because she had to check under the beds and clean underneath the bathroom sinks. (Saracay Dep. 90:1-98:8.) She also testified that she had to push a loaded cart of linens everyday, which she estimated weighed between 50-100 pounds. (Saracay Dep. 90:1-98:8; DUMF ¶ 17.)
Accordingly, squatting, kneeling, knee bending, repetitive right hand motions, and lifting, pushing, and pulling heavy weights were essential functions of Plaintiff's job. These duties were specialized and comprised the majority of Plaintiff's work. The elimination of these duties would eliminate the need for Plaintiff's [*13]  job. Furthermore, the job descriptions or job functions contained in the collective bargaining agreement indicate that these duties belonged primarily to housekeepers. These requirements suggest that Plaintiff would be unable to do her job without assistance if she were unable to lift more than ten or fifteen pounds.
b. Plaintiff Could Not Perform These Essential Functions Without A Reasonable Accommodation.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job as a housekeeper without a reasonable accommodation from Defendant. Per her doctor's recommendation, Plaintiff was placed on permanent work restrictions, prohibiting her from squatting, kneeling, knee bending, making repetitive right hand motions for more than thirty cumulative minutes per hour for more than eight hours per day, and from lifting, carrying pushing and pulling more than fifteen pounds. (Ganz Dec. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff admitted that given her work restrictions, she would not be able to carry out the essential functions of a housekeeper, with or without reasonable accommodation. (PMF ¶¶ 10-11, 17-19.) Plaintiff also admitted that she did not apply for a housekeeping position elsewhere after [*14]  she left Marriott because she could not perform the essential job functions of a housekeeper given her work restrictions. (DUMF ¶ 10.) Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendant that squatting, kneeling, knee bending, repetitive right hand motions, lifting, pushing, and pulling fifty-five pounds without assistance are essential functions of Plaintiff's job. Plaintiff would not be able to complete these tasks without a reasonable accommodation.
2. Reasonable Accommodations
Having established that Plaintiff had to squat, kneel, make repetitive right hand motions, lift, push, and pull fifty-five pounds as part of her essential function as a housekeeper and that Plaintiff would need an "accommodation" to be a housekeeper, the Court next determines whether Defendant provided "reasonable accommodations" to Plaintiff.
Reasonable accommodations can include, (1) "making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities;" (2) job restructuring, which may include "reallocation or redistribution of non-essential job functions in a job with multiple responsibilities;" (3) "providing an alteration of when and/or how an essential function is [*15]  performed;" or (4) "providing a part-time or modified work schedule." Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(p)(2). FEHA does not obligate the employer to accommodate the employee by excusing him or her from the performance of essential functions. Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 375 (citation omitted).
As previously stated, Plaintiff testified that she could not perform the essential functions of a housekeeper with or without reasonable accommodation. (DUMF ¶ 10-11.) Thus, Defendant could not provide Plaintiff with a housekeeping position.
The next question is whether Defendant could accommodate Plaintiff through another position - either as a laundry assistant or in an entirely new position. It is undisputed that Defendant was able to accommodate Plaintiff's temporary work restrictions for sixty days. (PMF ¶ 4; DUMF ¶ 4.) Plaintiff contends that she could have remained as an employee at Marriott if Defendant had allowed her to continue performing the various tasks that she was assigned during her sixty-day temporary restriction period. Plaintiff further argues that she was given these various tasks within various departments throughout the hotel without having to apply, and expected the same when she was placed on permanent disability. Defendant responds that [*16]  Plaintiff is describing a list of tasks within various departments throughout the hotel and not a specific job position at the hotel. Defendant also contends that none of these accommodations are reasonable nor is the creation of another position, such as Plaintiff describes, obligatory. (DUMF ¶ 21.)
Defendant's position is the correct one. Under FEHA, the obligation to reassign a disabled employee who cannot otherwise be accommodated does "not require creating a new job, moving another employee, promoting the disabled employee, or violating another employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement." Hastings v. Department of Corrections, 110 Cal. App. 4th 963, 973, 2 Cal. Rptr. 3d 329 (Ct. App. 2003).
Defendant also is not obligated to reassign Plaintiff to the position of laundry assistant. (DUMF ¶ 9.) In Hastings, the defendants had given the plaintiff a conditional offer of employment as a correctional officer and placed Plaintiff on probation. Id. During the probationary period, the plaintiff sustained an injury that left him nearly immobile. Id. The plaintiff sought to be reassigned to a position that did not require physical mobility, such as a data entry position. Id. However, that position required "substantially different qualifications, duties, and tests of fitness [*17]  than the position of a correctional officer, and therefore falls into a different class." Id. at 974. The Hastings court ultimately denied the plaintiff's claim of discrimination under FEHA because the plaintiff sought accommodation by reassignment to a different position without demonstrating that he was qualified for that position. Id.
Here, much like Hastings, Plaintiff seeks to be reassigned as a laundry assistant, a position for which she is not qualified. The essential functions of a laundry assistant require Plaintiff to "stand, sit or walk for an extended period of time or for an entire work shift. Move lift, carry, push, pull and place objects weighing less than or equal to twenty-five pounds without assistance." DUMF ¶ 9.) However, Plaintiff could not lift more than fifteen pounds and could not bend herknee. Plaintiff testified that the tasks she was assigned to do in the laundry area consisted of hanging gowns on the hangers and separating the bed sheets from the towels and folding them.(Saracay Dep. 103:16-20) These tasks did not demonstrate that she could perform the essential functions of the laundry assistant position because the tasks did not require Plaintiff to lift more than [*18]  twenty-five pounds.
Plaintiff attempts to dispute this fact by arguing that she was willing to clean. She also asked if various laundromats were hiring. (PUMF ¶ 9.) Though Plaintiff may have been willing to apply to different laundromats and possibly clean, she still does not present facts to demonstrate that she would have been able to perform the essential functions of the position of laundry assistant. Instead, Plaintiff admits that she knew her permanent work restrictions would prohibit her from carrying out the essential functions of a laundry attendant at Marriott. (DUMF ¶ 9.) Thus, it is undisputed that Plaintiff could not have been reasonably accommodated by reassignment to a different position.
Plaintiff goes on to insist that an employer bears the burden of looking for a suitable reassignment position because they are in the most qualified position to be informed of job vacancies. Plaintiff is correct that an employee cannot necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself because "'[e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations [*19]  which employers have" Wysinger v. Automobile Club of Southern California, 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 425, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (Ct. App. 2007). Nevertheless, the employee must identify specific, available reasonable accommodations through the litigation process, and particularly by the time the parties have conducted discovery and reached the summary judgment stage. Id. Courts have more explicitly stated that the "burden of proving the availability of a reasonable accommodation rests on the employee." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal.App. 4th. 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (Ct. App. 2008).
Plaintiff has not carried this burden. In Nealy v. Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 375, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Ct. App. 2015) , for example, an employer informed an employee of vacant positions by telling him they "posted all open positions on the City's Web site." Id. at 369. The employer also encouraged the employee to "monitor the website and inform human resources if he was interested in any posted positions." Id. at 369. The employee applied but did not qualify for any vacant positions. The Court held that employee did not "adduce any such evidence here to dispute the City's evidence that no other vacant positions for which he was qualified existed." Id. at 377.
Here, much like Nealy, Defendant gave Plaintiff a list of jobs that it had open at the time of her termination. (DUMF ¶ 15) Plaintiff did not apply to any position nor did Plaintiff inform Defendant that she was interested in a specific vacant position. [*20]  Furthermore, undisputed evidence of Defendant's actions demonstrate that Marriott was willing to hire Plaintiff in a different position on the condition that Plaintiff satisfied the requirements of the position she was applying for. (Ganz Dec. ¶¶ 11-14, Ex. B and C.)
Ultimately, Plaintiff has not identified a position she is qualified for both at the time the interactive process took place and through the instant litigation process. Though Plaintiff suggested that she would have liked to be a laundry assistant, she was unqualified for this position. Furthermore, Plaintiff suggested that Defendant could create a new position for her, but Plaintiff still fails to identify a position for which she was qualified.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion with respect to Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination. Defendant shows that although Plaintiff suffered from a disability, Plaintiff could not perform the essential duties of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. Moreover, Plaintiff was not subject to an adverse employment action because of her disability but rather because she was not able to perform the essential functions of her job.
C. Failure to Provide [*21]  Reasonable Accommodation
The Court next analyzes Plaintiff's cause of action for Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation for her known physical disability. "The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are: (1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Ct. App. 2015).
As set forth in the prior section, Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a reasonable accommodation was available to Plaintiff and whether Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with that reasonable accommodation. See Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55, 68 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's cause of action related to Defendant's failure to provide reasonable accommodation.
D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Defendant next contends that Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process fails because Plaintiff does not identify a reasonable accommodation that should have been produced by the process. Moreover, Defendant points [*22]  out that Plaintiff did not apply to available positions at the hotel when she was invited to do so. The Court agrees with Defendant.
FEHA requires employers to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); see also Scotch v. Art Inst., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (Ct. App. 2009). "The 'interactive process' required by the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) is an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (quoting Wilson v. County of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1195, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (Ct. App. 2009)). Ritualized discussion are not required, but the interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and the employee. See id.
The employee must initiate the interactive process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious. Id. (citing Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)). "Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous." Id. (citing Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Assn., 239 F.3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001)). Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information [*23]  which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith. See Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n.22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1115 (9th Cir. 2000) ("[C]ourts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown [in the interactive process] and then assign responsibility so that liability . . . ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for that breakdown." (internal quotation marks omitted)), rev'd on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002).
"The availability of a reasonable accommodation (i.e., a modification or adjustment to the work place that enables an employee to perform the essential functions of the position held or desired) is necessary to a section 12940(n) claim " for failure to engage in the interactive process. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th. at 983. Furthermore, to prevail, "the employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." Scotch v. Art Institute of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th. 986, 1019, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (Ct. App. 2009).
In the instant case, Plaintiff claims that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants engaged in an interactive process because Defendants told Plaintiff that they "do not have anything for [her] in [her] position [*24]  due to [her] restrictions " without further information on the job list they provided for her. (DUMF ¶ 8; PMF ¶ 8.) Specifically, the issue is whether providing Plaintiff with a job list without further information is a good faith effort to continue the interactive process. Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to make multiple attempts for reassignment and failed to inquire with her physician whether her restriction was flexible enough to meet the physical requirements of any vacant positions. However, it is the Plaintiff's burden to demonstrate that the vacancies that Defendant provided on the job list could have allowed for a reassignment and that it would have allowed her to abide by her doctor's instructions. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th. at 1019.
Plaintiff does not carry her burden in this regard. Plaintiff's failure to apply to other positions obstructed the continuation of the interactive process. Defendant thus did not impede the interactive process. The Court, therefore, GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's interactive process cause of action.
E. Retaliation Claim
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because [*25]  the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). FEHA also clarifies that it is unlawful for an employer to "retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, Plaintiff must show: "(1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005).
Requesting an accommodation for a disability is a protected activity under an amendment to FEHA, made effective January 1, 2016. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2); see also Castro-Ramirez v. Dependable Highway Express, Inc., 2 Cal. App. 5th 1028, 1050, 207 Cal. Rptr. 3d 120 (Ct. App. 2016). Because termination is an adverse employment action, Plaintiff must only raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a causal link between her request for accommodation and her termination. Proximity in time between the employee's protected activity and the adverse employment action satisfies the employee's prima facie burden. Castro-Ramirez, 2 Cal. App. 5th at 1049-49 (citing McRae v. Dep't of Corrections & Rehabilitation, 142 Cal. App. 4th 377, 388, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313 (Ct. App. 2006)).
"Temporal proximity, although sufficient to shift the burden to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory [*26]  reason for the adverse employment action, does not, without more, suffice also to satisfy the secondary burden borne by the employee to show a triable issue of fact on whether the employer's articulated reason was untrue and pretextual." Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Internat., 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (Ct. App. 2007).
Thus, "if the employee successfully establishes these elements and thereby shows a prima facie case exists, the burden shifts to the employer to provide evidence that there was a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Morgan v. Regents of University of California, 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 68, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (Ct. App. 2000). When the employer produces evidence showing a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, "the presumption of retaliation ""drops out of the picture,"" (Yanowitz, supra ), and the burden shifts back to the employee to provide "substantial responsive evidence " that the employer's proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual. Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1735, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (Ct. App. 1994).
In the instant case, the issue is whether Plaintiff made a request for accommodations on May 16, 2016 or prior to January 1, 2016, when FEHA amended subdivision (m)(2). The interactive process began on December 30, 2014 when Defendants accommodated Plaintiff's temporary work restrictions. This interactive process continued until May 16, 2016 when Defendants and Plaintiff discussed her permanent work restrictions. [*27]  Thus, Plaintiff engaged in a protected activity.
Although there is proximity in time between Plaintiff's request for an accommodation and her ultimate termination, undisputed facts reveal that there was a legitimate and non-retaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment - Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job. Accordingly, because Plaintiff has not provided sufficient facts to survive summary judgment as to the underlying FEHA discrimination claim, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's cause of action for retaliation.
F. Failure to Prevent Discrimination or Retaliation
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination . . . from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). "The employer's duty to prevent harassment and discrimination is affirmative and mandatory." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 288, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 103 Cal. App. 4th 1021, 1035, 127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 285 (Ct. App. 2002)).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation must fail because Plaintiff cannot prove her underlying harassment, discrimination and retaliation claims. The Court agrees with this holding. Plaintiff has not carried her burden [*28]  to show that discrimination, harassment, and retaliation too place.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion as to Plaintiff's cause of action for failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.
G. Wrongful Termination
Termination of an employee constitutes a tort when it violates fundamental principles of public policy. Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 170, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980). To prove a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) the existence of an employer-employee relationship; (2) that the termination of plaintiff's employment was in violation of public policy; (3) that the termination of employment was a legal cause of Plaintiff's damages; and (4) the nature and the extent of plaintiff's damages. See Holmes v. Gen. Dynamics, Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1427 n.8, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (Ct. App. 1993). Violation of FEHA can serve as the basis for such a claim. See Acuna v. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co, 217 Cal. App. 4th 1402, 1420, 159 Cal. Rptr. 3d 749 (Ct. App. 2013) ("To the extent [the plaintiff] is able to prove the allegations of a timely [FEHA] retaliation claim, she also may be entitled to recover on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy prohibiting retaliatory terminations"); see also Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1159-61, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998). "[W]hen a plaintiff relies upon a statutory prohibition to support a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, [*29]  the common law claim is subject to statutory limitations affecting the nature and scope of the statutory prohibition . . . ." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original) (quoting Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 880, 904, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (Ct. App. 1997)).
If an employer did not violate FEHA, the employee's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy necessarily fails. See Esberg v. Union Oil Co. 28 Cal.4th 262, 272-273, 121 Cal. Rptr. 2d 203, 47 P.3d 1069 (2002). Accordingly, because Plaintiff has not provided sufficient facts to survive summary judgment as to the underlying FEHA discrimination claim, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to the wrongful termination cause of action.
H. Age discrimination
Because Plaintiff and her counsel stipulated to dismiss her cause of action for age discrimination, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to the age discrimination cause of action.
H. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
To prove intentional infliction of emotional distress, Plaintiff must show: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's [*30]  outrageous conduct. Daniel v. Wayans, 8 Cal. App. 5th 367, 400, 213 Cal. Rptr. 3d 865 (Ct. App. 2017). To be outrageous, the conduct must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. Id. However, there is no liability for mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. Id.
Here, Defendant did not engage in any conduct supporting the basis for the FEHA discrimination claim. Thus, Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim necessarily fails. The Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action.
I. Declaratory Judgement
The Court finally addresses the declaratory judgment cause of action. To fall within the Declaratory Judgment Act, "the case of actual controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests,' and it must be 'real and substantial and admi[t] of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts." MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2007). "The propriety of the application of summary judgment to declaratory relief lies in the trial court's function to render such a judgment [*31]  when only legal issues are presented for its determination." Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor & Assocs., 98 Cal. App. 4th 1388, 1401-02, 120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 392 (Ct. App. 2002) (citations, quotation marks, and formatting omitted). "The grant or denial of a permanent injunction rests within the trial court's sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion." Contra Costa Cnty. v. Pinole Point Props., LLC, 235 Cal. App. 4th 914, 925, 186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 109 (Ct. App. 2015). Injunctive relief will be denied if, "at the time of the order of judgment, there is no reasonable probability that the past acts complained of will recur . . . ." In re Tobacco Cases II, 240 Cal. App. 4th 779, 802, 192 Cal. Rptr. 3d 881 (Ct. App. 2015) (citation omitted).
Since declaratory judgement is predicated on Plaintiff's FEHA discrimination, reasonable accommodation, and retaliation claims, and Defendant prevails on its summary judgment motion with respect to these claims, the Court GRANTS the instant Motion with respect to Plaintiff's declaratory judgement cause of action. See Gafcon, 98 Cal. App. 4th at 1402 (stating that plaintiff is not entitled to declaratory relief if the undisputed facts do not support the premise for the relief).
IV. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement as to all of Plaintiff's causes of action. This case shall close. JS-6.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
