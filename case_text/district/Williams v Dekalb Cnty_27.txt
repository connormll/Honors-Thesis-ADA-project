UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Before the Court are the motions for summary judgment filed by Defendants DeKalb County, Georgia (hereinafter "DeKalb County"), and Dr. Joseph A. Hill (hereinafter "Dr. Hill"). [Docs. 193, 203].1 For the reasons below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motions be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

I. Introduction
This case involves a pro se Plaintiff who has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. He sues his former employer and a doctor contracted through a third party with his former employer, asserting various claims under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ("Title VII"), and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983. The nucleus of operative facts involves Plaintiff allegedly being pressured into retiring after complaining about an alleged government conspiracy based upon Plaintiff's beliefs that the FBI and GBI were trying to set him up to be fired. Plaintiff contends that after he refused the early retirement package, Defendants developed a scheme to force Plaintiff to take FMLA leave and then fire him. In this Order and R&R, the Court exercises its statutory duty to thoroughly examine the record and Plaintiff's allegations to determine if any [*3]  of his claims are fit for trial. To do this, the Court must separate Plaintiff's perceptions about misconduct directed at him from what evidence actually is in the record.

II. Facts
As required when considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court has viewed the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the nonmoving party. See United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). To the extent that material facts are in dispute, the Court has resolved the disputes in Plaintiff's favor. See Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F.3d 1323, 1326 n.1 (11th Cir. 2003). The facts of the case, for the purpose of adjudicating Defendants' motions for summary judgment, are as follows:2
Plaintiff was hired in February 1999 with the DeKalb County Marshal's Office ("DCMO") as a Deputy Marshal, Senior. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 1; Doc. 202-4 at 5).3 R. Steven Mann ("Mann") became DCMO Marshal in August 2004. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 4). In September 2004, Mann informed Plaintiff that the Deputy Marshal, Senior position requires employees to possess a Peace Officer Standard Training ("P.O.S.T.") certification and, because Plaintiff did not have P.O.S.T. certification, he was not qualified for the position of Deputy Marshal, Senior. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 5-6; Doc. 209-5 at 100). Plaintiff was given until May 2005 [*4]  to obtain P.O.S.T. certification in order to remain in the same classification, however, Plaintiff failed to obtain the certification. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 8; Doc. 209-5 at 100). In July 2005, Plaintiff was demoted to the position of Office Assistant Senior. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 9; Doc. 209-5 at 101).
On January 10, 2008, Plaintiff was reprimanded for accepting a gift card from a public vendor; Plaintiff maintained that he did not know that he received a gift card. (Doc. 202-4 at 72). At this point, Plaintiff began to express extreme fear of being fired from the DCMO. See id. Thus, on January 18, 2008, Plaintiff submitted a letter to DCMO stating that he was under surveillance by the FBI and GBI and that he was "being set up" to be fired. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 10; Pl. Resp. ¶ 10). On January 23, 2008, Mann was notified that Plaintiff was hospitalized at Meridian Healthcare in Gainesville, Florida. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 12; Doc. 202-4 at 72, 77). On January 24, 2008, Mann submitted a letter to DeKalb County's Human Resources Director to request that the Human Resources Department schedule a Fitness-for-Duty evaluation. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 11, 14; Doc. 202-4 at 72-73).
Plaintiff met with Dr. Hill, a psychologist contracted through [*5]  Cameron and Associates, Inc. ("CAI"), for a fitness-for-duty evaluation on February 1, 2008. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 16; Pl. Resp. ¶ 16). In a letter dated February 4, 2008, Dr. Hill wrote that Plaintiff appeared to exhibit symptoms suggestive of a psychiatric disorder, paranoid type, and Plaintiff was scheduled for an emergency psychiatric consult through Kaiser Permanente ("Kaiser"), where he was evaluated on February 3, 2008. Kaiser reported that Plaintiff was not a threat to himself or others, and both Kaiser and Dr. Hill recommended that Plaintiff return to work. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 18-20; Doc. 202-5 at 1-2).
In February 2009, Plaintiff voluntarily admitted himself to Peachford Behavioral Health's inpatient unit. He met with Dr. Hill after discharge, and Dr. Hill recommended that Plaintiff remain on leave from work. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 23-24; Doc. 202-5 at 3-4). Plaintiff met with Dr. Hill a couple of times in March 2009, and Dr. Hill continued to recommend that Plaintiff not return to work at that time. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 25-26; Doc. 202-5 at 5-6). On March 10, 2009, Plaintiff completed forms for FMLA leave, which were approved for requested leave from February 20, 2009 to April 6, 2009. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 29-31; [*6]  Doc. 202-5 at 13-14). On April 9, 2009, Dr. Hill recommended that Plaintiff return to work beginning April 13, 2009. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 34; Doc. 202-5 at 13-14).
In March 2010, Mann received memos from two of Plaintiff's supervisors advising that Plaintiff reported to them that the government was "still messing" with him. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 35-36; Doc. 202-5 at 15-16). One supervisor stated that that same morning, she received a call from the DeKalb County District Attorney's Office ("DA's Office"), and was told that Plaintiff reported to the DA's Office that the government was out to get him. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 37; Doc. 202-5 at 16). On March 10, 2010, Mann sent a letter to the Human Resources Director requesting that Human Resources schedule another fitness-for-duty evaluation. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 38-39; Doc. 202-5 at 22). Mann then placed Plaintiff on sick leave as of March 12, 2010, pending instructions from Dr. Hill. Mann also gave Plaintiff FMLA forms if needed. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 40-41; Doc. 202-5 at 23). Plaintiff signed the FMLA forms on March 12, 2010, requesting leave from March 12, 2010 through May 4, 2010. The requested leave was approved. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 44-45; Doc. 202-5 at 25-26).
In response to a [*7]  Health Care Provider Certification regarding Plaintiff's FMLA, on March 25, 2010, Kaiser reported that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of his job and the time frame for his return to work was unknown. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 48-49; Pl. Resp. ¶ 49).
Plaintiff was offered an early retirement package with an acceptance deadline of April 16, 2010. (See DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 51-53). Plaintiff discussed the early retirement package with Dr. Hill on numerous occasions and Dr. Hill reported these discussions to Mann. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 51, 52, 55). Plaintiff told Dr. Hill that he would accept the retirement package, and then opted not to accept it. (DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 52, 55).
On April 30, 2010, Kaiser recommended that Plaintiff be able to return to work with the restriction that Plaintiff be allowed time off work to attend treatment for 2.5 hours per day, 4 days per week for 5 weeks. [Doc. 202-5 at 40]. Also on April 30, 2010, Dr. Hill reported to Mann that it was not recommended that Plaintiff return to work. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 59; Doc. 202-5). That same day, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Mann requesting vacation time starting May 3, 2010 because Dr. Hill did not clear him to return to work, but Plaintiff [*8]  indicated that Kaiser cleared him to return to work with time to attend appointments. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 56; Pl. Resp. ¶ 56; Doc. 202-5 at 38). On May 3, 2010, Plaintiff wrote another letter to Mann requesting that he be allowed to use vacation time to allow him to attend medical appointments. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 60; Pl. Resp. ¶ 60). On May 5, 2010, Kaiser stated that Plaintiff could resume work on May 7, 2010, but that he needed to be allowed to attend Intensive Outpatient Treatment Monday through Thursday from 10:00 am until 12:30 pm each day for 4-5 weeks. [Doc. 209-6 at 113].
On May 11, Mann issued a letter to Plaintiff terminating his employment effective May 14, 2010. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 63; Pl. Resp. ¶ 63). The letter stated that neither the county physician, nor the specialist, i.e. Kaiser, cleared Plaintiff to return to work or identified a future date of when Plaintiff could return, but only that he should refrain from work until " 'further notice,' " and that further absence would cause undue hardship for the DCMO. (DCMO SOMF ¶ 64; Pl. Resp. ¶ 64; Doc. 209-4 at 129).
Plaintiff was 54 years old at the time of his discharge. (See DCMO SOMF ¶¶ 2; Pl. Resp. ¶ 2).

III. Summary Judgment Standard
"Summary [*9]  judgment is proper where 'the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.' " Tana v. Dantanna's, 611 F.3d 767, 772 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The movant carries the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The moving party may also meet its burden by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support an element of the case on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" [*10]  supporting the nonmovant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "[F]acts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id. If the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also EPL Inc. v. USA Fed. Credit Union, 173 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 1999); Duke v. Cleland, 884 F. Supp. 511, 514 (N.D. Ga. 1995). On the other hand, if the record presents disputed issues of material fact, the Court may not decide them; rather, it must deny the motion and proceed to trial. FindWhat Inv. Grp. v. FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Tullius v. Albright, 240 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2001)).

IV. Discussion4

A. Dr. Hill
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint makes several allegations pertaining to Dr. Hill. Mainly, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Hill conspired with Mann to coerce Plaintiff to accept the early retirement package. [See Doc. 64 ¶¶ 25, 31, 33, 38, 53, 57]. As examples of Dr. Hill's misconduct, Plaintiff alleges [*11]  that Dr. Hill disclosed confidential information about Plaintiff to Mann, [see id. ¶¶ 58, 71,81],5 told Plaintiff that his kids would suffer if Plaintiff did not take the retirement package, [id. ¶ 38], and ordered Plaintiff to take the retirement package or they (DCMO) would fire him, [id. ¶ 53]. Plaintiff further alleges that as part of the scheme, in March and April 2010, Dr. Hill was to control Plaintiff's mind and not allow Plaintiff to come back to work once Plaintiff was out of FMLA leave time. [Id. ¶ 57]. Plaintiff also alleges that Dr. Hill took advantage of his mental illness and harassed and intimidated Plaintiff into writing a letter to the pension board to obtain a pension he did not want. [Id. ¶¶ 124, 126]. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Mann and Dr. Hill both told Plaintiff that Dr. Hill was employed by DeKalb County. [Id. ¶ 130].
In his motion, Dr. Hill argues that he is an independent contractor employed by CAI and has no individual liability under Title VII. [Doc. 203 at 29]. Dr. Hill also argues that Plaintiff's § 1983 claim fails because Plaintiff cannot prove that Dr. Hill was acting under color of state law by performing a fitness-for-duty evaluation. [Id. at 30]. Dr. [*12]  Hill further argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that Dr. Hill was Plaintiff's employer under any of the statutes Plaintiff claims he suffered discrimination. [Id.]. Dr. Hill also contends that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because Plaintiff only cited discrimination based on retaliation, age, and disability and Plaintiff did not list any Title VII claims. [Id. at 31]. Finally, Dr. Hill argues that Plaintiff did not allege in any pleading that Dr. Hill retaliated against him. [Id. at 31-32].
In his response, Plaintiff reiterated his allegations from the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff argued that Dr. Hill told Plaintiff that he was an employee of DeKalb County just like Plaintiff. [Doc. 209 ¶¶ 51, 151]. Plaintiff asked Dr. Hill many times not to tell Mann about his mental health issues and Dr. Hill promised Plaintiff that he would not tell and they also had a contract to this effect. [Id. ¶¶ 56, 90, 103]. Dr. Hill breached the contract because Dr. Hill told Mann about Plaintiff's mental health issues. [Id. ¶ 56]. Plaintiff further argues that Dr. Hill forced and pressured Plaintiff to sign one of the FMLA forms with a date of March 12, 2010 when the date was really [*13]  March 25, 2010. [Id. ¶ 62 (citing Doc. 209-4 at 1, 2)]. He claims that Dr. Hill along with DeKalb County tried to coerce him into retiring by ordering him to accept the retirement package. [Id. ¶¶ 70, 71, 103]. Plaintiff contends that Dr. Hill was part of a scheme with Mann, his supervisor Rebecca Wilkerson, and DeKalb County CEO W. Burrell Ellis to retaliate against him for not accepting the retirement package by not allowing Plaintiff to return to work at the end of his FMLA leave. [Id. ¶¶ 81, 82, 162].
Dr. Hill did not file a reply brief. [See Dkt.].
As DeKalb County also raised the argument that Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies under Title VII, [see Doc. 193-1 at 19], the Court first addresses this argument.

1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
In a previous R&R on Defendants' motions to dismiss, the Court addressed DeKalb County's argument that Plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his claims of discrimination based on race and gender. [Doc. 47 at 15- 18, adopted [Doc. 51]]. In the R&R, although the undersigned recognized that Plaintiff did not check the boxes for race and gender in his EEOC charge, the Court found that Plaintiff [*14]  made these allegations in his supplemental filing and that these supplemental responses relate back to the original filing of the EEOC charge. [Doc. 47 at 16-17 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1601.12(b); Kelly v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 457 Fed. Appx. 804, 805 (11th Cir. Dec. 5, 2011))]. The undersigned noted that DeKalb County did not discuss (likely because it had not yet been served with) Plaintiff's supplemental filing, nor did it discuss whether the later filing should relate back to the original charge. [Id. at 17]. Thus, the Court found that those claims could proceed as dismissal on untimeliness grounds was not appropriate at the motion-to-dismiss-stage of the proceedings. [Id., adopted [Doc. 51]].
Here, again, none of the Defendants addressed the later filing or even the Court's finding regarding the exhaustion of administrative remedies. [See Doc. 193-1 at 19-20; Doc. 203 at 31]. Therefore, the undersigned sees no reason to disregard its prior recommendation and RECOMMENDS that Defendants' motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII claims be denied on the basis of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

2. Individual Liability
As the Court found in its prior R&R, Title VII, the ADA and the ADEA impose no individual liability as individuals are not classified as employers [*15]  under these statutes. [See Doc. 47 at 10 (citing Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 830 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that Title VII, the ADEA and the ADA do not "countenance individual liability"), adopted [Doc. 51]]. Therefore, the Court RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be GRANTED to Dr. Hill on Plaintiff's claims against him under Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA.
The undersigned also found that public officials in their individual capacities are not "employers" under the FMLA and that, as a result, there is no individual liability of public officials under the FMLA. [Id. (citing Wascura v. Carver, 169 F.3d 683, 684 (11th Cir. 1999)]. In this case, Dr. Hill is not a public official and thus Wascura does not apply. While Dr. Hill makes the argument that he has no individual liability under Title VII, Dr. Hill fails to address the scope of his liability under the FMLA (or any other statute for that matter). Dr. Hill only makes the bald assertion that "under no set of facts articulated by Plaintiff in his Complaint or other pleadings can the Plaintiff prove that Dr. Hill is the employer under any of the statutes Plaintiff alleges he was discriminated under." [Doc. 203 at 30]. Dr. Hill cites Calhoun v. EPS Corp., 36 F. Supp. 3d 1344 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (Batten, J.), and Argo v. Gregory, No. CV 212-213, 2014 WL 4467268 (S.D. Ga. 2014), for the proposition that only "employers" are prohibited from discriminating against employees. [*16]  [Doc. 203 at 30-31]. Although neither of these cases are relevant to the scope of individual liability, the Court agrees that "employers" are prohibited from discriminating against employees under the FMLA. However, the term "employer" under the FMLA is quite expansive.
The FMLA holds liable an employer "who interferes with or denies any rights provided to an employee" under the FMLA. Wascura, 169 F.3d at 685 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)). An employer is defined as "any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs 50 or more employees for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(4)(A)(i). However, the definition of employer also includes, in relevant part, "any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(4)(A)(ii)(I).
Thus, an individual can be an "employer" under the FMLA. See Wascura, 169 F.3d at 686 (finding that FLSA's definition of employer is equivalent to FMLA and recognizing that under the FLSA, an individual can be an "employer"); but see Hurley v. Kent of Naples, Inc., 746 F.3d 1161, 1163 n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) (noting that the Eleventh Circuit has never specifically held that a private employee is individually liable under the FMLA, but recognizing that other [*17]  circuits have, and citing Darby v. Bratch, 287 F.3d 673, 681 (8th Cir. 2002)). Courts have found that for an individual to qualify as an employer under the FMLA, the person must have the ability to control in whole or in part the employee's ability to take leave under the Act or return to his position. Johnson v. A.P. Products, Ltd., 934 F. Supp. 625, 629 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting Freemon v. Foley, 911 F. Supp. 326, 331 (N.D. Ill. 1995); Santiago v. Dep't of Transp., No. 3:12CV132 JBA, 2014 WL 4823869, at *10 (D. Conn. Sept. 25, 2014) (citing Rupnow v. TRC, Inc., 999 F. Supp. 1047, 1048 (N.D. Ohio 1998)); cf. Perez v. Cellco Partnership, No. 8:12-cv-546-T-30TGW, 2012 WL 2451218, at * 1 (M.D. Fla. June 27, 2012) (finding that where plaintiff failed to provide allegations describing private employee's role with respect to plaintiff's FMLA requests or how an email to the employee related to plaintiff's termination, plaintiff failed to establish that private employee had exercised sufficient control to warrant individual liability under the FMLA); see also Rubin v. Tourneau, Inc., 797 F. Supp. 247, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (construing 29 U.S.C. § 2001(2), which contains the same definition of "employer" as the FMLA, to reach any individual who "exerts some degree of control over the employer's compliance with [the statute]").
While corporate officers and supervisors under certain circumstances can be found individually liable under the FMLA, see Wascura, 169 F.3d at 686 (recognizing that under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), which contains materially the same definition of "employer" as the FMLA, an individual could be an employer); Patel v. Wargo, 803 F.2d 632, 638 (11th Cir. 1986) (discussing liability under the FLSA); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.104(d), the Eleventh Circuit has not yet ruled on whether an employee - or [*18]  independent contractor - who is not Plaintiff's supervisor can be found liable under the Act. Hurley, 746 F.3d at 1163 n.1. However, Dr. Hill has failed to argue one way or the other as to whether he can be found individually liable under FMLA, instead generally arguing that FMLA does not provide a situation where an individual can be held liable.6
"Although Plaintiff bears the ultimate burden at trial of demonstrating that Defendant is his employer, it is crucial to bear in mind that, at the summary judgment stage, it is Defendant who has the burden to prove that there is no dispute of relevant fact and that Plaintiff will not be able to prove that Defendant is his employer as a matter of law." Coleman v. FFE Transp. Servs., Inc., Civil Action No. 3:12-CV-1697-B, 2013 WL 1914932, at *5 (N.D. Tex. May 9, 2013) (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24). Defendant Hill has not presented sufficient evidence or law to show that Plaintiff cannot prove he is not Plaintiff's employer as a matter of law. To the contrary, the evidence shows that DCMO requested that Dr. Hill perform a fitness-for-duty evaluation; Dr. Hill sent numerous and detailed letters and emails to Mann regarding Plaintiff's condition and fitness to return to work, [see Doc. 209-5 at 104-119]; and Dr. Hill knew that Mann relied on his opinion in evaluating whether Plaintiff could return from leave. [*19]  Mann also sent a letter to Plaintiff that refers to Dr. Hill as the "County physician." [Doc. 209-4 at 129]. Moreover, the letters Dr. Hill wrote to Mann show that Dr. Hill had what can be perceived to be a peculiar interest in whether Plaintiff accepted the retirement package, providing detailed information on Plaintiff's plans to accept or reject the retirement package. [See Doc. 209-5 at 65, 104, 105, 107-108]. Most importantly, Dr. Hill recommended that Plaintiff not be allowed to return to work at the end of his leave even though the specialist at Kaiser recommended that he be allowed to return to work with restrictions. [Doc. 209-5 at 110]. An inference can be made that Dr. Hill, for the interest of DCMO, recommended that Plaintiff not be able to return to work after his leave ended, thus preventing reinstatement. Cf. Haybarger v. Lawrence Cnty. Adult Probation and Parole, 667 F.3d 408, 418-19 (3d Cir. 2012) (holding that supervisor was FMLA employer where defendant recommended plaintiff's dismissal as being " 'in the best interest of' " probation department and exercised substantial authority over termination decision even if he lacked final authority to dismiss plaintiff).
Plaintiff has not made a showing that Dr. Hill was his employer under any other statute he has [*20]  sued upon, and thus the undersigned RECOMMENDS that all claims against Dr. Hill be DISMISSED except Plaintiff's claims under the FMLA. The merits of Plaintiff's FMLA claim will be discussed below.

B. DeKalb County
In its motion for summary judgment, DeKalb County argues that summary judgment should be granted to it on Plaintiff's claims for FMLA, ADA, and ADEA because Plaintiff was an employee of the DCMO which is part of the State Court of DeKalb County and thus the DCMO is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. [Doc. 193-1 at 9-12, 13, 22]. On the merits of Plaintiff's claims, DCMO argues that Plaintiff has not presented tangible evidence to prove interference, restraint or denial of his FMLA rights, [id. at 12], and that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination under either the ADA or the ADEA, [id. at 14-17, 22-23]. As to Plaintiff's Title VII claims, DCMO argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case for race discrimination because he has failed to identify a comparator, [id. at 18-19]; Plaintiff's gender discrimination claim is time-barred because Plaintiff made no allegation of sex or gender discrimination in his EEOC charge, [id. at 20]; and Plaintiff cannot [*21]  make out a prima facie case for retaliation, [id. at 20-22]. Finally, DCMO argues that summary judgment should be granted on Plaintiff's § 1983 claims because Plaintiff has no evidence to show that DeKalb County had an official policy or custom of discrimination based on race. [Id. at 23-24].

1. Eleventh Amendment Immunity
DCMO argues that it is an extension of the State Court of DeKalb County because the court was given the authority to appoint marshals and deputy marshals "to hold office during the pleasure of the appointing judge." [Doc. 193-1 at 9-10 (quoting 1951 Ga. Laws 2408-09)]. DCMO contends that because Plaintiff was an Office Assistant, Senior in the DCMO, his employer was a state court. [Id. at 10]. DCMO argues that, significantly, Plaintiff was not subject to the personnel code rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Commissioners of DeKalb County. [Id.]. However, DCMO admits that merit system forms utilized by DeKalb County Human Resources and Merit System were used as a convenience for processing personnel matters. [Id.].
In his response, Plaintiff argues that he was hired by DeKalb County Government in 1999 and placed in the Marshal's Office because he applied through DeKalb County for an Administrative Assistant [*22]  position using an application provided by DeKalb County, and further, that DCMO has its own applications which are for deputies only. [Doc. 209 ¶¶ 34, 37, 171]. Plaintiff argues that DeKalb County would not produce a copy of his employment application during discovery which would show that he was hired by DeKalb County. [Id.]. Plaintiff cites to other forms in the record used by DeKalb County to demonstrate that DeKalb County was his employer. [Id. (citing Doc. 209-4 at 152; Doc. 209-5 at 63-64)]. Plaintiff also argues that it was DeKalb County, not DCMO, that offered him the retirement pension and DeKalb County sent Plaintiff his pension refund. [Id. ¶ 70 (citing Doc. 209-4 at 170)]. Plaintiff further suggests that DeKalb County had some control over his employment, especially when it came to promotions and demotions, but acknowledges that it did not have final say in hiring and firing in the DCMO. [See Doc. 209 ¶ 33]. Plaintiff's response also makes a reference to evidence, [see Doc. 209-5 at 97], to show that Mann was required to report his involuntary demotion to DeKalb County. [Doc. 209 ¶ 38].
DeKalb County did not file a reply brief.
The Eleventh Amendment shields states and "arms of the state" [*23]  from being sued by citizens. Regents of Univ. Of Calif. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 430 (1997). "Eleventh Amendment protection does not, however, extend to mere political subdivisions of a State such as counties or municipalities, even if the counties and municipalities exercise a 'slice of State power.' " Davis v. Durham Mental Health Developmental Disabilities Substance Abuse Area Auth., 320 F. Supp. 2d 378, 392-93 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (quoting Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 401 (1979)); see also Stewart v. Baldwin Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 908 F.2d 1499, 1509 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing Mt. Healthy Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280 (1977)). In determining whether a particular entity is an arm of the state, the Court must look to the factors set out in Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc): "1) how state law defines the entity; 2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; 3) where the entity derives its funds; and 4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity." Pellitteri v. Prine, 776 F.3d 777, 779 (11th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations omitted). The recent case of Pellitteri examined each of the factors to determine whether a county sheriff acted as an arm of the state and thus would be entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. Id. In holding that the sheriff there was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Eleventh Circuit reaffirmed its holding in Manders, removing any doubts created by the unpublished decision of Keene v. Prine, 477 Fed. Appx. 575 (11th Cir. May 15, 2012) (per curiam). The Court finds its analysis of the sheriff's office to be particularly useful in determining whether the DCMO is due the same Eleventh Amendment protection.7

a. How State Law Defines the Entity
In looking at the first Manders factor, the Eleventh Circuit found [*24]  this factor to weigh in favor of viewing the sheriff's office to be an arm of the state. Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 780. The Eleventh Circuit found that " 'the essential governmental nature' of each sheriff's office in Georgia is to (1) 'enforce the law and preserve the peace on behalf of the sovereign State' and (2) 'to perform specific statutory duties, directly assigned by the State, in law enforcement, in state courts, and in corrections.' " Id. (quoting Manders, 338 F.3d at 1312; Ga. Const. art. IX, § 1, ¶ III(a)). Thus, the court concluded that sheriffs were only "county officers" in that they have a limited geographic location. Id. The Eleventh Circuit also reiterated its point that " 'sheriffs in Georgia derive their power and duties from the State, are controlled by the State, and counties cannot, and do not, delegate any law enforcement power or duties to sheriffs.' " Id. (quoting Manders, 338 F.3d at 1313). The court noted that Georgia's constitution expressly prohibits counties from controlling or affecting the sheriff's office or its personnel, id. (citing Ga. Const. art. IX, § 2, ¶ I(c)(1)), and "also grants the state legislature the exclusive authority to establish and control a sheriff's powers and duties." Id. (citing Ga. Const. art. IX, § 1, ¶ III(a)-(b)). Finally the court found that the sheriff's authority to employ personnel is derived from [*25]  the state because (1) "[t]he Georgia legislature has enacted laws giving sheriffs alone the power to hire their deputies, independent of any influence from county governments," (citing O.C.G.A. § 15-16-23), and (2) deputies are considered employees of the sheriff and not the county. Id.
Looking to Georgia law in the case at bar, the legislature established the State Court of DeKalb County in 1951, and granted judges the power to appoint a marshal and deputy marshals in the judges' discretion "to hold office during the pleasure of the appointing judge." 1951 Ga. Laws 2401, 2408-2409; 1960 Ga. Laws 2166, 2171. The marshal and deputy marshals of the State Court of DeKalb County "have the same powers, duties, and authority as constables of justice courts and sheriffs of this State," however, such powers are limited by the subject matter of the court. 1960 Ga. Laws 2171. Given that marshals are appointed by a judge of the State Court; have the same powers, duties and authorities of sheriffs; and act to serve in the interest of the State Court of DeKalb County, the Court finds this factor to weigh in favor of immunity.

b. Degree of Control the State Maintains Over the Entity
The Manders court explored whether Georgia sheriffs "act as an 'arm of the State' when setting force policies at [*26]  their jails and training and disciplining their deputies in that regard." Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 781 (citing Manders, 338 F.3d at 1308- 09). Manders and Pellitteri concluded "that the State of Georgia exercises substantial control over a sheriff's personnel decisions, especially in the hiring and firing of deputies" because Georgia laws require that sheriffs attend specialized training including "corrections practices," and the Governor has the power to investigate and suspend sheriffs for misconduct in the performance of their duties. Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 781; Manders, 338 F.3d at 1308-09, 1320. Moreover, Pellitteri found that the state exercised great control over the hiring and firing of deputies as it is state law that provides the requirements for peace officers, including deputy sheriffs. Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 781 (citing O.C.G.A. § 35-8-8). Thus, Pellitteri found that the "threshold requirements for serving as a peace officer in Georgia significantly limit a sheriff's discretion when hiring potential deputies." Id. Moreover, the Georgia legislature, through laws, created a P.O.S.T. Council to discipline peace officers, including deputies, for misconduct. Id. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit found that a sheriff's ability to hire and fire his deputies is subject to significant oversight by the State and thus the second Manders factor weighed in favor of immunity. Id. at 781, 782.
The Court notes [*27]  that both Pellitteri and Manders focused on the sheriff's ability to hire and fire deputies, not administrative personnel. While the evidence does show that Plaintiff was hired as a Deputy Marshal, Senior, [Doc. 202-4 at 5], the issues here concern Plaintiff's position as an Office Assistant, Senior. [Doc. 209-5 at 1, 101]. Although the manner in which the marshal and deputy marshals are governed by Georgia law, Georgia law is silent as to administrative personnel for both marshals and sheriffs. For instance, it is Plaintiff's contention that he was hired by DeKalb County and placed in the DCMO and suggests that the marshal only has the power to directly hire deputy marshals. [See Doc. 209 ¶ 34]. Plaintiff also suggests that, with the exception of hiring and firing, DeKalb County approved personnel matters such as promotions and demotions and that Mann had to report Plaintiff's involuntary demotion to DeKalb County. [Id. ¶ 33]. Plaintiff also cites a letter from Mann to DeKalb County Human Resources Director Joe Stone requesting a demotion pursuant to § 20-126 of the DeKalb County Code. [Id. ¶ 38 (citing Doc. 209-5 at 97)].
Moreover, Plaintiff's claims that his FMLA rights were violated. The evidence demonstrates that Mann, as marshal, [*28]  did not have the authority to grant or deny FMLA, but could only recommend to DeKalb County Human Resources that FMLA be granted or denied, and that DeKalb County has final approval. [See, e.g., Docs. 202-5 at 8, 209-4 at 133, Doc. 209-5 at 68]. Moreover, DeKalb County performs all of the inquiries to make an informed decision as to whether to grant or deny FMLA requests. [See, e.g., Docs. 202-5 at 9-10, 209-5 at 23-24, 67].
On the other hand, the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment appears to be Mann's alone, [see Doc. 209-4 at 129], and Plaintiff's Separation Notice is a form from the State of Georgia, not DeKalb County, [Doc. 209-4 at 134]. His pay stub near the time of his termination also reflects that the Department he worked for was the "State Court Marshal." Most importantly, the Court must answer "the 'key question' of the Manders function-by-function inquiry, which 'is not what . . . powers [marshals] have, but for whom [marshals] exercise that power." Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 782 (emphasis in original). Thus, as in Pellitteri, the Court finds that administrative personnel, like deputies, are there to "assist [marshals] in executing their own duties, which have been delegated to them by the State." Id. Thus, [*29]  the State maintains a great deal of control as Plaintiff, while an administrative assistant, was there to assist the State Court. See id. Therefore, the Court finds that the second Manders factor also weighs in favor of immunity.

c. Where the Entity Derives Its Funds
Like the sheriff's office, it appears that the marshal's office derives its funds from the county. See Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 782. While the Court did not find any mention of which entity funds the marshal's budget, the Court notes that the salary of the marshal and chief deputy marshal are specifically set by the state of Georgia with "[s]aid salaries to be paid out of the treasury of the DeKalb County as an expense of the court." 1957 Ga. Laws 3322 (emphasis added); 1960 Ga. Laws 2166, 2170; 1961 Ga. Laws 2461, 2463; 1963 Ga. Laws 3613, 3614; see 1976 Ga. Laws 3488, 3489. While it is not clear whether counties set the budget for the marshal's office, it appears to be within the authority of the appointing judge to determine the number of deputy marshals, thus suggesting that the court sets the budget. 1951 Ga. Laws 2408-09; 1960 Ga. Laws 2171. Because the salaries of marshals are considered an expense of the state court and the state court also determines the needs of support to the marshal, the Court finds that the third Manders factor weighs in favor of immunity.

d. Liability for and Payment of Adverse Judgments [*30] 
While the "impetus" for immunity under the Eleventh Amendment was the " 'prevention of federal-court judgments that must be paid out of State's treasury,' " Pellitteri, 776 F.3d at 782-83 (quoting Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 48 (1994)), "the fourth Manders factor alone is not necessarily dispositive in any given case." Id. at 783 n.3. Again, there is no clear indication of whether the state would be responsible for the judgment, but based on the above analysis, all signs point to the county treasury being liable for the judgment, but it would come at the expense of the state court. See 1960 Ga. Laws 2170. While the State's coffers will not necessarily be used to pay the judgment, it appears that the State Court of DeKalb County will suffer as the judgment will be at its expense. Such a likely result goes against the spirit of the Eleventh Amendment as its purpose is to protect an "arm of the state." See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280; see also Manders, 338 F.3d at 1328. Therefore, the Court finds that the fourth Manders factor also weighs in favor of immunity.
As all four Manders factors weigh in favor of immunity, the Court concludes that the DCMO is an arm of the state and is thus entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.
As the undersigned briefly noted in its earlier R&R, [Doc. 47 at 21-22], Eleventh Amendment immunity is applicable to claims for money damages under the ADA, ADEA, and FMLA. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 (2001) (holding that Congress did not validly [*31]  abrogate states' sovereign immunity for private suits seeking money damages under Title I of the ADA); Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 91 (2000) (holding that the ADEA did not validly abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity); Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Md., 132 S. Ct. 1327, 1338 (2012) (Congress did not validly abrogate States' Eleventh Circuit immunity for the "self-care" provision of the FMLA). Although Plaintiff also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, such relief is obtainable against a State if such claims were brought against state actors in their official capacities pursuant to Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Garrett, 531 U.S. at 374 n.9; State Police for Automatic Retirement Ass'n v. DiFava, 317 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2003). Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's FMLA, ADA, and ADEA claims be DISMISSED against DeKalb County.8

2. Title VII

a. Legal Framework
Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII also makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for his participation in certain statutorily protected activities:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against [*32]  any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because [she] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a); see also Biniashvili v. Bohne, 397 Fed. Appx. 597, 598-99 (11th Cir. Sept. 28, 2010).
A plaintiff asserting a discrimination claim can support his claim either by direct or circumstantial evidence. EEOC v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002). If direct evidence of intentional discrimination does not exist or is insufficient, a plaintiff may offer circumstantial evidence, using the framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Lawver v. Hillcrest Hospice, Inc., 300 Fed. Appx. 768, 772 (11th Cir. Nov. 24, 2008) (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1331 (11th Cir. 1998)).
This framework requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and then the burden shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action it took. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason was pretextual. The plaintiff can establish pretext by showing that the employer's non-discriminatory reason should not be believed, or, when considering all the evidence, that it is more likely that the discriminatory reasons motivated the decision than the employer's proffered reasons.
Lawver, 300 Fed. Appx. at 772 (citations omitted).
"The methods [*33]  of presenting a prima facie case are flexible and depend on the particular situation." Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004)). Generally speaking, to satisfy a prima facie case for discrimination based on circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) he was replaced by a person outside his protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside his protected class." Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003) (recognized by Connelly v. Metro. Atlanta Rapid Transit Auth., 764 F.3d 1358, 1364 (11th Cir. 2014)).9
Regarding pretext,
A plaintiff is not allowed to recast an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute his business judgment for that of the employer. Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and he cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.
Alvarez, 610 F.3d at 1265-66 (quoting Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff " 'must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination.' " Brooks v. Cnty. Comm'n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1228 (11th Cir. 1993)). In other words, a plaintiff "must demonstrate [*34]  'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Alvarez, 610 F.3d at 1265 (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)).

b. Race Discrimination10
DeKalb County appears to acknowledge that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class, suffered an adverse employment action, and was qualified to do the job; however, DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish that DCMO treated similarly situated employees outside his class more favorably. [Doc. 193-1 at 18]. Specifically, DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff has failed to identify any comparator whatsoever, much less one that is similarly situated in all relevant aspects. [Id.]. DeKalb County further argues that even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case for race discrimination, DCMO had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the termination and Plaintiff has not offered evidence to show that the reason provided by DCMO was pretext for intentional race discrimination. [Id. at 19].
In his response, Plaintiff generally argues that he was punished more severely than his white co-workers, [Doc. 209 ¶ 4], paid substantially [*35]  less than his white co-workers, [id. ¶ 5], and denied pay increases because of his race, [id. ¶ 8]. Plaintiff also alleges that he was replaced by Virginia Mathis, a white female. [Id. ¶¶ 47, 121]. Plaintiff's response specifically identifies four white male coworkers, Richardson, Palmer, Dankawich, and Quas,11 who were allowed to leave work early and receive the full eight hours pay, but Plaintiff argues that he was not allowed to do so. [Id. ¶ 125]. Plaintiff also alleges that Richardson, Palmer, Quas, and Matthews, who Plaintiff identifies as being all white male and one white female, were allowed to work overtime, while Plaintiff was not. [Id. ¶ 126]. Plaintiff further alleges that Mann promoted Dankawich12 and Lewis, where as Plaintiff was demoted, and Mann allowed Richardson, Palmer, and Quas to get reduced priced or free food at restaurants, but Plaintiff was written up for receiving a gift card. [Id.].
As DeKalb County points out, the only adverse employment action that occurred within 180 days of Plaintiff's EEOC filing was his termination, which also is the only adverse action Plaintiff complains of in his EEOC charge. [Doc. 193-1 at 18 (citing Doc. 202)]; 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). To the extent that [*36]  Plaintiff alleges discrimination based on his 2005 demotion or the 2008 disciplinary proceeding for receiving a gift card, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's summary judgment motion be GRANTED because they are untimely asserted. Plaintiff also does not allege any dates of when he was denied the right to work overtime or leave early but still receive full pay. Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff alleges discrimination based on these claims, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's summary judgment motion as to Plaintiff's claims for discriminatory withholding of overtime and early leave be GRANTED.
The Court concludes, however, that Plaintiff has satisfied the prima facie case for race discrimination based upon his discharge. Plaintiff has shown, and DeKalb County does not dispute, that Plaintiff was replaced by a person outside his race. [Doc. 64 ¶ 97; Doc. 209 ¶¶ 47, 121]. Thus, the Court proceeds to consider the remaining factors in the McDonnell-Douglas paradigm.
DeKalb County argues that DCMO had legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Plaintiff, but those reasons are not stated anywhere in the summary judgment motion. [See Docs. 193, 193-1, passim [*37] ]. From what the Court gathers from reviewing DeKalb County's summary judgment motion as to Plaintiff's other claims, DCMO's reason for terminating Plaintiff was that he exhausted his FMLA and no doctor cleared him to return to work or provided a date certain that he could return to duty, thus creating an undue burden on DCMO to allow him continued absences. [See Doc. 193-1 at 1, 7-8, 19; Doc. 209-4 at 134 (separation notice indicating that the reason for termination was "exhaustion of FMLA"); Doc. 209-4 at 129 (termination letter from Mann to Plaintiff)]. That latter letter stated as follows in relevant part,
The County physician then referred you to a specialist for further evaluation of your fitness for duty. Neither of these doctors cleared you to return to duty now or identified a future date when you could return to duty. Both said you would need to refrain from work until "further notice."
Unfortunately, further absence from your job position would cause undue hardship of the Marshal's office.
[Doc. 209-4 at 129]. However, Plaintiff presents evidence that at the end of his FMLA leave, he was cleared to return to work by the specialists at Kaiser. [Doc. 209-4 at 140; Doc. 209-6 at [*38]  113]. While the return came with the restrictions that Plaintiff be allowed to attend outpatient therapy for 2.5 hours per day, 4 days per week, DeKalb County does not address these restrictions in its motion or supporting brief, nor is there evidence that DCMO considered this or used this as a basis for discharging Plaintiff. Instead, DeKalb County argues that no doctor cleared him to return to work, which the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, suggests is not correct. Thus, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether DeKalb County presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims for discriminatory discharge based on racial discrimination under Title VII be DENIED.13

c. Gender Discrimination
Next, DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff's claim for gender discrimination is time-barred because Plaintiff did not make an allegation of sex or gender discrimination in his EEOC charge. [Doc. 193-1 at 20]. As discussed in section IV.A.1.,  [*39] supra, summary judgment on this issue is due to be DENIED as DeKalb County failed to discuss the later amended filing that related back to the filing of the EEOC charge.
Notwithstanding, DeKalb County argues that the DCMO has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination and Plaintiff has failed to establish pretext.14 [Doc 193-1 at 20]. However, as discussed above in section IV.B.2.b, DeKalb County also has failed to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether DeKalb County had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination.15
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII gender discrimination claim be DENIED.

d. Retaliation
DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the first element of a prima facie claim for retaliation because there is no evidence that Plaintiff opposed practices made unlawful under Title VII or participated in any activity protected by Title VII. [Doc. 193-1 at 21]. DeKalb County argues that, although Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges that he complained to the DeKalb County District Attorney's [*40]  office about discrimination in March 2010, the record does not reflect that any of Plaintiff's communications with the District Attorney's office were about discrimination, but instead were about Plaintiff's perceived government conspiracy against him. [Id.]. Moreover, DeKalb County argues, even if Plaintiff did make claims of discrimination to the District Attorney's office, there is no evidence in the record that the DCMO was aware of any such claims. [Id]. It further argues that even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case of retaliation, DCMO presented a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Plaintiff's termination.
In Plaintiff's response, Plaintiff argues that he complained to the District Attorney's office about the discrimination and was fired because of it. [Doc. 209 ¶¶ 108, 140, 174].
Under the anti-retaliation clause of Title VII, it is an unlawful employment practice "for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter." [*41]  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). The Supreme Court recently held that a plaintiff must demonstrate that his protected activity was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment decision. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S.    ,    , 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2534 (2013); see also Smith v. Ft. Pierce, Fla., 565 Fed. Appx. 774, 778 (11th Cir. April 30, 2014); Mealing v. Ga. Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 564 Fed. Appx. 421, 426-27, (11th Cir. April 23, 2014).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in an activity protected under Title VII, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the two. See Mealing, id.; see also Dixon v. The Hallmark Cos., Inc., 627 F.3d 849, 856 (11th Cir. 2010); Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., 234 F.3d 501, 507 (11th Cir. 2000); Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1566. To satisfy the first element, a plaintiff need not prove the underlying claim of discrimination that led to his protected activity; it is sufficient if he had "a reasonable good faith belief that the discrimination existed." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam); see also Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328 ("[I]t is sufficient that an employee have a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that his activity is protected by the statute."). Statutorily protected activity "includes internal complaints of discrimination to superiors, as well as complaints lodged with the EEOC and discrimination-based lawsuits." Gerard v. Bd. of Regents of State of Ga., 324 Fed. Appx. 818, 825 (11th Cir. April 24, 2009). As for the second element, a materially adverse action is one that " 'well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.' " Reeves v. DSI Sec. Servs., Inc., 395 Fed. Appx. 544, 547 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2010) (quoting Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68 (2006)). Regarding [*42]  the third element, causation, the Eleventh Circuit has explained as follows:
A plaintiff establishes a causal connection by showing that the relevant decision-maker was "aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated." Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecomm., Inc., 292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 590 (11th Cir. 2000)). Yet under [ ] Nassar,     U.S.    ,    , 133 S. Ct. [at] 2533[ ], "Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in § 2000e-2(m). This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or action of the employer." Id. In other words, a plaintiff making a Title VII retaliation claim "must establish that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer." Id. at 2534. But see Ramirez v. Bausch & Lomb, Inc., [546 Fed. Appx. 829, 833 n.2 (11th Cir. Oct. 22, 2013)] ("However, the Court did not clarify the role of 'but for' causation in a plaintiff's prima facie case."). Thus, the plaintiff always has the burden of persuasion "to proffer evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that discriminatory animus was the 'but-for' cause of the adverse employment action." Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir. 2013) (reconciling "but-for" causation and the McDonnell Douglas framework [*43]  in ADEA case, and affirming summary judgment where appellant could not establish that discriminatory animus was the but-for cause of his termination).
Smith, 565 Fed. Appx. at 778-79.
The Court agrees with DeKalb County that Plaintiff has not made a prima facie case of retaliation. Although Plaintiff alleges that he was involuntarily put on FMLA and then fired in part because of the complaints made to the DA's office, the documented evidence does not reflect that Plaintiff complained of discrimination, but instead shows that he complained of the perceived conspiracy against him by the FBI and GBI. [Doc. 202-5 at 16, 18, 20, 21]. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that he complained of discrimination based on race or gender. See Gerard, 324 Fed. Appx. at 826 (concluding that plaintiff's letter to superior "did not constitute statutorily protected expression because it laid out a list of grievances, but did not indicate that he was discriminated against based on his membership in a protected group."). Other than complaints to the DA's office, Plaintiff has not alleged that he engaged in statutorily protected activity before his termination or any other instances of complaints based on discrimination under Title VII. Therefore, the Court finds [*44]  that Plaintiff has not made a prima facie case for retaliation and RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim be GRANTED.

e. Hostile Work Environment
DeKalb County did not address Plaintiff's allegations of an "unbearable work environment," "abuse," and constructive discharge. In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Mann and another deputy choked Plaintiff while sitting at his desk, [Doc. 64 ¶ 30], Plaintiff was forced to go out in the rain and cold to get food and lottery tickets for Mann and Wilkerson, [id. at ¶ 45], Plaintiff was required to answer all calls by the second ring, [id.], Mann and Wilkerson would change Plaintiff's completed work requiring Plaintiff to report to work early to complete the work again, [id. ¶¶ 54-55], and Mann and Wilkerson called Plaintiff gay and told him that he was doing a female's job, [id. at 56]. Based on these allegations, the Court is compelled to discuss Plaintiff's claim for hostile work environment.16
First, the Court notes that Plaintiff did not raise any allegations of a hostile work environment claim in either his [*45]  EEOC charge or his supplemental filing such that this claim could reasonably be expected to rise out of the EEOC investigation. [Doc. 209-6 at 65, 71-75]; see Anderson v. Dunbar Armored, Inc., 678 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1304 (N.D. Ga. 2009). Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on a claim for hostile work environment. Id. Although a Title VII plaintiff's failure to timely exhaust his administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing suit in federal court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982), a plaintiff's failure to file an EEOC claim absolutely bars his claims. Hines v. Widnall, 334 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir. 2003); see also Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 152 n.6 (1984) (clarifying that the Court did not declare in Zipes that the EEOC filing requirement need not ever be satisfied, but rather held that timely filing is subject to waiver and tolling); Grier v. Sec'y of the Army, 799 F.2d 721, 724 (11th Cir. 1986) (finding that party's "failure to exhaust or even begin her administrative remedies" barred her suit). Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly dismissed Title VII claims for failure to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Thomas v. Kroger Co., 24 F.3d 147, 150 (11th Cir. 1994) (affirming dismissal of Title VII claim where plaintiff failed to file an EEOC charge); Hines, 334 F.3d at 1257 (emphasizing that "filing a complaint with the EEOC is a prerequisite to the equitable exceptions to administrative exhaustion," and concluding that party's [*46]  failure to file an EEOC claim absolutely barred his claims); Grier, 799 F.2d at 724-25 (holding that party's failure to file an EEOC charge barred suit and warranted dismissal).
Even if Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim was not barred by his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie case. To establish a claim for hostile work environment, Plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected group; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based on his membership in the protected class; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for that environment under either vicarious or direct liability. Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, 683 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir. 2012).
To establish that conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment, a plaintiff must establish both subjective and objective components. See Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). The subjective component is met when "the complaining employee perceived it to be [severe or pervasive] at the time" of the harassment. Hulsey v. Pride Restaurants, LLC, 367 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir. 2004). The undersigned assumes that Plaintiff perceived [*47]  that the harassment rose to this level. See Jones, 683 F.3d at 1299. Therefore, the undersigned focuses on the objective component.
In evaluating the objective component, courts examine whether the actions of the employer altered the employee's working conditions to such an extent that a reasonable person would find the atmosphere hostile and abusive. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22-23 (1993). To determine whether the complained of statements and conduct are sufficiently severe or pervasive from an objective standpoint to alter an employee's terms and conditions of employment, courts consider the following four factors: "(1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's job performance." Miller, 277 F.3d at 1276. These four factors are used to "delineate a minimum level of severity or pervasiveness necessary for harassing conduct to constitute discrimination in violation of Title VII." Mendoza v. Borden, 195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999). No single factor is controlling or required. Mangrum v. Republic Indus., Inc., 260 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1247 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23). Instead, a court must "look[] to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter [*48]  the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive working environment." Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1258. The above inquiries serve to ensure that Title VII does not become "a general civility code." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998).
First, other than alleging that his superiors called him gay and said that he was doing a woman's job, none of the other perceived harassment Plaintiff claims is based on a protected characteristic. Cf. Hudson v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 209 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1315 (N.D. Ga. 2001) (Carnes, J.) ("Although behavior need not be sexual in nature to support a claim of hostile work environment based on gender, the behavior must be based on gender. . . ."). Plaintiff did not make any allegations that DCMO's other harassing conduct was motivated by Plaintiff's protected characteristics. With regard to Plaintiff's allegation that Mann and Wilkerson called him gay and said that he was doing a woman's job, Plaintiff has not provided any specific instances of this conduct either in his Amended Complaint or his massive response brief, nor does Plaintiff produce any other evidence to this effect. The allegations in both the Amended Complaint and the response are general and do not provide any indication as to the frequency of the name-calling, the severity of statements (other than the statements [*49]  themselves), whether the statements were stated in front of others to aggregate the perceived humiliation, or whether such statements interfered with his job performance. Therefore, the Court finds that the alleged statements, even if made, were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to satisfy a claim of hostile work environment under Title VII. Thus, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to assert such a claim, the undersigned sua sponte RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's claim for hostile work environment be DISMISSED.

V. Alternative Recommendations
In the event the District Judge does not adopt the above recommendation pertaining to the undersigned's findings regarding DCMO's Eleventh Amendment immunity, the undersigned offers the following alternative recommendation to Plaintiff's FMLA, ADA, and ADEA claims.

A. FMLA
DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff did not present any tangible evidence that DCMO interfered with, restrained, or denied Plaintiff his rights to FMLA. [Doc. 193-1 at 12]. To the contrary, DeKalb County argues, Plaintiff presented evidence that he was informed of the opportunity to take FMLA leave and encouraged to take FMLA leave, and Plaintiff even maintains that he did not want FMLA leave. [Id.]. Thus, [*50]  DeKalb County argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor. [Id.].
Plaintiff's amended complaint and response are filled with allegations that DCMO forced Plaintiff to take FMLA leave against his will. [See e.g. Doc. 64 ¶¶ 35, 44; Doc. 209 ¶ 37]. Plaintiff argues that he had 312 sick leave hours and 536 annual leave hours that he could have used in place of FMLA. [Doc. 209 ¶ 37 (citing Doc. 209-5 at 1)]. Plaintiff also alleges that DeKalb County Human Resource Specialist Raco Calland told him he had FMLA leave coverage until June 2010, but Calland later sent Plaintiff a letter that he needed to return to work May 4, 2010, [id. ¶ 136], and Plaintiff was fired when his FMLA had not yet run out. [Id. ¶¶ 161, 163]. Plaintiff further argues that he was on a conference call with Mann and Ellis in March 2010 where Ellis stated that if Plaintiff did not accept the retirement package, he would be sent out on FMLA and then fired. [Id. ¶¶ 42, 46, 50, 80, 85, 99]. Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Hill was part of a scheme with Mann and Ellis to retaliate against Plaintiff to fire him by not allowing him to return back to work from FMLA. [Id. ¶¶ 81, 82, 162]. Plaintiff contends that DCMO [*51]  would not allow him to return to work even after Dr. Heath at Kaiser approved his return to work. [Id. ¶¶ 50, 85 (citing Doc. 209-4 at 128, 140)].
The FMLA grants an eligible employee the right to take up to twelve workweeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including "[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). The FMLA prohibits an employer from: (1) "interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or deny[ing] the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right" under the FMLA; or (2) "discharg[ing] or in any other manner discriminat[ing] against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by" the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), (2). Although the FMLA " 'uses the language of interference, restraint, denial, discharge, and discrimination, not retaliation, . . . nomenclature counts less than substance. And the substance of the FMLA . . . is that an employer may not do bad things to an employee who has exercised or attempted to exercise any rights under the statute.' " Smith v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 273 F.3d 1303, 1313 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 n.5 (11th Cir. 2000)). Under this interpretation of the FMLA, the Eleventh Circuit has stated as follows:
[T]he FMLA creates two types of claims: interference [*52]  claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, . . . , and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act . . . .
Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see also Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206). To state a claim for interference with a substantive right under the FMLA, the plaintiff "need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07. "Interfering with" the exercise of FMLA rights includes both "refusing to authorize FMLA leave . . . [and] discouraging an employee from using such leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b). When bringing an interference claim, "[t]he employee need not allege that his employer intended to deny the benefit-the employer's motives are irrelevant." Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1293. Conversely, to state a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, the plaintiff "must demonstrate that his employer intentionally discriminated against him in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right"; in other words, the plaintiff shoulders the increased burden of showing that the defendant's actions "were motivated by an [*53]  impermissible or discriminatory animus." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207 (internal quotation marks omitted).

1. FMLA interference

a. Involuntary Leave
Plaintiff argues and DeKalb County almost acknowledges that Plaintiff did not want to take FMLA and was instead forced to take leave. [Doc. 209, passim; Doc. 193-1 at 12]. Instead, DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff's assertion that he did not want FMLA leave belies his claim that his FMLA rights were interfered with, restrained or denied. [Doc. 193-1 at 12]. While the Eleventh Circuit has not expressly addressed whether a plaintiff may assert an FMLA interference claim on an involuntary leave theory, Grace v. Adtran, Inc., 470 Fed. Appx. 812, 816 (11th Cir. Apr. 27, 2012), it did recognize that if such theory were permitted, the claim " 'ripens only when and if the employee seeks FMLA leave at a later date, and such leave is not available because the employee was wrongfully forced to use FMLA leave in the past." Id. (quoting Wysong v. Dow Chem. Co., 503 F.3d 441, 449 (6th Cir. 2007)). Thus, "[a]n employee may have a claim under § 2615(a)(1) [of the FMLA] when an employer forces an employee to take FMLA leave when the employee does not have a 'serious health condition' that precludes [him] from working. Wysong, 503 F.3d at 449; see also Walker v. Trinity Marine Products, Inc., 721 F.3d 542, 544-45 (8th Cir. 2013). The Second and Third Circuits also hold that forced leave, by itself, does not violate the [*54]  FMLA. Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 175 (2d Cir. 2006); Foster v. N.J. Dep't of Transp., 255 Fed. Appx. 670, 671 n.1 (3d Cir. Nov. 15, 2007).
Thus, contrary to DeKalb County's contention, Plaintiff may assert an FMLA interference claim based on involuntary leave; however, this claim is not ripe. While Plaintiff argues that he did not need to take FMLA as he was not sick, the evidence from Kaiser and Anchor Hospital in 2009 and 2010 reflects that Plaintiff did have a serious health condition that precluded him from working. [Doc. 202-5 at 10, 28; Doc. 209-4 at 135]. Therefore, if the District Judge does not agree with the undersigned's Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis, then the undersigned alternatively RECOMMENDS that DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim based on involuntary leave be GRANTED.

b. Reinstatement
While the evidence does show, as DeKalb County indicates, that Plaintiff was encouraged to take FMLA leave and it granted all requests for FMLA leave, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, response and the evidence also show that Plaintiff was denied reinstatement at the end of his leave. [See Doc. 64 ¶¶ 57, 64, 78, 90, 91; Doc. 209 ¶¶ 85, 112, 113; Doc. 209-4 at 128, 140; Doc. 209-6 at 113]. DeKalb County did not address this argument and thus has waived the argument. Hudson, 209 F. Supp. 2d at 1324 (holding that [*55]  "[w]hen a party fails to respond to an argument or otherwise address a claim, the Court deems such argument or claim abandoned."). Notwithstanding, the Court will address the merits of Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim based on the denial of reinstatement.
To state a claim for interference under the FMLA, "a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was entitled, under the FMLA, to a benefit that he was denied." Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 2006); O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1353-54 (11th Cir. 2000); see also King v. Preferred Technical Group, 166 F.3d 887, 891 (7th Cir. 1999). "An employee has the right following FMLA leave 'to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced' or to an equivalent position." Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Public School, 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1)(A) and citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.214(a)). "But this right is not absolute; an employer can deny reinstatement 'if it can demonstrate that it would have discharged the employee had he not been on FMLA leave.' " Martin, 543 F.3d at 1267 (quoting Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208). In other words, the employer must show that it "refused to reinstate the employee for a reason wholly unrelated to the FMLA leave." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208; see also Parris v. Miami Herald Publ'g Co., 216 F.3d 1298, 1301 n.1 (11th Cir. 2000) ("Under the FMLA regulations, if an employer interferes with an employee's right to reinstatement under the FMLA, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee would have been laid off during the FMLA period for reasons unrelated [*56]  to the employee's condition, and therefore is not entitled to restoration.") (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(a) and O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1354 (11th Cir. 2000)).
Here, DeKalb County's entire argument for terminating Plaintiff is that Plaintiff exhausted his FMLA leave and none of his doctors cleared him to return to work or provided a date certain when Plaintiff would be allowed to return to work. [Doc. 193-1 at 1, 7-8]. Thus, the reason for failing to reinstate Plaintiff was entirely related to Plaintiff's FMLA leave. DeKalb County does not attempt to meet its burden to show that Plaintiff would have been terminated during the FMLA period for reasons unrelated to Plaintiff's condition. DeKalb County uses the excuse that none of his doctors cleared him to return to work and that further absences would cause undue hardship, but DeKalb County does not acknowledge that Kaiser cleared Plaintiff to return to work at the end of his leave period subject to medical appointments. [Doc. 209-4 at 140; Doc. 209-6 at 113]. DeKalb County has not disputed that Plaintiff informed Mann of Kaiser's recommendation that he may return to work, [Doc. 64 ¶¶ 90-91; Doc. 209 ¶¶ 85, 112-13]. [See also Doc. 209-4 at 128; Doc. 202-5 at 38 (referencing an attached letter from Kaiser [*57]  clearing him to return to work)]. However, Mann made the decision to terminate Plaintiff anyway. While Kaiser's recommendation that Plaintiff be allowed to return to work did come with the restriction that Plaintiff be allowed 2.5 hours per day to attend outpatient therapy, DeKalb County provides no evidence as to whether the absence of 2.5 hours was factored into Plaintiff's "continued absences" that created an undue hardship. [See Doc. 193-1 at 1, 8]. Even if this factor was clearly articulated by DeKalb County, DeKalb County also argued that none of his doctors provided a date certain that he could return to work. [Id.]. However, as Kaiser's fit-for-duty letter provides, Plaintiff was only required to attend the outpatient therapy for 5 weeks. [Doc. 209-4 at 140; Doc. 209-6 at 113]. Thus, DeKalb County has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that its failure to reinstate Plaintiff was wholly unrelated to his FMLA leave. Accordingly, if the District Judge does not adopt the above recommendation pertaining to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.17

2. FMLA Retaliation [*58] 
"To state a claim [for retaliation] under the FMLA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she availed herself of a protected right; (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decision." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Walker v. Elmore Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 379 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir. 2004)). The plaintiff must also prove that the employer acted with the requisite intent to retaliate. See Cross v. Sw. Recreational Indus., Inc., 17 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1369 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Murphy, J); see also Russell v. N. Broward Hosp., 346 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2003).
A plaintiff may prove her case through presentation of direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. Cross, 17 F. Supp. 2d at 1371. "Direct evidence is 'evidence, that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption.' " Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., 402 F.3d 1076, 1081 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1086). "Such evidence must demonstrate the existence of 'a discriminatory . . . attitude correlating to the discrimination . . . complained of by the employee.' " Darring v. DailyAccess Corp., No. Civ. 05-112-BH-M, 2006 WL 779868, at *10 (S.D. Ala. Mar. 27, 2006) (quoting Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets Of Florida, Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir. 1999)). "If the Court finds that the alleged statement merely 'suggests, but does not prove, a discriminatory motive, then it is circumstantial evidence.' " Darring, 2006 WL 779868 at *10 (quoting Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1086).
If the plaintiff lacks direct evidence, then a court analyzes the plaintiff's claim using the McDonnell-Douglas framework applied to retaliation claims brought under Title VII. See Walker, 379 F.3d at 1251; Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. As noted, under the McDonnell-Douglas [*59]  framework, if the plaintiff satisfies her prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action taken, and then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (11th Cir. 2010). To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff "must present evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision." Id. at 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted).
To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must present evidence that: "(1) he engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision; and (3) there was a causal connection between the statutorily protected conduct and the adverse employment decision." Drago, 453 F.3d at 1307. To establish the causation element, a plaintiff must show: (1) close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action; and (2) the decisionmaker knew that the plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity. See Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1298. This can be satisfied if the Plaintiff can show " 'that the protected activity [*60]  and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.' " Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999)). As discussed above, the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to show that the FMLA leave and the termination were not wholly unrelated. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied his prima facie case.
Also as discussed above, DeKalb County's reason for terminating Plaintiff was that none of his doctors cleared him to return to work. However, evidence was presented (by both Plaintiff and DeKalb County) that one of his doctors did clear him to return to work and DeKalb County does not dispute that DCMO knew of this clearance. [Doc. 64 ¶¶ 90-91; Doc. 209 ¶¶ 85, 112-13; Doc. 209-4 at 128; Doc. 202-5 at 38 (referencing an attached letter from Kaiser clearing him to return to work); Doc. 202-5 at 42 (same); Doc. 202-5 at 43]. Therefore, the Court finds that DeKalb County did not meet its burden to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, or at the least, an absence of a material issue of disputed fact as to that claim.
Even if DeKalb County had shown a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, Plaintiff makes an argument that this was pretext by arguing that [*61]  he was fired for not accepting the retirement package and DCMO forced him to take FMLA just so they could fire him. [Doc. 64 ¶¶ 25, 35, 36, 38, 53, 57, 64, 78, 84, 87-88; Doc. 209 ¶¶ 42, 46, 50, 80, 85, 99]. This was due in part, Plaintiff argues, because Plaintiff would make complaints to the DA's office. [Doc. 209 ¶ 140]. The undersigned is not convinced that a jury could not believe that DCMO, with the aid of Dr. Hill, overly encouraged Plaintiff to accept the retirement package in an attempt to eliminate his employment. [See Doc. 209-5 at 65, 104, 105, 107-108 (emails between Mann and Dr. Hill reminding Plaintiff of retirement package and reports of Plaintiff's position on acceptance)]. Because at least one of his doctors cleared Plaintiff to return to work and there is an appearance that, at the very least, DCMO overly encouraged Plaintiff to accept the retirement package, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that DCMO's reason for terminating Plaintiff was pretext for discrimination.
Accordingly, if the District Judge concludes that DeKalb County does not have Eleventh Circuit immunity in this action, the undersigned [*62]  RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim.

B. ADA
DeKalb County argues that even if DCMO is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, that Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA. [Doc. 193-1 at 14-15]. Specifically, DeKalb County argues that Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without a reasonable accommodation. [Id.]. DeKalb County argues that because his doctors indicated that Plaintiff was not able to return to work, he was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job. [Id.]. DeKalb County goes on to argue that even if Plaintiff could make a prima facie case of ADA discrimination, the DCMO has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions and Plaintiff cannot prove pretext. [Id. at 15].
DeKalb County also argues that Plaintiff has not made a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA on the basis of failure to accommodate. [Id. at 15-17]. It argues that Plaintiff has not met his burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation and demonstrating that it would enable him to perform the essential [*63]  functions of the job. [Id. at 16]. DeKalb County acknowledges that Plaintiff sent letters to DCMO requesting additional sick leave and vacation leave, but argues that these were not requests for accommodations and they did not demonstrate how the leave would allow him to perform the essential functions of his job. [Id.]. Even if Plaintiff had met this burden, it would have posed an undue hardship on the DCMO to allow Plaintiff continued absences from his duties because it was unknown when Plaintiff would be able to return to work. [Id.].
In Plaintiff's response, Plaintiff argues that in 2008, 2009, and 2010, Plaintiff asked Wilkerson and Mann several times to be able to attend training so that he could advance within the department, however, he was told by both of them that he was too old, slow and crazy to attend the training, thus denying him the right to advance and get promotions. [Doc. 209 ¶¶ 28, 127]. Plaintiff alleges that Mann and Wilkerson called him crazy on many occasions. [Id. ¶¶ 36, 102]. Plaintiff further argues that they were concerned about Plaintiff being around guns, (citing Doc. 209-5 at 32), and thus he asked for a transfer, which Mann refused to grant. [Id. ¶¶ 35, [*64]  70, 162].
The ADA prohibits covered entities from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., Civil Action No. 1:10-cv-2816-JEC, 2012 WL 2726766, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2012) (Carnes, J.).

1. Disparate Treatment
With respect to disparate-treatment claims, "the burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). As the Eleventh Circuit has noted:
"In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, [the plaintiff] must demonstrate that she (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability." Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000); 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). On the issue of whether an impairment [*65]  substantially limits a major life activity, "[w]e are guided . . . by the regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which state that major life activities means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." Cash, 231 F.3d at 1305 (quotation omitted). The ADA defines a "qualified individual" as an individual with a disability "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of her job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., Div. of Family & Children Servs., 446 Fed. Appx. 179, 182 (11th Cir. Nov. 2, 2011) (alterations in original) (footnote omitted).
DeKalb County only focuses on the third element of the prima facie case, that is, that Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the job because none of his doctors cleared him to return to work. However, this argument fails because, as demonstrated above, Kaiser cleared him to return to work with restrictions.
DeKalb County also argues that "[a]s a result of his diagnosed condition [Plaintiff] was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his job," [Doc. 193-1 at 15], however, DeKalb County has failed to show how Plaintiff's mental impairment prevented him from being able to perform the essential functions of his job if [*66]  he was eligible to return to work. DeKalb County cites to Judge Carnes' opinion in Eckerd Corp., 2012 WL 2726766, in support of its position, however, that case is inapposite as that case involved a plaintiff with a physical impairment who was physically unable to perform her job for parts of the workday. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a prima facie case for disability discrimination. Looking again to the McDonnell-Douglas factors, as discussed above, DCMO has not shown that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Even if DCMO had satisfied this requirement, for the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff presented sufficient facts and evidence to meet his burden of showing that the decision was pretextual. Accordingly, if the District Judge does not adopt the Eleventh Amendment immunity analysis, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment related to Plaintiff's claims for disparate treatment under the ADA.

2. Failure to Accommodate
As for reasonable-accommodation claims, the Eleventh Circuit has stated:
An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability [*67]  when the employer fails to provide "reasonable accommodations" for the disability-unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). An accommodation can qualify as "reasonable," and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. See LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998). The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997).
The ADA lists as examples of reasonable accommodations "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); see 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). As the list indicates, the ADA may require the employer to "reassign," i.e., transfer, the disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation. The reassignment duty, however, does not require the employer to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee. See Willis, 108 F.3d at 284. Nor does it require the employer to promote a disabled employee. See EEOC v. Humiston-Keeling, Inc., 227 F.3d 1024, 1029 (7th Cir. 2000); Cravens v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 214 F.3d 1011, 1019 (8th Cir. 2000); Cassidy v. Detroit Edison Co., 138 F.3d 629, 634 (6th Cir. 1998); Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 832 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing White v. York Int'l Corp., 45 F.3d 357, 362 (10th Cir. 1995)); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(o) ("It should also be noted [*68]  that an employer is not required to promote an individual with a disability as an accommodation.").
Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001).
The Court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden in demonstrating an accommodation and that the accommodation allows him to perform the essential functions of his job. Plaintiff presented evidence that Kaiser cleared him to return to work with the restriction that he be allowed to attend outpatient therapy for 2.5 hours per day. Plaintiff also wrote to Mann on April 26, 2010 that Kaiser cleared him to return to work on May 3 and requested that he be allowed to return to work and transferred to another department. [Doc. 209-4 at 136-39]. In letters dated April 30 and May 3, 2010, Plaintiff requested that he be allowed to return to work per the advice of his doctor at Kaiser and noted the restriction. [Doc. 202-5 at 38, 42]. On May 3, 2010, Plaintiff sent a letter specifically asking to use vacation days to allow him to attend medical appointments. [Doc. 202-5 at 41]. Other letters from Plaintiff, to which DeKalb County refers, request that Plaintiff be allowed to use vacation and/or sick time because Dr. Hill would not clear him to return to work. [Doc. 202-5 at 37, 38, 45]. It appears [*69]  that Plaintiff asked for an accommodation pursuant to his doctor's orders to be allowed to return to work to attend outpatient therapy from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm, Monday through Thursday for four to five weeks. [Doc. 209-6 at 113]. Without addressing this restriction, DeKalb County argues that it would create an undue burden on DCMO to allow Plaintiff to have continued absences. However, DeKalb County fails to show how a 2.5 hour absence would create an undue burden and prevent Plaintiff from performing its essential functions, especially since part of the 2.5 hour absence falls during a typical lunch hour. DeKalb County argues that the "absences" would be an undue burden because the date Plaintiff could return to work was unknown, however, Kaiser indicated that the expected duration was four to five weeks. [Id.]. The cases DeKalb County cites, Thomas v. Trane, No. 5:05-CV-440(CAR), 2007 WL 2874776 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 27, 2007), and Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994), are inapplicable here as those cases involve "unpredictable" absences from work. Here, the time that Plaintiff needed off from work was predictable. Moreover, DeKalb County did not address Plaintiff's request for a transfer.
Accordingly, if the District Judge does not adopt the above recommendation pertaining to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the undersigned [*70]  RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment related to Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate under the ADA.

C. ADEA
DeKalb County argues that summary judgment should be granted to it because Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination because he cannot show that he was replaced by a substantially younger person, nor can Plaintiff show that age was the "but-for" cause of Plaintiff's termination. [Doc. 193-1 at 22]. In a footnote, DeKalb County argues that, although Plaintiff alleges that he was pressured to take early retirement, Plaintiff presented no evidence of any ADEA violations in this regard. [Id. at 23 n.5]. DeKalb County asserts that, like all eligible employees at the time, Plaintiff was informed about a retirement plus incentive package and he did not accept the package by the deadline. [Id.]. However, Plaintiff was eligible to accept an alternative early retirement package on a future date of his choosing. [Id.].
Plaintiff responds that he was fired for not accepting the retirement package that DCMO pressured him to take. [Doc. 209 ¶¶ 15, 17, 20]. In a conference call in March 2010, Mann and Ellis said [*71]  that Plaintiff would be sent on FMLA and fired if he did not accept the retirement plan. [Id. ¶¶ 42, 46, 50, 80]. Plaintiff acknowledges that every employee over the age of 50 was offered the retirement package, [id. ¶ 37], but Plaintiff argues that he was the only one singled out and intimidated and threatened by Mann and Ellis into accepting it. [Id. ¶ 38]. Plaintiff further acknowledges that his replacement is in the same age range as he is, but he argues that Mann and Ellis told him they would do this to avoid an age discrimination claim. [Id. ¶¶ 47, 48, 49, 83, 84].18
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer, inter alia, "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). The ADEA also prohibits discrimination against any employee because she "has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual . . . has made a charge, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under this chapter." 29 U.S.C. § 623(d). The Eleventh Circuit uses the McDonnell-Douglas [*72]  framework to evaluate ADEA claims. Sims v. MVM, Inc., 704 F.3d 1327, 1332 (11th Cir. 2013). However, "[t]he burden of persuasion always remains on the plaintiff in an ADEA case to proffer evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the discriminatory animus was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action." Id. (citing Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009)).
To prove a prima facie case of age discrimination, a plaintiff must prove that he was (1) a member of the protected class; (2) qualified for the position; (3) subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) replaced by a substantially younger person or suffered from disparate treatment because of his age. See Kelliher v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1270, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002).
Here, DeKalb County only contests the fourth element by arguing that Plaintiff cannot prove that he was replaced by a younger person because his replacement was older than Plaintiff. [Doc. 193-1 at 22]. However, while Plaintiff concedes that he was replaced by a person in his same age group, this is not the only way to satisfy the fourth element. See Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1226 (11th Cir. 1993) ("These requirements are not, however, interpreted strictly if the plaintiff can otherwise provide a basis for the inference that age was a factor in the employment decision."). "Evidence demonstrating that an employer used direct [*73]  coercion to force an employee to 'choose' retirement may establish liability under the ADEA." Baker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 903 F.2d 1515, 1523 (11th Cir. 1990); cf. Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., 433 F.3d 794, 806-07 (11th Cir. 2005) ("Because [plaintiff] was not faced with an impermissible take-it-or-leave-it choice between retirement or discharge, we find that he cannot establish an adverse employment action of constructive discharge and his ADEA claim fails."). Assuming that Plaintiff's allegations that Mann and Wilkerson said that Plaintiff was too old, slow and crazy to perform the job was true, this would provide a basis that age was a factor in Plaintiff's termination. See Clark, 990 F.2d at 1228; but see Montgomery v. John Deere & Co., 169 F.3d 556, 560-61 (8th Cir. 1999) (finding that where plaintiff's prima facie case was weak, at best, statements that plaintiff was referred to as an "old fart," "old man" and "too old to be on the air" with no other evidence of pretext, do not provide a sufficient basis for an inference of age discrimination.). The fact that Plaintiff was fired after being offered to retire may also provide an inference that age was a determinative factor in his termination. Young v. Gen. Foods. Corp., 840 F.2d 825, 831 (11th Cir. 1988); Cargile v. Horton Homes, Inc., 851 F. Supp. 1575, 1580 n.2 (M.D. Ga. 1994).
Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the prima facie case for age discrimination and Defendant has not shown the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to a legitimate, non-discriminatory [*74]  reason for terminating Plaintiff. Accordingly, if the District Judge does not adopt the above recommendation pertaining to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY DeKalb County's motion for summary judgment related to Plaintiff's claims for disparate treatment under the ADEA.
To the extent that Plaintiff raises a claim for retaliation under the ADEA, this claim fails for the same reasons set forth in Plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim. Therefore, if the District Judge does not adopt the above recommendation pertaining to Eleventh Amendment immunity, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT DeKalb County's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims for retaliation under the ADEA.

VI. Conclusion
For the reasons herein, the undersigned RECOMMENDS to the District Judge that she GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART Defendants' motions for summary judgment. [Docs. 193, 203]. Specifically, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be GRANTED to Dr. Hill on Plaintiff's claims under Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA. However, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be DENIED to Dr. Hill on Plaintiff's claims under the FMLA. Further, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that [*75]  summary judgment be GRANTED to DeKalb County on Plaintiff's FMLA, ADA, and ADEA claims based on Eleventh Amendment immunity, and on Plaintiff's claims for retaliation under Title VII; however, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motion be DENIED as to Plaintiff's Title VII claims based on race and gender discrimination.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion to allow consideration of his documents. [Doc. 212].
As all matters referred to the undersigned under Standing Order 14-01 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 15, 2014), now have been ruled upon by the undersigned, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the referral to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED, this the 2d day of July, 2015.
