Opinion


REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE
The plaintiff, King Grant-Davis ("Plaintiff"), appearing pro se and in forma pauperis, filed this action against the Board of Trustees of Charleston County Public Library ("Library Board") and the County of Charleston ("County") after Charleston County Public Library's ("CCPL's") Executive Director, Douglas Henderson ("Henderson") issued a Trespass Warning to him which prohibited him from entering any of CCPL's facilities in the future.1 (See generally Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) The Plaintiff alleges that the Library Board and the County have violated his rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq. (the "ADA"). This case was referred to a United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code Section 636(b)(1), and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(e) (D.S.C.). The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this case presents a federal [*2]  question. Venue is proper because the events at issue occurred in this District. 28 U.S.C. § 1391.
On October 16, 2015, the Library Board and the County filed a Motion to Dismiss in Lieu of an Answer ("Motion to Dismiss"). (Dkt. No. 14.) The court then issued an order pursuant to Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309 (4th Cir. 1975), advising the Plaintiff of the dismissal procedure and the possible consequences if he failed to adequately respond to the Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 16.) The Plaintiff timely filed a motion in opposition, and on March 8, 2016, the court issued a Report and Recommendation ("R&R") which recommended that the Motion to Dismiss be granted as to the Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the County and denied as to the Library Board, and be denied as to the Plaintiff's ADA claims against the Library Board and the County. (Dkt. No 19.) Neither party filed objections to the R&R.
On April 12, 2016, the District Court entered an Order adopting the R&R. (Dkt. No. 23.) Accordingly, the § 1983 claims against the County were dismissed, leaving the Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the Library Board, and the Plaintiff's ADA claims against the Library Board and the County. (Id.)
On September 14, 2016, the Library Board and the County (collectively, the [*3]  "Defendants") filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the remaining claims, and the court again issued a Roseboro order to the Plaintiff. (Dkt. Nos. 38, 39.) The Plaintiff timely filed an opposition to the Defendants' Motion (Dkt. No. 41), and thus this case is ripe for review. As the court finds that the issues have been adequately briefed, it has determined that oral argument is not necessary. See Local Civ. Rule 7.06 (D.S.C.). For the reasons stated herein, the undersigned recommends that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment be granted, and that this case be dismissed with prejudice.

I. THE PARTIES

A. The Plaintiff
The Plaintiff has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), major depression, and anti-social personality disorder and has been treated for these conditions at the Medical University of South Carolina's Institute of Psychiatry. (Compl. 3.) He claims that "[i]n 2014 and 2015, and going back to 2005, plaintiff informed [CCPL] personnel of all these mental health and speech symtoms [sic] which he has." (Id.)

B. The Defendants

1. The County
In South Carolina, counties are political subdivisions of the State, and each county has been granted the power to sue and be sued. S.C. Code § 4-1-10(1). See [*4]  also Avery v. Burke Cty., 660 F.2d 111, 113-14 (4th Cir. 1981) ("The capacity of a governmental body to be sued in the federal courts is governed by the law of the state in which the district court is held.").

2. The Library Board
In South Carolina, county public library systems are a "continuing function of county government" and each one is controlled and managed by a board of trustees appointed by its respective county council. S.C. Code §§ 4-9-35(A) & (B). The South Carolina General Assembly has, by statute, enumerated the powers of library boards of trustees to include the power to "[t]ake any actions deemed necessary and proper by the board to establish, equip, operate and maintain an effective library system within limits of approved appropriations of county council." S.C. Code § 4-9-36(9). Furthermore, library boards of trustees are authorized to "[a]dopt regulations necessary to insure effective operation, maintenance and security of the property of the library system." S.C. Code § 4-9-37(b). As will be discussed below, it does not appear that the Library Board has the capacity to be sued. See, e.g., Armstrong v. D.C. Pub. Library, 154 F. Supp. 2d 67, 71 (D.D.C. 2001) (dismissing claims against the District of Columbia Public Library because the statute setting forth the duties of the board of trustees did not mention its authority to sue and be sued).

II. FACTS
In 2012, Henderson [*5]  banned the Plaintiff from access to all CCPL facilities.2 (Compl. 4.) Henderson's letter stated:
[T]his letter is to inform you that based upon numerous incidents of inappropriate, threatening, and dangerous behavior by you on various [CCPL] premises, beginning November 3, 2005 and culminated on April 13, 2012, you are no longer permitted to enter or be present upon any of the facilities or property operated by the [CCPL].
(Dkt. No. 38-5 at 1.)
In 2014, the South Carolina General Assembly passed S.C. Code § 16-11-625, which codified the trespass notice procedure for public libraries. In response, the Plaintiff wrote to Henderson to appeal the 2012 ban. (Dkt. No. 38-11 at 3-9.) At the August 26, 2014 Library Board meeting, the Plaintiff argued his appeal. (Dkt. No. 38-7 at 2-3.) Thereafter, Library Board voted to lift the ban and restore the Plaintiff's CCPL privileges. (Id. at 4; Compl. 4-5.)
Meanwhile, on June 24, 2014, pursuant to S.C. Code § 4-9-37(b), the Library Board issued the CCPL Code of Conduct ("Code of Conduct") to ensure "the comfort and safety of patrons, volunteers, and staff, and the protection of Library property[.]" (Dkt. No. 38-13 at 4-5.) The Code of Conduct set forth "examples of conduct not allowed on Library property," [*6]  which included:
• Creating any loud, unreasonable and/or disturbing actions . . . that could interfere with the ability of others to use and enjoy library services; . . .
• Threatening behavior toward another person, either verbally or physically; . . . .
(Id. at 4.) The Code of Conduct specifically stated:
Library staff will intervene to stop prohibited activities and behaviors. Failure to comply with the library's established standards of acceptable behavior may result in removal from the building and/or restriction of library privileges.
(Id. at 5.) The court concludes that the Plaintiff was aware of CCPL's Code of Conduct, as well as the penalties for failing to abide by it, prior to the events at issue in this case because, on October 1, 2013, the Library Board's chairperson had mailed the Plaintiff a copy of the Library's 2008 Code of Conduct which prohibited the same conduct and set forth the same penalties (using virtually identical wording), and the Plaintiff attached the 2008 Code of Conduct to his Response to Summary Judgment. (See 2008 Code of Conduct, Dkt. No. 41-1 at 6; cf. 2014 Code of Conduct, Dkt. No. 38-13 at 4-5.)
After the Plaintiff's library privileges were restored, he began to visit [*7]  the Library in October of 2014. (Compl. 6.) He alleges that at about that time, Darlene Jackson, the Main Library manager ("Jackson"), began to act in concert with Henderson and other Main Library staff in the Reference section and South Carolina Room to "manufacture false misconduct accusations against plaintiff, so they could have plaintiff barred from access to the libraries permanently." (Id.)
The events that precipitated the filing of this action occurred over the course of two months in 2015. On March 17, 2015, the Plaintiff went to CCPL's Main Library and asked for assistance with photocopying certain pages of a book. (Dkt. No. 38-4 at 13.) Library staff member Michael Welle ("Welle") assisted the Plaintiff, who became dissatisfied when one of the photocopied pages had a shadow on it because the crease of the book's spine had caused the edge of the page to darken. (Id.) According to Welle:
[The Plaintiff] told me that the page I copied for him (which he waved in front of me) was no good and that he was going to throw it away. He motioned with his hands while doing this. I found his behavior to be borderline inappropriate, definitely reportable, downright rude, intimidating and [*8]  thankless. . . .
(Id.) Welle completed a CCPL Customer Interaction Form memorializing his interaction with the Plaintiff; on the line marked "Type of Violation," Welle checked the box for "Inappropriate Behavior."3 (Id.)
On March 31, 2015, at approximately 4:00 p.m., the Plaintiff went to the Main Library to have a document notarized and spoke with Library supervisor Marianne Cawley ("Cawley"). (Compl. 6-7; see also Dkt. No. 38-4 at 11.) In a CCPL Customer Interaction Form completed in connection with the Plaintiff's visit, Cawley stated:
[The Plaintiff] came into the [South Carolina Room] and requested notary service. I was on Desk at the time. I read the document to be notarized, which was an Affidavit of Service for Charleston County Court of [Common] Pleas. Some of the wording of the document left me uncomfortable and uncertain with signing. When I expressed misgivings to the patron, he became loud and argumentative. I requested several times that he give me time to read the document but every time he would argue more. He kept insisting there was nothing wrong. I said this document was new to me and I hadn't seen it before. He said several times that he needed time to walk to County [*9]  Offices to deliver the document before 5:00. I said I understood what he was saying, I asked more than once if he wanted to take the document to another notary in the building, he always said no. Lish Thompson showed up and tried to distract the patron by offering to help him make some copies he wanted. But he was still arguing with me. Molly French came on Desk and showed me a note saying Security was on the way. The [South Carolina Room] staff could hear him in the Workroom. Katie Gray had called Security. Eric, one of the guard[s], showed up. [Library manager] Jackson also appeared in the [South Carolina Room] and she asked [the Plaintiff] to lower his voice. . . . I went in the back and called the Charleston County Clerk of Court Office for the Court of Common Pleas, they said it was fine and I notarized the document. When I handed him his document, [the Plaintiff] said he knew I was only trying to do what was right or something to that effect, which I took as backtracking because he knew he had not behaved well. Darlene Jackson, Lish Thompson, and Eric [the security guard] were still present after [the Plaintiff] left.
(Dkt. No. 38-4 at 11.) On the line marked "Type of Violation," Cawley [*10]  checked the box for "Inappropriate Behavior." (Id. at 10.)
Jackson also memorialized the interaction with the Plaintiff, stating:
I was called by Lish Thompson in the [South Carolina Room] [at 4:10 p.m.] because [the Plaintiff] was giving Marianne [Cawley] a hard time about notarizing some legal documents. I immediately called for the guard and was told that he was already in the [South Carolina Room]. When I arrived, [the Plaintiff] was speaking loudly about needing his legal document completed right away so that he could dro[]p it off to the court house. I told him to lower his voice and that I understood. I looked over the document with Marianne and decided to call the clerk of court, which Marianne did in the back office. It was okay, so Marianne notarized the document. After [the Plaintiff] left, I told the guard that in the future, [the Plaintiff] should be told to lower his voice when he starts to speak in a loud tone. This is in violation of our Code of Conduct. If he doesn't comply, then ask him to leave, if he doesn't leave, then call the police.
(Dkt. No. 38-4 at 9.) On the CCPL Customer Interaction Form, Jackson checked the box for "Inappropriate Behavior." (Id.) In the section of [*11]  the form seeking "Additional comments, " Jackson wrote:
I told staff that it is very important to document interactions and to not accept inappropr[i]ate behavior. Staff are obviously intim[i]dated by [the Plaintiff], so I told the guard that for future reference, to tell [the Plaintiff] to lower his voice when he starts to speak in a loud tone.
(Id.)
On May 13, 2015, the Plaintiff entered the Main Library after 4:00 p.m. and went to the Reference section to ask for notary services. (Compl. 7.) He was referred to the South Carolina Room because no notary was available in the Reference section. (Id.) In the South Carolina Room, the Plaintiff was referred to another staff member [Linda Bennett], who was helping another patron. (Id. 7-8.) The Plaintiff asked her "how long will it be," and she did not answer. (Id. at 8.) The Plaintiff was in a hurry because it was about 4:30 p.m., and he needed to get his documents notarized, copied, and filed at the courthouse by 5:00 p.m. (Id.) The Plaintiff asked Bennett two additional times how long it would be, and she responded, "It will be a while." (Id.) The Plaintiff then returned to the Reference section where someone notarized his documents; as he was assembling them, "Ms. Jackson suddenly [*12]  appeared, imposing on plaintiff. . . . Jackson loomed in front of plaintiff as he was trying to put his papers together in order." (Id., emphasis in original.) The Plaintiff told Jackson that all he had said to Bennett was "how long will it be?" and that it was his right to ask. (Id.) Jackson, accompanied by two security officers, told the Plaintiff she wanted to see him the next time he came to the Library. (Id. 8-9.) One of the officers told the Plaintiff to "bring down the tone of your voice!" (Id. at 9.) By his own account, the Plaintiff responded by saying, "What is this, White supremacy? [Jackson] already told me to see her next time I come to the [L]ibrary. Sir, I have PTSD, major depression, and anti-social personality systoms [sic]." (Id.)
Bennett completed a CCPL Customer Interaction Form stating that the Plaintiff had asked for a notary, but because she was working with another patron, she "politely told him he would have to wait for a few minutes." (Dkt. No. 38-4 at 2.) She continued:
Evidently, this was the second time he had asked for a notary. He got quite upset and started yelling at me, stating that had to get down to the Courthouse before 5 p.m. . . . His attitude was hostile. He did not want [*13]  to wait and made that explicitly clear.
(Id.). Bennett marked the box labeled "Inappropriate Behavior" on the Customer Interaction Form. (Id.) Main Library staff member Dorothy Glover ("Glover") also completed a Customer Interaction Form regarding the May 13, 2015 incident, noting that the Plaintiff had exhibited inappropriate behavior. (Dkt. No. 34-4 at 4.) Main Library Security Officer Eric Ledford ("Ledford") also witnessed the Plaintiff's behavior on May 13, 2015, and stated:
While doing rounds I entered the SC room. [The Plaintiff] was yelling at Linda [Bennett] about a notary. She asked him to wait. I asked him to lower his voice and to be patient. He proceeded to yell at me.
(Dkt. No. 38-4 at 3.) Ledford also completed a Customer Interaction Form; on the line marked "Type of Violation," he checked the box for "Inappropriate Behavior." (Id.) Main Library Security Officer Alan Genest ("Genest") likewise witnessed the Plaintiff's behavior on May 13:
Security was called up to the SC room because [the Plaintiff] was being very hostile to the staff because he could not get a not[a]ry right away. Ms. [Jackson] went up to tell [the Plaintiff] that she wanted to talk with him before he left and [*14]  he got really hostile and started to fling his arms around. Then she said that she would like to speak with him tomorrow because he [said] he had to go to the court house. He got really hostile with her again she then asked him to lower his voice and he did not so I stepped in and asked him to lower his voice and he said to me what are you a white supremacist because I am talking to Ms. Jackson.
(Dkt. No. 38-4 at 1.) Genest completed a Customer Interaction Form; on the line marked "Type of Violation," he checked the box for "Inappropriate Behavior." (Id.)
Jackson also completed a Customer Interaction Form regarding the May 13, 2015 incident: the Main Library to see Jackson and gave her some of his mental health records. (Compl. 9.) Pursuant to S.C. Code § 16-11-625(A)(2), CPD officers were present when Jackson gave the Plaintiff the Trespass Warning which permanently banned him from entering CCPL's facilities. (Id.; see also Dkt. Nos. 38-3 at 2; 38-6 at 1; 38-8 at 2.) The Trespass Warning stated that the Plaintiff had violated the Code of Conduct due to "Unacceptable behavior: Loud and aggressive tone of voice; Calling security an inappropriate name (white supremacist); Failure to comply to [sic] Library Staff's [*15]  request to lower voice." (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 1.) In conformance with South Carolina law, the Trespass Warning set forth the procedure by which the Plaintiff could appeal the Warning to the Library Board. (Id., citing S.C. Code § 16-11-625).
Officer Eric Ledford came to me . . . to report that [the Plaintiff] was in the South Carolina room talking very loudly and agitated about not getting his document notarized immediately. . . . I went upstairs to get more details of what was happening. After speaking to staff, I went over to [the Plaintiff] and asked him to stop by to see me on his way out. He immediately became very loud and agitated and said that he had to get to the court house. I said it would not [take] more than a few minutes. He loudly repeated himself in a highly agitated tone, so I said the next time you are in the library I would like to speak with you. He became more agitated, so I asked him to lower his voice. He continued to rant about being treated fairly and started talking about his prison life, PTSD and being treated and counseled for depression. Office[r] Allan Genest was near and asked him to lower his voice since [the Plaintiff] was not listening to me. [The Plaintiff] went on to say that this [*16]  was all about getting him out [of] the library and about what happened in 2005/6. [the Plaintiff] also asked Officer Allan Genest why he spoke to him because he was talking to me. At this point, [the Plaintiff] started aggressively waving his arms, so I stepped back and help up my hand to Officer Allan Genest to pause because [the Plaintiff] was displaying symptoms of becoming violent. [The Plaintiff] called Officer Allan Genest a white supremacist. . . .
(Dkt. No. 38-4 at 5.) In the section provided for "Additional comments," Jackson wrote:
[The Plaintiff's] behavior was aggressive and at the point of being violent. I am concerned for the safety of myself and staff. I recommend placing [the Plaintiff] on Trespass before anyone gets hurt. His behavior seems to get wors[e] with each visit to the library. After [the Plaintiff] left, I apologized to the patron [who] was in the SCRoom for the disturbance. The patron commented that the situation was handled well but he was concerned about my safety while talking with [the Plaintiff] and that it was good that I had security with me.
(Id. at 6.) On May 14, 2015, Henderson signed a CCPL Trespass Warning, informing the Plaintiff that pursuant to S.C. Code § 16-11-625, he was "prohibited [*17]  from entering any property or premises of [CCPL]." (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 1.) That day, Jackson spoke with the Charleston Police Department ("CPD") and was told to call when the Plaintiff returned so that CPD could present the Trespass Warning to him. (Dkt. No. 38-3 at 2.) Later that day, the Plaintiff went to
On May 19, 2015, the Plaintiff, by letter, appealed the Trespass Warning to the Library Board, attached a copy of his mental health records, and requested a hearing. (Compl. 9-10.) The Library Board scheduled the Plaintiff's hearing for its May 26, 2015 meeting. (See Dkt. No. 38-6.) In a memorandum to the Library Board dated May 26, 2015, Jackson stated, in part, concerning the May 13, 2015 incident:
My concern is that [the Plaintiff] displayed disruptive behavior that was on the brink of violence. He did not listen to me or to the Security Guards. The Security Guards and I are the last staff who can be called when the in charge staff feels threatened and cannot resolve a disruptive patron incident. The last resort is for the police to be called.
. . .
We all have compassion for [the Plaintiff] because of his problems. His counselor's paperwork provides an explanation for his disruptive [*18]  behavior. But [the Plaintiff's] problems cannot be used as an excuse for his disruptive behavior. [The Plaintiff's] disruptive behavior is unacceptable behavior in the library. His disruptive behavior has terrorized staff because of the potential of violence to them and to the public.
If we excuse [the Plaintiff's] disruptive behavior caused by his problems, then we are setting a trend for others to expect their disruptive behavior to be excused because of their problems. The reversal of this trespass would result in our library no longer being safe and secure for children, teens, adults or staff. We would then have a library in chaos.
(Dkt. No. 38-8 at 2.)
The Plaintiff did not receive notice of the Library Board's hearing until late on May 26, and was unable to attend. (Compl. 10.) The Library Board considered the Plaintiff's appeal and upheld the Trespass Warning, but informed the Plaintiff by letter that it would reconsider its decision if the Plaintiff so desired. (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 4.) The Plaintiff requested a rehearing, and the Library Board agreed to rehear his appeal on June 23, 2015. (Compl. 10-11; see also Dkt. No. 38-6.) At the June 23, 2015 hearing, the Plaintiff was allowed [*19]  to make a statement to the Library Board, after which it voted to uphold the Trespass Warning. (Compl. 11; see also Library Board minutes, Dkt. No. 38-9 at 2.) A police officer escorted the Plaintiff from the meeting after the vote. (Compl. 11.)
Approximately eight months after the Plaintiff was banned from CCPL, a Main Library staff member emailed Jackson on Saturday, February 20, 2016 to inform her that the Plaintiff "was in front of the library today harassing people on the sidewalk. He was careful not to come on library property. We did, however, have a patron come [in] very upset [about] their interaction." (Dkt. No. 38-10 at 2.) The following Monday, the patron, a man who had recently moved to Charleston from New York City, where he had worked as a paramedic, told Jackson he "felt harassed by Davis and was concerned about patrons entering the library." (Dkt. No. 38-10 at 1.)
On July 6, 2015, the Plaintiff filed this action to force the Defendants to reconsider and revoke the June 23, 2014 trespass notice so that he again may have access to CCPL's facilities. (Compl. 14.) He also seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $200,000.00. (Id.)

III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW

A. Summary Judgment [*20] 
Summary judgment is appropriate only "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. "[T]he burden on the moving party may be discharged by 'showing'— that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Conversely, "[t]he party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but 'must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Emmett v. Johnson, 532 F.3d 291, 297 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)); see also Francis v. Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 452 F.3d 299, 308 (4th Cir. 2006) ("Mere unsupported speculation is not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion if the undisputed evidence indicates that the other party should win as a matter of law.").

B. The Pro se Pleading
The court is required to liberally construe pro se documents, Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976), holding them to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys, Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9-10, 101 S. Ct. 173, 66 L. Ed. 2d 163 (1980) (per curiam). The mandated liberal construction afforded pro se pleadings means that if the Court can reasonably read the pleadings to state a valid claim on which the plaintiff could prevail, it should do so, but a court may not rewrite a complaint [*21]  to include claims that were never presented, Barnett v. Hargett, 174 F.3d 1128, 1133 (10th Cir. 1999), or construct the plaintiff's legal arguments for him, Small v. Endicott, 998 F.2d 411, 417-18 (7th Cir. 1993), or "conjure up questions never squarely presented" to the court, Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985). Further, the requirement of liberal construction does not mean that the Court can ignore a clear failure in the pleading to allege facts which set forth a claim currently cognizable in a federal district court. Weller v. Department of Social Services, 901 F.2d 387, 391 (4th Cir. 1990).

IV. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS
The Plaintiff filed his disability discrimination claim under the ADA and his civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that his First Amendment right to freedom of speech, and his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection were violated when he was banned from CCPL.
In their Motion for Summary Judgment, the Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiff's ADA claim because he has failed to prove one or more essential elements, and on the Plaintiff's § 1983 claims because he has failed to produce evidence that his rights under the United States Constitution have been violated. (Dkt. No. 38-1 at 5-8; 8-14.)
Although the Defendants have not raised the issue whether the County and the Library Board are subject to suit, the court is compelled to do so at this time. Clearly, the South [*22]  Carolina General Assembly intended that counties have access to the courts. See S.C. Code § 4-1-10 (1986) (A county has the power to sue and be sued). However, it does not appear that the Library Board has a similar access to the courts. "Because county library boards are created by statute with the aid of county councils, they only possess the powers afforded to them by the Legislature and the county council." Op. S.C. Atty. Gen., 2011 S.C. AG LEXIS 80, 2011 WL 2214064, at *1 (May 6, 2011) (citing City of Newberry v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., Inc., 387 S.C. 254, 692 S.E.2d 510 (S.C. 2010); Responsible Econ. Dev. v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 371 S.C. 547, 641 S.E.2d 425 (S.C. 2007)). The Attorney General's opinion had been issued in response to a question as to whether a library board could raise property taxes to improve its county library facilities. Id. In its analysis, the Attorney General first noted that neither S.C. Code §§ 4-9-36 nor -37 gave county library boards the express ability to impose property taxes. Id. The Attorney General then reviewed § 4-6-36(9), which allowed county library boards to "take any actions deemed necessary and proper by the board to establish, equip, operate and maintain an effective library system within limits of approved appropriations of county council[,]" and found it did not grant county library boards an implied authority to assess a tax. Id. Further, it found that a county council could not delegate its authority to levy a tax to a library board. [*23]  Id. In conclusion, the Attorney General noted that county councils, not county library boards, were statutorily obligated to fund county libraries. 2011 S.C. AG LEXIS 80, [WL] at *2 (citing S.C. Code § 4-9-39).
Applying the reasoning of that opinion to the case at hand, the General Assembly has not expressly given county library boards the power to sue and be sued. Absent such specific statutory authority, it would appear that the Library Board cannot be sued. See Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. Casualty Ins. Co. v. Parker, 282 S.C. 546, 555, 320 S.E.2d 458, 463 (S.C. Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted) ("A well-established rule of statutory construction is expressio unius est exclusion alterius, which means that the enumeration of particular things excludes the idea of something else not mentioned. Under the rule, exceptions made in a statute give rise to a strong inference that no other exceptions were intended."). Therefore, as a threshold matter, the court finds that the Library Board is not subject to suit, and recommends that it be dismissed from this action with prejudice. Nonetheless, because the District Court may disagree with this conclusion, the court will proceed to address the merits of the Plaintiff's case against the Library Board.

V. The ADA

A. Introduction
"The [ADA] prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major [*24]  areas of public life: employment, under Title I, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117; public services, under Title II, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165; and public accommodations, under Title III, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182-12189." A Helping Hand, LLC v. Baltimore Cty., 515 F.3d 356, 361 (4th Cir. 2008) (citing Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 516-17, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004)). To maintain an action under Title I of the ADA, a plaintiff first must exhaust administrative remedies. See 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a). In contrast, neither Title II nor Title III requires administrative exhaustion prior to filing suit. See, e.g., Roe v. County Comm'n, 926 F. Supp. 74, 77 (N.D.W. Va. 1996) (citations omitted) (Title II); McInerney v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., 505 F.3d 135, 138 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (Title III). As discussed below, the Plaintiff's claims fall within Titles II and III of the ADA and thus he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing this action.

B. Whether the County or the Library Board is immune from suit under the ADA 1. Qualified Immunity
The court previously found that "[qualified immunity does not apply to either Defendant in the case at bar," (R&R 9, Dkt. No. 19), and neither of the Defendants challenges this conclusion.

2. Eleventh Amendment immunity

a. The County
Although the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states and any state instrumentality properly characterized as an "arm of the state," Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429-30, 117 S. Ct. 900, 137 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1997), Congress has abrogated the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to ADA actions. Lane, 541 U.S. at 518 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12202) ("A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court [*25]  of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter."). As the Fourth Circuit has held, "[this provision clearly and unambiguously expresses congressional intent to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to claims brought under the ADA." Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 484 (4th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, Eleventh Amendment immunity "does not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations . . . . " Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280-81, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977); see also Cash v. Granville Cty. Bd. of Educ., 242 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). Thus, the County is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and the Plaintiff may bring his ADA action against it.

b. The Library Board
As a threshold matter, the court must address whether the Library Board is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. In its R&R, the court had noted: "It is not clear from the Complaint whether the Board is an arm of the state or the County. Therefore dismissing the Board under the Eleventh Amendment is premature at this time. . . . This court . . . does not have enough information to determine if [Eleventh Amendment immunity] applies to the Board." (R&R 9.) The Library Board did not respond to the court's request for clarification of this issue, and it does not address the question whether it is amenable to suit.
As has been noted, Eleventh Amendment immunity does not extend to counties. Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280-81. The court finds that the Library Board is an arm of the county because each county council [*26]  was statutorily authorized to establish a county public library system within the county. See S.C. Code Ann. § 4-9-35. Furthermore, the Library Board is a "continuing function of county government" pursuant to S.C. Code § 4-9-35(A). Because the Library Board functions as a part of Charleston County, the court concludes that it is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. In conclusion, the Plaintiff may bring his ADA action against the Library Board.
Furthermore, to the extent that the Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief in the form of renewed access to CCPL, the Library Board is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trs. of Loudoun Cty. Library, 2 F. Supp. 2d 783, 790 (E.D. Va. 1998) (citing Gray v. Laws, 51 F.3d 426, 430 n.1 (4th Cir. 1995) ("A state and its officers are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment protection . . . where a plaintiff seeks only prospective, injunctive relief.")). Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Plaintiff's § 1983 action for injunctive relief against the Library Board.

C. The Plaintiff's claim against the County pursuant to Title II

1. The County is a "public entity"
Title II of the ADA applies to a "public entity," which is defined as "any State or local government; [or] any department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government . . . ." 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1)(A) & (B). Title II applies to "the services, programs, or activities of a public [*27]  entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The court finds that the County falls within the ADA's definition of public entity. See Pombrio v. Villaraigosa, No. CV 10-5604-GHK (MAN), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110504, 2010 WL 4181340, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 15, 2010) (finding that the County of Los Angeles was a local governmental entity and therefore a public entity under the ADA).

2. Establishing a prima facie case under Title II against the County
To establish a prima facie case under Title II of the ADA, the Plaintiff must show that: "(1) [he] has a disability, (2) [he] is otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of a public service, program, or activity, and (3) [he] was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such service, program, or activity, or otherwise discriminated against, on the basis of [his] disability." Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498; 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462, 467 (4th Cir. 1999). "A plaintiff seeking relief under Title II of the ADA must prove that disability 'played a motivating role' in the adverse action[.]" Constantine, 411 F.3d at 498 n.17 (citing Baird, 192 F.3d at 469-70).
Under Title II, a plaintiff may "pursue three distinct grounds for relief: (1) intentional discrimination or disparate treatment; (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make reasonable accommodations." A Helping Hand, 515 F.3d at 362 (citations omitted). The court construes the Plaintiff's complaint as alleging claims for intentional discrimination and disparate [*28]  treatment due to his mental disability.

a. Whether the Plaintiff has a disability
The ADA defines "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Major life activities "include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A).
In his complaint, the Plaintiff alleges, in part, that he is "a mental health outpatient who suffers from [PTSD], major depression, and anti-social personality disorder." (Compl. 3.) He refers to his "mental health condition" and his "mental health disabilities," and claims that "the defendants have violated plaintiff's federal civil rights as an american with disabilities." (Id. 9, 12 (emphasis in original)). In its R&R, the court found that the Plaintiff had pled a "disability" sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss, and the District Court adopted the R&R as the order of the Court. (See R&R 5; Order [*29]  1.) In their motion for summary judgment, the Defendants do not challenge whether the Plaintiff has a "disability" as defined in the ADA, but argue that the "plaintiff has provided no evidence that Defendants treated him differently than non-disabled patrons or that any of their conduct regarding Plaintiff was motivated by him being disabled." (Defs.' Mem. 7, Dkt. No. 38-1.) As the Defendants appear to have conceded this issue, the court will assume, without deciding, that the Plaintiff has a disability under the ADA.

b. Whether the Plaintiff is "otherwise qualified"
A plaintiff is "otherwise qualified" if he is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). The Plaintiff used CCPL facilities until he received the Trespass Warning, and therefore it can be inferred that he was qualified to receive the benefits provided by CCPL. See, e.g., Elliott v. Spencer, 1:15CV813, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38605, 2017 WL 1047333, at *3 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 17, 2017) (It could be reasonably inferred that a student who had participated in a school program until he [*30]  was terminated was qualified for the program.). Thus, the court concludes that the Plaintiff is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.

c. Whether the Plaintiff was discriminated against because of his disability
Next, for the Plaintiff to prevail on his Title II claim, he must prove that some act attributable to the County caused him either to be "excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, a program or service offered by a public entity, or subjected to discrimination by that entity." Constantine, 411 F.3d at 499 (emphasis added); see also Bacon v. City of Richmond, 475 F.3d 633, 639-40 (4th Cir. 2007) (same); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12132.
The Plaintiff's claim against the County fails on this point, because he does not argue that the County played any role whatsoever in the decision to ban him from CCPL. In fact, the Plaintiff does not make any specific claims against the County at all—he merely refers, throughout his complaint and his response, to the "Defendants."4 A close reading of the Plaintiff's complaint reveals that the County is specifically named only in the caption, and in the prayer for relief, where the Plaintiff asks the court to "[d]irect the defendants (including County of Charleston) to promptly pay the plaintiff compensatory, punitive, and equitable monetary [*31]  damages awards totaling $200,000,00[.]" (Compl. 1, 14.) Furthermore, the Plaintiff does not specifically refer to the County in his response. (Resp., Dkt. No. 41). Instead, the Plaintiff's response focuses on the wrongful actions taken by CCPL staff. For example, he states "that the defendants (library staff) are responsible or contributively [sic] responsible in all of those incidents" that were reported by the staff, and blames "the collective actions of numerous libraries staff members in [] reporting and/or misreporting every minute manner or act of the plaintiff and employing exclusionary, provocative, and incendiary manners/tactics toward plaintiff[.]" (Resp. 11 & 16 (emphases added.))
It is clear to the court that the County had no role in the decision-making process that led to the Plaintiff being banned from CCPL facilities. First, Henderson's actions cannot be imputed to the County, because as Library Director, he reports to the Library Board, not to the County. See Op. S.C. Att'y Gen., Mar. 27, 2014, 2014 S.C. AG LEXIS 26, 2014 WL 1284637, at *4 (quoting Op. S.C. Att'y Gen., July 11, 2008, 2008 S.C. AG LEXIS 102, 2008 WL 3198122) (library directors "are under the supervision and responsible to their respective library boards, rather than to their counties.")). [*32]  Second, although the Library Board promulgated the Code of Conduct, the Library Board's acts cannot be imputed to the County because the County does not control the Library Board. See Op. S.C. Att'y Gen., July 28, 2014, 2014 S.C. AG LEXIS 79, 2014 WL 3886690, at *2 ("[S]ection 4-9-35 empowers the library board of trustees to 'control and manage' the county public library systems . . . [which] means that the county council dismissed the § 1983 claims against the County in its April 12, 2016 Order. (See Resp. at 16, Dkt. No. 41; see also Dkt. No. 23 (Order)). does not control the library system . . . [and] the county administrator is not responsible for the administration of the library board of trustees.").
Because the County had no role whatsoever in the decision to ban the Plaintiff from CCPL, his ADA claim against the County cannot stand. "[T]o impose responsibility in the absence of fault and causation would stretch the law of remedies beyond limit. . . . Title II . . . cannot be read to impose strict liability on public entities that neither caused plaintiffs to be excluded nor discriminated against them." Bacon, 475 F.3d at 639-40. In Bacon, the district court had ordered the City of Richmond to provide funding for a city-wide retrofitting of its schools to make them [*33]  ADA compliant, even though the School Board had exclusive control over the schools. Id. at 639. The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the City could not be liable "in the express absence of fault and causation." Id. at 639-40. In the present case, the County played no role whatsoever in the decision to ban the Plaintiff from CCPL, and thus it did not discriminate against him or subject him to disparate treatment. Therefore, it is recommended that the County be dismissed with prejudice from this action.

D. The Plaintiff's claim against the Library Board pursuant to Title III

1. The Library Board operates a place of "public accommodation"
Title III of the ADA forbids discrimination "on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (emphasis added). A library falls within Title III's definition of "public accommodation." See 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(H) ("The following private entities are considered public accommodations . . . a museum, library, gallery, or other place of public display or collection"); see also Robertson v. Foster, C.A. No. ELH-16-3610, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42921, 2017 WL 1104664, at *5 (D. Md. Mar. 23, 2017)  [*34] ("[L]ibraries are specifically enumerated as public accommodations that are covered by the ADA.").5
The Plaintiff seeks to have the Library Board restore his library privileges, and he also asks for an award of money damages. Although Title III of the ADA provides for injunctive relief, it does not provide a private cause of action for money damages. Thomas v. The Salvation Army S. Territory, 841 F.3d 632, 638 (4th Cir. 2016) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and Ervine v. Desert View Reg'l Med. Ctr. Holdings, 753 F.3d 862, 867 (9th Cir. 2014) ("Damages are not an available remedy to individuals under Title III of the ADA; individuals may receive only injunctive relief.")). This is so because, under 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1), the remedies under Title III of the ADA are identical to those under 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(a); see also Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 401-02, 88 S. Ct. 964, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263 (1968) (per curiam) (holding that 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(a) provides no basis for an award of compensatory damages). Having determined the relief that is potentially available to the Plaintiff, the court turns to whether he has established a prima facie case under Title III.

2. Establishing a prima facie case under Title III against the Library Board
To establish a claim of disability discrimination under Title III, a plaintiff must show: "(1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and [*35]  (3) the defendant denied the plaintiff public accommodations because of his disability." Callum v. CVS Health Corp., 137 F. Supp. 3d 817, 839 (D.S.C. 2015) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a)-(b); Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010); Camarillo v. Carrols Corp., 518 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam))).
As previously stated, the court has assumed, without deciding, that the Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Having thus established the first prong of the test, the court finds that the second prong is likewise established, because the Library Board operates CCPL, which is a "public accommodation." The crucial issue, however, is whether the Library Board denied the Plaintiff the use of CCPL's facilities because of his disability. Discrimination with respect to Title III is defined in relevant part as "a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i). Importantly, the "reasonable modifications" requirement is subject to three limitations. First, modifications are not required where they would "fundamentally alter" the nature of the public accommodation's goods and services. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii). Second, modifications are not required if the entity can demonstrate that taking such [*36]  steps would result in an undue burden, such as significant difficulty or expense. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii); see also 28 C.F.R. § 36.104 (defining undue burden). Third, modifications are not required if doing so would pose a "direct threat" to the health or safety of others. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(3). The "direct threat" exception provides:
Nothing in this subchapter shall require an entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of such entity where such individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The term "direct threat" means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.
Id. "The 'direct threat' exception . . . allows discrimination if a disability 'poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.'" Haas v. Wyo. Valley Health Care Sys., 465 F. Supp. 2d 429, 435 (M.D. Pa. 2006) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(3)); see also Blind Indus. & Servs. of Md .v. Route 40 Paintball Park, C.A. No. WMN-11-3562, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172331, 2012 WL 6087489, at *4 (Dec. 5, 2012) ("the direct threat defense certainly encompasses as 'others' the other individuals in [a] group").
The "direct threat" exception is "a complete defense to ADA claims." Hebert v. Churchill Downs Inc., No. NA 01-254-C B/G, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4467, 2004 WL 541038, at *3 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 2, 2004). [*37]  In Hebert, the court presumed that the plaintiff, an alcoholic jockey, would be able to show that he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4467, [WL] at *2. The court then held that Churchill Downs was a place of public accommodation under Title III, and that it was prohibited from denying the plaintiff "equal access to racing at its tracks on the basis of his disability, unless allowing him to race would fundamentally alter the nature of the 'goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations' provided by it to the public." Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)). In response, the defendant argued that the plaintiff's alcoholism was a direct threat to the safety of others at the racetrack, and that the threat could not be reduced or eliminated by a reasonable accommodation. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4467, [WL] at *3. The defendant also set forth uncontroverted evidence of the dangers posed by thoroughbred horse races, as well as the danger created if an impaired jockey rode on the track. Id. The court held that the defendant had shown that the plaintiff was a direct threat to the safety of himself and others, and granted summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's ADA claim. Id.
In the present case, the Library [*38]  Board argues that it did not violate the ADA when it banned the Plaintiff from CCPL, but it only banned the Plaintiff from its premises after several instances "of Plaintiff's inappropriate, threatening, and dangerous behavior on [sic] various library employees." (Defs.' Mem. 8.)
[T]here is no evidence to suggest that Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of any disability or treated Plaintiff differently than non-disabled patrons. Rather, the record reveals that the Defendants upheld Plaintiff's ban from the library based solely on his habitual display of behavior that not only violated the [Code of Conduct], but also jeopardized the security and safety of patrons at the library.
(Id.) The ADA's regulations provide a framework for analyzing whether the Plaintiff posed a direct threat to the health or safety of others who use CCPL's facilities:
In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the [*39]  probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.
28 C.F.R. § 36.208(b). The record before the Library Board clearly established the "nature, duration and severity of the risk" the Plaintiff posed to others beginning on March 17, 2015. On that date, Welle, a male staff member, assisted the Plaintiff with photocopying, and found the Plaintiff's attitude "borderline inappropriate," "downright rude," and "intimidating." Two weeks later, on March 31, 2015, the Plaintiff was "loud and argumentative" with Cawley, causing staff members Thompson, French, and Gray to come to her assistance, along with Security Officer Ledford, followed by Jackson. The Plaintiff was speaking so loudly that he could be heard by staff in the adjacent workroom. Both Cawley and Jackson described the Plaintiff's behavior as inappropriate; Jackson observed that CCPL staff were "intimidated" by the Plaintiff.
Approximately six weeks later, on May 13, 2015, the Plaintiff became hostile to Bennett, and "started yelling" at her, causing Jackson, as well as two security officers, to attempt [*40]  to intervene. One security officer who observed the Plaintiff "yelling" at Bennett asked the Plaintiff to "lower his voice and to be patient," which caused the Plaintiff to "proceed to yell at" the security officer. When the other security officer asked the Plaintiff to lower his voice, the Plaintiff challenged him, asking: "What is this, White supremacy?" One security officer described the Plaintiff's behavior towards Bennett and others as "agitated" and "demanding." The other security officer described the Plaintiff as "hostile to the staff," and when Jackson approached the Plaintiff, "he got really hostile and started to fling his arms around." The Plaintiff was "very loud and agitated" by this time, and "continued to rant." He repeatedly was asked to lower his voice by Jackson and by a security officer, which prompted the Plaintiff "start[] aggressively waving his arms," causing Jackson to conclude that "Grant was displaying symptoms of becoming violent." Jackson characterized the Plaintiff's behavior that day as "aggressive and at the point of being violent" and was concerned for the safety of herself and her staff. A library patron who had witnessed the scene told Jackson that [*41]  he was concerned for her safety.
Applying the criteria of the regulation to the facts at hand, it is clear that the Library Board had ample evidence of the nature and the severity of the risk that the Plaintiff presented. Second, there was a high probability that a potential injury would actually occur, given the evidence of the Plaintiff's escalating hostility towards CCPL staff during the time at issue.6 The Plaintiff was twice described as flailing his arms in anger, and Jackson was rightfully concerned that the Plaintiff's escalating verbal hostility towards her and other CCPL staff could lead to injury. In fact, Jackson expressed fear for her own safety, as well as for the safety of the staff. Finally, Jackson noted in her May 26, 2015 memorandum that the Plaintiff's "disruptive behavior . . . was on the brink of violence." (Dkt. No. 38-8 at 2.) Jackson stated that although she and CCPL staff had compassion for the Plaintiff, his "problems cannot be used as an excuse for his disruptive behavior . . . which is unacceptable behavior in the library." (Id.) Furthermore, the Plaintiff's "disruptive behavior has terrorized staff because of the potential of violence to them and to the [*42]  public." (Id.)
Lastly, it does not appear that CCPL could reduce or eliminate the Plaintiff's direct threat towards others by making a reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification for him. CCPL's facilities are public, which means that CCPL staff, as well as library patrons, will always be present during the times that the facilities are open. As Jackson sagely observed:
If we excuse [the Plaintiff's] disruptive behavior caused by his problems, then we are setting a trend for others to expect their disruptive behavior to be excused because of their problems. The reversal of this trespass would result in our library no longer being safe and secure for children, teens, adults or staff. We would then have a library in chaos.
(Dkt. No. 38-8 at 2.) In fact, the Plaintiff has acknowledged that the Library must be operated "for the safety and wellbeing of staff and customers, as well as the effective and good operation of the facilities." (Resp. 17).
In his deposition, the Plaintiff insisted that he always acted appropriately at the Library. (Pl.'s Dep. 12:8-11, Dkt. No. 38-12.) According to the Plaintiff, Jackson conspired with CCPL staff to ban him from CCPL, although there is absolutely [*43]  no evidence in the record, except his own testimony, to support this notion. At the Plaintiff's deposition, the following colloquy occurred:
Q: . . . The evidence you put forth in your lawsuit for my clients' alleged violations of the [ADA], you're saying that they banned you from the library on the basis of your disability, and to prove that you're saying they concocted some lies in these incident reports?
A: The incident reports are concocted lies.
Q: And that's the evidence, that's all the evidence you have of your alleging they discriminated against you?
A: I will say, also, and both those matters, where Ms. Jackson come looming over me, and confronting me, for no apparent cause, is evidence that it was all a scheme.
(Pl.'s Dep. 63:12-64:1, Dkt. No. 38-12.) The Plaintiff has not provided the court with any evidence, beyond his own testimony, that any person at CCPL "schemed" against him. Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence that the Plaintiff was treated differently than a non-disabled patron, or that the decision of the Library Board to ban him from CCPL's facilities was motivated by his disability. Instead, the evidence of record shows that the Plaintiff was consistently [*44]  loud, disrespectful, and rude to Library staff, in violation of the rule prohibiting "[c]reating any loud, unreasonable and/or disturbing actions — by an individual[.]" (Dkt. No. 38-13 at 4.) In addition, the threatening manner the Plaintiff exhibited towards Library staff was in direct violation of the rule forbidding "[t]hreatening behavior toward another person, either verbally or physically[.]" (Id.)
To be sure, "the ADA confers no right to be rude." Kiel v. Select Artificials, Inc., 169 F.3d 1131, 1136 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Case law relevant to this issue makes a distinction between discrimination based on a disability (which is generally prohibited by the ADA) and adverse decisions motivated by the misconduct of the disabled person (which is not prohibited by the ADA).
Many Title III cases arise in the educational environment, and these cases provide guidance in the instant case. For example, a student who took medication to treat his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and anxiety disorder was dismissed from medical school due to his unprofessional conduct. Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Servs., 669 F.3d 454, 457 (4th Cir. 2012). The evidence before the district court showed the student had consistently exhibited unprofessional behavior and was unable to follow some of the rules of the medical school; the student blamed the side [*45]  effects of his medication as well as cultural differences. Id. at 457-59. After he was dismissed from the medical school, he filed an action under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, claiming that the medical school failed to make reasonable accommodations for his disability. Id. at 460. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the university on the ground that the student was not "otherwise qualified" as a medical student because he had failed to demonstrate the professionalism required by the medical school's program. Id.
On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the student was not "otherwise qualified" for the medical school's program, given his extensive history of unprofessional behavior. Id. at 464. The court then turned to whether there existed a reasonable accommodation that would have permitted the student to become qualified. Id. Relying on ADA cases in the employment context, the court noted that case law dictated that "'misconduct—even misconduct related to a disability—is not itself a disability' and may be a basis for dismissal." Id. at 465 (citations omitted). After reviewing the record, the court held that "[w]here a professional school has reasonably determined based on an identifiable pattern of prior [*46]  conduct that a student is unfit to join his chosen profession, federal law does not obligate the school to allow that student to remain in and graduate from its educational program." Id. at 466-67. The court concluded that the university did not violate the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 467.
In a similar case, a graduate student alleged that a university discriminated against her on the basis of her mental illness in violation of Title III of the ADA after it expelled her because she was mentally ill. Ascani v. Hofstra Univ., No. 98-7756, 173 F.3d 843 [published in full-text format at 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 7654], 1999 WL 220136, at *1 (2d Cir. Apr. 9, 1999) (Table). The district court granted summary judgment to the university, holding in pertinent part that during the relevant time period the student was a "direct threat" to the safety of others. Id. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling, finding that "[a] student who threatens her professor is not 'otherwise qualified' even if the behavior was precipitated by her mental illness." Id. (citations omitted). In so holding, the Second Circuit noted that "the appellant admits that she frightened her professor and indeed, pleaded guilty to harassment and trespass. Therefore, she was not 'otherwise qualified' to continue as a graduate student at Hofstra University and was likewise a 'direct [*47]  threat' to the safety of others for purposes of the ADA." Id.
In the employment context, it is well settled in this Circuit that an employer may discharge an employee who engages in misconduct, even when that misconduct is related to, or caused by, a disability.7 See, e.g., Darcangelo v. Verizon Md., Inc., 189 F. App'x 217, 218-19 (4th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (affirming grant of summary judgment on ADA claim to employer that discharged bipolar employee who engaged in "aggressive and antagonistic behavior" inconsistent with requirements of her job, notwithstanding evidence "that [such] behavior was related to her bipolar disorder"); Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 104 F.3d 683, 686 n.3 (4th Cir. 1997) (holding that "misconduct—even misconduct related to a disability—is not itself a disability, and [a defendant] is free to terminate an [individual] on that basis."); Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., 31 F.3d 209, 214-15 (4th Cir. 1994) (no discrimination occurred when an employer fired an employee due to disability-related absences); see also Little v. FBI, 1 F.3d 255, 259 (4th Cir. 1993) (no discrimination occurred under the Rehabilitation Act when an employer fired an alcoholic employee for disability-related intoxication while on duty).
In Darcangelo v. Verizon Maryland, Inc., a mentally ill employee filed an ADA claim against her employer after she was terminated. No. Civ. WDQ-02-816, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37660, 2005 WL 1367083, at *4 (D. Md. June 7, 2005). The district court granted summary judgment to the [*48]  employer, holding:
There is no evidence that [the employer] fired [the employee] because of her mental illness, but because she continually violated its code of business conduct by threatening and harassing her coworkers, effectively removing herself from the category of "otherwise qualified" individuals. When an employer fires an employee because of the employee's unacceptable behavior, the fact that the behavior was precipitated by mental illness does not present an issue under the ADA.
Id. In affirming the district court, the Fourth Circuit stated: "[T]he ADA does not require Verizon to subject its employees to Darcangelo's abusive behavior, which, not surprisingly, created considerable anxiety within her work environment, even if that behavior was related to her bipolar disorder." Darcangelo, 189 F. App'x at 219 (citing Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union Nat'l, 192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted) ("The law is well settled that the ADA is not violated when an employer discharges an individual based upon the employee's misconduct, even if the misconduct is related to a disability.")).
The Fourth Circuit falls in line with other Circuits that have held that an employer may discipline or terminate an employee for workplace misconduct caused by a disability. As the First Circuit [*49]  has observed, "the ADA does not require that an employee whose unacceptable behavior threatens the safety of others be retained, even if the behavior stems from a mental disability. Such an employee is not qualified." Calef v. Gillette Co., 322 F.3d 75, 87 (1st Cir. 2003). Likewise, where a male plaintiff who suffered from PTSD claimed that his condition was to blame when he "angrily confronted a physically smaller female manager in front of witnesses" and yelled profanities at her, the Fifth Circuit held that "the ADA does not insulate emotional or violent outbursts blamed on an impairment" when the outburst violates the employer's policy against workplace violence. Hamilton v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998).
Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has ruled that a teacher who admitted he had threatened members of a school board was not otherwise qualified for the job of teaching, because "'threatening other employees disqualifies one' from a job[.]" Sullivan v. River Valley Sch. Dist. 197 F.3d 804, 813 (6th Cir. 1999) (quoting Palmer v. Circuit Ct. of Cook Cty., 117 F.3d 351 (7th Cir. 1997)). In Palmer, an employee who had been diagnosed with major depression and delusional (paranoid) disorder was terminated after she made threatening telephone calls from her home to the office and threatened to kill her supervisor. 117 F.3d at 352. The employee filed an ADA action, claiming discrimination, and the district court granted summary judgment [*50]  to the employer. Id. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding: "There is no evidence that Palmer was fired because of her mental illness. She was fired because she threatened to kill another employee. . . . [I]f an employer fires an employee because of the employee's unacceptable behavior, the fact that that behavior was precipitated by a mental illness does not present an issue under the [ADA]." Id. (citations omitted). Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has ruled that an employer did not discriminate against a deaf employee when it terminated him after he was insubordinate to his supervisor and violated company policy. Kiel, 169 F.3d at 1136 (citations omitted) ("the anti-discrimination statutes do not insulate an employee from discipline for violating the employer's rules or disrupting the workplace.").
In the present case, the Library Board's interest in ensuring a safe environment is likely even greater than an employer's interest in a safe workplace, given the fact that CCPL's facilities are used by people of all ages, including children. Henderson's Trespass Warning specifically stated that the Plaintiff had violated the Code of Conduct due to "Unacceptable behavior: Loud and aggressive tone of voice; [*51]  Calling security an inappropriate name (white supremacist); Failure to comply to [sic] Library Staff's request to lower voice." (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 1.) The evidence before the court ably demonstrates that the Plaintiff's behavior was disruptive to other Library patrons as well as to CCPL staff. In fact, even after the Plaintiff had been banned from CCPL, he harangued patrons entering the Main Library, causing a male patron to feel "harassed" and express concern for other patrons attempting to enter the facility. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the Library Board's decision to uphold the Trespass Warning was motivated by anything other than the Plaintiff's own consistently hostile behavior. "[T]he fact that the behavior was precipitated by mental illness does not present an issue under the ADA." Darcangelo, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37660, 2005 WL 1367083, at *4. Therefore, it is recommended that the Library Board be granted summary judgment on the Plaintiff's ADA claim.

VI. The Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the Library Board

A. Introduction
"To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he was 'deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state [*52]  law.'" Thomas, 841 F.3d at 637 (quoting Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S. Ct. 977, 143 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1999)). The court construes the Plaintiff's § 1983 claim against the Library Board as based on the First Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses.

B. Whether the Library Board is entitled to legislative immunity

1. The Library Board's adoption of the Code of Conduct
The court already has concluded that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Plaintiff's § 1983 action for injunctive relief against the Library Board. However, because the Library Board promulgated the Code of Conduct, the court must determine whether legislative immunity is available to the Library Board for its actions.8
As previously mentioned, the Library Board is appointed by the county council. In Bogan v. Scott-Harris, the Supreme Court unanimously held that not just federal, state, and regional legislators were entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability for their legislative activities, but that "local legislatures are likewise absolutely immune from suit under § 1983 for their legislative activities." 523 U.S. 44, 46, 49, 118 S. Ct. 966, 140 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1998). This immunity attaches to "all actions taken in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity" and extends to "[o]fficials outside the legislative branch . . . when they perform legislative functions[.]" Id. at 54, 55. This legislative immunity applies to claims for declaratory [*53]  and injunctive relief, as well as claims for damages. Supreme Ct. of Va. v. Consumers Union of the U.S., Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 732-33, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641  (1980).
In Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees of Loudoun County Library, a group of library patrons sued the library board under § 1983, alleging that its policy requiring the use of software to block access to adult-oriented websites on the Internet violated the First Amendment. 2 F. Supp. 2d 783, 787 (E.D. Va. 1998) ("Mainstream Loudoun I"). The library board moved to dismiss the action, and the district court held that the library board was entitled to legislative immunity insofar as it had decided to adopt the policy at issue. Id. at 788. In so holding, the district court noted that a section of the Virginia Code specifically gave the library board legislative authority to create and adopt rules and bylaws for the governance of the library system, and that the policy had been enacted pursuant to that authority. Id. Moreover, the policy that had been adopted by the library board was prospective in nature and general in application, and "the Library Board's adoption of the Policy was essentially a discretionary exercise of rulemaking authority." Id. at 788-89. Pursuant to Bogan, the district court concluded that "the Library Board and its members were entitled to absolute immunity for their decision to adopt [*54]  the Policy." Id. at 789.
In the present case, as in Mainstream Loudoun I, a section of the South Carolina Code specifically authorized the Library Board to adopt the Code of Conduct. See S.C. Code § 4-9-37(b) (requiring a library board to "[a]dopt regulations necessary to insure effective operation, maintenance and security of the property of the library system."). In addition, as in Mainstream Loudoun I, the Code of Conduct is prospective in nature and general in application, and an exercise of the Library Board's rulemaking authority. Accordingly, it is recommended that to the extent the Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the Library Board are based upon its adoption of the Code of Conduct, these claims should be dismissed with prejudice.

2. The Library Board's enforcement of the Code of Conduct
The Library Board's enforcement of the code of conduct, however, is a different matter. In Mainstream Loudoun I, although the library board acted in a legislative role when it enacted its policy, it also had to enforce the policy, because state law charged the library board with the "management and control of [the] free public library system." 2 F. Supp. 2d at 789 (citing Va. Code Ann. § 42.1-35). The district court held that the library board's enforcement of the policy was non-legislative [*55]  in nature, and thus the library board was "not entitled to legislative immunity in [its] enforcement role." Id. (citing Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 734-36). In Mainstream Loudoun I, the district court concluded that the plaintiffs could sue the library board for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to § 1983 to prevent it from enforcing the library policy at issue. Id.
Applying the reasoning in Mainstream Loudoun I to the present case, the South Carolina Code states that "[e]ach county public library system shall be controlled and managed by a board of trustees[.]" S.C. Code § 4-9-35(B). Thus, to the extent that the Plaintiff's § 1983 claim against the Library Board for injunctive relief is based upon the Library Board's enforcement of the Code of Conduct, this claim may go forward. Therefore, the court will proceed with its analysis of the constitutional claims advanced by the Plaintiff against the Library Board resulting from its enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

C. The Plaintiff's First Amendment claim against the Library Board
The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . ." U.S. Const. Amend. I. With respect to public libraries, "the First Amendment encompasses the positive right of public access to information and ideas." Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for the Town of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992) (citing Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969)). This "positive [*56]  right" "includes the right to some level of access to a public library, the quintessential locus of the receipt of information." Id. at 1255; accord Neinast v. Bd. of Trs. of the Columbus Metro. Library, 346 F.3d 585, 591 (6th Cir. 2003); see also Doe v. City of Albuquerque, 667 F.3d 1111, 1119 & n.6 (10th Cir. 2012); Lu v. Hulme, 133 F. Supp. 3d 312, 324 (D. Mass. 2015); Rihm v. Hancock Cty. Pub. Library, 954 F. Supp. 2d 840, 855 (S.D. Ind. 2013); Spreadbury v. Bitterroot Pub. Library, 862 F. Supp. 2d 1054, 1056 (D. Mont. 2012); Doyle v. Clark Cty. Pub. Library, No. C-3-07-0003, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 20, 2007); Miller v. Nw. Region Library Bd., 348 F. Supp. 2d 563, 570 (M.D.N.C. 2004); Armstrong v. D.C. Pub. Library, 154 F. Supp. 2d 67, 75 (D.D.C. 2001); Sund v. City of Wichita Falls, 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 548 (N.D. Tex. 2000); Brinkmeier v. City of Freeport, No. 93 C 20039, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9255, 1993 WL 248201, at *3 (N.D. Ill. July 2, 1993).
The Library Board agrees with the proposition that the Plaintiff has a First Amendment right of access to information and ideas, Defs.' Mem. 10, as does the court. However, "the right to receive information is not unfettered and may give way to significant countervailing interests." Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1255; see also Spreadbury, 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1056 (the right of access to a library "is not unqualified"); Rihm, 954 F. Supp. 2d at 855; Tronsen v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Pub. Library, No. 3:08CV148, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, 2008 WL 2622939, at *2 (N.D. Ohio June 30, 2008); Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *5 ("The right of the public to use the public library . . . is not absolute — it can be lost for engaging in conduct inconsistent with the purpose of public libraries . . . ."); Miller, 348 F. Supp. 2d at 570; Brinkmeier, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9255, 1993 WL 248201, at *3 ("[T]here is a First Amendment right to access the . . . [l]ibrary. That right, as is usually the case, is not without limits.").
When considering whether a specific rule or regulation violates the First Amendment, the court first must identify the nature of the forum which the Plaintiff seeks to access. Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983). In Perry, the Supreme Court adopted a "forum" analysis to determine the degree of First Amendment protection afforded to speech on different types of government property, [*57]  and in so doing, identified three types of fora. Id. at 45-47. First, the Court described traditional or "quintessential public forums," such as streets or parks, "used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions." Id. at 45 (citation omitted). The Court then identified "[a] second category [which] consists of public property which the state has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity." Id. (citations omitted). The second category would include university meeting facilities, a school board meeting, or a municipal theater. Id. (citations omitted). The third type of forum consisted of "[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication[.]" Id. at 46. This third category would include a school district's interschool mail system, because it "is not held open to the general public." Id. at 46-47.
Although the Fourth Circuit has not addressed this issue, the Third Circuit in Kreimer relied on Perry and its progeny to hold that a public library was neither a traditional public forum nor a nonpublic forum, but was "a limited public forum, a type of designated public fora." 958 F.2d at 1255-62. In so holding, the court in Kreimer first relied [*58]  on Supreme Court decisions that had held that a municipal theater, a school board meeting, and a public university's meeting places constituted designated public fora. Id. at 1256-58. Next, the Kreimer court examined the government's intent in opening the public library ("namely, 'the communication of the written word'"); the extent of the library's use ("only for specified purposes: reading, studying, [and] using the Library materials" but "not . . . for the exercise of all First Amendment activities"); and the nature of the library ("to aid in the acquisition of knowledge through reading, writing and quiet contemplation"). Id. at 1259-61. Kreimer held that "[a]s a limited public forum, the Library is obligated only to permit the public to exercise rights that are consistent with the nature of the Library and consistent with the government's intent in designating the Library as a public forum." Id. at 1261; accord Neinast, 346 F.3d at 591; Jaffe v. Baltimore Cty. Bd. of Library Trs., No. RDB-08-1437, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130116, 2009 WL 7083368, at *4 (D. Md. Mar. 25, 2009), aff'd, 332 F. App'x 6 (4th Cir. 2009) (per curiam); see also Mainstream Loudoun v. Bd. of Trs. of Loudoun Cty. Library, 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998) ("Mainstream Loudoun II") (The library board of trustees "intended to designate the Loudoun County libraries as public fora for the limited purposes of the expressive activities they provide[.]").
Most courts addressing this issue have relied on Kreimer to hold that a public library is "a limited [*59]  public forum." See Neinast, 346 F.3d at 591; Spreadbury, 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1056; Dolan v. Tavares, C.A. No. 10-10249-NMG, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73601, 2011 WL 10676937, at *10 (D. Mass. May 16, 2011); Jaffe, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130116, 2009 WL 7083368, at *4; Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *4; Hill v. Derrick, No. 4:05-cv-1229, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37676, 2006 WL 1620226, at *6 (M.D. Pa. June 8, 2006), aff'd, 240 F. App'x 935 (3d Cir. 2007) (per curiam); Gay Guardian Newspaper v. Ohoopee Reg'l Library Sys., 235 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1368 (S.D. Ga. 2002), aff'd, 90 F. App'x 386 (11th Cir. 2003) (Table); Armstrong, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 75; Sund, 121 F. Supp. 2d at 548; Mainstream Loudoun II, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 562; Brinkmeier, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9255, 1993 WL 248201, at *4; but see Doe, 667 F.3d at 1130 ("The City's libraries are designated public fora") (analyzing facts using Kreimer); Hawkins v. City & Cty. of Denver, 170 F.3d 1281, 1287 (10th Cir. 1999) ("Examples of designated public fora include: . . . public libraries . . . .") (dicta) (analyzing facts using Kreimer); Lu, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 325 ("[T]he library is a designated public forum.") (citing Doe, Kreimer, and Neinast).
Admittedly, the difference between a limited public forum and a designated public forum is not altogether clear.9 Those courts holding that a library is a limited public forum have used Kreimer's "designated public forum" standard to review library rules that restricted permissible activity (such as reading, writing, and quiet contemplation) in a library. See, e.g., Neinast, 346 F.3d at 591; Spreadbury, 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1056; Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *4; Hill, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37676, 2006 WL 1620226, at *6; Armstrong, 154 F. Supp. 2d at 75-76; Sund, 121 F. Supp. 2d at 547-48; Mainstream Loudoun II, 24 F. Supp. 2d at 563; Brinkmeier, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9255, 1993 WL 248201, at *4. Thus, regardless of whether CCPL is considered a limited public forum or a designated public forum, the paradigm of analysis set forth in Kreimer will apply.
The Kreimer court set forth the following method of analyzing the rules of a public library in light of the First Amendment:
The Supreme Court has indicated that restrictions that do not limit those First Amendment activities the government [*60]  has specifically permitted in the designated public forum need only be reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view. In contrast, time, place or manner regulations that limit permitted First Amendment activities within a designated public forum are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and . . . leave open ample alternative channels for communication of information.
Id. at 1262 (citations omitted). The Third Circuit held that a library's written rule requiring that a patron "shall not harass or annoy others through noisy or boisterous activities, . . . by . . . talking loudly to others . . . or by behaving in a manner which reasonably can be expected to disturb other patrons" was not a challenge to a First Amendment activity based on content or viewpoint. Id. at 1262. Instead, the library's rule merely prohibited conduct "that tends to or is disruptive in a library setting. Prohibiting disruptive behavior is perhaps the clearest and most direct way to achieve maximum library use." Id. at 1263 (cited with approval in Mpala v. City of New Haven, C.A. No. 3:11cv1724(VLB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24320, 2013 WL 657649, at *5 (D. Conn. Feb. 22, 2013), aff'd, 577 Fed. App'x 20 (2d Cir. 2014) (Mem.)); see also Nappi v. Timberline Reg'l Library, No. C14-5945 JRC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83501, 2015 WL 3936308, at *3 (W.D. Wash. June 26, 2015);  [*61] Spreadbury, 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1057; Tronsen, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, 2008 WL 2622939, at *2; Hill, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37676, 2006 WL 1620226, at *6; Shapiro v. City of Va. Beach Cent. Library, No. Civ. A2:06cv28, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102569, 2006 WL 4473469, at *3 (E.D. Va. June 7, 2006), appeal dismissed, 203 F. App'x 526 (4th Cir. Oct. 19, 2006) (per curiam)).
In Kreimer, the rule prohibiting harassing behavior, as a conduct rule, was reviewed under the "reasonableness" standard; the court held that the rule was "fundamentally reasonable" because "the restrictions are not aimed at activities which the government has specifically permitted in the Library . . . [and] to a large extent, the rules regulate non-expressive activity (i.e., activity not protected under the First Amendment)."10 958 F.2d at 1263 n.24. Further, the court held that the rule was not impermissibly void for vagueness because the reference to "annoyance" listed certain specific behaviors that were deemed to be annoying to others. Id. at 1268.
Similarly, in Spreadbury v. Bitterroot Public Library, a district court reviewed a public library rule prohibiting disruptive behavior under the "reasonableness" standard and upheld the library's termination of a patron's right to use the library after the patron intimidated both library staff and other patrons with his "disruptive" behavior. 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1056. In Spreadbury, state law specifically provided that a public library could refuse service [*62]  to anyone who willfully violated a library policy; the policy at issue provided: "Patron behavior that becomes disruptive to other library users or staff or constitutes a public nuisance is not allowed and the person(s) will be asked to leave." Id. (citation omitted). The district court held that the patron had "willfully engaged in behavior that became disruptive. On at least two occasions prior to the termination of his library privileges, he confronted staff in an intimidating manner." Id. The court further found that the patron's conduct fell within the state statute's definition of "willfulness" and held that "a reasonable person would see [the plaintiff's] behavior as disruptive." Id. Accordingly, the court upheld the library's revocation of the patron's library privileges, reasoning that "the ban furthered the government's significant interest in maintaining the peaceful character of a library." Id. at 1057 (citing Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 142, 86 S. Ct. 719, 15 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1966) (a library is "a place dedicated to quiet, to knowledge, and to beauty.")).
In Tronsen v. Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, the district court likewise reviewed a library's restriction on disruptive behavior using the "reasonableness" standard. In that case, the library board's [*63]  written code of conduct prohibited library patrons from "[e]ngaging in any act, which clearly disrupts or prevents the normal and intended use of the public library by any other patrons or staff." Id., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, 2008 WL 2622939, at *2. After a male library patron gave a threatening note to a female patron, she reported the incident to library security officers, and the male patron was given notice that he had violated the code of conduct and was banned from the library for six months. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, [WL] at *1. He did not pursue the library's administrative appeal process, but filed a federal action alleging that the library had violated his First Amendment right to access the library. Id. The district court granted summary judgment to the library, holding that "the plaintiff disrupted the female patron's right to quiet enjoyment of her time and activity in the library. Approaching another patron and handing her a note that she found to be offensive is not protected speech under the First Amendment." Id. Relying on Kreimer's holding that "[p]rohibiting disruptive behavior is perhaps the clearest and most direct way to achieve maximum Library use," the district court found the library's rule prohibiting disruptive conduct to be "fundamentally reasonable" and upheld the patron's suspension of privileges. [*64]  2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, [WL] at *2 (citing Kreimer, 958 F.2d at 1263); see also Shapiro, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102569, 2006 WL 44773469, at *2-*3 (The court dismissed a public library patron's claim that his three-month suspension of privileges violated the ADA or § 1983 when the plaintiff admitted in his complaint that his "disrespectful" conduct had violated library rules and resulted in being reprimanded by library staff); Mpala, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24320, 2013 WL 657649, at *1, *5 (A library patron who had been ordered to leave a public library after a librarian accused him of creating a disturbance failed to allege that his speech was protected under the First Amendment; the district court held that "it is well established that restrictions on talking and other disruptive behavior in a library are fundamentally reasonable under the First Amendment.") (citations omitted); see also Brinkmeier, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9255, 1993 WL 248201, at *5 ("[A] rule which prohibits disruptive behavior in a public library is at least conceptually inoffensive to the First Amendment"); accord Tronsen, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121638, 2008 WL 2622939, at *2; Hill, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37676, 2006 WL 1620226, at *2-*9 (A library rule prohibiting the hitting of other patrons was reviewed for reasonableness and upheld as "ensur[ing] the comfort and security of patrons and library staff").
In the present case, the Plaintiff does not argue that his First Amendment rights were violated because of the content of his speech; instead, he claims that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was denied access to CCPL's facilities as the consequence [*65]  of having violated the rules prohibiting "loud unreasonable, and or disturbing actions" and "[t]hreatening behavior toward another person, either verbally or physically[.]" Accordingly, the rules at issue will be reviewed for reasonableness.
The challenged rules prohibit conduct that is not protected under the First Amendment, or that exceeds the First Amendment purposes to which a public library is dedicated. It is well-established that a library board may issue rules prohibiting disruptive conduct, so long as it enforces the rules in "a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner, equally applicable to all and administered with equality to all." Brown, 383 U.S. at 143. The court agrees with the other courts that have uniformly held that a rule which prohibits disruptive behavior in a public library does not offend the First Amendment. In the present case, the Code of Conduct clearly identifies the conduct expected of those who used CCPL's facilities. Indeed, at his deposition, the Plaintiff agreed with the proposition that a person cannot talk in a loud and aggressive manner because it posed a risk to the safety and reputation of CCPL. (Pl. Dep. 64:6-12, Dkt. No. 38-12 at 4.) The Plaintiff was aware of these rules, and, in fact, had been cautioned by various CCPL [*66]  library personnel to lower his voice several times during the incident on May 13, 2015. The Code of Conduct's rules prohibiting disruptive or threatening conduct are reasonable, and were passed by the Library Board to ensure "the comfort and safety of patrons, volunteers, and staff . . . ." (Dkt. No. 41-1 at 6.) Certainly, prohibiting loud and disruptive conversation and authorizing the loss of CCPL privileges as a punishment for such conduct is a reasonable means of furthering the goals of providing a comfortable and safe library for all—patrons and staff alike. For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the Plaintiff's First Amendment claim fails on the merits, and it is recommended that this claim against the Library Board be dismissed with prejudice.

D. The Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against the Library Board
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property may only be done through due process of law. U.S. Const. amend. XIV § 1; see also Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 570, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972). A procedural due process claim requires a two-part analysis: "[W]hether [the Plaintiff] was deprived of a protected interest, and, if so, what process was . . . due." Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 428, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1982)).
The Plaintiff claims that "Jackson violated plaintiff's federal [*67]  Constitutional rights to . . . due process of law[,]" (Compl. 13), but he does not specify whether he contends he was deprived of a liberty interest or a property interest. Both the Defendants and this court assume that the Plaintiff is alleging that he has a constitutional liberty interest in access to a public library. (See Defs.' Mem. 11.) Therefore, the court must first determine whether the Plaintiff possesses such a protected liberty interest, and, if so, whether the procedures employed in depriving the Plaintiff of that interest were constitutionally sufficient. Miller, 348 F. Supp. 2d at 570 (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); Roth, 408 U.S. at 569).

1. Whether the Plaintiff has a protected liberty interest in access to the Library
The court does not find any authority in this Circuit as to whether the plaintiff has a protected liberty interest in access to a public library. Outside the Circuit, the few courts that have addressed this issue are divided as to whether the inability to access a public library implicates a cognizable liberty interest. Several courts have held that a library patron enjoys a protected liberty interest, based on the Constitution, in having access to a public library. See, e.g., Nappi, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83501, 2015 WL 3936308, at *3 ("Arguably, the suspension of library privileges [*68]  involves a cognizable liberty interest"); Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *5 ("The right of the public to use the public library is best characterized as a protected liberty interest created directly by the First Amendment."); Miller, 348 F. Supp. 2d at 570 ("The First Amendment includes the 'positive right of public access to information and ideas.'"). Other courts are doubtful as to whether a person has a protected liberty interest in access to a public library. See, e.g., Mpala, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24320, 2013 WL 657649, at *3 ("It is . . . far from clear whether Mpala's inability to use the library for a week implicated a cognizable federal liberty interest."); Rihm, 954 F. Supp. 2d at 856 (The plaintiff "does not provide any authority that use of the library is indeed a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment nor is the court aware of any."). A few courts have held that a protected liberty interest does not flow from the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, but from state law. Wayfield v. Town of Tisbury, 925 F. Supp. 880, 884-85 (D. Mass 1996); Hill, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37676, 2006 WL 1620226, at *7-8.
The Defendants appear to concede that the Plantiff's liberty interest in using a public library flows from the First Amendment, Defs.' Mem. 10, and this court agrees. Nonetheless, this liberty interest "is not absolute—it can be lost for engaging in conduct inconsistent with the purpose of public libraries . . . ." Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *5; see also Hunt v. Wise, No. 8:07-cv-1168-T-30TGW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61586, 2009 WL 2163108, at * 6 (M.D. Fla. July 17, 2009) ("The Court agrees that Plaintiff's First Amendment right to enjoy the [public] [*69]  Library could be curtailed if he acted in a threatening manner.").

2. Whether the Plaintiff's procedural due process rights were violated
Having determined that the Plaintiff has a cognizable liberty interest in using CCPL's facilities, the court must decide whether he was afforded sufficient due process when he was deprived of that protected interest. In this context, all that is required is that a library board provide the patron with notice that the patron is banned from the library, the reasons for the ban, and an opportunity to be heard so that he may present his side of the story. Neinast, 346 F.3d at 598; Nappi, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83501, 2015 WL 3936308, at *1; Spreadbury, 862 F. Supp. 2d at 1056-57; Doyle, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60923, 2007 WL 2407051, at *5; cf. Miller, 348 F. Supp. 2d at 570-71 (A library patron was held to have stated a claim for a violation of procedural due process when he had not been given any explanation of the violation, the charges against him, or the penalty to be imposed; he also alleged he was not given any right to appeal or any opportunity to present his side of the story.).
In the present case, the Plaintiff was afforded constitutionally-sufficient process. Jackson gave the Plaintiff a written notice of the Trespass Warning, which advised him of his violations of the Code of Conduct. (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 1.) The Trespass Warning also advised him of the [*70]  appeals process. (Id.) The Plaintiff appealed the Trespass Warning, and when he missed the first Library Board meeting on May 26, 2015, he was permitted to appear before the Library Board at another meeting and was given the opportunity to address the Library Board before it rendered a final decision. (Dkt. No. 38-6 at 4.)
The court finds that the Plaintiff was provided adequate procedural protections because he was given notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard. Nothing more was required. The Plaintiff has failed to show how the process he received was constitutionally insufficient. Therefore, it is recommended that the Plaintiff's due process claim be dismissed.

E. The Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim
"The Equal Protection Clause prohibits state actors from subjecting individuals with disabilities to treatment that lacks any rational relationship to a legitimate state interest." Lewis v. N.C. Agr. & Tech. State Univ., No. 1:09-CV-724, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39478, 2010 WL 1630814, at *2 n.4 (M.D.N.C. Apr. 21, 2010) (citing Brown v. North Carolina DMV, 166 F.3d 698, 706-07 (4th Cir. 1999); Doe v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 50 F.3d 1261, 1267 (4th Cir. 1995))). An equal protection claim arises when, without adequate justification, similarly-situated persons are treated differently by a governmental entity. U.S. Const. amend XIV. "To succeed on an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he has been treated [*71]  differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination." Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001). If that is shown, "the court proceeds to determine whether the disparity in treatment can be justified under the requisite level of scrutiny." Id.
The Plaintiff alleges in his complaint that he given the trespass warning "as a result of [CCPL staff's] discrimination and segregation towards plaintiff on the ground of and inspite [sic] of plaintiff's mental health disabilities." (Compl. 12.) He contends that his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated as a result of being banned from the Library. (Compl. 13.)
Under the rational basis standard of review, to establish a violation of the Equal Protection clause based on disability discrimination, the Plaintiff must show that (1) the Library Board treated him differently than it treated non-disabled persons; and (2) there was no rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and a legitimate governmental purpose. Torres v. Bowles, C.A. No. 7:07cv00600, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43831, 2008 WL 2310689, at *2 (W.D. Va. June 4, 2008). Here, the Plaintiff's equal protection claim fails as a matter of law because he has offered no evidence that could lead the court to infer that (1) he was intentionally [*72]  discriminated against by the Library Board because of his mental disability, or (2) he was treated differently from other similarly situated patrons. Furthermore, although the Plaintiff alleges that Jackson and other CCPL staff conspired to concoct a scheme to have him banned from CCPL, and the incident reports were created to support this scheme, the Plaintiff offers no proof in support of this notion. Instead, the evidence before the court shows that the Plaintiff received a Trespass Warning not because of any disability, but because of a series of documented instances of inappropriate, hostile, and threatening behavior directed toward Jackson and CCPL staff, as witnessed by both staff and library patrons. The Plaintiff has offered no evidence that he was treated differently from other disabled persons. Therefore, it is recommended that the Plaintiff's Equal Protection claim against the Library Board be dismissed with prejudice.

VII. CONCLUSION
Wherefore, it is RECOMMENDED that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 38) be GRANTED in its entirety, and that this action be dismissed with prejudice.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
