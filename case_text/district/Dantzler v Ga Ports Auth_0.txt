Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Before the Court is Defendant Georgia Ports Authority's ("GPA") Motion for Summary Judgment, doe. 32, to which Plaintiff Mary N. Dantzler has filed a response, doe. 36. Dantzler brought this suit contending that GPA discriminated against her when it failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability and then terminated her employment. See doc. 11 at 12, ¶ 65 (Amended Complaint); doc. 19 at 14, ¶ 65 (date of plaintiffs termination). GPA contends first, that it has presented an unrebutted, non-pretextual, non-discriminatory reason for Dantzler's termination, see doc. 32-1 at 12-14, second, that Dantzler has failed to state a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim, see id. at 14-21, and, finally, that GPA is entitled to partial summary judgment based on its discovery, during litigation, of Dantzler's misconduct, see id. at 21-24. For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion should be GRANTED.

BACKGROUND1
Mary Dantzler was a GPA employee in the Trade Development Group. Doc. 32-2 at 1, (GPA's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts). She was initially [*2]  hired as an Administrative Specialist, and was later promoted to the position of "Market Research Analyst" in 2012. Doc. 36 at 1-2. While she admits that her annual performance ratings as an Administrative Specialist ranged from the low to mid-30s out of 50 available points, it was after her promotion that more serious issues arose. Id. at 1. Dantzler's performance was criticized and she acknowledged that she frequently made mistakes. Doc. 32-3 at 25. She had a fraught relationship with her supervisors, particularly Jennifer Tatom and John Petrino. Doc. 36 at 7 (disputing GPA's characterization that she felt "hostility" toward Ms. Tatom and Petrino, but conceding she was afraid of them). And on at least one occasion, she complained that she was inadequately trained. Id. at 2. In 2015, Dantzler became concerned that she might suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD").2 Id. Shortly thereafter, Dantzler informed GPA's EEOC officer that Dantzler believed that she had a disability and that this disability was responsible for her performance problems. Id. at 3. A medical evaluation confirmed her suspicions and she received an official diagnosis in July of 2015, although she did not immediately [*3]  inform GPA.3 Id. at 2.
Also in July of 2015, Dantzler received another performance evaluation rated in the 30s. Doc. 36 at 2-3. Because of the low score, she was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP") and warned that failure to complete this plan could result in her termination. Id. at 3. She was instructed to complete PIP paperwork which allowed her to make certain requests to address the perceived deficiencies in her work. Id. On July 22, 2015, Dantzler requested a quiet place to work and further training as part of her PIP. Id. After GPA reviewed that request for a "quiet place to work," it informed Dantzler that there were no available private offices and that she should remove this request from her PIP. Id. Dantzler did so. Id. On July 29, 2015, Dantzler informed Tatom of her ADHD, after Dantzler had removed her request and after the PIP had been approved.4 Id. at 4. Dantzler requested, and received, some subsequent training, but was ultimately terminated. Id. at 5.
The parties do not dispute that Dantzler provided GPA with some notice of her diagnosis, but they disagree on the extent and circumstances of that notice. GPA concedes that Dantzler discussed her suspicion that she suffered from [*4]  ADHD with her supervisor, Tatom, in June of 2015, but contends, at that time, Dantzler "did not . . . claim to actually have [ADHD], did not indicate that she had received a diagnosis of [ADHD], and did not ask for an accommodation concerning it at that point." Doc. 32-1 at 6. Dantzler responds that, although her discussions with Tatom were not formal, she had reason to believe that GPA either was aware of the process leading to her diagnosis, or should have been. Doc. 36 at 8-9. And she did file an affidavit with the court establishing that she told Tatom about her diagnosis prior to her termination. Doc. 36-1 at 4-7. Moreover, Dantzler contends that GPA's lack of established disability policy and procedure was (at least partly) to blame for Tatom's failure to recognize the significance of Dantzler's communications and act on them appropriately. Doc. 36 at 9 ("That Tatom failed to communicate [Dantzler's disclosure of her ADFID concerns] to anyone is evidence of the GPA's disregard for the ADA in failing to train managers and supervisors in those matters.").

ANALYSIS

I. Summary Judgment Standard
According to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), "[a] party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or [*5]  the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Such a motion must be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id. The "purpose of summary judgment is to 'pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 advisory committee notes).
Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmovant "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The substantive law governing the action determines whether an element is essential. DeLong Equip. Co. v. Wash. Mills Abrasive Co., 887 F.2d 1499, 1505 (11th Cir. 1989).
As the Supreme Court explained:
[A] party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.
Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323 (citations omitted). The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to [*6]  establish, by going beyond the pleadings, that there is a genuine issue as to facts material to the nonmovant's case. Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The Court must review the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences arising from it in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587-88. However, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. A mere "scintilla" of evidence, or simply conclusory allegations, will not suffice. See, e.g., Tidwell v. Carter Prods., 135 F.3d 1422, 1425 (11th Cir. 1998). Nevertheless, where a reasonable fact finder may "draw more than one inference from the facts, and that inference creates a genuine issue of material fact, then the court should refuse to grant summary judgment." Barfield v. Brierton, 883 F.2d 923, 933-34 (11th Cir. 1989).
Substantively, a factual dispute is "material" if it concerns "facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "The materiality inquiry is independent of and separate from the question of the incorporation of the evidentiary standard into the summary judgment determination. That is, while the materiality determination rests on the substantive law, it is the substantive law's identification of which facts are critical and which facts are irrelevant that governs." Id. [*7]  Thus, the Court must look to the ADA to determine what facts are material to Dantzler's claim.

II. Discrimination Under the ADA
Dantzler's allegations boil down to two basic claims. First, GPA violated the ADA when it terminated her due to her ADHD. Second, it discriminated against her when it refused her requested accommodation for that condition. The Court addresses each in turn.

A. Dantzler's Termination.
In regards to her termination claim, the ADA states that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). These claims, like race discrimination claims under Title VII, are subject to the burden shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination. See Jest v. Archbold Med. Ctr., Inc., 561 F. App'x 887, 889 (11th Cir. 2014); Jones v. Aaron's Inc.,     F. App'x    , 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 25002, 2018 WL 4203459, * 6 (11th Cir. Sept. 4, 2018).
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, "Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled, (2) she was a 'qualified individual' when she was terminated, and (3) she was discriminated against on account of her disability." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2016)(quoting Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1312 (11th Cir. 2003)). If a plaintiff makes this showing, [*8]  the burden then shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993). If an employer offers a non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision, the employee must then show that the proffered nondiscriminatory reason was mere pretext. E.E.O.C. v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272-73 (11th Cir. 2002). "A proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is not pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason." Lopez v. AT&T, Corp., 457 F. App'x 872, 874 (11th Cir. 2012)(citing St. Mary's, 509 U.S. at 515).
Here we assume, arguendo, that Dantzler established a prima facie case of ADA discrimination-namely, that she was disabled, was a qualified individual at the time of her termination, and was discriminated against on the basis of her disability. Defendant asserts that it has proffered a reasonable, non-discriminatory justification for Dantzler's termination; namely, she was a poor employee and blamed her supervisors for her mistakes. There is more than sufficient evidence in the record to support this position. Defendant acknowledged that she had a fraught relationship with Ms. Tatom and that Mr. Petrino was "out to get" her. Doc. 32-3 at 94-97. She also admits to committing errors in her work at GPA. Id. at 91-92. Dantzler's [*9]  performance reviews support her history of difficulties with work, and indicate—at best—an average performance. Id. at 116-121. Dantzler agrees that she received average performance results. See Doc. 36-1 at 6 (noting that she consistently performed at a 3 level). She agrees that her errors continued after she was placed on a PIP. See id. at 7 (noting "occasional errors" in the weeks after PIP). She also acknowledged that it was an "uphill battle" to "improve [her] organization and attention to detail." Doc. 32-3 at 25. In emails from before this suit was instituted, Plaintiff stated that "every single thing I do — without exception — has errors."5 Id. at 65. As a result, GPA has carried its burden to show a nondiscriminatory reason for Dantzler's termination.
The burden shifts back to Dantzler, then, to show that this reason is mere pretext and that she was instead terminated because of her ADHD. Dantzler argues that the only reason her performance was poor was because she had ADHD. Doc. 36 at 8. However, this allegation is not sufficient to overcome GPA's alleged reasons for firing her. First, Dantzler has offered only her opinion that her poor performance [*10]  was caused by her ADHD. See e.g. Todd v. McCahan, 158 F. Supp. 2d 1369, 1380 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (granting summary judgment when unsubstantiated opinion offered by Plaintiff). Moreover, Dantzler's poor performance and difficulties with her supervisors began before she notified GPA of her diagnosis, and continued thereafter. See id. at 1380 (granting summary judgment where history of poor performance prior to ADHD diagnosis and where no evidence that complaints of poor performance were "fabricated and/or staged as part of a 'ruse designed to mask' retaliation). Dantzler argues that Tatom knew of her diagnosis, but this knowledge alone is insufficient to establish pretext in the face of evidence that she consistently made mistakes in her work. See id. at 1374 (employee informed supervisor of ADHD prior to termination). Second, even if Dantzler's claim regarding her ADHD were sufficient to rebut GPA's first reason for termination—Dantzler's performance—it does not address GPA's second reason—Dantzler's poor relationship with her supervisors. See e.g. Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Commc'ns, 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984) (allowing employer to fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, or a reason based on erroneous facts, so long as it is not a discriminatory reason). Because she has failed to rebut GPA's non-discriminatory [*11]  reasons, her claim for discriminatory termination should fail. See e.g. Jest, 561 F. App'x at 890 (affirming district court's decision to grant summary to defendant because "[plaintiff] failed to adequately rebut several of [ defendant's] legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for suspension and termination.").

B. Dantzler's Requests for Accommodation
Plaintiff's complaint that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability also fails. "[A]n employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007); see also Crutcher v. Mobile Hous. Bd., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35402, 2005 WL 2675207, * 11 (S.D. Ala. Oct. 20, 2005) ("It is well settled that an ADA violation occurs when an employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for an employee with a disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer.") (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). While employers are required to reasonably accommodate disabled employees who are otherwise qualified, that duty "is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). In order to trigger the obligation, the person requesting accommodation must link the request to the disability. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009) (to trigger [*12]  duty to provide reasonable accommodation, the employee "must explain that the adjustment in working conditions or duties she is seeking is for a medical condition-related reason"); Freadman v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2007) (employee's request for reasonable accommodation "(1) must be sufficiently direct and specific, and (2) must explain how the accommodation requested is linked to some disability") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus it is not enough—even if an employer is aware of a potential disability—for an employee to request a change in their working conditions or duties unless that request is linked to their disability. Finally, the Plaintiff bears the burden of both of identifying an accommodation, "and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255.
Dantzler asserts that she told GPA of her ADHD diagnosis and that she requested a "quiet place to work," and additional training.6 However, what she did not do was link either request to her diagnosis. There is no evidence that Plaintiff requested a quiet place to work or additional training because of her ADHD. See Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 313 (3d Cir. 1999) ("[W]hile the notice does not have to be in writing, be made by the employee, or formally [*13]  invoke the magic words 'reasonable accommodation,' the notice nonetheless must make clear that the employee wants assistance for his or her disability." (emphasis added)). What the record shows instead is a history of average to poor performance capped off by a PIP wherein Dantzler requested a quiet place of work and additional training. That PIP does not identify ADHD as the reason for those requests. Instead, the evidence shows that this request was made specifically to address identified deficiencies in Plaintiff's general performance.
Moreover, GPA could not have understood Plaintiff's requests to be related to an ADHD diagnosis, because at the time the requests were made, Plaintiff had not informed GPA of her diagnosis. As such, failure to provide Dantzler with the private space cannot be discrimination because Defendant was unware of Plaintiff's disability at the time it denied her request. See Taylor, 184 F.3d at 313 (noting that "employer must know of both the disability and the employee's desire for accommodations for that disability") (emphasis added). Courts have been clear that the "employer has no duty to divine the need for a special accommodation where the employee merely makes a mundane request [*14]  for a change at the workplace." Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir. 2001); see contra Kowitz v. Trinity Health, 839 F.3d 742, 747-48 (8th Cir. 2016) (finding failure to accommodate where employer was "aware of [plaintiff's] specific condition, as well as the general nature of the limitations it placed on [plaintiff]"); Taylor, 184 F.3d at 303 (finding failure to accommodate where plaintiff's son had informed employer of plaintiff's diagnosis and hospitalization). GPA was under no obligation to assume that any requests Plaintiff made in response to a poor performance review were associated with her diagnosis of ADHD, absent some indication from her or absent knowledge of the disability. See Cole v. Cobb Cty. Sch. Dist., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127761, 2014 WL 4545766, * 4 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 12, 2014) (finding no request for accommodation where email requesting accommodation failed to mention disability and attendant limitations). Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff failed to request an accommodation, the Court does not address whether Defendant had an obligation to engage in an interactive dialogue with Plaintiff or whether Plaintiff's request was reasonable under the circumstances.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement should be GRANTED.
This Report and Recommendation (R&R) is submitted to the district judge assigned to this action, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) and this Court's Local Rule 72.3.
