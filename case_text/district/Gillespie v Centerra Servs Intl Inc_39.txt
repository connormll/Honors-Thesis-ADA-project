I. BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2021, Plaintiff Eldonna Gillespie ("Gillespie") filed a complaint against Defendants Centerra, Constellis, Peraton, Veantea Burnside, and Does 1 through 99. ("Complaint," Dkt. No. 1-1.) The Complaint asserted nine causes of action under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12900, et seq., the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.1, and Section 1102.5 of the California Labor Code. (See id.)
On December 3, 2021, Constellis and Centerra removed. ("Notice of Removal," Dkt. No. 1.) On January 17, 2022, Ms. Gillespie filed a notice of dismissal as to Defendant Veantea Burnside. (Dkt. No. 17.)
On February 9, 2022, Ms. Gillespie filed a first amended complaint against Centerra, Constellis, Peraton, and Does 1 through 99 (collectively, "Defendants"). ("FAC," [*3]  Dkt. No. 23.) The FAC asserts eight causes of action: (1) gender discrimination in violation of FEHA; (2) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; (4) failure to make reasonable accommodation in violation of FEHA; (5) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (6) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of FEHA; (7) violation of the CFRA; and (8) retaliation in violation of Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5. (See id.)
On March 3, 2022, Centerra and Consellis filed MTD 1. (See MTD 1.) On March 14, 2022, Ms. Gillespie opposed MTD 1. ("MTD 1 Opposition," Dkt. No. 31.) On March 21, 2022, Centerra and Constellis replied. ("MTD 1 Reply," Dkt. No. 32.)
On March 3, 2022, Peraton filed MTD 2.1(See MTD 2.) In support of MTD 2, Peraton filed Exhibits A through G. (Dkt. Nos. 26-1, 26-2, 26-3, 26-4, 26-5, 26-6, 26-7.) On March 14, 2022, Ms. Gillespie opposed MTD 2. ("MTD 2 Opposition," Dkt. No. 29.) In support, Ms. Gillespie filed a request for judicial notice. ("Plaintiff's RJN," Dkt. No. 30.) On March 21, 2022, Peraton replied. ("MTD 2 Reply," Dkt. No. 33.)

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
The following allegations are accepted as true [*4]  for the purposes of the Motions.
Plaintiff Eldonna Gillespie is a woman who was employed as a Supervisor and Security Captain at Fort Irwin National Training Center ("Fort Irwin") in the City of Barstow, County of San Bernardino. (FAC ¶¶ 1, 10-11, 18.)
Defendant Centerra Services International, Inc. ("Centerra") employed Ms. Gillespie beginning on October 1, 2015. (Id. ¶ 18.) Centerra has more than five employees and is listed as Ms. Gillespie's employer on her job application, offer of employment, paystubs, new hire documents, and other personnel paperwork. (Id. ¶ 11.)
Defendant Constellis Integrated Risk Management Services, Inc. ("Constellis") has more than five employees. (Id. ¶ 12.) Constellis employees "handled" many of Ms. Gillespie's human-resources related concerns, including reports of harassment, gender discrimination, and work-place injuries. (Id.) Constellis employees are the individuals who informed Ms. Gillespie that she could not be accommodated under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). (Id.) Constellis is named as Ms. Gillespie's employer on many internal human resources department documents, and Constellis CEO Kris Kluzinski is listed as her manager in a Personnel Action Form. (Id.) Various personnel [*5]  documents also list Constellis as Ms. Gillespie's employer, including a document wherein Ms. Gillespie agreed to abide by the terms of Constellis's company polices. (Id.)
Defendant Peraton, Inc. ("Peraton") has more than five employees. (Id. ¶ 13.) Its employees "handled" many of Ms. Gillespie's human-resources related concerns, including reports of harassment, gender discrimination, and work-place injuries." (Id.)
At all times relevant to the FAC, Ms. Gillespie worked at the Goldstone Site, a national security site on an active military base operated by private NASA contractors, including Peraton. (Id. ¶ 19.) During her employment, she was considered a Federal Aeronautic Security Police Officer. (Id. ¶ 18.) At all times, Ms. Gillespie was qualified for her positions and performed competently and capably. (Id.) She was never disciplined by her employers. (Id.)

A. Ballistic Vests
Due to her job, Ms. Gillespie was required to be armed at all times and to wear a "Level III" rated ballistic vest to protect her from gunfire. (Id. ¶ 21.) Centerra issued a ballistic vest to Ms. Gillespie, but the Kevlar inside the vest had an expiration date that had long passed. (Id. ¶ 22.) Although ballistic [*6]  vests are made to accommodate women's breasts, the vests Centerra provided to Ms. Gillespie and other similarly-situated female armed security guards were of the male configuration. (Id.)
Centerra once issued a male security guard a female ballistic vest with a bullet hole in it. (Id.) Range Master Ben Palmer at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory ("JPL"), who conducted Ms. Gillespie's gun qualification, knew that women were not provided with properly fitted vests. (Id.) While Mr. Palmer loaned a proper vest to the male employee whose vest had a bullet hole in it, upon information and belief Mr. Palmer either (a) did nothing with the information about the distribution of improper vests to women and the distribution of unsafe vests to all employees, or (b) Mr. Palmer reported the situation, and Defendants did nothing in response to Mr. Palmer's report. (Id.) Either way, Ms. Gillespie and female guards were not provided with properly fitted vests. (Id.)
In 2015, Ms. Gillespie and two other female security guards began to complain about pain and discomfort in their breasts resulting from being forced to wear male ballistic vests that had no room for female breasts. (Id. ¶ 23.) These complaints [*7]  were made to site male supervisor Veantea Burnside. (Id.) Defendants deployed a representative to the site to take photos of a female employee with her male ballistic vest. (Id.)
At some point in time, Centerra recalled the male vests it had issued to the female guards. (Id. ¶ 25.) Female officers, including Ms. Gillespie, requested to purchase their own fitted ballistic vests. (Id.) Defendants told the female officers "no." (Id.) Mr. Burnside told the female staff that Defendants did not want to buy vests because if the female officer left Peraton, the vest would only be fitted to the individual female. (Id.) Mr. Burnside said fitted vests for women would be a waste of money. (Id.)
In 2016, used vests were distributed to the female guards. (Id. ¶ 26.) The efficacy of these vests had already expired. (Id.) Defendants referred to the vests as "universal." (Id.) However, the vests were all male vests again and unsuitable for the female body. (Id.) Defendants informed the female employees that the ballistic vests were "unisex" or words to that effect. (Id.) All of the women who tried the new vests agreed that the male vests did not fit around their breasts. (Id.) Female guards were forced [*8]  to use these new, male vests which caused them significant pain and discomfort. (Id.) The female guards would have to constantly reach into their vests to pull the Kevlar away from their breasts to help alleviate the pain and discomfort caused by wearing the men's ballistic vests. (Id.) Mr. Burnside told Ms. Gillespie that he could not order her a female ballistic vest because she was "too top heavy." (Id.)
Ms. Gillespie and the other similarly situated female armed guards made regular complaints to Defendants both verbally and in writing. (Id. ¶ 27.) Supervisor Burnside gave the female guards what was purported to be a solution: a suggestion to take the vests home, fold the vests, and put them under a mattress in order to create a crease to supposedly create enough space for female breasts not to be compressed. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie followed this suggestion, but this did not work or help alleviate the pain. (Id.)
In February 2018, Ms. Gillespie was promoted to Captain and given supervisory responsibilities. (Id. ¶ 30.) In April 2018, Ms. Gillespie was on and off of light duty due to an occupational knee injury. (Id. ¶ 32.)
Centerra represented to Ms. Gillespie that it would not buy female [*9]  vests. (Id. ¶ 33.) Carmen Cortinas, the security administrator for Peraton, was aware of the ongoing injuries that Ms. Gillespie and other similarly-situated female guards suffered because of Defendants' failure to provide female ballistic vests. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie repeatedly reported the pain she was suffering to Ms. Cortinas. (Id.) Ms. Cortinas suggested that she wear a larger size of men's vest. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie informed her that doing so would not help because the vest would pinch her neck, prevent her from wearing a seat belt, and would cause other health/safety issues. (Id.)
When Ms. Gillespie became Captain, she would bring up the ballistic vest issues on almost a weekly basis with Ms. Cortinas at weekly meetings. (Id.) The meetings also included a woman whom Ms. Gillespie believes is Heidi Lynn Vanmetre, a Peraton employee. (Id.) Ms. Cortinas took no action to address the pain and suffering of female employees. (Id.) Ms. Cortinas said words to the effect of, "We're not required to issue you a female vest. They're universal vests." (Id.) She further said, "NASA regulations don't require that we give you female vests, just that they be ballistic vests." (Id.) Ms. Cortinas's [*10]  refusal to provide women with fitted vests appears to conflict with NASA Security protocols. (Id.)
In April 2019, Ms. Gillespie presented Defendants with a certification by her physician that she had developed painful, fluid-filled cysts in both breasts and needed to wear a female ballistic vest. (Id. ¶ 34.) Ms. Gillespie also experienced pain in her neck, rib cage, and back due to the improper vest. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie transmitted this medical certification to Centerra CEO Kristian Kluzinski. (Id.) However, Mr. Kluzinski did not respond, even though Ms. Gillespie followed-up several times. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie then followed-up with Constellis's Human Resources supervisor Robert Handel. (Id.) Mr. Handel informed her that he had tried to reach Mr. Kluzinski about this issue but had also been unsuccessful. During this time and due to Defendants' failure to accommodate, Ms. Gillespie suffered from painful cysts caused by her occupation in both breasts. (Id. ¶ 35.)
On August 23, 2019, Ms. Gillespie took time off from work due to a cumulative back injury. (Id. ¶ 36.) Ms. Gillespie provided Defendants with a medical certification that contained requests for reasonable accommodations to permit [*11]  her to return to work. (Id. ¶ 45.) These accommodations were to temporarily avoid bending, lifting more than ten pounds, kneeling, squatting, or excessive standing. (Id.)
On or about this time, Centerra CEO Mr. Kluzinski agreed to purchase female vests for Ms. Gillespie and her female coworkers. (Id.) However, upon information and belief, he first contacted other work sites for used female vests, but was unable to find any. (Id.)
In September 2019, Ms. Gillespie was instructed to meet with a vendor to be sized for a female vest. (Id. ¶ 37.) The vendor was Greg McClung of Proforce Law Enforcement. (Id.) Ms. Cortinas refused to clear the vendor to come onside to Fort Irwin, so Ms. Gillespie and other female employees had to meet Mr. McClung at a museum and have their breasts measured in a public space. (Id.) In response to an inquiry from Ms. Gillespie, Mr. McClung denied that any ballistic vests were "universal" or "unisex," contrary to Defendants' representations to Ms. Gillespie and the other female armed guards. (Id.)
In November 2019, Ms. Gillespie's medical provider gave Constellis's Mr. Handel an off-work note from November 5, 2019 to November 26, 2019 due to injuries sustained by [*12]  the vest. (Id. ¶ 38.) However, Constellis cited Ms. Gillespie's knee injury as the reason for placing her of off-work. (Id.) Defendants informed Ms. Gillespie that if she was unable to return to work without restrictions by January 6, 2020, she would be terminated. (Id.) Ms. Gellispie alleges that Defendants did not engage in any timely, good faith interactive process and refused to provide her the accommodations requested based upon her physician's advice. (Id. ¶ 47.)
On or around January 15, 2020, Defendants terminated Ms. Gillespie's employment. (Id. ¶ 39.) In May 2020, Defendants issued female ballistic vests. (Id. ¶ 40.)
During the preceding five years, Ms. Gillespie and other similarly situated female armed guards were forced to endure severe, unrelenting pain while wearing the mandatory male vests while on-duty. (Id. ¶ 41.) At no point during Ms. Gillespie's employment with Defendants did she have the opportunity to wear a ballistic vest made for women. (Id.) The use of the male vests gave Ms. Gillespie lasting injuries to her neck, back, and breasts that would not have occurred but for Defendants' failure and refusal to provide her with a female ballistic vest. (Id. ¶ 42.)

B. [*13]  Locker Room
As of 2015, security guards were required to report to, and leave, work in civilian attire only. (Id. ¶ 24.) Defendants only provided a single locker room, so female and male employees were expected to use that one locker room. (Id.) Female employees, including Ms. Gillespie, complained of being uncomfortable using the co-ed locker room. (Id.) Female employees would use the bathroom to change their pants. (Id.)
Sometime in March 2017, Defendants provided separate locker rooms for men and women. (Id.) Afterwards, Mr. Burnside informed the female employees that yoga pants or similar clothing were inappropriate to wear off shift on their way out. (Id.) Mr. Burnside would follow female officers, including Ms. Gillespie, to see what their attire was and confront the female officers if they were wearing yoga pants or other "inappropriate" attire. (Id.) Upon information and belief, no male employees were told what clothes they could wear off duty. (Id.)
Female employees, including Ms. Gillespie, noticed that the women's locker room did not have a locking door and there was a gap between the door and door frame. (Id.) The female employees witnessed Mr. Burnside standing outside the [*14]  door when they were inside the locker room. (Id.) The female employees complained to Defendants. (Id.)

C. Alleged Conduct by Veantea Burnside
On March 28, 2017 a female officer met with whom Ms. Gillespie believes is a Vice President of Constellis, (upon information and belief the name of the individual was "Dave Bradley"), at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites, in connection with the female officer complaints of Mr. Burnside's harassment and discrimination by Mr. Burnside. (Id. ¶ 28.)
In or around July 2017, a female employee complained to Mr. Burnside and Mr. Handel, a Human Resources Manager (and later Senior Human Resources Manager) for Centerra and Constellis, about Mr. Burnside harassing her and physically pushing female employees. (Id. ¶ 29.) The female employee further reported a male Sergeant named Cole for harassing and frightening her in a remote location in Fort Irwin. (Id.) In response, Mr. Burnside placed this female employee on involuntary leave due to her supposed "emotional state," and Mr. Handel demanded that the female employee take a fitness for duty examination prior to returning to work. (Id.) Mr. Handel told the employee, "[t]he fitness for duty assessment stems from [*15]  your strong emotional reaction to" the events the female employee reported, which were sexual harassment, violence, and threats. (Id.)
In February 2018, a female job applicant called Ms. Gillespie and reported Mr. Burnside for sexual harassment. (Id. ¶ 31.) The applicant reported that Mr. Burnside had made a quid pro quo offer to give her a job if she met him in a hotel. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie reported this job applicant's phone call to Mr. Handel. (Id.)
Centerra conducted an internal inquiry based upon multiple complaints that Mr. Burnside had been sexually harassing two of his female subordinates. (Id. ¶ 44.) Upon information and belief, Defendants, in bad faith and without making a proper investigation, concluded that the women's complaints were unfounded. (Id.) Later, upon information and belief, Defendants terminated Mr. Burnside's employment. (Id.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Motion to Dismiss: Rule 12(b)(6)
A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) ("Rule 12(b)(6)") tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in a complaint. "Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory." Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008). Factual allegations must be enough to "raise [*16]  a right to relief above a speculative level." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
Rule 12(b)(6) must be read in conjunction with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that a pleader is entitled to relief," in order to give the defendant "fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Id.; see Horosny v. Burlington Coat Factory, Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179419, 2015 WL 12532178, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2015). In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must accept all material allegations in the complaint — as well as any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them — as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Doe v. United States, 419 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2005); ARC Ecology v. U.S. Dep't of Air Force, 411 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2005); Moyo v. Gomez, 32 F.3d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994). Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is "a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).
"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted). Rather, the allegations in the complaint "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id.

B. Motion to Dismiss: Rule 12(b)(1)
A motion [*17]  under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the court's subject matter jurisdiction, without which a district court cannot adjudicate the case before it. See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994). Under Rule 12(b)(1), a party may seek dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction "either on the face of the pleadings or by presenting extrinsic evidence." Sierra v. Dep't of Fam. & Children Servs., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91068, 2016 WL 3751954, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, 2016) (quoting Warren v. Fox Fam. Worldwide, Inc., 328 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir. 2003)). Thus, a jurisdictional challenge can be either facial or factual. White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000).
In a facial attack, the moving party asserts that the allegations contained in the complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction. Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). When evaluating a facial attack, the court must accept the factual allegations in the plaintiff's complaint as true. Comm. for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma Cnty. v. County of Sonoma, 644 F.Supp. 2d 1177, 1189 (N.D. Cal. 2009).
"By contrast, in a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction." Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039. In resolving a factual challenge, the court "need not presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff's allegations" and "may look beyond the complaint to matters of public record without having to convert the motion into one for summary judgment." White, 227 F.3d at 1242. "Where jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits, [the Court] must 'assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint . . . unless controverted [*18]  by undisputed facts in the record.'" Warren, 328 F.3d at 1139 (quoting Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987)).

C. Motion to Strike: Rule 12(f)
Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12 permits a court to "strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). The function of a motion to strike is to avoid expending time and money from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with them before trial. Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir. 2010).
"Motions to strike are generally disfavored"—they "should not be granted unless the matter to be stricken clearly could have no possible bearing on the subject of the litigation." Jacobson v. Persolve, LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115601, 2014 WL 4090809, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2014) (citation and quotations omitted). "If there is any doubt whether the portion to be stricken might bear on an issue in the litigation, the court should deny the motion." Id. Whether to grant a motion to strike lies within the sound discretion of the court. Id.
The grounds for a motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack. S.E.C. v. Sands, 902 F. Supp. 1149, 1165 (C.D. Cal. 1995), aff'd by 142 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 1998). With a motion to strike, the court must view the pleading under attack in the light most favorable to the pleader and determine whether the matter that the moving party seeks to strike is: (1) an insufficient defense; (2) redundant; (3) immaterial; (4) impertinent; or (5) scandalous. Vogel v. OM ABS, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11821, 2014 WL 340662, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 30, 2014); Whittlestone, 618 F.3d at 973-74. "Immaterial" matter [*19]  is "that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the defenses being pleaded," while "'[i]mpertinent matter' consists of statements that do not pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question." Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir. 1993), rev'd on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994) (citation and quotations omitted).

D. Leave to Amend: Rule 15
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 ("Rule 15") provides that leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The Ninth Circuit has held that "'[t]his policy is to be applied with extreme liberality.'" Eminence Capital, L.L.C. v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2001)). Generally, a "district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by allegation of other facts." Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Centerra and Constellis Motion to Dismiss (MTD 1)
Centerra and Constellis move to dismiss all eight causes of action in the FAC. (See MTD 1.) They argue that the statute of limitations has run on Counts One through Five and Count Eight and even if all claims were timely, Counts One through Eight fail to state a claim. (Id. at 4-18.) Centerra and Constellis further argue that the joint employer liability [*20]  allegations against Constellis and Ms. Gillespie's punitive damages claim must be dismissed or stricken because they are insufficiently pled. (Id. at 18-23.)

1. Statute of Limitations
Centerra and Constellis first move to dismiss Counts One through Five and Count Eight on the basis that they are time-barred in whole or in part. (MTD 1 at 4-5.) They argue that any claims that arise from incidents prior to or during 2018 fall outside FEHA's statute of limitations period. (Id.) Ms. Gillespie does not contest the applicable limitations period but argues that the continuing violation doctrine applies. (MTD 1 Opp'n at 5-9.)
Counts One through Five are FEHA claims. "An employee who wishes to file suit under the FEHA 'must exhaust the administrative remedy provided by the statute by filing a complaint with the [California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DEFH")], 'and must obtain from the DFEH a notice of right to sue.'" Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distrib. Servs., Inc., 11 Cal. 5th 918, 931, 281 Cal. Rptr. 3d 498, 491 P.3d 290 (2021) (quoting Romano v. Rockwell Int'l, Inc., 14 Cal. 4th 479, 492, 59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114 (1996)). Any administrative complaint "shall not be filed after the expiration of three years from the date upon which the unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred." Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(e)(5).
As Centerra and Constellis note, however, this three-year statute of limitations period [*21]  only took effect on January 1, 2020—pursuant to California Assembly Bill ("A.B.") No. 9. A.B. No. 9 had amended Cal. Gov't Code § 12960 to extend FEHA's statute of limitations from one year to three years. Pollack, 11 Cal. 5th at 931 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12960, former subd. (d)); Brome v. Cal. Highway Patrol, 44 Cal. App. 5th 786, 793 n.2, 258 Cal. Rptr. 3d 83 (2020); A.B. No. 9 § 1, 2019-20 Sess. (Cal. 2019). Under California law, "statutes ordinarily are interpreted as operating prospectively in the absence of a clear indication of a contrary legislative intent." Quarry v. Doe I, 53 Cal. 4th 945, 955, 139 Cal. Rptr. 3d 3, 272 P.3d 977 (2012). When, as here, a law extends the statute of limitations, "[a]s long as the former limitations period has not expired, an enlarged limitations period ordinarily applies and is said to apply prospectively to govern cases that are pending when, or instituted after, the [law's] enactment took effect." Id. at 956. "However, when it comes to applying amendments that enlarge the limitations period to claims as to which the limitations period has expired before the amendment became law—that is, claims have lapsed— ... revival of the claim is seen as a retroactive application of the law." Id. at 957.
Here, A.B. 9 expressly prohibited retroactive application. See A.B. No. 9 § 3, 2019-20 Sess. (Cal 2019) ("This act shall not be interpreted to revive lapsed claims."); Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(f)(3) (noting that tolling provision "is not intended to revise claims that have already lapsed"). Accordingly, the former one-year statute [*22]  of limitations applies to any FEHA claim that accrued more than one year before January 1, 2020 (or on or before December 31, 2018), while the current three-year period applies to any FEHA claim that accrued less than one year prior to, or after, January 1, 2020 (or on or after January 1, 2019). Ms. Gillespie filed her administrative complaint on July 12, 2021. (FAC, Ex. 1 at 10.) Therefore, any claim that accrued on or before December 31, 2018, has lapsed.
"The date of accrual is not the date on which the wrong that injures the plaintiff occurs, but the date ... on which the plaintiff discovers that he has been injured." Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distrib. Servs., Inc., 11 Cal. 5th 918, 947, 281 Cal. Rptr. 3d 498, 491 P.3d 290 (2021) (internal alterations and citation omitted). Here, Ms. Gillespie identifies purportedly discriminatory and harassing conduct that occurred between 2015 and 2020. (FAC ¶¶ 18-31, 33-39, 41.) She alleges that Defendants took the following adverse employment actions against her:
(1) denied any employment benefit or privilege (i.e. treated equally in relation to distribution of fitted vests, not providing a safe locker room environment, failure to prevent sexual and gender discrimination/harassment, holding female employees to a different and higher workplace performance [*23]  standard as male employees); (2) denied protected medical leave (FMLA/CFRA) (employers of 5 or more people) for her work-place injury resulting from the ill-fitting vests which only adversely affected female employees; (3) denied hire or promotion; (4) denied reasonable accommodation for a disability which only affected female employees; (5) denied work opportunities or assignments; (6) suspended; and, (7) terminated.
(Id. ¶¶ 53, 63, 73, 83, 91.)
Ms. Gillespie's timeline is somewhat vague. Even so, she alleges that the incidents related to the vests, locker room, and purported failure to prevent sexual and gender discrimination and harassment primarily occurred on 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (Id. ¶¶ 23-31, 33.) She further alleges that she presented her physician's certification for a female ballistic vest to Defendants in April 2019 and that on or around January 15, 2020, Defendants terminated her employment. (Id. ¶¶ 34, 39.) Because Ms. Gillespie alleges that she discussed these issues with Defendants or that they communicated their position to her during the incidents, it is reasonable to infer that she knew or should have known of the adverse decisions at the alleged times. Assuming [*24]  for statute of limitations purposes that the alleged conduct constitute adverse employment actions, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie's claims premised on incidents from 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 have lapsed because Ms. Gillespie did not file her administrative complaint within one year of claim accrual. Accordingly, the Court considers whether Ms. Gillespie has sufficiently alleged a continuing violation theory.
"[T]he continuing violation doctrine comes into play when an employee raises a claim based on conduct that occurred in part outside the limitations period." Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 812, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001). Liability attaches "for unlawful employer conduct occurring outside the statute of limitations if it is sufficiently connected to unlawful conduct within the limitations period." Brome, 44 Cal. App. 5th at 798. "Allegations of a pattern of reasonably frequent and similar acts may, in a given case, justify treating the acts as an indivisible course of conduct actionable in its entirety...." Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Solutions, Inc., 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 1198, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 (2013). "[A]n employer's persistent failure to reasonably accommodate a disability, or to eliminate a hostile work environment targeting a disabled employee, is a continuing violation if the employer's unlawful actions are (1) sufficiently similar in kind—recognizing, [*25]  as this case illustrates, that similar kinds of unlawful employer conduct, such as acts of harassment or failures to reasonably accommodate disability, may take a number of different forms; (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence." Richards, 26 Cal 4th at 823 (internal citation omitted). In this context, "permanence" means "that an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment will be futile." Id.
The Court finds that Ms. Gillespie sufficiently alleges a continuing violation regarding Defendants' alleged failure to provide her and other female guards with female ballistic vests. First, Defendants' conduct from the lapsed claims are sufficiently similar in kind to their conduct when Ms. Gillespie presented her physician's certification in 2019: they refused her request for female ballistic vests. (FAC ¶¶ 23, 25-26, 33-34.) Second, these same allegations demonstrate that Ms. Gillespie and other female employees complained about this problem on multiple occasions over four years, which demonstrates reasonable frequency. (Id.) Third, Ms. [*26]  Gillespie shows that permanence had not been established as new events would create an opportunity to re-raise the problem—such as when the male vests issued to female guards were recalled, used vests were distributed, and Ms. Gillespie was promoted to Captain. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26, 30, 33.) Therefore, to the extent that Ms. Gillespie's claims rest on Defendants' conduct regarding the vests, the Court concludes that the continuing violation doctrine delayed the accrual of the claims at least until 2019 and the claims are not time-barred.
By contrast, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie fails to allege a continuing violation for Defendants' alleged failures to provide a safe locker room environment and address harassing and discriminatory conduct by male employees. While these incidents may fit within the broad universe of gender and disability discrimination, they are dissimilar to the failure to accommodate Ms. Gillespie's injuries with a vest or to Ms. Gillespie's termination that occurred within the limitations period. (Id. ¶¶ 24, 28-29, 31 34-39.) Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. Gillespie's claims that rely on these incidents are time-barred. The Court GRANTS IN PART MTD 1 and [*27]  DISMISSES Counts One through Five and Counts Eight against Centerra and Constellis to the extent that they are premised on Defendants' alleged conduct regarding the locker room and harassing and discriminatory conduct by male employees, including Mr. Burnside, WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. The Court DENIES the Motion on Counts One through Five as to the other statute of limitations arguments.
Count Eight is a retaliation claim under Section 1102.5 of the California Labor Code. "[U]nder California law and specifically [Cal. Civ. Proc. Code] § 338(a), a three-year statute of limitations period applies to plaintiff's § 1102.5 claim." Ayala v. Frito Lay, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 3d 891, 917 (E.D. Cal. 2017). Because Ms. Gillespie filed her administrative complaint on July 12, 2021, only those claims that arise from incidents on or after July 12, 2018 are timely. As noted above, Ms. Gillespie alleges numerous incidents that occurred prior to this date. While claims arising from those incidents would be time-barred, the Court finds that the continuing violation doctrine saves those claims premised on the denial of female ballistic vests. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART MTD 1 and DISMISSES Count Eight against Centerra and Constellis to the same extent discussed above WITH LEAVE TO AMEND, but DENIES the Motion on Count Eight as to the remaining [*28]  incidents.

2. Gender and Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Counts One and Two)
Centerra and Constellis argue that Counts One and Two must be dismissed because Ms. Gillespie fails to state claims for gender and disability discrimination. (MTD at 5-12.)
FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics, including sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, and physical or mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). To state a FEHA discrimination claim, the plaintiff must allege he "(1) was a member of a protected class; (2) performed his job in a competent manner; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the action occurred under circumstances suggesting discriminatory motive (i.e. [a] person outside of the protected class was treated more favorably)." Gathenji v. Autozoners, LLC, 703 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1028 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (citations omitted). "California defines adverse employment actions as those 'materially affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.'" Hicks v. Netflix, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 3d 763, 775 (C.D. Cal. 2020) (quoting Flores v. City of Westminster, 873 F.3d 739, 748 (9th Cir. 2017)).
Here, Ms. Gillespie alleges that she is a "woman." (FAC ¶ 1.) She alleges that she "was qualified for her positions, and performed competently and capably" and that she was promoted to Captain in February 2018. (FAC ¶¶ 18, 30.) Ms. Gillespie [*29]  further alleges that she was not "treated equally in relation to distribution of fitted vests" and provided with male ballistics vests unsuitable for the female body that caused her pain and discomfort. (Id. ¶¶ 22-23, 25-27, 33-38, 53.) These allegations, taken as true, show that the purportedly unequal treatment affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. In addition, Ms. Gillespie alleges additional adverse employment actions, including that she was "denied protected medical leave (FMLA/CFRA) ... for her work-place injury resulting from the ill-fitting vests," "denied reasonable accommodation for a disability which only affected female employees," " suspended," and "terminated." (Id. ¶ 53.) See Ayala, 263 F. Supp. 3d at 906 (finding that allegations of "denial of a request to transfer work shifts, "denial of long-term disability benefits," and "ultimately termination" sufficiently showed "adverse employment action"). Finally, Ms. Gillespie demonstrates a discriminatory motive: she alleges that male employees received proper vests and that Mr. Burnside had said that "fitted vests for women would be a waste of money." (FAC ¶¶ 22, 25.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie states a gender [*30]  discrimination claim under FEHA. The Court DENIES MTD 1 on Count One.
The Court finds that the same allegations that support a gender discrimination claim also support a disability discrimination claim under FEHA. Ms. Gillespie alleges that she had a disability, suffered ongoing injuries "to her neck, back, and breasts," and developed "painful, fluid-filled cysts in both breasts" due to the male ballistic vests. (Id. ¶¶ 23, 26, 33-35, 42, 61.) She further alleges that on or around January 15, 2020, Defendants terminated her employment, citing her knee injury. (Id. ¶¶ 38-39.) In Ms. Gillespie's view, Constellis "used Plaintiff's knee injury as a reason Plaintiff was off-work" when Ms. Gillespie's medical provider recommended off-work based on her vest-related injuries. (Id. ¶ 38.) Because Ms. Gillespie alleges that the vest-related injuries only affected female employees, a reasonable inference arises that male employees who received male ballistics vests did not suffer from this disability. (Id. ¶ 53.) Taken as true, Ms. Gillespie pleads disability discrimination. Accordingly, the Court DENIES MTD 1 on Count Two.

3. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process and Failure to Make Reasonable [*31]  Accommodation in Violation of FEHA (Counts Three and Four)
Centerra and Constellis next move to dismiss Counts Three and Four on the basis that Ms. Gillespie inadequately pleads a failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to make reasonable accommodations. (MTD 1 at 12-14.)
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee ... to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for accommodation by an employee ...." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To state a prima facie case for failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she "tender[ed] a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000)). "FEHA requires an informal process with the employee to attempt to identify reasonable accommodations, not necessarily ritualized discussions." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). "Both employer and employee have the obligation 'to keep communications open' and neither has 'a right to obstruct the process.'" Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1014, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 266, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)). "Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous." Id. at 1013.
An employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled [*32]  employee is also a violation of FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "'Reasonable accommodation' means a 'modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.'" Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, (N.D. Cal. 2015); Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). An employer who fails to continue to accommodate an employee's need may be held liable. See Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2015).
As noted above, Ms. Gillespie alleges that she has a disability and was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job. (FAC ¶¶ 18, 61, 72.) Moreover, she alleges that she had requested reasonable accommodations in the form of a properly fitted vest and medical leave. (Id. ¶ 62, 71.) Despite this request, Ms. Gillespie alleges that "Defendants outright terminated [her] employment without engaging in any timely, good-faith interactive process." (Id. ¶¶ 62, 72.) She alleges that prior to her termination, she sought to communicate with Centerra's CEO Kristian Kluzinski about her requested accommodation of [*33]  a female ballistic vest, but he did not respond. (Id. ¶ 34.) The Court finds that these allegations sufficiently demonstrate a failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to make reasonable accommodations at this stage. Accordingly, the Court DENIES MTD 1 on Counts Three and Four.

4. Retaliation in Violation of FEHA and Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5 (Counts Five and Eight)
Centerra and Constellis next move to dismiss Ms. Gillespie's retaliation claims under FEHA and Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5. (MTD 1 at Counts Three and Four on the basis that Ms. Gillespie inadequately pleads a failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to make reasonable accommodations. (MTD 1 at 14-16.)
Under FEHA, an employer may not discriminate against any person because "the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under [] FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020 (internal quotation [*34]  omitted).
Under the California Whistleblower Protection Act ("CWPA"), it is "illegal for employers to retaliate against an employee who 'disclos[es] information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or violation of noncompliance with a state or federal regulation.'" Coleman v. City of Los Angeles, 2016 WL 11266836, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2016) (quoting Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5(b)).
The Court finds that the allegations that establish Ms. Gillespie's discrimination, failure to engage in the interactive process, and failure to make reasonable accommodations claims also demonstrate retaliation under FEHA. Accordingly, the Court DENIES MTD 1 on Count Five. However, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie fails to state a retaliation claim under the CWPA because she insufficiently alleges any authority to whom she disclosed a violation. Ms. Gillespie alleges that she "disclosed to a person with authority over Plaintiff, and employees with authority to investigate, discover, and correct legal violations." As Centerra and Constellis assert, this allegation is conclusory and merely repeats the elements of the claim. No other facts in the FAC support an inference that Ms. Gillespie [*35]  disclosed a violation to a government or law enforcement agency. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS MTD 1 and DISMISSES Count Eight against Centerra and Constellis WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

5. Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, or Retaliation in Violation of FEHA (Count Six)
Centerra and Constellis argue that Ms. Gillespie's failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation claim falls short because it is derivative of her failed discrimination and retaliation claims. (MTD at 17.) As discussed above, however, the Court has found that Ms. Gillespie has sufficiently alleged discrimination and retaliation. Accordingly, her failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation cause of action survives dismissal. The Court DENIES MTD 1 on Count Six.

6. CFRA Violation (Count Seven)
Centerra and Constellis also move to dismiss Ms. Gillespie's claim under the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"). (MTD 1 at 18.) The CFRA "is intended to give employees an opportunity to take leave from work for certain personal or family medical reasons without jeopardizing job security." Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 878, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). Under the CFRA, "[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for any employer, as defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b), to [*36]  refuse to grant a request by any employee with more than 12 months of service with the employer, and who has at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous 12-month period or who meets the requirements of subdivision (r), to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a).
"Violations of the CFRA generally fall into two types of claims: (1) 'interference' claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave, and (2) 'retaliation' claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to CFRA leave." Choochagi v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., 60 Cal. App. 5th 444, 454, 274 Cal. Rptr. 3d 753 (2020). Ms. Gillespie asserts that she alleges the interference theory. (MTD 1 Opp'n at 12-13.) "A CFRA interference claim consists of the following elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the employer's interference with or denial of those rights." Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 250, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff need only allege that "the employer den[ied] the employee's entitlement to CFRA-qualifying leave." Id. "Leave because of an employee's own serious health condition that makes [*37]  the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of that employee" constitutes "[f]amily care and medical leave" under the CFRA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(b)(4)(C).
Here, Ms. Gillespie alleges that she requested leave for a "serious health condition." (FAC ¶ 105.) However, she fails to specify what condition. Though she alleges various injuries, including "a cumulative back injury," "injuries sustained by the vest," and a "knee injury," the Court cannot determine from the FAC for which of these conditions Ms. Gillespie took leave. (Id. ¶¶ 36, 38.) For the same reason, Ms. Gillespie's allegation that "Defendants refused to return Plaintiff to the same or comparable job when her medical leave ended, choosing instead to immediately terminate her position" fails to link this purported interference with a CFRA-protected leave. (Id. ¶ 107.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie fails to state a violation of the CFRA. The Court GRANTS MTD 1 and DISMISSES Count Seven against Centerra and Constellis WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

7. Joint Employer Liability
Centerra and Constellis move to dismiss or strike all joint employer allegations in the FAC. (MTD 1 at 18-20.) They argue that Ms. Gillespie was employed by Centerra [*38]  and fails to allege that Constellis was a joint employer.2 (Id.)
"[T]he joint employer doctrine recognizes that even where business entities are separate, if they share control of the terms of conditions of an individual's employment, both companies can qualify as employers' for purposes of liability under the California Labor Code. Holtegaard v. Howroyd-Wright Emp't Agency, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195035, 2020 WL 6051328, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2020) (quoting Johnson v. Serenity Transp., Inc., 141 F. Supp. 3d 974, 988 (N.D. Cal. 2015)). To employ means: "(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment relationship." Martinez v. Combs, 49 Cal. 4th 35, 64, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 514, 231 P.3d 259 (2010) (emphasis in original). "[W]hether two entities are 'joint employers' is a legal conclusion that, under California law, depends on a factual inquiry into the totality of the working relationship of the parties." Id. To determine "whether a defendant is a joint employer under the FEHA, California courts consider the 'totality of circumstances' that reflect upon the nature of the work relationship of the parties." Scates v. FedEx Ground Package Sys. Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178198, 2020 WL 5759121, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2020). "While the plaintiff is not required to conclusively establish that defendants are her joint employers at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must at least allege some facts in support of this legal conclusion." Ruelas v. County of Alameda, 519 F. Supp. 3d 636, 655 (N.D. Cal. 2021).
The Court finds that Ms. Gillespie [*39]  has alleged enough facts to show that Centerra and Constellis are joint employers. As Centerra and Constellis note, Ms. Gillespie does not respond to this argument in the Opposition. In addition, she alleges that she "was employed as an armed security guard for Defendant CSI [Centerra]." (FAC ¶ 18.) Ms. Gillespie only identifies adverse employment actions taken by Centerra. (Id. ¶¶ 22, 25, 33-34, 44.) However, Ms. Gillespie also alleges that "CONSTELLIS is named as Plaintiff's employer on many internal human resources department documents, and CONSTELLIS CEO Kris Kluzinski is listed as Plaintiff's manager in a Personnel Action Form." (Id. ¶ 12.) She further alleges that "CONSTELLIS employees 'handled' many of Plaintiff's human-resources related concerns," "CONSTELLIS employees are the individuals who informed Plaintiff that she could not be accommodated under FMLA," and "CONSTELLIS is listed as Plaintiff's employer on various personnel documents, including one wherein Plaintiff agreed to abide by the terms of CONSTELLIS' company policies." (Id.) Taken as true, these allegations suggest that Constellis exercises control over Ms. Gillespie's wages and hours and is an employer. Accordingly, [*40]  the Court finds that it is premature to dismiss the joint employer liability allegations. The Court DENIES MTD 1 on this basis.

8. Punitive Damages
Centerra and Constellis finally move to dismiss Ms. Gillespie's punitive damages claim. (MTD 1 at 20-23.) They argue that Ms. Gillespie fails to allege: (1) unlawful conduct by "an officer, director, or managing agent" of their respective entities; (2) advanced knowledge and conscious disregard by an officer, director, or managing agent; and (3) malice, oppression, or fraud. (Id.)
"California law conditions punitive damages on a showing that the defendant is guilty of 'oppression, fraud, or malice.'" McKay v. City of Hayward, 949 F. Supp. 2d 971, 989 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a)). "An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Ca. Civ. Code § 3294(b). "With respect to a corporate employer, the advanced knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, [*41]  fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation." Id. "Punitive damages are recoverable for FEHA violations." Martinez v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 481 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 1104 (S.D. Cal. 2020) (citing Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 221, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982)).
Ms. Gillespie argues that she has sufficiently alleged malice on Centerra's part. (MTD 1 Opp'n at 17.) While this may be true, she fails to address the argument that the FAC does not identify an officer, director, or managing agent of Centerra and Constellis who had advanced knowledge or acted unlawfully with conscious disregard. Nor can the Court find such allegations in the FAC. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS MTD 1 and DISMISSES the punitive damages claim against Centerra and Constellis WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
In sum, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART MTD 1.

B. Peraton Motion to Dismiss (MTD 2)
Peraton moves to dismiss or strike the FAC. (See MTD 2.) It first argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action because Fort Irwin National Training Center ("Fort Irwin"), from where the action arises, is a federal enclave, and state law claims are barred. (Id. at 12-15.) Peraton alternatively argues that the Counts One through Eight must be dismissed because Ms. Gillespie fails to allege any [*42]  wrongful conduct committed by Peraton or allege that Peraton is a joint employer. (Id. at 15-28.) Like Centerra and Constellis, Peraton also moves the Court to dismiss or strike Ms. Gillespie's punitive damages claim. (Id. at 28-31.)

1. Requests for Judicial Notice
Peraton and Ms. Gillespie request that the Court take judicial notice of certain documents regarding the federal enclave doctrine argument. ("Peraton RJN," MTD 2 at 5-6; "Plaintiff's RJN," Dkt. No. 30.)
"In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court generally looks only to the face of the complaint and documents attached thereto." Gerritsen v. Warner Bros. Entm't Inc., 112 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1019 (C.D. Cal. 2015). "A court may, however, consider certain materials-documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in the complaint, or matters of judicial notice—without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment." United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 98 (9th Cir. 2003). The Court "may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2).
Here, all of the exhibits are records on file with agencies or publicly available websites. (Peraton RJN, Exs. A—G; Pl.'s RJN, Exs. A—G.) Because these documents are judicially [*43]  noticeable, the Court GRANTS the Peraton RJN and GRANTS Plaintiff's RJN. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding records on file with agencies to be judicially noticeable); Perkins v. LinkedIn Corp., 53 F. Supp. 3d 1190, 1204 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (noting that publicly available websites are judicially noticeable).

2. Federal Enclave Doctrine
Peraton argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the FAC because under the federal enclave doctrine, federal law, not state law, must govern all controversies arising on a federal enclave like Fort Irwin. (MTD 2 at 12-15.) Because Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), rather than Rule 12(b)(6), governs a motion to dismiss based on jurisdictional grounds, the Court construes the MTD 2 as a Rule 12(b)(1) motion for the purposes of this argument. Because Peraton asserts that the FAC, as alleged, fails to give rise to subject mater jurisdiction, it lodges a facial attack and the Court takes all allegations in the FAC as true.
The United States Constitution gives Congress "'exclusive' legislative power" over federal enclaves. Paul v. United States, 371 U.S. 245, 263, 83 S. Ct. 426, 9 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1963). The Federal Enclave Clause states:
The Congress shall have power ... [t]o exercise exclusive legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by Cession of particular states, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of [*44]  the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in Which the Same Shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings.
U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17.
The federal enclave doctrine arises from this clause and provides that "when the federal government purchases state land with the consent of the state legislature, 'any law existing [on that land] must derive its authority and force from the United States and is for that reason federal law.'" County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp., 32 F.4th 733, 749 (9th Cir. 2022) (quoting Mater v. Holley, 200 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1952)). As such, "unless an exception applies, any conduct on a federal enclave is governed by federal law." Id. "The state law that previously governed the territory 'remain[s] operative as federal law' so long as it is consistent with federal law." Id. at 749 n.4 (quoting Mater, 200 F.2d at 124); Stiefel v. Bechtel Corp., 497 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1147 (S.D. Cal. 2007) ("Only state laws in effect at the time of cession or transfer or jurisdiction, however, can continue in operation. Laws subsequently enacted by the state are inapplicable in the federal enclave unless they come within the reservation of jurisdiction or are adopted by Congress" (internal citations omitted).).
"Exclusive jurisdiction can be acquired by the United States over land within a state in [*45]  three ways: (1) by purchase or donation of property within the consent of the state as provided in the United States Constitution; (2) by a reservation of jurisdiction by the United States upon the admission of the state into the union; and (3) the state's cession, together with the United States['s] acceptance, of such jurisdiction." Coso Energy Devs. v. County of Inyo, 122 Cal. App. 4th 1512, 1520, 19 Cal. Rptr. 3d 669 (2004) (internal citations omitted). The third method is at issue here.
The parties disagree on whether Fort Irwin is a federal enclave. Peraton argues, and Ms. Gillespie does not dispute, that Fort Irwin is on land held by the United States for military purposes. (MTD 2 at 12-14.) However, Peraton argues that California ceded exclusive jurisdiction over Fort Irwin through an affirmative waiver, while Ms. Gillespie argues that the United States failed to meet all of the requirements for cession and thus never acquired exclusive jurisdiction. (Id.; MTD 2 Opp'n at 2-6.)
The controversy centers around cession legislation that California passed in 1897, which states:
The State of California hereby cedes to the United States of America exclusive jurisdiction over all lands within this State now held, occupied, or reserved by the Government of the United States for [*46]  military purposes or defenses, or which may hereafter be ceded or conveyed to said United States for such purposes; provided, that a sufficient description of metes and bounds and a map or plat of such lands be filed in the proper office of record in the county in which the same are situated.
("1897 Statute," Peraton RJN, Ex. B.) The statute provides that cession occurs if the United States meets two requirements: it (1) provides a sufficient description of metes and bounds, and (2) files a map or plat of such lands in the proper office. (See id.)
According to Peraton, the United States met the first requirement when in 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8507 that included a description of metes and bounds for public lands being withdrawn in California, including Fort Irwin. (MTD 2 at 14.) Peraton acknowledges that the United States never filed a map or plat of the lands. (Id.) Nonetheless, Peraton asserts that California waived this second requirement when in 1944, California Governor Earl Warren signed and returned letters from the United States War Department that stated its acceptance of exclusive jurisdiction over Fort Irwin. (Id. at 14-15; Peraton RJN, Exs. D, E.) Ms. Gillespie [*47]  argues that the map filing requirement is mandatory and cannot be constructively waived. (MTD 2 Opp'n at 4.)
As the parties point out, courts in this district have reached opposite conclusions on whether California waived the map filing requirement for Fort Irwin. Compare Hillman v. Lexicon Consulting, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200818, 2016 WL 10988766, at *7 (C.D. Cal. July 27, 2016) ("The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, Fort Irwin is not a federal enclave."); Atiqui v. Acclaim Tech. Servs., Inc., 2014 WL 12965984, at *9 (C.D. Cal. July 3, 2014) (same); Graupner v. Lewis Ltd. Consultants, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194116, 2012 WL 12895714, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2012) (same); with Jackson v. Mission Essential Personnel, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199920, 2012 WL 13015000, at *1-2 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 13, 2012) (concluding that "California did cede exclusive jurisdiction over Fort Irwin" and "the federal government did accept California's cession of Fort Irwin").
Upon review of this case law and the judicially noticed exhibits, the Court finds Ms. Gillespie's position more persuasive. "[T]he voluntary cession of land by a state to the federal government is an actual transfer of sovereignty." Taylor v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 78 Cal. App. 4th 472, 478, 92 Cal. Rptr. 2d 873 (2000). "[S]tatutes restricting or derogating the state's sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state." Coso Energy Devs., 122 Cal. App. 4th at 1533. This authority suggests that the Court must strictly construe the 1897 Statute's requirement that the United States file a map or plat with the proper office. Because this requirement was not followed and California did not expressly waive it, the Court finds that California did not cede exclusive jurisdiction [*48]  over Fort Irwin. See Hillman, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 200818, 2016 WL 10988766, at *6 (finding that "the map or plat requirement must be strictly construed and that the actions of Governor Warren were not sufficient to constitute waiver"). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the federal enclave doctrine does not apply. The Court DENIES MTD 2 on this basis.

3. Joint Employer Liability
Peraton next argues that Ms. Gillespie insufficiently alleges joint employer liability against Peraton. (MTD 2 at 15-18.) The Court agrees with Peraton that Ms. Gillespie's allegations pertaining to Peraton are threadbare. However, the Court finds that she pleads enough to demonstrate that Peraton was her employer. Ms. Gillespie alleges that Peraton was one of the companies that operated the site at which she worked. (FAC ¶ 19.) She also alleges that she "repeatedly reported the pain she was suffering" from the vests to Carmen Cortinas, "the security administrator for Peraton." (Id. ¶ 33.) When Ms. Gillespie became Captain, she continued to report her pain "on almost a weekly basis with Cortinas at weekly meetings." (Id.) Ms. Gillespie alleges that she believed another Peraton employee, Heidi Lynn Vanmetre, attended those meetings with Ms. Cortinas. (Id.) She further [*49]  alleges that Ms. Cortinas not only responded to her reports, including by "suggest[ing] wearing a larger size in men's," but "refus[ed]" to provide fitted vests for women. (Id.) These allegations sufficiently show that Peraton, through Ms. Cortinas, exercised control over Ms. Gillespie's working conditions and engaged with her. Martinez, 49 Cal. 4th at 64. Accordingly, the Court DENIES MTD 2 as to joint employer liability.

4. Counts One through Eight
Peraton moves to dismiss Counts One through Eight on the basis that Ms. Gillespie fails to allege any unlawful conduct committed by Peraton and establish other elements of her claims. (MTD 2 at 18-28.)
The Court finds that Ms. Gillespie pleads sufficient facts to state claims for gender discrimination, disability discrimination, and failure to make reasonable accommodations. As discussed in Centerra and Constellis's motion to dismiss, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie sufficiently alleges that she is a member of a protected class and was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job. She alleges that Ms. Cortinas refused her requests for female ballistic vests, which demonstrates an adverse employment action. (FAC ¶ 33.) Ms. Gillespie further alleges that [*50]  Ms. Cortinas told her that there was no obligation to issue a female vest because the vests issued were "universal vests," contrary to a vendor's statement that any ballistic vests were "universal" or "unisex." (Id. ¶¶ 33, 37.) Similarly, she alleges that Ms. Cortinas's statement that "NASA regulations don't require that we give you female vests, just that they be ballistic vests" may "conflict with NASA Security protocols." (Id. ¶ 33.) Taken as true, these allegations raise a reasonable inference that the reason proffered by Ms. Cortinas for the adverse employment action was pretextual. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion on Counts One, Two, and Four. Because Ms. Gillespie's failure to prevent discrimination claim is derivative of her discrimination claim, the Court also DENIES the Motion on Count Six.
The Court also finds that the same allegations adequately state a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. Accordingly, the Court DENIES MTD 2 on Count Three.
By contrast, the FAC fails to show that Peraton engaged in retaliatory conduct. Nor are there allegations to demonstrate that Peraton interfered with Ms. Gillespie's rights to take leave under the CFRA. Accordingly, [*51]  the Court GRANTS MTD 2 and DISMISSES Counts Five, Seven, and Eight against Peraton WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

5. Punitive Damages
Peraton finally moves to dismiss Ms. Gillespie's punitive damages claim. As with her request for punitive damages against Centerra and Constellis, the Court finds that Ms. Gillespie fails to show malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent conduct by any officer, director, or managing agent of Peraton. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS MTD 2 and DISMISSES Ms. Gillespie's request for punitive damages against Peraton WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the MTD 1 and GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the MTD 2. Ms. Gillespie must file any amended complaint by Friday, September 23, 2022. The hearing set for September 19, 2022 is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
