Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case has been referred to me by Hon. Richard J. Arcara for supervision of all pretrial proceedings, including the preparation of a Report and Recommendation on dispositive motions [7].1 Plaintiff, Jerri Mineweaser, commenced this action against the defendant City of North Tonawanda, alleging claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §12111 et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Executive Law §296, for failing to afford him a reasonable accommodate for his disability and retaliation. Complaint [1].
Before me is the City's motion for summary judgment [17]. For the following reasons, I recommend that the motion be granted as to plaintiff's ADA claims, and that the court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's NYSHRL claims.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff [*2]  began his employment with the City in May 1988 in various capacities with the City's Water/Wastewater Treatment Department. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶1; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 25, 27-29. In 2003, he was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and was told that he could no longer work in maintenance because of his inability to work in cold weather and with vibratory tools. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶2; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 31-32. He then became a pump station operator in 2003 before commencing his current position as a water treatment plant operator ("operator") in 2005. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶3; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 31, 35-37.2 He worked rotating day and night shifts (also referred to as "swing shifts") in both positions. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 36, 38-40.
The City's water treatment plant where plaintiff worked as an operator, is in operation 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Operators work a rotating schedule to ensure that an operator is always on duty. Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶5. However, plaintiff states that in 2008 certain operators were removed from rotating shifts and permitted to work the day shift, but that since plaintiff was "overlooked" for this shift change despite having the same qualifications, he bid on a job in the wastewater treatment plant. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 41-42. Plaintiff's co-worker, James Demonte, was also told that he was not qualified for the positon and filed a grievance. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 42. At that time, there were a total of nine operators, two senior operators, and a chief operator (id., p. 42).
The two operators that worked the day shift had maintenance and mechanical skills and covered the vacations and absences of others on the evening and night shifts. Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶8. On August 31, 2012 and May 22, 2014, these operators retired and their positions were not replaced (id., ¶¶8, 15). According to David Scott, who became [*4]  the superintendent of the department on January 1, 2013, plaintiff did not have same level of maintenance and mechanical skills as the operator who retired on May 22, 2014 (id., ¶14).
On November 9, 2009, plaintiff took a reduction in pay to work as a wastewater treatment plant mechanic, which was a day shift position, and remained in that position until its elimination due to a reduction in funding on October 12, 2010, when he returned to the position of operator. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶3; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 40, 108. In late 2010 or early 2011, plaintiff began struggling with working on a rotating shift, and reported this to Ernie Chank, the chief operator at the time. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 63. Chief operator Chank told him to "suck it up . . . you're lucky you have a job" (id., p. 63-64).

Plaintiff's First Request for an Accommodation
Plaintiff testified that in November 2011 he made his first request for an accommodation to chief operator Chank by giving him a blank copy of the City's ADA policy and telling him to read it over. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 109-11. He subsequently gave chief operator Chank a [*5]  completed and signed copy in December 2011 (id., pp. 110-11). However, he provided him with no medical information (id., p. 111).3 Plaintiff had no further discussion with chief operator Chank or anyone else about his requested accommodations, since he "assume[d] that [chief operator Chank] was doing right with it" (id., pp. 111-12).4

The Whiteboard Incident
In January 2012, plaintiff's union and the City were engaged in protracted negotiations over a contract which had been voted down twice by the union. The contract submitted for the third ratification vote contained a change that was unpopular with most union members in the department. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶28. When Fred Marazita, a senior operator [*7]  from 2006 to 2014, noticed that plaintiff failed to participate in the January 19, 2012 vote and that the ratification was approved by a narrow margin, on the day following the vote he wrote "Jerri Mineweaser did not vote" on a whiteboard in the pump station. Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶14. Senior operator Marazita states that the purpose of writing that "was to make clear that, because Plaintiff did not bother to vote, he should not complain about the results of the vote" (id.).
In late January or early February 2012, plaintiff and his co-worker, David Conti, spoke to Shawn Nickerson, the City attorney, about this incident, but at no time did plaintiff indicate that he believed that the incident occurred because of his disability. Nickerson Declaration [17-7], ¶18; City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶30; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 53. Plaintiff followed that conversation with a letter to City attorney Nickerson dated February 13, 2012, stating: "Please consider this letter as my formal complaint to you as the compliance officer for the city anti-harassment policy . . . . I am requesting that you begin an investigation as described in the anti-harassment [*8]  policy". [17-6], p. 12 of 22. City attorney Nickerson proceeded to investigate the complaint and asked the superintendent of the department, Paula Sattleberg, to interview senior operator Marazita. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶32.
Superintendent Sattleberg prepared a written report dated February 21, 2012 concerning her interview with senior operator Marazita, which confirmed that the incident related to plaintiff's failure to vote. [17-7], p. 14 of 14. Accordingly, by letter dated March 9, 2012, City attorney Nickerson informed plaintiff that since the incident "did not specifically relate to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability or marital status, it does not fall within the parameters of the City's [anti-harassment] policy." (id., p. 14 of 22).

Break Incident
On February 15, 2012 senior operator Marazita gave plaintiff a verbal warning for "[v]iolation of break times" [17-4], p. 6 of 12. At that time, senior operator Marazita was unaware that plaintiff had made a complaint about the whiteboard incident. Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶19. The employee warning notice described the incident as follows: "After being repeatedly reminded of break and cleanup times . [*9]  . . Jerri was sitting with his feet up at the break table . . . on 2/14/2012 20 minutes before normal clean-up time" [17-4], p. 6 of 12. However, plaintiff denies that the infraction occurred. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 59. Following the alleged infraction, plaintiff was brought into an office with senior operator Marazita, chief operator Chank, and Louis Zmuda, who was a senior operator until becoming the chief operator in September 2012. Zmuda Declaration [17-9], ¶1; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 59. Plaintiff testified that "after I initially refused to talk about [the employee warning notice]. They initially said here, you need to sign [it], you're being warned about excessive breaks, and I said I don't agree with it, I want representation" and a union representative was called for him, but he did not speak to that individual because he preferred to speak to Mr. Conti, who was more familiar with the situation. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 59.

Cartoon Incident
In March 2012 plaintiff alleges that there were cartoons posted in the workplace, including a cartoon "about somebody having health issues that . . . it wasn't healthy for them [*10]  to be working [swing shifts]", which he believed mimicked him. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 61-62. Plaintiff did not know or have a belief as to who posted the cartoon, and did not know why it was posted (id., pp. 62, 64). At the time the cartoon was posted, he had not told anyone other than chief operator Chank that he was struggling with shift work (id., p. 63). The cartoon remained posted for at least 30 days until plaintiff removed all of the cartoons (id., p. 64). Although he may have mentioned the cartoon to another operator, he never complained to anyone about the cartoon (id., p. 65).5

Plaintiff's Second Reasonable Accommodation Request
On May 24, 2012, plaintiff sent a written request to the City Mayor's office with copies to City attorney [*11]  Nickerson and chief operator Chank, stating: "The Disability Act Compliance Policy commits the City . . . to providing accommodations for eligible individuals. I am currently . . . able to perform the duties required of the position. My physician has recommended a more routine life practice with proper sleep and medication times to minimize my symptoms and facilitate the remission of my condition. I have requested an opportunity to meet and discuss accommodations with . . . Chank and also . . . Sattleberg. Both have declined to address this issue. Please contact me to schedule a meeting beginning the process to determine reasonable accommodations" [17-5], p. 6 of 17.6
Prior to his receipt of the letter, City attorney Nickerson had no knowledge of plaintiff's medical condition or that he was seeking an accommodation related to his job. Nickerson Declaration [17-7], ¶7. Since the letter did [*12]  not identify plaintiff's condition or include any medical documentation, plaintiff was informed by the City attorney's office that he needed to complete appropriate paperwork to formally request an accommodation (id., ¶¶7-8).
On July 11, 2012, plaintiff completed and submitted the reasonable accommodation request Form, in which he "contended that he had rheumatoid arthritis and . . . sought to be limited to working only the day shift". City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶18; [17-5], p. 9 of 17. The City forwarded this documentation and a medical release to plaintiff's physician, Carlos Martinez, M.D., on or about August 1, 2012. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶20. Physician Assistant ("PA") Stephen Hodkin of Dr. Martinez's Office responded by letter dated September 14, 2012, stating that plaintiff "is currently under our care for Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is respectfully requested that he be allowed to remain on the day shift, not to be on the swing shift as this may cause a flare of his condition. It is recommended that a more routine life practice with proper sleep and current mediations to minimize his symptoms and facilitate the remission of his medical condition." [*13]  [17-5], p. 17 of 17. Although the September 14, 2012 response did not state that plaintiff's assignment to the day shift was mandated as a consequence of his medical condition, Dr. Martinez testified, "I cannot mandate. I can only request". Martinez deposition transcript [17-3], p. 113. None of plaintiff's supervisors, other than chief operator Chank, had any knowledge prior to September 2012 that plaintiff was seeking an accommodation related to his job. See Zmuda Declaration [17-9], ¶10; Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶10; Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶10.
Facing what it believed to be "unclear medical information", the City scheduled plaintiff for an independent medical examination. Nickerson Declaration [17-7], ¶13. In the interim, plaintiff was permitted to use sick leave and vacation time when scheduled for evening or night shifts. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶¶22, 40. In July 2012, there were seven operators other than plaintiff. Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶8.

The Picture Incident
In the department, operator licenses were displayed in picture frames on the wall, and underneath each license in the same frame was a picture of the operator. City's Statement of Material [*14]  Facts [17-11], ¶44. When plaintiff presented a medical excuse on November 4, 2012 to chief operator Zmuda for sick time that he took from October 26, 2012 to November 18, 2012, he told chief operator Zmuda that his picture was displayed where his license was previously located (id., ¶47). Chief operator Zmuda explained that he had already directed someone to correct this (id.). After his conversation with chief operator Zmuda, plaintiff took his medical excuse to superintendent Scott, and again mentioned the picture (id., ¶48). At that point, superintendent Scott called chief operator Zmuda, who advised that that the license and picture had already been switched (id.).

Plaintiff's Assignment to the Day Shift
Plaintiff's independent medical examination, which was completed on January 15, 2013, concluded that he was able to work "without restrictions (Full Duty)", but "presently agree[d] with trial of day shift for at least one year to determine potential medical benefit of such". [17-6], p. 4 of 22. At that point, the City permitted plaintiff to remain on the day shift, and he has remained assigned only to that shift since that time. Nickerson Declaration [17-7], ¶¶16-17. Currently, rotating [*15]  shifts are performed by the four other operators. Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶15. In order to provide sufficient coverage, these operators work fewer day shifts (id., ¶¶14-15).

The Sign-in/out Incident
Operators often perform job responsibilities at two different worksites located directly adjacent to one another — the filtration plant and pump station. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶51. They are required to sign in and out of the filtration plant (id.). All operators were reminded of this requirement in January, February, and March of 2013 (id., ¶52). Notwithstanding these reminders, plaintiff acknowledges that he did not sign in as required (id., ¶53). During a heated discussion with chief operator Zmuda on March 12, 2013 concerning his failure to sign in, plaintiff told him "you need to learn to wipe your ass instead of worrying about these sign-in sheets". (id., ¶54; plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 89-90). As a result, chief operator Zmuda prepared a verbal disciplinary warning, but it was not presented to plaintiff since he agreed to begin using the sign in sheets again. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶55. However, on March 13, 2013, chief [*16]  operator Zmuda, senior operator Marazita and three operators met with superintendent Scott concerning plaintiff (id., ¶56). In addition to plaintiff's failure to use the sign in sheet and comment to chief operator Zmuda, it was reported that plaintiff stands in the way of other operators and hinders their progress and that he shoves his fingers close to operator's faces (id., ¶57). Following this meeting, superintendent Scott met with plaintiff and advised him of the dissatisfaction of his co-workers and supervisors (id., ¶58). Although no formal disciplinary action was taken, plaintiff was told that if his conduct continued, it could be considered grounds for discipline under the collective bargaining agreement (id., ¶59).

The Bathroom Incident
All operators have a variety of duties, including cleaning. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶60. When plaintiff was assigned cleaning duty in February 2013, individuals defecated on the toilet seats five different times (id., ¶61). However, plaintiff only cleaned one of the soiled toilet seats (id.). When he reported this issue to chief operator Zmuda on one of the occasions, chief operator Zmuda cleaned the bathroom himself (id. [*17] ). On the other occasions, superintendent Scott told chief operator Zmuda that "somebody clean it up and it's not going to be [plaintiff]". Plaintiff's deposition transcript [17-2], pp. 95-99.

Plaintiff's EEOC Charges
On or about October 11, 2012, plaintiff filed his first charge of discrimination with the EEOC, alleging that he was denied a reasonable accommodation and retaliated against. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶67. However, it is undisputed that no one outside of the City Attorney's office was aware of the charge until March 2013 (id., ¶68). Plaintiff filed a second charge with the EEOC on or about June 26, 2013, but the EEOC found no probable cause to believe that discrimination or retaliation occurred with respect to either charge (id., ¶69).

The Pipe Incident
In June 2013, senior operator Marazita assigned plaintiff and Mr. Demonte the task of locating a leaking water pipe and provided them with a drawing, which he told them was inaccurate. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶¶62-64. They were unsuccessful in locating the pipe, but plaintiff believes that he was set up to fail at this task since he was only provided with hand tools to dig with and an inaccurate [*18]  drawing. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 81. Shortly thereafter, the same task was assigned to another operator, who successfully located the pipe with the same equipment and drawing. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶65; Marazita Reply Declaration [24-2], ¶7.

The Conti Complaint
On or about August 19, 2013, plaintiff's co-worker, David Conti, filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights ("SDHR") alleging that he had been retaliated against for assisting plaintiff with his accommodation request. The SDHR required the City to respond to the complaint, and as part of its response the City submitted information related to plaintiff's accommodation request, including his medical records. Disare Declaration [17-1], ¶24. Plaintiff argues that his "medical records were utterly irrelevant to this inquiry". Plaintiff's Amended Local Rule 56.1 Statement [22-2], p. 19, ¶70.7

ANALYSIS

A. Summary Judgment Standard
"The standards governing summary judgment are well-settled. [*19]  Summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The party seeking summary judgment has the burden to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact exists. In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, a court must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to, and draw all inferences in favor of, the non-movant. Summary judgment is improper if there is any evidence in the record that could reasonably support a jury's verdict for the non-moving party." Ford v. Reynolds, 316 F.3d 351, 354 (2d Cir. 2003).

B. Plaintiff's ADA Claims

1. Failure to Accommodate
Reasonable accommodation claims are evaluated under the framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Snowden v. Trustees of Columbia University, 612 Fed. App'x. 7, 8 (2d Cir. 2015) (Summary Order). "[A] plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of disability discrimination arising from a failure to accommodate by showing each of the following: (1) Plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could [*20]  perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations." McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Manufacturing Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2009). "The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment". Id. at 97. "An employer can defeat a prima facie claim if it shows (1) that making a reasonable accommodation would cause it hardship, and (2) that the hardship would be undue." Mitchell v. Washingtonville Central School District, 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir. 1999).
It is undisputed that plaintiff is a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. The City correctly notes that since plaintiff was ultimately granted the accommodation he sought in January 2013, his claim arises from the delay in granting that request. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 21-22. "To demonstrate that the delay in being afforded that accommodation violated the ADA, plaintiff must prove that the delay was not motivated by discriminatory intent." Hamedl v. Weiland, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127648, 2012 WL 3903499, *7 (E.D.N.Y. 2012), aff'd, 557 Fed. App'x. 68 (2d Cir. 2014) (Summary Order). Although the City argues that the delay was not motivated by discriminatory intent, it is not necessary for me to reach that question unless plaintiff satisfies the other elements of his prima [*21]  facie claim.
The City argues that a prima facie case cannot be established because: 1) the requested accommodation was unnecessary (City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 14-17); and 2) the accommodation does not allow plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job (id., pp. 17-20). The City further argues that even if plaintiff could establish a prima facie case, the requested accommodation presents an undue hardship (id., pp. 22-24).

a. Was the Accommodation Necessary?
Relying on PA Hodkin's September 14, 2012 letter "request[ing] that [plaintiff] be allowed to remain on day shift" ([17-5], p. 17 of 17),8 Dr. Martinez's deposition testimony, and plaintiff's medical records, the City argues that plaintiff "cannot demonstrate that, due to his medical condition, he needs the requested accommodation". City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], p. 14. In response, plaintiff relies on the same evidence to argue that to argue that while it was physically possible for him to continue working swing shifts, "the pain and aches caused by the swing shifts would aggravate [his] rheumatoid arthritis, as the doctor notes, and would affect his ability to continue working in the future because of the continued aggravation of [his] disability". [*22]  Plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], pp. 8-9.
"A party seeking an accommodation under the ADA must show that it is necessary to ameliorate an impairment arising from the alleged disability." A. v. New York Board of Elections, 99 F. Supp. 2d 258, 260 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (emphasis in original). See Konieczny v. New York State Division of Parole, 647 F. Supp. 2d 256, 264 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) (Larimer, J.) ("there is no evidence, medical or otherwise, that a flexible work schedule or the opportunity to work additional overtime hours during the week are reasonable and bona fide accommodations for the limitations imposed by plaintiff's blood disorder and panic disorder"). While it appears undisputed that shoulder pain and swollen joints are impairments arising from plaintiff's disability, the City argues that plaintiff has not established a "basis to connect those physical ailments to [his] work schedule". City's Reply Memorandum [*23]  of Law [24], p. 4.
In support of that argument, the City relies on plaintiff's medical records from his July 11, 2012 exam at Dr. Martinez's office, which do not mention any need to restrict his work schedule or for other work-related accommodations. In fact, the notes from that exam suggest that his condition was stable despite working a rotating shift at that time: "patient states that overall he is doing much better, patient has noted significant improvement with decreased soft tissue swelling and joint pain, patient still has element of soft tissue swelling and stiffness of his hands, fingers, wrists, knees, ankles, and feet, patient denies any acute flair, no myalgia, no weakness, no acute joint inflammation, patient still having some degree of personal stress at work patient is . . . working full-time, sleeping well, no fatigue, patient states he is able to do all ADLs without difficulty . . . test results are essentially unremarkable". [17-5], p. 14 of 17. Dr. Martinez concedes that plaintiff was "back to normal" as of July 11, 2012 (Martinez deposition transcript [17-3], p. 108), that plaintiff was not seen again by his office prior to PA Hodkin's September 14, 2012 letter requesting [*24]  that he be placed on the day shift (id., p. 112), and that the notes from plaintiff's next visit with his office on October 1, 2012 state that he was able to perform all functions of daily living and was fully functional (id., pp. 111-12).9
Not only is there an absence of supporting medical records as to what prompted the September 14, 2012 request, Dr. Martinez was equivocal as to whether the requested accommodation, namely, elimination of working the swing shift, was necessary to ameliorate the impairments arising from plaintiff's Rheumatoid Arthritis:
"Q. . . . [Plaintiff] [*25]  wasn't unable to continue working the same schedule he'd worked for years, was he?
A. He had been doing it all along. He could have continued his schedule, yes.
Q. So he could have continued to work the swing shift?
A. Yes. Despite the fact that it seemed to aggravate his joints, it was physically possible.
. . .
Q. So if he had been working the swing shift there's no indication that the swing shift gave rise to any additional soreness, is there?
A. There's no clear documentation here that the swing shift caused his joints to swell or make him more sore. It may have made him more tired or maybe he had less rest, but there's no direct documentation in the notes that was have seen so far that prove that that exacerbated his joints or caused an acute flare. I can infer that perhaps the stress or worry of the change shift may have stressed him to a point that he may have had more pain and more fatigue, but it's not written in black and white in the charts.
Q. So there's no indication that it would have been problematic for him to continue on that shift? . . .
A. Other than his personal stress and perhaps more pain . . . I had myself perhaps concluded that he was doing more a physical job and maybe [*26]  it would have caused him to have more joint pain, but not that a change in his shift with - - it may make him more achy and more tired, but it would not directly cause his joints to flare.
. . .
Q. . . . So there wasn't any medical necessity to move him immediately to a different shift?
A. Well, it was a request, and . . . when requests are sent, unless there's a life or death issue, a request is is it possible, can this be changed . . . .
Q. But it wasn't a medical necessity, was it, Doctor?
A. I do not have the black and white proof of that in the chart, that it directly caused him to flare because of this.
Q. And certainly not something that had to happen immediately, if it happened at all?
A. Our request is if possible . . . .
Q. . . . . [C]an he currently work [swing shifts]? . . .
A. He was last in my office February 16th [2015]. At that time the physical examination was basically unremarkable as pertains to joint issues . . . At that time objectively there were no swollen joints, but he did report the same type of degree of personal stress and the same degree of joint pain that he had. Looking at that last visit from February of this year, he is capable of working regular shift. He'll be [*27]  capable of working with his swing shift with the hardship that he had of fatigue or tiredness or increased joint pain but that he did not appear to have any loss of range of motion of a joint to infer damage that he could not work". Dr. Martinez' deposition transcript [24-1], pp. 114-117; [17-3], p. 118.
Notwithstanding Dr. Martinez's equivocal testimony, it is undisputed that since the January 2013 schedule change, plaintiff has asked superintendent Scott and his other supervisors to allow him to work the evening and night shifts when they are available on an overtime basis. Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶16; plaintiff's deposition transcript [17-2], pp. 140-41. Based on these requests, the City argues that "[i]f the accommodation requested (to only work day shifts) was truly necessary, then Plaintiff would not be seeking to work evening and night shifts under any circumstance". City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], p. 17.
In the absence of any explanation or argument from plaintiff as to why his request to work night and evening shifts on an overtime basis would not undermine any necessity for the requested accommodation, I agree with the City that plaintiff's willingness and desire to work the [*28]  night and evening shifts on an overtime basis conclusively refutes his claim that the accommodation of working exclusively the day shift was necessary, and I therefore recommend that plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim be dismissed on this basis.

b. Is Working a Rotating Shift an Essential Function of the Operator Position?
Even if the accommodation of working exclusively the day shift was necessary to accommodate plaintiff's disability, I also agree with the City that plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether working a rotating shift was an essential function of that position. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 17-20. A reasonable accommodation may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities". 42 U.S.C. §12111(9)(B). However, "a reasonable accommodation can never involve the elimination of an essential function of a job". Shannon v. New York City Transit Authority, 332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003). "Essential functions" are defined under EEOC regulations "to mean the 'fundamental' duties to be performed in the position in question, but not functions that are merely 'marginal'". Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(n)(1)).
"Although a court will give [*29]  considerable deference to an employer's determination as to what functions are essential, there are a number of relevant factors that may influence a court's ultimate conclusion as to a position's essential functions." McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 2013). These include "the employer's judgment, written job descriptions, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, the mention of the function in a collective bargaining agreement, the work experience of past employees in the position, and the work experience of current employees in similar positions" Id. "Usually, no one listed factor will be dispositive. A court must avoid deciding cases based on unthinking reliance on intuition about the methods by which jobs are to be performed. Instead, a court must conduct a fact-specific inquiry into both the employer's description of a job and how the job is actually performed in practice." Id.
Here, the City relies heavily on its own judgment that working rotating shift is an essential function of the operator position and that every other current operator works a rotating shift. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 18-19. The City further points to a number of cases that have held a rotating shift to be an essential [*30]  function of a job (id., p. 18 citing cases including Reville v. Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130799, 2009 WL 5167645, *8-9 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) (Arcara, J./McCarthy, M.J.); Bogner v. Wackenhut Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1063, 2008 WL 84590, *5-6 (W.D.N.Y 2008) (Telesca, J.)).
Plaintiff concedes that the case law cited by the City contains "theoretically supportive language" for the proposition that a rotating shift may be an essential function of a job. Plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], p. 11. However, he makes no attempt to distinguish that case authority from the facts of this case. Instead, he argues that the essential function of his job is to be "responsible for the flow of water as well as maintaining its purity for the safety of customers", as opposed to working a flexible shift. Id. That argument misses the mark, since "the term essential function encompasses more than core job requirements; indeed, it also may include scheduling flexibility". Rehrs v. Iams Co., 486 F.3d 353, 358 (8th Cir. 2007). See Reville, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130799, 2009 WL 5167645, *8; Lupe v. Shinseki, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120508, 2012 WL 3685954, *12 (N.D.N.Y. 2012).
Plaintiff next argues that working a "swing shift is not essential unless [he] is the only one qualified to work that shift and no one is capable of working in his place". Plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], p. 11. I disagree. "Moving one operator to a straight day shift would place a heavier burden on the rest of the operators in the plant. And an accommodation that would result in other employees [*31]  having to work harder or longer is not required under the ADA." Turco v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 101 F.3d 1090, 1094 (5th Cir. 1996). See Milton v. Scrivner, Inc., 53 F.3d 1118, 1125 (10th Cir. 1995) ("An accommodation that would result in other employees having to worker harder or longer hours is not required"); Kallail v. Alliant Energy Corp. Services, Inc., 691 F.3d 925, 931 (8th Cir. 2012) ("Shift rotation . . . enhances the non-work life of Resource Coordinators by spreading the less desirable shifts -nights and weekends - among all Resource Coordinators. If Kallail were switched to a straight day shift and not required to work the rotating shift, then other Resource Coordinators would have to work more night and weekend shifts"); 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(p)(2)(v) (impact to other employees on their ability to do their duties is a relevant factor in determining the reasonableness of an accommodation). As noted by the City, it is currently down to only five operators (including plaintiff), which imposes a greater burden on the remaining four operators to work less day shifts and to rotate shifts more frequently. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 20, 23; Smith Declaration [17-8], ¶15.
Finally, plaintiff argues that "most destructive to Defendant's allegation that working a swing shift is essential is the fact that Defendant has pulled other water treatment plant operators into straight day shifts". Plaintiff's Amended [*32]  Memorandum of Law [22], p. 11. However, it is undisputed that the two operators, who primarily worked the day shift, also covered vacations or other absences on the night or evening shifts. City's Statement of Material Facts [22-2], ¶¶7, 9. Thus, these individuals did not - as plaintiff seeks to - exclusively work the day shift.
As the City argues, and plaintiff does not dispute, its decision to permit plaintiff work exclusively the day shift since January 2013 does not remove rotating shifts from the essential functions of the job. "Evidence that accommodations were made so that an employee could avoid a particular task merely shows the job could be restructured, not that [the function] was non-essential. To find otherwise would unacceptably punish employers from doing more than the ADA requires, and might discourage such an undertaking on the part of employers". Phelps v. Optima Health, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001). See Trobia v. Henderson, 315 F. Supp. 2d 322, 331 (W.D.N.Y. 2004) (Larimer, J.), aff'd, 143 Fed. App'x. 374 (2d Cir. 2005) (Summary Order) ("The fact that the USPS allowed plaintiff to work in the Box Section from 1994 until January 1996 without performing certain functions . . . does not mean that these functions were not essential functions of the job within the meaning of the Act"). [*33] 10
Therefore, I recommend that plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim be dismissed.11

2. Retaliation
"To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the employee was engaged in an activity protected by the ADA, (2) the employer was aware of that activity, (3) an employment action adverse to the plaintiff occurred, and (4) there existed a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 1999).
Under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp., "[o]nce a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment decision". Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 721 (2d Cir. 2002). "Upon the defendant's articulation of a non-discriminatory reason for the employment action, the presumption of discrimination arising with the establishment of [*35]  the prima facie case drops from the picture, and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to come forward with evidence that the defendant's proffered, non-discriminatory reason is a mere pretext for actual discrimination." Ben-Levy v. Bloomberg, L.P., 518 Fed. App'x.17, 19 (2d Cir. 2013) (Summary Order).
"Although the causation standard for retaliation claims under the ADA . . . has not been definitively resolved", Gallagher v. Town of Fairfield, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69535, 2015 WL 3453342, *8 n. 10 (D. Conn. 2015), plaintiff does not dispute the City's argument that the "but-for" standard applies. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 24-25. Moreover, "substantial authority suggests that a plaintiff alleging retaliation must establish that retaliation was a 'but-for' cause of the adverse action and not simply a 'substantial' or 'motivating' factor". Gallagher, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69535, 2015 WL 3453342, *8 n. 10. See Housel v. Rochester Institute of Technology, 6 F. Supp. 3d 294, 309 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (Geraci, J.) (applying the but-for standard to an ADA retaliation claim); Forrester v. Prison Health Services, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40491, 2015 WL 1469737, *15 n. 12 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) ("With respect to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim, the mixed-motive approach is likely foreclosed by the Supreme Court's analysis in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar,    U.S.    , 133 S.Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 . . . (2013), in which the Court held that for a Title VII retaliation claim . . . a plaintiff must establish that the unlawful retaliation was a but-for cause of the adverse employment action, and not just a 'substantial' or 'motivating' factor").

a. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case

i. Adverse Actions
First, [*36]  the City challenges whether plaintiff suffered any adverse actions. As the City notes, it is "unclear exactly what actions or events Plaintiff claims were retaliatory". City's Reply Memorandum of Law [24], p. 8. Initially, plaintiff appears to limit the allegedly adverse acts to the following: 1) being "singled out for not attending a non-mandatory contract vote"; 2) "targeted by cartoon that specifically insulted individuals with disabilities"; 3) "had his license removed from the location where the licenses of all other employees were properly displayed"; and 4) "had to clean up after someone defecated on a toilet seat". Plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], p. 17. However, at other portions of his brief, he appears to rely on additional adverse actions, including: 1) his assignment to locate the leaking pipe (plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], p. 19); 2) the February 15, 2012 verbal discipline (id., p. 18); and 3) the City's submission of his medical records to the SDHR in response to the complaint filed by Mr. Conti (id., pp. 23-24).
At points, the City argues that an adverse action requires a "change in the terms and conditions of employment". City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], p. 25. However, [*37]  "unlike claims of discrimination, which limit what qualifies as an 'adverse employment action' to changes in the terms and conditions of employment, adverse employment actions in the context of a claim of retaliation are much broader". Vale v. Great Neck Water Pollution Control District, 80 F. Supp. 3d 426, 439-40 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). In the retaliation context "a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination". Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). "Actions that are trivial harms - i.e., those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience - are not materially adverse." Tepperwien v. Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., 663 F.3d 556, 568 (2d Cir. 2011). "Material adversity is to be determined objectively, based on the reactions of a reasonable employee." Id.
The conduct here fails to constitute adverse action. It is "well established . . . that criticisms, and even written warnings, do not constitute adverse employment action where there is no diminution in pay, job status, or benefits". Shaughnessy v. Xerox Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39537, 2015 WL 1431687, *4 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (Telesca, J.). Therefore, the verbal warnings that plaintiff received do not constitute adverse employment actions. Likewise, plaintiff's assignment to locate a leaky pipe, a [*38]  task that he does not dispute fell within his job description and was assigned to other operators, was not materially adverse. See Rodas v. Town of Farmington, 567 Fed. App'x. 24, 27 (2d Cir. 2014) (Summary Order) ("alleged retaliatory actions cannot be deemed materially adverse", where inter alia, the plaintiff "conceded that the purportedly degrading work assignments were within his job description").
The remaining complained-of conduct falls well within the bounds of conduct that would not dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. For example, the removal of plaintiff's license from the wall, which was promptly remedied, and the posting of the fact that he did not participate in a contract vote, would not dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. The same holds true for plaintiff's routine assignment to clean bathrooms. City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶60. Although people defecated on the toilet seats on five occasions while he was assigned bathroom duty, the impact on plaintiff was minimal, since he only cleaned one of the soiled toilet seats. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [17-2], pp. 95-99; City's Statement of Material Facts [17-11], ¶61.12
Plaintiff further points to the posting of a derogatory cartoon about a disabled individual as being a retaliatory act. Whereas the City argues that "it is entirely unclear how [the cartoons produced in discovery] are related to Plaintiff, his medical condition, or any protected activity", neither party made the cartoons part of the record. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], p. 26 n. 6. In any event, supporting the benign nature of the cartoon, plaintiff never complained about it — as he readily had about other conduct — to his supervisors. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 64.
Plaintiff's reliance on the City's submission [*40]  of his medical records to the SDHR in response to Mr. Conti's retaliation claim as an adverse action is similarly unavailing, since "in commencing this action, Plaintiff himself disclosed some of the same personal information that he now contends Defendants disclosed in retaliation. Consequently, he cannot be heard to complain about such disclosures." Laurent v. G & G Bus Service, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77138, 2011 WL 2683201, *9 (S.D.N.Y.), adopted, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74348, 2011 WL 2693651 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).
"Alleged acts of retaliation must be evaluated both separately and in the aggregate, as even trivial acts may take on greater significance when they are viewed as part of a larger course of conduct". Tepperwien, 663 F.3d at 568. Even construing all inferences in plaintiff's favor, a reasonable trier of fact would not conclude that the alleged retaliatory action (either separately or in combination) rose to the level of an adverse action. See Lotocky v. Elmira City School District, 149 F. Supp. 3d 429, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167626, 2015 WL 8958712, *3 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (Larimer, J.) (holding that there was no adverse action where the alleged retaliatory acts included plaintiff being "subjected to unspecified coworker comments that were derisive of his national origin, a comment by then-Assistant Superintendent . . . concerning American freedom of speech, increased supervisory scrutiny, alleged failure to adequately discipline an employee who threatened plaintiff, the administration [*41]  of a random drug test, the expiration of a Civil Service 'qualification list' on which plaintiff's name appeared, and an expansion of school outdoor athletic facilities which had the indirect effect of increasing plaintiff's workload"); Rivera v. Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority, 743 F.3d 11, 26 (2d Cir. 2014) (finding no adverse actions where the plaintiff relied upon "two disciplinary citations he received for insubordination over a two-year period, his assignment to drive particularly 'dirty buses,' one late overtime payment, and [a] one-time refusal to give him a half-day off for a doctor's appointment").13 This alone is fatal to plaintiff's retaliation claim, but if my conclusion is determined to be erroneous, I have analyzed the remainder of plaintiff's prima facie case.

ii. Protected Activities
Plaintiff casts an equally wide net in identifying his protected activities. However, the City disputes whether many of those complaints, which plaintiff did not link to his disability or requested accommodation, constitute protected activities. See City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], pp. 29-30. "Requests for disability accommodation and complaints, whether formal or informal, about working conditions related to one's [*43]  alleged disability are protected activities." Gorbea v. Verizon New York, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31225, 2014 WL 917198, *11 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). "Naturally, a retaliation claim . . . requires that the employer be aware of the employee's protected activity: thus, while complaints about discriminatory conduct need not mention discrimination or use any particular verbiage, ambiguous complaints that do not make the employer aware of alleged discriminatory misconduct do not constitute protected activity." Marcus v. Barilla America NY, Inc., 14 F. Supp. 3d 108, 115-16 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (Larimer, J.). See Parinello v. Bausch & Lomb, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55379, 2013 WL 1680152, *12 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (Telesca, J.), aff'd, 576 Fed. App'x. 32 (2d Cir. 2014) (Summary Order). "The onus is on the speaker to clarify to the employer that he is complaining of unfair treatment due to his membership in a protected class and that he is not complaining merely of unfair treatment generally." Aspilaire v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 612 F. Supp. 2d 289, 308-09 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).
Under this standard, many of the complaints plaintiff made to his supervisors about the conduct that he was experiencing do not constitute protected activities. For example, in his complaints to City Attorney Nickerson (both orally and in writing) following the January 2012 whiteboard incident, plaintiff never mentioned his medical issues or indicate that he thought that he was being harassed on the basis of his disability or as a result of his reasonable accommodation requests. Plaintiff's [*44]  deposition transcript [17-2], p. 53; [17-6], p. 12 of 22. Therefore, even when construed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, these complaints failed to put the City on notice that he believed that he was being discriminated against because of his disability or reasonable accommodation requests. The same holds true for plaintiff's complaints concerning the removal of his license from the wall in November 2012 and his complaints about individuals defecating on the toilet seats during his cleaning detail in February 2013. See McDowell v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 307 Fed. App'x. 531, 534 (2d Cir. 2009) (Summary Order) (where "plaintiff never explicitly complained about racial discrimination in any of his oral complaints . . . . plaintiff's supervisors could have understood that plaintiff's complaints about a paperwork delay and a co-worker's career were about race"); Rommage v. MTA Long Island Rail Road, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104882, 2010 WL 4038754, *14 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd, 452 Fed. App'x. 70 (2d Cir. 2012) (Summary Order) ("Because the statements displayed no obvious reference to race or gender and plaintiff's letter addressed harassment generally, but did not mention gender or race discrimination or harassment, there is no reason to impute to defendant any consciousness of an unstated race or gender premise underlying the harassing conduct described"). [*45]  It is also difficult to discern how his removal of the alleged derogatory cartoons could be a protected activity, when he never even complained about the cartoons.
The only protected activities undertaken by plaintiff were his reasonable accommodation requests to chief operator Chank in November and December 2011, and subsequent request in May 24, 2012 (see Lyman v. New York & Presbyterian Hospital, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95492, 2014 WL 3417394, *21 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ("Making requests for reasonable accommodations for a disability is protected activity within the contemplation of the [ADA]")), and EEOC charges in October 2012 and June 2013. Significantly, plaintiff concedes that prior to the June 2013 pipe incident, his supervisors had no knowledge of the EEOC charges. Plaintiff's Amended Memorandum of Law [22], p. 19. Therefore, if plaintiff could show that he was subjected to adverse actions, much of plaintiff's claim would hinge on whether he established a causal connection between his reasonable accommodation requests and the alleged retaliatory conduct.

iii. Causal Connection
Even if plaintiff could establish that he was subjected to adverse actions, he fails to offer evidence supporting a causal connection between those actions and his protected activities. Standing alone, "[t]he bald fact that [*46]  someone in a supervisory capacity over the plaintiff knew of the [protected activity] is insufficient to lead to a reasonable conclusion that others would also know". Hazward v. Runyon, 14 F. Supp. 2d 120, 124 n. 9 (D.D.C. 1998). Significantly, plaintiff has offered no evidence that chief operator Chank was involved in any of the alleged retaliatory conduct or that anyone other than chief operator Chank was aware of plaintiff's November and December 2011 reasonable accommodation requests until September 2012 — after many of the alleged adverse actions occurred. See Plaintiff's deposition transcript [24-1], pp. 110, 112; Scott Declaration [17-8], ¶10; Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶10; Zmuda Declaration [17-9], ¶10.14
Addressing the alleged adverse actions in chronological order, the record demonstrates that there is no evidence linking that conduct [*47]  to plaintiff accommodation requests. Plaintiff offers no evidence suggesting that senior operator Marazita wrote "Jerri Mineweaser did not vote" on a whiteboard in the pump station for any reason other than his failure to vote. Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶14. On February 13, 2012 plaintiff was then verbally disciplined by senior operator Marazita, but it is undisputed that at that time senior operator Marazita was not even aware of plaintiff's reasonable accommodation requests. Marazita Declaration [17-10], ¶10.
The next alleged adverse action occurred in March 2012, when plaintiff testified that he was the subject of a derogatory cartoon posted in the workplace concerning an individual with a disability working the swing shift, which he removed. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], pp. 62-64. However, plaintiff testified that he did not did not know who posted the cartoon or why it was posted. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [22-5], p. 62. There is also nothing linking chief operator Chank to this incident, nor did anyone other than chief operator Chank ever mention anything to plaintiff about swing shift work prior to the posting of the cartoons (id., pp. 63-64).
Nearly seven months later, [*48]  in November 2012, plaintiff's license was removed from the wall by an unidentified individual, and plaintiff alleges nearly three months later, in February 2013, unidentified individuals defecated on the toilet seats while he was assigned bathroom duty. However, plaintiff fails to offer any evidence linking these incidents to any protected activity. The last alleged retaliatory act occurred in June 2013 when he and Mr. Demonte were tasked with locating an abandoned leaky pipe. Although this incident occurred after plaintiff's supervisors became aware of his EEOC charges, plaintiff testified that he believed that they were given that task by senior operator Marazita because they submitted a March 4, 2013 complaint concerning asbestos in the facility ([17-4], p. 8 of 12) - not because of his requests for a reasonable accommodation, his EEOC charges, or any protected activity related to his disability. Plaintiff's deposition transcript [17-2], pp. 79-82.
In any event, even if plaintiff could establish a prima facie case, he would still bear the burden "to prove - with hard evidence, not conclusory supposition - that the defendant's articulated rationale is a pretext for discrimination". [*49]  Schanfield v. Sojitz Corp. of America, 663 F. Supp. 2d 305, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). However, plaintiff has failed to produce evidence that the motivating, much less "but-for", cause of the alleged adverse actions was retaliation for engaging in a protected activity.

3. Additional Claims
The City argues that the Complaint "only alleges claims of denied accommodation and retaliation", but because of references to "harassment" and "discrimination" in the Complaint, it addresses those claims out an abundance of caution. City's Memorandum of Law [17-12], p. 33. As the Complaint recognizes (see [1], ¶48), "[d]iscrimination under the ADA encompasses not only adverse actions motivated by prejudice and fear of disabilities, but also includes failing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities". Taylor v. Phoenixville School District, 184 F.3d 296, 306 (3d Cir. 1999). Although the First Cause of Action of the Complaint is broadly captioned as "Unlawful Discrimination", it is evident from the allegations supporting that cause of action ([1], ¶¶49-51) that it is limited to a discrimination claim for failing to accommodate plaintiff's disability. Therefore, I conclude that no discrimination claim based on adverse actions is asserted.
While the Complaint at points mentions harassment (see, e.g., [1], ¶19), it includes no claim of hostile work environment [*50]  harassment. See Noon v. International Business Machines, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174172, 2013 WL 6504410, *5 n. 3 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) ("Though the Complaint alleges that States 'harass[ed]' Plaintiff when she returned from disability leave, Plaintiff does not bring an ADA harassment claim . . . . Rather, Plaintiff cites the harassment as evidence that IBM took adverse employment action against her"). Since no claims for discrimination based on adverse actions or a hostile work environment were pled in the Complaint, I find no reason to address them.

C. NYSHRL Claims
"[I]n the absence of any remaining federal claims, the appropriate analytic framework to be applied to discrimination claims based on a 'disability' as defined by New York state and municipal law is a question best left to the courts of the State of New York." Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 754 (2d Cir. 2001). See Brief v. Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 423 Fed. App'x. 88, 93 (2d Cir. 2011) (Summary Order) ("because the law of New York in regard to relative state and federal disability claim analysis is still developing, we see no reason to decide them in this appeal . . . Instead, in the absence of any continuing basis for federal question jurisdiction, we leave these issues to the parties to pursue in state court if the plaintiff seeks to reinstate his state and city law claims in that forum").
Therefore, I recommend that the court not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over [*51]  plaintiff's NYSHRL claims. See Hernandez v. International Shoppes, LLC, 100 F. Supp. 3d 232, 268 (E.D.N.Y. 2015).

CONCLUSION
For these reasons, I recommend that the City's motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff's ADA claims [17] be granted, and that the court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining NYSHRL claims. Unless otherwise ordered by Judge Arcara, any objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the clerk of this court by April 7, 2016 (applying the time frames set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. ("Rules") 6(a)(1)(C), 6(d), and 72(b)(2)). Any requests for extension of this deadline must be made to Judge Arcara. A party who "fails to object timely . . . waives any right to further judicial review of [this] decision". Wesolek v. Canadair Ltd., 838 F. 2d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 1988); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985).
Moreover, the district judge will ordinarily refuse to consider de novo arguments, case law and/or evidentiary material which could have been, but were not, presented to the magistrate judge in the first instance. Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1988).
The parties are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 72(b) and (c) of this Court's Local Rules of Civil Procedure, written objections shall "specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings and recommendations to which objection is made and the basis for each objection . . . supported by legal authority", and must include "a written [*52]  statement either certifying that the objections do not raise new legal/factual arguments, or identifying the new arguments and explaining why they were not raised to the Magistrate Judge". Failure to comply with these provisions may result in the district judge's refusal to consider the objections.
