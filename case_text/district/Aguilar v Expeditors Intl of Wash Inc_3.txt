Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
Before the Court is a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.'s ("Expeditors" or "Defendant"). See Dkt. # 19-1 ("Mot."). Plaintiff Rose Aguilar ("Plaintiff") opposed the motion, see Dkt. # 31 ("Opp."), and Defendant replied, see Dkt. # 34 ("Reply"). The Court finds the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion
I. Background
This case arises out of Defendant's termination of Plaintiff's employment. See Defendant's Separate Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, Dkt. # 19-14 ("DUF"), ¶ 106. Defendant Expeditors is a logistics company based in Seattle, Washington, see Mot. 7:24-8:3. See DUF ¶ 2. Expeditors employed Plaintiff as an Accounts Payable Clerk ("AP Clerk") for approximately twenty-three years. See id. ¶ [*2]  4. As an AP Clerk, Plaintiff's responsibilities included paying invoices, processing inter-branch payments, running accounting reports for debit and credit, inputting journal vouchers, and reporting underpayment problems to management. See Plaintiff's Additional Material Facts, Dkt. # 31-1 ("PAF"), ¶ 1.
A. Plaintiff's April 2016 Complaint and Defendant's Investigations
On April 29, 2016, Plaintiff complained that her team members "were talking behind her back." See DUF ¶ 10. That same day, Plaintiff met with Diane Griffin ("Griffin"), the Branch Administrative Manager, and Lisa Blandi ("Blandi"), the Account Operations Manager, and asked if she could transfer to a different workstation due to her anxiety that people were talking about her.1 See PAF ¶ 6. Plaintiff was crying and reported to Griffin and Blandi that she was very nervous and anxious, which only happened while she was at work, and that she was seeing a doctor about these issues. See id. ¶ 7.; DUF ¶ 13.
Upon hearing Plaintiff's complaints and request, Griffin offered Plaintiff the options of workers' compensation, leave, an accommodation, information [*3]  regarding the Employee Assistance Program ("EAP"), and the opportunity to change desks within her department. See id. ¶ 14-15. Plaintiff declined these opportunities, and instead indicated that she wanted to transfer her workstation to a different department. See id. ¶¶ 16, 20. Ultimately, after discussing the matter with Carlton Ruesch ("Ruesch"), the District Manager, see Opp. 1:23-24, Griffin denied Plaintiff's request because (1) there was no room on the other side of the building and (2) it would have been detrimental to the business. See PAF ¶ 12.
From May 2 to May 5, 2016, Griffin interviewed staff members who sat in Plaintiff's immediate area, all of whom reported not knowing what Plaintiff was talking about. See DUF ¶ 24. On May 5, Griffin and Ruesch met with Plaintiff to communicate the findings of the investigation. See id. ¶ 28. At this meeting, Plaintiff explained that she believed people were talking about her involvement with a young man in another department. See id. ¶ 29. Following receipt of this new information, Griffin initiated a second round of investigatory interviews. See id. ¶ 30. When the second investigation yielded no support for Plaintiff's complaint, Griffin [*4]  and Ruesch closed the investigation. See id. ¶¶ 31-32.
B. Plaintiff's Behavior Through Summer 2016
Throughout May 2016, Plaintiff continued to make claims that "they were talking about her." See id. ¶ 33. She repeatedly and emphatically declared that she was not "crazy" or "disabled." See id. ¶ 34. Due to her behavior, Griffin again offered Plaintiff accommodation paperwork, see id. ¶ 35, which Plaintiff again declined, see id. ¶ 37. Defendant claims, and Plaintiff disputes, that, on or around May 6, Plaintiff shared with Maria Higa ("Higa"), Plaintiff's direct boss, that her "doctor told her she needs to see a psychologist." See id. ¶ 38; Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact, Dkt. # 31-1 ("PDF"), ¶ 38.
Over the next several weeks, Plaintiff's erratic behavior persisted sporadically, as she repeatedly told people to stop talking about her and that she was not "crazy." See DUF ¶ 40. In late June/early July, following complaints from multiple employees about Plaintiff's erratic behavior towards them, Griffin and Ruesch met with Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 43. During this meeting, Ruesch asked Plaintiff if she had any additional concerns since they last spoke in May, instructed [*5]  her to bring any future concerns to him, Griffin, or someone in management, and warned her that accusing other employees was inappropriate. See id. ¶ 46. Finally, due to the numerous employees who had complained of Plaintiff's confrontational accusations, Ruesch cautioned her to stop engaging in unprofessional conduct. See id. ¶ 48.
In August, Aguilar's accusations escalated, as she accused people at Expeditors of conspiring to get her fired. See id. ¶ 49. For example, Plaintiff reported to Blandi that she believed that an Expeditors regional manager and an information services employee were entering her computer remotely to watch/monitor her. See id. ¶¶ 50-52. Blandi explained to Plaintiff that no one was conspiring to fire or spy on her, reminded Plaintiff of the EAP resources available, and forwarded her concern to Griffin. See id. ¶¶ 53-54.
At the encouragement of Ruesch and Griffin, Plaintiff took a vacation from August 18 to August 22. See id. ¶ 55. Upon her return, Plaintiff expressed that she had rested well and presented Ruesch and Griffin a note from Peter Carlson, M.A., ("Carlson") of Carlson Counseling & Psychotherapy, indicating that she was receiving therapy. See id. ¶ [*6]  57. Ruesch and Griffin were encouraged that Plaintiff was seeking treatment and reminded her that sick time and a leave of absence were available. See id. ¶ 58.
C. Defendant's Decision to Put Plaintiff on Leave
On September 8, Plaintiff resumed her accusatory and confrontational complaints regarding "being watched" and people interfering with her computer. See id. ¶ 59. On September 12, Plaintiff told Higa that she could not "continue to work in this environment" and also stated "I hear voices." See id. ¶ 60. Later that afternoon, after Plaintiff indicated she "needed more privacy" to complete her job duties, Ruesch and Griffin met with Plaintiff and presented her with accommodation paperwork. See id. ¶ 61. Plaintiff contradicted herself, explaining that she did not need privacy and did not want the paperwork, and Ruesch and Griffin again raised the EAP available to Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 62-63. Plaintiff further mentioned that her regular doctor referred her to a psychiatrist but that she could not afford to see him. See id. ¶ 64.
After observing Plaintiff become increasingly angry and agitated during this meeting, Ruesch advised Plaintiff to take the rest of the week off, with pay, assured [*7]  her that she was not being terminated, and advised her not to return to work until he contacted her. See id. ¶ 65-66. At the recommendation of senior management and, in the interest of employee safety, while determining the proper next steps to take, Ruesch and Griffin temporarily deactivated Plaintiff's access badge upon her departure following their meeting. See id. ¶ 67. Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with any paperwork indicating that she was on leave rather than terminated. See PDF ¶ 69.
The next day, Plaintiff entered the building to inquire about when she could return and to clarify whether she was put on leave or had been terminated. See id. Ruesch explained that he was uncertain how long she would be off but would compile the documents she had requested. See DUF ¶ 71.
D. Plaintiff's Diagnosis
On September 16, Ruesch phoned Plaintiff to check in and update her on next steps. See id. ¶ 74. Ruesch explained that, in light of Plaintiff's concerns about being unable to afford the appointment with her doctor recommended psychiatrist, Expeditors had arranged an appointment with Dr. Praveen Kambam, M.D. ("Dr. Kambam"). See id. ¶ 76. Ruesch explained that Plaintiff was to remain [*8]  on paid leave until Expeditors heard back from Dr. Kambam. See id. ¶ 77.
Dr. Kambam met with Plaintiff on September 19. See id. ¶ 78. According to the evaluation that Dr. Kambam prepared, dated October 13, 2016, Dr. Kambam concluded that Plaintiff suffered from Delusional Disorder, Persecutory Type. See ¶ 79. In reaching his conclusion, Dr. Kambam spoke with Dr. Nilsa Laborde, M.D., who had been treating Plaintiff as her primary physician for over 20 years, and Carlson. See id. ¶ 80. In speaking with Carlson, Dr. Kambam confirmed Carlson assessed Plaintiff with a delusional disorder, noting Plaintiff demonstrated limited insight into her symptoms. See id. ¶ 83.
Ultimately, Dr. Kambam concluded that "Ms. Aguilar has experienced fixed, false beliefs that she is being conspired against, spied on, and harassed since at least 4/2016." See id. ¶ 84; Deposition of Dr. Kambam, Dkt. # 19-7 ("Dr. Kambam Depo."), 19:4-20, 36:13-23. The report goes on to state:
Perhaps even more concerning than Ms. Aguilar's actual symptoms (and subsequent behavior) is her lack of insight into: 1) how her symptoms and behavior may affect her coworkers and the work milieu; 2) the likely etiologies of such behaviors [*9]  (i.e., mental illness); and 3) the necessity of psychiatric or psychological treatment to ameliorate her symptoms and decrease the likelihood of such behaviors' recurring in the future. This is important because her lack of insight in the aforementioned domains makes it unlikely that she will seek or continue in treatment of her own accord . . . It is my opinion that without antipsychotic medication (and solely psychotherapy), her delusional symptoms are unlikely to improve enough to render her able to return to work.
See id.
Plaintiff had commenced treatment with Carlson in August. See DUF ¶ 87. Carlson testified that he had approximately nine, 50-minute sessions with Plaintiff, from August 22 through October 28, when she ceased treatment. See id. ¶ 88. He testified that, from his second session with her, he hypothesized that Plaintiff suffered from thought disorders. See id. ¶ 89. He further testified that because she was so rigidly locked down into a belief system, Plaintiff presented resistance to seeing other viewpoints and resisted acknowledging that she may be wrong in her viewpoints. See id. ¶ 90.
E. Defendant Places Plaintiff on FMLA Leave
Following receipt of Dr. Kambam's October [*10]  evaluation, on November 2, Defendant placed Plaintiff on paid, job-protected medical leave, designating it as leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). See DUF ¶ 85. Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with Dr. Kambam's evaluation or diagnosis and did not tell Plaintiff that Dr. Kambam recommended that she seek treatment or take medication. See PAF ¶ 56. Plaintiff asserts that she stopped seeing Carlson when Ruesch informed her that she needed to stay on leave and did not advise her of any steps she could take to be cleared. See id. ¶ 59. Defendant disputes that Plaintiff stopped therapy sessions for this reason and argues that Plaintiff stopped the sessions because she could no longer afford them. See DRPAF ¶ 59.
On November 16, Plaintiff faxed a note to Corporate Employee Relations asking when she could return to work and stating, "I cannot provide you with the Medical Certification because I am not sick." See id. ¶ 57; DUF ¶ 86. On November 21, Ruesch emailed Plaintiff and informed her that no further action was needed to take approved medical leave, and that her leave would expire on January 25, 2017. See PAF ¶ 60. Plaintiff was still unaware of why she had not been cleared [*11]  to return to work or what she needed to do to return to work. See id. Plaintiff contacted Ruesch again on January 15, 2017, to inquire what would happen when her medical leave expired and to ask if she could return to Expeditors. See id. ¶ 61. Ruesch responded that Dr. Kambam would need to clear her return to work. See id.
F. Plaintiff's Termination
On January 18, Dr. Kambam evaluated Plaintiff a second time. See PAF ¶ 63. In his January 25 evaluation, Dr. Kambam noted that the intensity of her delusions had decreased. See id. ¶ 64. He also made three recommendations to increase the probability that she would be fit for duty:
1. Regular follow-up with a psychiatrist to include taking antipsychotic medication to reduce delusional symptoms and prevent a worsening in their severity. Referral for psychotherapy may occur based on the psychiatrist's recommendations after she is taking antipsychotic medication but as an initial intervention, psychotherapy is unlikely to be effective as a sole intervention.
2. Clear, written and oral instructions regarding expectations regarding her behavior that she agrees to (in essence, a behavioral contract). This form of behavioral contract should also include [*12]  likely consequences of her unwanted behaviors to potentially serve as a deterrent. Although this will likely not change her underlying delusional thinking, it may serve to alter her response to her thinking because she identified wanting to work to financially provide for her son as an overriding concern.
3. Placement in a different department or around different personnel than her previous department to minimize potential triggering of previous delusional thinking about being harassed.
See Dr. Kambam's January 2017 Evaluation Dkt. # 19-7, Ex. 7 ("January 2017 Evaluation"), at 4. Although Dr. Kambam thought that these recommendations would help Plaintiff if she returned to work, during his deposition, he testified that he did not believe Plaintiff was fit to return to work at the time of his report, and he did not have a "foreseeable" date or "specific time frame" in mind by which she would be fit to return. See Dr. Kambam Depo. 84:1-86:2, 112:16-113:9, 117:18-119:3.
Following receipt of Dr. Kambam's January evaluation, Expeditors decided that termination was warranted and communicated the news to Plaintiff on February 14. See DUF ¶ 106. At the time of her termination, Plaintiff had been [*13]  on paid leave for approximately twenty-two weeks. See id. ¶ 107. Defendant interpreted Dr. Kambam's evaluation to mean that returning Plaintiff to work was predicated on her ability to gain insight into her condition and seek treatment. See id. ¶ 102. In interpreting Dr. Kambam's warning that Plaintiff was unlikely to gain insight into her own condition, Defendant concluded that it would be an indeterminate amount of time before Plaintiff would cooperate with Defendant to work towards an accommodation. See id. ¶ 103.
Defendant did not advise Plaintiff that she needed to seek treatment, take medication, or enter into a behavioral contract. See PAF ¶ 99. Additionally, Defendant did not offer to transfer Plaintiff to another workstation where she could work around different personnel. See id. ¶ 100. On February 28, Plaintiff emailed Dr. Kambam to request his report, but he never responded. See id. ¶ 95.
G. Additional Evaluations of Plaintiff's Mental Health
On February 27, Carlton authored a two-page letter clearing Plaintiff for work, stating that she "is in good mental health, not a risk to anyone or herself and is a fine person, dedicated to always doing the best job she can as an accounts [*14]  payable employee." See DUF ¶¶ 108-09. The last time Carlson treated Plaintiff was on October 28, 2016. See id. ¶ 109. He based his report on Plaintiff's "self-report" during a telephone call. See id. ¶ 112. During his deposition, Carlson stated "I put my patient in a good light so that she can go back to work, and perhaps I stretched it a little far." See Deposition of Peter Carlson, Dkt. # 31-9 ("Carlson Depo."), 141:11-25, 142:19-24. He also testified that he would not have written the note if he did not have "some substantial confidence" in Plaintiff's new attitude, tone of communication, and belief. See PDF ¶ 91; Carlson Depo. 142:12-143:3, 145:14-146:13.
On March 22, Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim against Defendant, for which she was ordered to undergo a Qualified Medical Examination ("QME"). See DUF. ¶¶ 113-14. Dr. Cheri Adrian, Ph.D., ("Dr. Adrian") conducted the QME and determined that Plaintiff suffered from Delusional Disorder, Persecutory Type. See id. ¶ 116.
In June, Plaintiff saw another psychiatrist, Dr. Bal. S. Grewal, M.D., at the instruction of her attorney. See id. ¶ 120. Dr. Grewal concluded that Plaintiff was in immediate need of treatment interventions [*15]  including psychotropic medication and individual psychotherapy. See id. ¶ 121.
II. Procedural History
On February 14, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging nine causes of action. See Notice of Removal, Dkt. # 1 ("NOR"), ¶ 2; See generally Complaint, Dkt. # 1-1 ("Compl."). On March 27, 2019, Defendant removed the action to this Court. See generally id. When the parties met and conferred pursuant to Local Rule 7-3, Plaintiff stipulated to dismissing the sixth and eighth causes of action, as well as all causes of action asserting age-related claims. See DUF ¶ 1. The following causes of action, reordered for clarity, remain:
First Cause of Action: Discrimination in Violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 33-44.
Second Cause of Action: Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 45-56.
Third Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Compl. ¶¶ 57-62.
Fourth Cause of Action: Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq. Compl. ¶¶ 63-70.
Fifth Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in Violation of the FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq. Compl. [*16]  ¶¶ 71-78.
Sixth Cause of Action: Wrongful Termination in Violation of the Public Policy of the State of California. Id. ¶¶ 112-21.2
Plaintiff also seeks compensatory damages, a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and punitive damages, in addition to attorneys' fees and costs. See Compl. 21:5-25. Defendant now moves for summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's claims. See generally Mot.
III. Legal Standard
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the movant can prevail by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the moving party's case. See id. If the moving party [*17]  meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The evidence presented by the parties must be capable of being presented at trial in a form that would be admissible in evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
IV. Evidentiary Objections
As a preliminary matter, Defendant asserts evidentiary objections along with its reply. See generally Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact, Dkt. # 35 ("DRPDF"). To the extent that the Court relies on objected-to evidence, it relies only on admissible evidence and, therefore, the objections are overruled. See Godinez v. Alta-Dena Certified Dairy LLC, No. CV 15-01652 RSWL (SSx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187253, 2016 WL 6915509, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2016).
V. Discussion
The Court will consider each of Plaintiff's causes of action in turn, [*18]  then Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.
A. First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
The FEHA prohibits employment practices that discriminate against any person because of his or her disability. Cal. Gov't. Code § 12940(a). On a motion for summary judgment based on a discrimination claim, the Court applies the McDonnell Douglas3 burden-shifting framework. See Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011). First, the plaintiff has the "initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination." Id. (quoting Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir. 1998)). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show: "(1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action [e.g., termination of employment] because of the disability." Prue v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc., 242 Cal. App. 4th 1367, 1378, 196 Cal. Rptr. 3d 68 (2015) (quoting Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 236, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997)).
After the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show either (1) that the plaintiff cannot establish an element of the FEHA claim or (2) that there was a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 745 (quoting Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008)). For disability discrimination, "section 12940 makes it clear that drawing distinctions on the basis of physical or mental disability is not forbidden discrimination in itself [*19] ." Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). "Rather, drawing these distinctions is prohibited only if [1] the adverse employment action occurs because of a disability and [2] the disability would not prevent the employee from performing the essential duties of the job, at least not with reasonable accommodation." Id.
Finally, if the defendant satisfies its burden at the second step, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that "the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 746 (quoting Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 225, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999)).
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established her prima facie case, and Defendant has failed to offer a legitimate, good faith reason for her termination. Thus, the Court does not address whether Defendant's reason was pretextual.
Plaintiff argues that "the admissions from Defendant's witnesses demonstrate clearly that Plaintiff was terminated because she had a disability." See Opp. 16:2-4. Defendant does not deny that Plaintiff was terminated due to her disability. See Mot. 20:16-22:11. Instead, Defendant argues that it had legitimate, good faith reasons for terminating her. See id.
According to Defendant, Plaintiff was terminated because (1) her disorder "causes her to fail to interact with other team members in a professional [*20]  manner at all times and causes her to exhibit behavior that prevent[s] the workplace from being comfortable and professional for all employees," see Mot. 22:1-3; DUF ¶¶ 79-84; (2) her "lack of insight into her own condition . . . made it highly unlikely that she would seek treatment on her own accord," see Mot. 22:3-5; DUF ¶¶ 98-101; and (3) "switching Plaintiff's desk or department . . . would not[,] standing [] alone, be sufficient to alleviate Plaintiff's erratic behaviors," see Mot. 22:7-10; DUF ¶¶ 96-101. In other words, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's disability would prevent her from performing the essential duties of her job.
A qualified individual is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." Brundage, 57 Cal. App. 4th at 235. An "essential function" refers to "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f).
Defendant has failed to establish as a matter of law Plaintiff was no longer qualified to perform her job. Defendant relies heavily on Dr. Kambam's recommendations in the January evaluation, particularly [*21]  the first item on the list, as a basis for establishing that Plaintiff could no longer perform her essential job functions. See Mot. 16:21-28; Reply 9:1-12. Dr. Kambam recommended "[r]egular follow-up with a psychiatrist to include taking antipsychotic medication to reduce delusional symptoms [because] psychotherapy is unlikely to be effective as a sole intervention." See DUF ¶ 97. Defendant categorizes Plaintiff's completion of this recommendation as a necessary step for her to return to work. See Mot. 16:20-28. Based on this recommendation and Dr. Kambam's opinion that Plaintiff was unlikely to seek treatment, Defendant decided, without discussing with Plaintiff, that she was no longer fit and terminated her employment. See DUF ¶¶ 101-06.
Plaintiff has demonstrated a genuine issue of fact as to whether she could perform the essential functions of her job with the accommodations suggested in Dr. Kambam's January evaluation. See Opp. 16:13-25. First, Dr. Kambam's January evaluation does not establish that Plaintiff was unfit without accommodations; it indicates that Plaintiff may have been able to return to work had Defendant taken one or more of the recommendations listed. See Dr. [*22]  Kambam's January Evaluation, 4. Second, Plaintiff has submitted evidence that her therapist, Dr. Carlson, believed she was fit to work. See Carlson Depo., 142:19-24. Finally, because Defendant did not inform Plaintiff of Dr. Kambam's recommendations or of his diagnosis of her condition, she was unaware of her supposedly disqualifying condition when Defendant terminated her employment, see PAF ¶¶ 99, 101, despite her repeated inquiries regarding when she could return to work, see id. ¶¶ 54, 61, 86, steps she could take to resume her employment, see id., and her requests to view Dr. Kambam's evaluations, see PAF ¶ 95. She also completed both evaluations with Dr. Kambam, see PAF ¶¶ 46, 63, indicating both her willingness to cooperate with Defendant and to seek treatment. Her obvious desire to return to work and Defendant's lack of communication around the steps necessary to do so raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she would have cooperated with Dr. Kambam's recommendations. See Opp. 16:13-27:7. And, at the summary judgment stage, Plaintiff is entitled to the reasonable inference that, based on her cooperative and inquisitive actions, she would have taken the necessary [*23]  steps to retain her job. See T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630-31.
Defendant also relies on Plaintiff's repeated statements that she was not "sick" or "crazy" to prove that she would not have sought treatment. See Mot. 25:19-23; 26:20-27:1. Again, these statements were made when Plaintiff did not have information about her own condition—information that Defendant knew but did not share. Whether Plaintiff would have sought treatment, and whether the treatment was necessary to make her fit for work, are genuine issues of fact for the jury to decide.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination cause of action.
B. Second Cause of Action: Retaliation
Akin to discrimination claims, California courts apply the three-stage burden shifting test from McDonnell Douglas to retaliation claims under the FEHA. Taub v. Fleishman-Hillard, Inc., 256 F. App'x 170, 172 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354). Under this test, plaintiff bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005).
"In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected [*24]  activity and the employer's action." Id. "The causal link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, 'such as the employer's knowledge that the [employee] engage[d] in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision.'" See Jordan v. Clark, 847 F.2d 1368, 1376 (9th Cir. 1988) (quoting Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir.1987)).
Once a plaintiff makes their prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to show either that a plaintiff cannot establish an element of the claim or that there was a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 745. After the defendant provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that "the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual." See id. at 746.
Plaintiff argues she engaged in protected activities when (1) she requested to move to another workstation on the other side of the building and (2) Dr. Kambam requested reasonable accommodations for her. See Compl. ¶ 48; Opp. 20:14-23. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a causal link between her request to move to another workstation and her termination. Plaintiff requested to [*25]  move her workstation to a different location on April 29, 2016, see DUF ¶¶10, 20. She was terminated on February 14, 2017. See id. ¶ 106. An employer's knowledge that an employee engaged in a protected activity, followed by an adverse employment action ten months later, does not give rise to an inference of retaliation. See Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, 439 F.3d 1018, 1035 (9th Cir. 2006) (upholding the district court's grant of summary judgment to the employer on a retaliation claim when the adverse employment action occurred eight months after the protected activity).
Regarding Dr. Kambam's requests, Plaintiff has failed to establish that his recommendations constitute a protected activity that could be the basis for a retaliation claim. Retaliation occurs when an employee engages in a protected activity. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042 ("[S]ection 12940(h) makes it an unlawful employment practice '[f]or any employer . . . to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part.'") (emphases in original). Plaintiff does not offer any case law, and the Court has found none, to support her argument [*26]  that an employer-sponsored activity, such as the recommendations from a medical professional hired by the employer here, could be the basis for a retaliation claim.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's second cause of action.
C. Third Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation
California Government Code § 12940(k) requires employers to take "all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring" in the workplace. A plaintiff seeking damages under this theory must show: (1) she was subjected to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; (2) the defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; and (3) this failure caused her to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm. Lelaind v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008).
First, Defendant argues that because Plaintiff cannot establish disability discrimination and retaliation, her failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation claim fails as a matter of law. See Mot. 29:20-28. The Court agrees that Plaintiff has failed to establish retaliation, and thus Plaintiff's claim that Defendant failed to prevent retaliation is foreclosed. See Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 288-89, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998). However, because the Court denied [*27]  summary judgment as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, Plaintiff's failure to prevent discrimination claim does not fail as a matter of law. See Lelaind, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 1103 (denying employer's motion where employee had presented sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment with respect to her discrimination claim).
Second, Defendant argues that "Expeditors took reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and retaliation, including conducting a thorough investigation of Aguilar's claims, implementing anti-discrimination policies (of which Aguilar was well aware), and trainings on the same, and maintaining an open door policy." See id. 30:9-12; DUF ¶ 2. However, these steps represent Defendant's prevention of discrimination and retaliation regarding Plaintiff's internal complaints; they do not address Defendant's discriminatory termination. Furthermore, Defendant fails to show how its policies were designed to prevent discrimination.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's third cause of action for failure to prevent retaliation. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's third cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination.
D. Fourth and Fifth Causes of [*28]  Action: Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff argues that Defendant failed to accommodate her (1) by refusing to move her workstation in April 2016 and (2) by refusing to engage in the interactive process according to Dr. Kambam's recommendations. See Opp. 21:13-24:24. The Court first addresses whether Defendant failed to accommodate Plaintiff as to the workstation transfer request. Next, the Court analyzes whether Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process according to Dr. Kambam's recommendations.

i. Workstation transfer request
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to fail to make reasonable accommodations for an employee's disability. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are: "(1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015).
Defendant argues, and the Court agrees, that Plaintiff has not established a failure to accommodate as to her request to transfer her workstation. See Reply 2:15-23. Defendant was [*29]  unaware that Plaintiff suffered a disability at that time, see DUF ¶ 11, and therefore was under no legal obligation to accommodate her request. See Kao v. Univ. of San Francisco, 229 Cal. App. 4th 437, 450, 177 Cal. Rptr. 3d 145 (2014) ("When a disability is not obvious, the employee must submit 'reasonable medical documentation confirm[ing] [its] existence.'") (quoting Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11069, subd. (d)(2)). Although Plaintiff expressed feeling anxious and stressed, she did not present Defendant with documentation confirming her disability. See DUF ¶ 11-13. Thus, Plaintiff has not established that Defendant failed to reasonable accommodate her request to transfer to a different workstation.

ii. Failure to engage in the interactive process
The FEHA requires that an employer engage in an interactive process to ascertain an appropriate accommodation for an employee who has a disability that is known or apparent. See Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12926.1(e), 12940(n). To prevail on a failure to engage in the interactive process claim under California Government Code § 12940(n), the "employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal.-Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009); see also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 983, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) ("[T]he availability of a reasonable accommodation (i.e., a modification or adjustment to the work place that enables an employee to perform the essential functions [*30]  of the position held or desired) is necessary to a section 12940(n) claim."). However, if an employer did reasonably accommodate an employee, this "forecloses" an allegation that the employer failed to engage in the interactive process. Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 829 n.5 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 229 ("We see no reason why this employer should be subjected to liability for failing to engage in the interactive process where the employee was reasonably accommodated.").
Defendant argues that placing Plaintiff on paid leave for twenty-two weeks establishes that Expeditors reasonably accommodated Plaintiff, foreclosing any argument that it did not engage in the interactive process. See Mot. 24:8. While placing an employee on paid leave can be a reasonable accommodation, see Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999), Defendant acknowledges that paid leave was not a long term solution. See PAF ¶ 89. Rather than continue to engage in the interactive process, Defendant ignored Plaintiff's requests for information regarding her future at Expeditors and kept Plaintiff in the dark regarding possible steps she could take to return to work. See id. ¶ 99. While placing Plaintiff on paid leave may have been an appropriate first step, Defendant failed to continue engaging in the interactive process once it [*31]  received Dr. Kambam's report. See id. ¶¶ 99-101. Plaintiff has put forth evidence that Defendant failed "to keep communications open" and "obstruct[ed] the process." Canupp v. Children's Receiving Home of Sacramento, 181 F. Supp. 3d 767, 780 (E.D. Cal. 2016) (quoting Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1014).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's fourth cause of action regarding the workstation transfer. The Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action regarding Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process, specifically as to Defendant's failure to attempt to implement Dr. Kambam's recommendations.
F. Sixth Cause of Action: Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"[D]isability discrimination can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." City of Moorpark v. Super. Ct., 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1161, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998). To establish such a claim, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) termination or other adverse employment action; (2) the termination or other action was a violation of a fundamental public policy, as expressed in a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision; and (3) a nexus between the adverse action and the employee's protected status or activity." Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Wash., Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 660, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013) (citing Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th 1028 at 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123). Plaintiff and Defendant recognize that the wrongful termination claim rises and falls with the FEHA claims. See Mot. [*32]  29:6-8 ("Because Aguilar's discrimination and retaliation claims fail, her wrongful termination claim fails as a matter of law."); see Opp. 24:26-28 ("Because Plaintiff has demonstrated genuine disputes of material fact as to her FEHA claims, Plaintiff's derivative claims for failure to prevent discrimination, wrongful termination, and declaratory relief all survive.").
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim for the same reasons that it denies the motion as to the FEHA claims — Plaintiff has created a genuine dispute as to whether Plaintiff was qualified to return to work with a reasonable accommodation.
G. Punitive Damages
Punitive damages are appropriate where there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of "oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. Malice means that the defendant acted with intent to cause injury or that defendant's conduct was done with a willful and knowing disregard of another's rights. Mock v. Mich. Millers Mut. Ins. Co., 4 Cal. App. 4th 306, 331, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 594 (1992). A plaintiff must show that the defendant intended to cause injury, and that their conduct was "so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched, or loathsome" so as to be "despised by ordinary decent people." [*33]  Id. However, an employer may not be assessed punitive damages under a theory of vicarious liability "for the decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer's good faith efforts to comply" with anti-harassment and anti-discrimination laws. See Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 545, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999) (applying this principle in the Title VII context). An employer's implementation of an extensive anti-harassment policy may demonstrate a good faith effort as a matter of law. Valois v. Airlines, No. CV 10-02030 (RGK) JCx, 2011 WL 13122365, at *10 (C.D. Cal. July 15, 2011); see also White v. Ultramar, Inc. 21 Cal. 4th 563, 568 n.2, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999) (applying this principle to California workplace discrimination and harassment laws).
Plaintiff argues that Ruesch, a managing agent of Defendant, acted with the requisite mental state for punitive damages. See Opp. 18:23-27. To support her argument, Plaintiff relies on Cloud v. Casey, 76 Cal. App. 4th 895, 90 Cal. Rptr. 2d 757 (1999). In Cloud, the jury found that the employee was denied a promotion based on her gender. See id. at 901. The employee put forth evidence of specific statements of discriminatory intent, such as "men do not like smart competent women working for them" and "it was not comfortable to have a woman in that position." See id. at 911. Furthermore, the employee presented evidence to show that the corporation added a requirement to the position she hoped [*34]  to obtain in order to create a pretextual reason for denying the promotion. Id. The appellate court held that the jury reasonably found the requisite mental state for punitive damages where "the corporations intentionally discriminated by denying Ms. Cloud a promotion based on gender, then attempted to hide the illegal reason for their decision with a false explanation." See id. at 912.
Here, Plaintiff does not provide similar evidence of malice or oppression. She argues that Ruesch lied to Plaintiff about the reason for her termination when he told her that Dr. Kambam recommended indefinite leave, and then changed his reasoning for her termination at his deposition, explaining that she was terminated due to Defendant's belief that she would not seek treatment or take medication. See Opp. 18:23-19:2. Plaintiff contends that, because Ruesch knew Dr. Kambam did not recommend indefinite leave, this attempt to create a "new defense" to her termination at his deposition is pretextual and "flatly illogical." See id. 19:6-7. However, while Dr. Kambam did not explicitly recommend indefinite leave, he wrote that "he did not believe Aguilar was fit to return at the time of his report(s), and did not have [*35]  a 'foreseeable' date or 'specific time frame' in mind by which Aguilar would be fit to return to work." See Mot. 23:21-23; DUF ¶ 99.
Furthermore, these statements were based on Dr. Kambam's belief that it was unlikely she would receive treatment. See DUF. ¶ 98. Ruesch's "new defense" at his deposition was not new, it was a further explanation regarding Plaintiff's termination. Additionally, Plaintiff overlooks that Defendant took active steps to help her by providing her with (1) multiple opportunities to engage with the EAP, see id. ¶¶ 14, 54, 63, (2) two mental health screenings with Dr. Kambam, see PAF ¶¶ 46, 63, and (3) twenty-two weeks of paid leave, see DUF ¶ 107. At her deposition, Plaintiff spoke fondly of Defendant and acknowledged that nobody at Expeditors treated her poorly. DUF ¶ 7; Deposition of Rosa Aguilar, Dkt. # 31-3, 211:24-212:6. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to offer clear and convincing evidence that Defendant or any of its managing agents acted with malice.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.
VI. Summary
In sum, the Court ORDERS the following on Defendant's motion for summary judgment:
• The Court DENIES summary [*36]  judgment on Plaintiff's first cause of action for disability discrimination in violation of the FEHA.
• The Court DENIES summary judgment on Plaintiff's third cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination in violation of the FEHA.
• The Court DENIES summary judgment on Plaintiff's fourth and fifth causes of action for failure to provide reasonable accommodations and failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of the FEHA, specifically as to Defendant's failure to attempt to implement Dr. Kambam's recommendations.
• The Court DENIES summary judgment on Plaintiff's sixth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
• The Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's second cause of action for retaliation in violation of the FEHA.
• The Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's third cause of action for failure to prevent retaliation.
• The Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for failure to provide reasonable accommodations regarding the workstation transfer.
• The Court GRANTS summary judgment on Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.
VII. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES [*37]  IN PART Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
