CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: (In Chambers) Order DENYING Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication (Docket No. 32)
The Court deems this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. The hearing set for November 16, 2009, is removed from the Court's calendar. For the reasons stated below, Defendant's motion is DENIED.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant on March 1, 2004. (Pl.'s Separate Statement of Undisputed Facts ("SOUF") ¶ 1.)1 In 2005, Plaintiff began receiving workers' compensation benefits after he was diagnosed with certain physical disabilities. (Id. ¶ 2.) In 2006 Plaintiff had elbow surgery, and was forced to take a leave of absence from his job from June 2006 to October 2006. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff returned to work in October 2006, and Defendant was informed Plaintiff had a permanent disability in November 2006. (Id. at ¶ 4.) Defendant laid Plaintiff off on January 11, 2007. (Id. ¶ 6. ) Plaintiff was 59 years old at the time. (Arriaza Decl. ¶¶ 2, [*2]  10.) Plaintiff claims that after he lost his job, he "became very depressed," had difficulties sleeping, discontinued "sports," and became more of a recluse. (Arriaza Depo. Tr. 36:13-38:17; Arriaza Decl. ¶ 12.)
Defendant claims it terminated Plaintiff's employment because of a business slow down at the location where Plaintiff worked. (Pl.'s SOUF ¶ 6.) However, Defendant's public filings stated Defendant's business had grown by $206 million in 2006, its press releases at the time predicted "record sales and earnings in 2007," and Plaintiff has declared under oath that he did not observe any work slowdown right before his dismissal. (Id. ¶¶ 7-9; Arriaza Decl. ¶ 10.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted where "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If the moving party's showing is insufficient, no defense is required. Neely v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 584 F.2d 341, 344 (9th Cir. 1978).
"[A] district court is not entitled to weigh the evidence and resolve disputed underlying [*3]  factual issues." Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992). Rather, "the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts . . . must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).

III. DISCUSSION

A. The California Fair Employment and Housing Act Claims
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") uses the same "three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination." Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). This "test places on the plaintiff the initial burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Id. The test is not onerous, but requires plaintiff to provide evidence that "(1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination . . ., and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Id. at 355. To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must have evidence to support a prima facie case. If the defendant puts forward a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, plaintiff must also "produce enough evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude either: (a) that the [*4]  alleged reason for [plaintiff's] discharge was false, or (b) that the true reason for his discharge was a discriminatory one." Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 918 (9th Cir. 1996).

1. The Disability Discrimination and Retaliation Claim
In order for a plaintiff to establish unlawful discharge on account of a disability under FEHA, he must prove that "the adverse employment action occurr[ed] because of a disability and the disability would not prevent the employee from performing the essential duties of the job, at least not with reasonable accommodation." Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007).
Plaintiff alleged in the complaint that "his disabilities and/or perceived disabilities, his need and/or requests for reasonable accommodations, as well as his decision to file a workers' compensation action were substantial and determining factors" in Defendant's decision to terminate his employment. (Compl. ¶ 19.) Defendant contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because: (1) Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he did not file a workers' compensation claim until after his employment with Defendant was terminated, (Arriaza Depo. Tr. at 29:12-30:8); and (2) Plaintiff testified that Defendant had never refused him any requested "accommodation" while he was employed [*5]  there. (Id. at 24:9-23; Def.'s Mot. at 2-3.)
The cited deposition testimony appears to be the result of defense counsel taking advantage of a lay person's ignorance of the legal process and legal terms; it does not serve as some sort of "smoking gun" admission by Plaintiff that his case has no merit. In addition, even though Defendant thought it best to delete the objections made during these portions of Plaintiff's deposition in its motion, the Court sustains them on the grounds stated.
Furthermore, although Defendant did not file a formal application for the adjudication of claims with the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board until after his termination, he declared under oath that he has "received benefits through what [he understood] was Defendant's workers' compensation insurance carrier" since as early as 2005. (Arriaza Decl. ¶ 6.) In addition, Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff a mere two months after discovering his permanent disability status suffices to create an inference of unlawful discrimination. (Id. ¶ 8-10.) Finally, Plaintiff's counsel has declared under oath that there are outstanding discovery requests relevant to material issues in dispute on all of Plaintiff's [*6]  claims. (Mirroknian Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) Defendant does not contest this statement. As such, the Court finds the motion to be premature as well. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).
For these reasons, Defendant's argument fails with respect to the first cause of action.2

2. The Age Discrimination Claim
To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under FEHA through circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must "show that he was: (1) a member of a protected class [age 40-70]; (2) performing his job in a satisfactory manner; (3) discharged; and (4) replaced by a substantially younger employee with equal or inferior qualifications." Nidds, 113 F.3d at 917. This last prong can be established "by showing the employer had a continuing need for his skills and services in that his various duties were still being performed, . . . or by showing that others not in [plaintiff's] protected class were treated more favorably." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Although Defendant is correct that Plaintiff's deposition testimony does not create an inference of age-based discrimination, (Arriaza Depo. Tr. 25:5-27:1), it is not entitled to summary judgment on this claim because, as already noted, there are outstanding discovery requests relevant [*7]  to this issue. (Mirroknian Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)

3. The Failure to Prevent Discrimination Claim
"The FEHA makes it a separate unlawful employment practice for an employer to 'fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.'" State Dept. of Health Servs. v. Superior Court, 31 Cal. 4th 1026, 1040, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441, 79 P.3d 556 (2003) (quoting Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(k)). Defendant's argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim rests on its assertion that "[t]here is no evidence of discrimination or harassment here, much less a failure to take reasonable steps to avoid it." (Def.'s Mot. at 5.) As already noted, the timeline of Defendant learning of Plaintiff's permanent disability and Defendant's decision to lay off Plaintiff suffices to create an inference of unlawful discrimination. In addition, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that laying someone off so soon after learning about his permanent disability status is not a reasonable step to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.

4. The Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Claim
"[T]he employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts that (1) reasonable accommodation was offered and refused; [*8]  (2) there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation; or (3) the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000).3 Defendant's argument on this count relies on the same deposition testimony it used for its argument on the first cause of action. It has no more probative value on this claim than it did on the first. In addition, the timeline of Defendant learning of Plaintiff's permanent disability status and its subsequent decision to lay him off suffices to create an inference that Defendant failed to offer reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff. Thus, Defendant has not met its burden in establishing any of the three possible defenses identified in Jensen.

B. The Wrongful and Tortious Discharge Claim
"An actual or constructive discharge in violation of fundamental public policy gives rise to a tort action in favor of the terminated employee." Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1252, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). "An employer has no [*9]  right to terminate employment for a reason that contravenes fundamental public policy as expressed in a constitutional or statutory provision." Id. Because Defendant failed to establish it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FEHA claims, it is not entitled to summary judgment on this claim either, because if Plaintiff succeeds on any of those claims, he succeeds on this claim.

C. The Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim
"The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is comprised of three elements: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) the plaintiff's injuries were actually and proximately caused by the defendant's outrageous conduct." McMahon v. Craig, 176 Cal. App. 4th 1502, 1515, 97 Cal. Rptr. 3d 555 (2009) (internal quotation marks
omitted). When an employee's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim "is based on conduct normally occurring in the workplace, it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board." Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 151, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987). However, "Cole does not prohibit all emotional distress causes of action against [*10]  an employer, but only those based on conduct that is a normal risk of the employment relationship." Fretland v. County of Humboldt, 69 Cal. App. 4th 1478, 1492, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 359 (1999). "[W]ork-related injury discrimination is not a normal risk" of the workplace. Id. Here, Defendant has failed to establish that there are no genuine issues of fact as to whether it engaged in unlawful work-related discrimination. Defendant also failed to establish that there were no genuine issues of fact about whether Plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress. In fact, the very little evidence before the Court on this issue suggests he did. (Arriaza Depo. Tr. 36:13-38:17; Arriaza Decl. ¶ 12.) Finally, Defendant did not attempt to argue Plaintiff's alleged injuries were not "actually and proximately caused" by Defendant's conduct. Because Defendant failed to prove there were no issues of genuine fact on any of these elements, it is not entitled to summary judgment on this claim either.

IV. CONCLUSION
Defendant's motion is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
