MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

I. INTRODUCTION
Terry Near ("Near") brought this case against his former employer Eli Lilly and Company ("Eli Lilly") after his employment was terminated on January 7, 2005. Near alleges Eli Lilly terminated his employment in violation of public policy under the State of Iowa, discriminated against him based on a disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA), Iowa Code Chapter 216, and breached its agreement with him to pay insurance benefits. (See First Amended Complaint [*2]  (Document No. 11).)
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the parties consented to have a United States Magistrate Judge conduct all proceedings and order the entry of judgment in the case. (See Document Nos. 17, 18 & 21.)
Presently before the court is Eli Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 56). In support of the motion, Eli Lilly submitted a Brief (Document No. 59), Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Document No. 56-2) and an Appendix (Document Nos. 56-3, 56-4).
Near requested three extensions of time to respond to the motion, which were granted by the court. (See Document Nos. 60, 65, 72, 73, 77 & 78.) Near filed a Resistance (Document No. 83), with a supporting Brief (Document No. 88), Statement of Additional Material Facts (Document No. 83-2), Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Document No. 83-3), and an Appendix (Document No. 85). Near also filed a Motion to Amend Petition (Document No. 86) in response to certain arguments raised in the motion for summary judgment.
Eli Lilly submitted a Reply Brief (Document No. 93), Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts (Document No. 93-3), and Supplemental Appendix (Document No. 93-2).
The court heard [*3]  oral arguments (see Minute Entry No. 100) and considers the matter fully submitted. For the reasons that follow, Eli Lilly's Motion for Summary Judgment shall be granted in part and denied in part, and Near's Motion to Amend Petition shall be denied.

II. STANDARDS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits, "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The party opposing a properly supported motion "'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but . . . must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. At this stage, the court's function is not to determine credibility, weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter. Id. at 249, 255. Instead, the court views the [*4]  record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determines whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Id.
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has cautioned that summary judgment is disfavored and should seldom be granted in employment discrimination cases because the issues often turn on inferences or "intent" rather than on direct evidence, and are "inherently fact-based." See, e.g., Simpson v. Des Moines Water Works, 425 F.3d 538, 542 (8th Cir. 2005); E.E.O.C. v. Woodbridge Corp., 263 F.3d 812, 814 (8th Cir. 2001)(citing Crawford v. Runyon, 37 F.3d 1338, 1341 (8th Cir. 1994)); Ross v. Alegent Health, 380 F.Supp.2d 1029, 1034 (S.D. Iowa 2005)(citing Eighth Circuit cases). Nonetheless, "summary judgment is proper when a plaintiff fails to establish a factual dispute on an essential element of [the] case." Woodbridge Corp., 263 F.3d at 814.
The court will apply these standards to address Eli Lilly's motion for summary judgment.

III. SUMMARY OF FACTS
In support of their respective arguments, the parties submitted extensive, and often repetitive, statements of fact which the court has carefully reviewed, along with the underlying evidentiary record, in the light most favorable to Near. While the expanse and repetitiveness of the statements certainly do not weigh upon the merits of the parties' legal claims and defenses, the court makes this reference to note the following summary does not encompass all the statements presented by the parties and considered [*5]  by the court. Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed based on the parties' statements of facts, responses thereto, and the record submitted by the parties.
Eli Lilly is a global, research-based pharmaceutical company that develops and manufactures pharmaceutical products and employs sales representatives throughout the United States. Near began his employment as a sales representative on July 1, 1996, and later became a senior sales representative until his employment was terminated effective January 7, 2005.
During relevant portions of Near's employment, including at termination, district sales manager Loren Ginden ("Ginden") was his immediate supervisor and Rebecca Crosley ("Crosley") was his human resources representative.
Eli Lilly's employment policies are available to all employees in an employee handbook. The "Disciplinary Actions" section of the handbook lists certain behaviors that may cause an employee's immediate discharge from employment, including "absence of three days without notice." Another section of the handbook, entitled "Absence from Work," reminds each employee that "an absence that is not reported for three days may result in dismissal." Near [*6]  received, read and understood Eli Lilly's employee handbook.
In addition to personally calling on medical professionals in their assigned sales territories, which is an essential duty, Eli Lilly's sales representatives have a number of job duties and responsibilities that they perform from home, including complying with administrative obligations such as checking email and voice-mail, completing required online training exercises, preparing and submitting expense reports, tracking and accounting for drug samples (sample accountability), and responding to inquiries from their supervisors.
As a sales representative, Near was responsible for maintaining regular contact with his district sales manager via a cell phone provided by Eli Lilly and the company's voicemail and email systems.
On May 24, 2004, Near was involved in an automobile accident while driving to a business meeting. He took a medical leave of absence that began immediately after the accident, during which he was restricted from performing any work. At the time, Near was eligible for up to twelve months of Illness Pay. He received full pay from Eli Lilly while he was on medical leave, from the time of his accident through the [*7]  end of his employment, and also received workers' compensation benefits.
During the medical leave, Near remained in communication with Eli Lilly regarding his medical status by using his home phone, company cell phone and the voice-mail and email systems. As of late September 2004, Near remained off work on medical leave and fully restricted by medical providers from returning to work, and it was undetermined when he would be able to return to work.
Near's sales representative position remained open for his return from the time of his accident until September 2004, when Crosley sent Near a letter informing him that Eli Lilly was filling his position and he would be placed on medical reassignment upon his return to work. The letter provided, in part, the following information regarding his employment status effective upon his return:
You will have 16 weeks to obtain a new position, provided you maintain acceptable performance and conduct. If you are unable to locate a new position within 16 weeks, you will be separated from the company for failure to locate a position.
(Crosley Letter dated September 29, 2004.)
According to Crosley, she received a telephone call on December 4, 2004, from [*8]  Jennifer Easler, a Registered Nurse and Case Manager who worked with Eli Lilly's workers' compensation carrier, Liberty Mutual, and was Near's workers' compensation case manager. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 10.) As stated in Crosley's affidavit, Easler informed her that Near's neurologist and orthopedist had cleared him to return to work on December 8, 2004, with a restriction to perform only sedentary work, which she anticipated would be lifted within the next few months. (Id. ¶ 12.) The handwritten notes of Crosley, which were attached in support of her affidavit, state as follows:
Jennifer Easler RIT Terry Near
* * *
Return to Work 12/8/04
w/ work restrictions
(Id. Ex. C.)
Near denies the statements of Crosley and raises several challenges to the veracity of the underlying information attributed to Easler. Near believes he was still on medical restrictions at the time and was not released to work by the neurologist, Dr. Dan Johnson, until January 7, 2005, after his employment was terminated. (Near Aff. ¶ 16.) Near notes Dr. Johnson saw him on November 19, 2004, and referred Near for tests which took place on December 8, 2004. After a follow up visit on January 7, 2005, Dr. Johnson gave Near a work [*9]  release so he could "return to work at a sedentary job with minimal driving for only short distances of less than one mile." (Dr. Johnson Letter dated January 7, 2005; Return to Work Form dated January 7, 2005.)
According to Dr. Johnson, Near was not released for sedentary or regular duty prior to January 7, 2005. (Dr. Johnson Dep. Tr. at 17.) There is no dictation in Dr. Johnson's file that he released Near to work or that he had spoken to Easler prior to January 7, 2005. (Id. at 18-19.)
Near notes Eli Lilly has not produced any affidavit, deposition or other sworn statement of Easler indicating Near had been released by the neurologist to return to work on December 8, 2004. Near further points out the absence of any note, letter, email or other written communication authored by Easler on the subject.
According to Crosley, she called Near on December 7, 2004,
to discuss his return to work on December 8 and Near informed me that, although he was released to return to sedentary work, he had a doctor's appointment on December 8 and requested that his return to work date be moved to December 9. I approved this modified return to work date and told Near he needed to talk to his District Manager to discuss [*10]  his job duties and responsibilities upon his return to work and reminded Near that he would return to work on medical reassignment status, during which he would have sixteen (16) weeks to find a new position within Lilly. Near did not dispute his ability to return to work and nothing in the conversation gave me reason to believe my understanding of his sole medical restriction was incorrect.
(Crosley Aff. ¶¶ 13-15.) Near disputes the statements of Crosley and presents a different version of the December 7 conversation in his sworn affidavit:
In early December, likely on December 7, 2005, I expressed concern that I was not released to return to work, by the neurologist, to Rebecca Crosley. I was suffering from a closed-head injury at that time. On December 7, 2005, I could not hold an in-depth conversation, with Rebecca Crosley, because I was confused due to my closed-head injury.
(Near Aff. ¶¶ 4-5.)
On December 8, 2004, Crosley sent Near a letter explaining that, effective upon his December 9, 2004, return to work, he would have sixteen weeks to obtain a new position provided he maintained acceptable performance and conduct.
According to Ginden, he talked to Near by telephone on December [*11]  10, 2004, about his job duties and responsibilities upon his return to work, and he informed Near that he expected him to complete the administrative tasks that Near had failed to complete before his medical leave, including submitting his outstanding expense reports by December 15, 2004, and completing his online training sessions by December 17, 2004. (Ginden Aff. ¶ 6.) He agreed to meet Near on December 20, 2004, to complete Near's final 2004 performance review, and Ginden asked Near to send him an electronic copy of his 2004 performance review by December 15, 2004. (Id. ¶ 7.) Ginden states Near did not tell him that he was unable to perform any of these tasks, or tell Ginden he was medically restricted from returning to work in a sedentary role; and nothing in the conversation gave Ginden reason to believe his understanding of Near's sole medical restriction was incorrect. (Id. ¶ 8.)
Near denies the sworn statements of Ginden and states that he does not remember any agreement to meet with Ginden on December 20, 2004, but acknowledges he "was suffering from a closed-head injury at that time" and was very confused. (Near Aff. ¶¶ 6-7.) He further states that he told Ginden in December [*12]  2004 that he was having trouble driving and doing work due to his closed head injury. (Id. ¶ 8.)
Ginden sent an email to Near dated December 10, 2004, which states as follows:
I wanted to send you an email with the highlights of our call today, Friday, 12/10/2004.
Here is what we discussed:
• We will meet on Monday, December 20, 2004, in Iowa to finalize 2004 and go through your final performance review. I will follow up with you to let you know the time and location of our meeting. Plan on a mid-morning start time.
• Please send me an electronic copy of your 2004 [sic] document that you should have created while still on Randy Buller's team in early 2004. Please send this by December 15th.
• You must get on-line and get up to date on your outstanding EERS account. You will need to make sure that I am still the approver before doing your expense reports. In addition, you still have not done your expense report for your quota trip expenses. When you do this report, you will need to check the box "charge to district other than your own" and make sure that the charges go to Randy Buller's district. You may need to send Randy a voice mail in order to get his district number. If you need help [*13]  doing any of these EERS reports please call the EERS hot line at 1-866-433-3377.
• We agreed that this would be completed by Wednesday, December 15, 2004.
• You need to get current with all GPP trainings in My Workplace. Some of these trainings may require you to get a hold of training CD's from sales services at 800-222-4639. Tell them your situation and the times that you have been off. They should be able to get you what you need. Some of this we may need to cover together while meeting in Iowa on the 20th.
• We agreed that you would complete what you can by Friday, December 17, 2004.
(Ginden email dated December 10, 2004.) Near acknowledges receiving the email but does "not recall or believe that it summarized [their] conversation." (Near Aff. ¶ 9.)
According to Crosley, Near informed her on December 10 that he planned to meet with Ginden on December 20 to discuss his 2004 performance review. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 17.) As explained by Crosley, Near told her that he understood he had sixteen weeks to locate a position within Eli Lilly and did not tell Crosley he was unable to perform any of the tasks Ginden assigned or that he was medically restricted from returning to work in this sedentary [*14]  role. (Id. ¶ 18.)
Near again disputes the sworn statements of Crosley, stating as follows:
. . . I do not recall her telling me about the sixteen week period, but I did suffer, and continue to suffer, from a closed head injury. I do not remember telling Rebecca Crosley that I would be able to accomplish tasks assigned by Loren Ginden, but, again, I suffer from a closed head injury. I believe I did not tell Rebecca Crosley, on December 10, 2004, that I planned to meet Loren Ginden on December 20, 2004. I was, however, suffering from a closed head injury at the time. I do not believe Ginden discussed the six [sic] week period with Crosley and me on December 20, 2004, or that I failed to indicate I was on medical restrictions. Again, however, I was suffering from a closed-head injury.
(Near Aff. ¶ 10-13.)
The only accommodation Near requested during his medical reassignment was that any new sales representative position be located in a smaller territory, and that Eli Lilly work with him "in good faith" to find something that would fill that request. Near viewed his restrictions as temporary because he understood that as his condition improved, he would get better. Near now claims that as [*15]  of December 10, 2004, no accommodation would have allowed him to function as a Eli Lilly sales representative.
Ginden states that after their December 10 discussion, he repeatedly attempted to contact Near by leaving three voice-mail messages on the Eli Lilly voice-mail system, leaving additional messages on Near's cell phone requesting that Near return his call by December 19, sending emails, and trying to contact Near at his home phone number, but each time he called he was transferred to a fax line. (Ginden ¶ 10.) According to Ginden, Near never returned his multiple phone calls and, as of December 19, had not contacted him. (Id. ¶ 11.)
Near acknowledges that he received phone and email messages from Ginden after their December 10 discussion but has no knowledge whether he returned these messages. He explains as follows:
I do not recall receiving repeated requests and voicemails, by Loren Ginden, after December 10, 2004, but acknowledge there may have been voicemails from Loren Ginden. Because I do not remember these calls, I do not know if I returned them. I was suffering from a closed head injury. I was taking a lot of medications.
(Near Aff. ¶ 14.)
Crosley sent Near a letter dated [*16]  December 22, 2004, which stated:
You have been absent from work from December 11, 2004 through December 22, 2004, and you have not properly notified your management regarding your absence. Your manager, Loren Ginden has made several attempts to reach you by voicemail, cellular phone and home phone requesting specific responses with specific deadlines from you. Additionally, Loren gave you explicit instructions on when and how to contact him. I attempted to reach you on December 20, 2004 by cellular phone and got no answer. You agreed with Loren on December 10, 2004 that you would complete multiple tasks including expense reports and GPP training, by December 15 and 17, 2004. You have failed to complete these action items, and have provided no reason as to why they weren't completed. These action items were due prior to your medical leave, which began on May 25, 2004 and ended on December 7, 2004. Additionally, you were scheduled to meet Loren on December 20, for your final performance review. Because you did not follow up with him after at least 6 attempts to contact you, your performance review was not completed. Loren's multiple attempts to contact you have not been successful, and [*17]  you have not made phone contact with him or myself as requested. As of today, neither one of us have actually spoken to you, despite our requests.
I am sending you this letter to make sure you understand that it is absolutely paramount that Loren Ginden and myself speak to you immediately. The expectation is that you make live contact with Loren Ginden on January 3, 2005, at 9:00 a.m. via phone number 913-909-8229. Additionally, please contact me at 317-997-0503 on January 3, 2005 prior to 10:00 a.m. We are interested in your well being, as well as helping you understand the policies regarding absences from work. Currently, you are not complying with policy, and being absent from work for more than three days without appropriate documentation and approvals may result in termination.
Again, I urge you to make immediate contact with Loren Ginden and myself.
(Crosley Letter dated December 22, 2004.)
On the morning of January 3, 2005, Near contacted Ginden and said he had lost his cell phone and was having computer problems, and said that he did not believe he had been released to return to work and did not recall speaking with Ginden on December 10. (Near Dep. Tr. at 98-99; Ginden Aff. ¶ [*18]  12.) Later that morning, when Ginden and Crosley contacted Near to discuss further his explanation for failing to return Ginden's calls and messages, Near reiterated that he had lost his cell phone and had computer problems and also stated that he did not think he should have been cleared to return to work. (Ginden Aff. ¶ 13.)
Crosley states she called Easler on January 4, 2005, and Easler reconfirmed Near's neurologist and his orthopedist had cleared him to return to work on December 8, 2004, with a restriction to perform only sedentary work. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 20.) Near denies this statement and again disputes the underlying information allegedly provided by Easler to Crosley. Near also points out there are no notes of this conversation with Easler even though Crosley kept notes of other conversations with Easler. Near further notes that there is no documentation in the record to indicate that Near had been released to work between December 9, 2004, and December 23, 2004.
According to Crosley and Ginden, they decided Near's employment with Eli Lilly should be terminated because he was absent from work without notice from December 13, 2004 to December 23, 2004, failed to comply with repeated [*19]  oral requests and voice-mails requesting that he return telephone calls, and failed to make contact with Ginden regarding non-completion of assigned tasks and performance management review. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 21; Ginden Aff. ¶ 14.)
On January 6, 2005, after receiving authorization to proceed with termination, Crosley and Ginden called Near and informed him that Eli Lilly had decided to terminate his employment because he was absent from work without notice for more than three days, and Crosley then sent Near a letter stating that Near's employment was ended effective January 7, 2005. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 22; Ginden Aff. ¶ 15.) The letter stated, in part:
You were absent from work December 13, 2004 to December 23, 2004. You failed to comply with repeated oral requests and voicemails requesting that you return telephone calls and make contact with your district manager, Loren Ginden regarding the completion of multiple tasks and your performance management review.
Because you were absent from work for three days without notice, your employment is considered a voluntary separation effective end of day January 7, 2005.
(Crosley Letter dated January 6, 2005.)
Near did not consider the reasons given [*20]  by Crosley and Ginden for terminating his employment to be dishonest, but he felt they did not have a complete understanding of his situation "[e]specially as it relates to the nature of the injuries sustained in the accident and the treatment thereafter and the patient's recovery after a closed head injury." (Near Dep. Tr. at 102-03.)
Near does not recall having any specific conversations with Ginden or Crosley about his eligibility under the EDL Plan or his filing for and receipt of workers' compensation benefits. (Near Dep. Tr. at 190, 194.) Near also does not recall anyone at Eli Lilly ever expressing displeasure at his having requested and received workers' compensation benefits. (Id. at 194-95.)
Near acknowledges that by approximately nine months after his accident, by February 2005, he was able to perform the sales representative job with assistance with driving and administrative tasks. (Id. at 210-12.) Within approximately twelve months after his accident, Near was fully capable of effectively performing all responsibilities of a sales representative without assistance. (Id. at 212.)
Other facts relevant to specific claims or defenses are set forth below.

IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS

A. Discharge in Violation of Public Policy [*21] 
Near believes his discharge was motivated by the fact he reported a workers' compensation injury and received benefits and may have eventually filed a claim for further disability benefits from Eli Lilly. (See First Amended Complaint, Count II, ¶ 11.) He contends, therefore, the discharge was contrary to the public policy of the State of Iowa. (Id. ¶ 12.)
Under Iowa law, "a discharged employee may maintain a cause of action when the discharge serves to frustrate a well-recognized and defined policy of the state." Bennett v. City of Redfield, 446 N.W.2d 467, 474 (Iowa 1989). "The employer's action must offend a clearly articulated public policy of [the] state to be actionable." Id. In other words, "[a]n action for the tort of wrongful discharge exists when a protected activity has been recognized through the implementation of an underlying public policy that would be undermined if an employee were discharged from employment for engaging in that activity." Davis v. Horton, 661 N.W.2d 533, 535 (Iowa 2003).
The Iowa Supreme Court has "held that one of the 'well-recognized and defined public policies' in employment relationships is violated when an employer discharges an employee for exercising his rights under the workers' compensation statute." Below v. Skarr, 569 N.W.2d 510, 511 (Iowa 1997)(citing Springer v. Weeks & Leo Co., 429 N.W.2d 558, 559-60 (Iowa 1988); Smith v. Smithway Motor Xpress, Inc., 464 N.W.2d 682, 685 (Iowa 1990)(holding that employer may be liable for [*22]  wrongful termination even if employer does not interfere with actual receipt of workers' compensation benefits)); Niblo v. Parr Mfg., Inc., 445 N.W.2d 351, 352-53 (Iowa 1989)(affirming jury verdict for employee where jury could have found employee's discharge was due to threat to file workers' compensation claim).
In setting forth the elements of his claim for retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy, Near correctly notes courts have utilized either a three prong or four prong test under Iowa law. The Iowa Supreme Court has set forth the following four elements for a wrongful discharge claim:
(1) The existence of a clearly defined public policy that protects an activity.
(2) This policy would be undermined by a discharge from employment.
(3) The challenged discharge was the result of participating in the protected activity.
(4) There was lack of other justification for the termination.
Lloyd v. Drake University, 686 N.W.2d 225, 228 (Iowa 2004)(quoting Davis, 661 N.W.2d at 535). These four "requirements have been identified as the clarity element, jeopardy element, causation element, and absence-of-justification element." Davis, 661 N.W.2d at 535-36.
The Iowa Supreme Court reiterated these four elements of a wrongful discharge claim in recent opinions. See George v. D.W. Zinser Co., 762 N.W.2d 865, 871 (Iowa 2009)(quoting Davis, 661 N.W.2d at 535); Jasper v. H. Nizam, Inc., 764 N.W.2d 751, 761 (Iowa 2009)(citing Lloyd, 686 N.W.2d at 228).
Prior to those recent decisions, the Iowa Supreme Court had identified [*23]  the following three elements of an action to recover damages for discharge in violation of public policy: "(1) engagement in a protected activity; (2) discharge; and (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the discharge." Fitzgerald v. Salsbury Chemical, Inc., 613 N.W.2d 275, 281 (Iowa 2000)(citing Teachout v. Forest City Cmty. Sch. Dist., 584 N.W.2d 296, 299 (Iowa 1998)). Even though the test appears to have changed from these earlier cases, the Court of Appeals of Iowa found, in an unpublished opinion, no need for clarification of the analytical framework for wrongful discharge claims especially in light of comments in the Fitzgerald decision. Arispe v. Walgreens Co., 2008 Iowa App. LEXIS 1076, 2008 WL 4724749 *3, n. 2 (Iowa Ct. App. October 29, 2008).
The Fitzgerald court noted the three "elements properly identify the tort of wrongful discharge." Fitzgerald, 613 N.W.2d at 281. As an apparent precursor to the more recent opinions of the Iowa Supreme Court, the Fitzgerald court also noted other courts were beginning to articulate the four elements for a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Id. at 282, n. 2. The Fitzgerald court further stated that, in addition to the three elements, a plaintiff must "offer adequate evidence from which a lack of justification for termination can be inferred" to withstand summary judgment. Id. at 282.
Federal courts in Iowa have continued to address the claim of wrongful discharge under the three-element test. See Bumgarner v. Grafco Indus., 581 F.Supp.2d 1052, 1061 (S.D. Iowa 2008); Raymond v. U.S.A. Healthcare Center, 468 F.Supp.2d 1047, 1056-60 (N.D. Iowa 2006); Gaston v. The Restaurant Company, 260 F.Supp.2d 742, 758 (N.D. Iowa 2003).
In his briefing, Near [*24]  utilizes the three-prong test applied by the federal courts to support his claim in this case. This court finds no reason to delve any further at this point into the distinctions, if any, between the three-element or four-element tests. While those issues may need to be resolved at trial, the court will focus presently on the arguments raised by the parties as relevant to the summary judgment motion, which appear to arise under the application of either test. Specifically, the issues before this court center on the causation and absence-of-justification components of the claim.
Eli Lilly argues it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Near has not presented sufficient evidence to show a causal connection between his discharge and his claim for workers' compensation benefits. Eli Lilly contends legal justification existed for the termination of Near's employment and there is no direct or circumstantial evidence that the termination was motivated by his workers' compensation claim. In its view, Near's employment was legally terminated because he was absent from work without notice for over three days and Near has nothing but his own speculation that his discharge was in any [*25]  way related to his workers' compensation claim.
After consideration of Eli Lilly's argument and the applicable legal authority, this court finds it is unable to resolve the questions of causation and justification as a matter of law because of material factual disputes in the record. Under Iowa law, "'[t]he causation standard in a common-law retaliatory discharge case is high.'" Napreljac v. John Q. Hammons Hotels, Inc., 505 F.3d 800, 803 (8th Cir. 2007)(quoting Teachout, 584 N.W.2d at 301). "The protected conduct must be the determinative factor in the decision to terminate the employee." Fitzgerald, 613 N.W.2d at 289 (citing Teachout, 584 N.W.2d at 301-02); see also Smithway Motor Xpress, 464 N.W.2d at 686 (trial court did not err in instructing jury plaintiff had burden of proving his claim for workers' compensation benefits was the determining factor in employer's decision to fire him). "A factor is determinative if it is the reason that 'tips the scales decisively one way or the other,' even if it is not the predominant reason behind the employer's decision." Teachout, 584 N.W.2d at 302; see also Smithway Motor Xpress, 464 N.W.2d at 686 (determinative factor "need not be the main reason behind the decision"); Bumgarner, 581 F.Supp.2d at 1062 (summarizing causation standard).
The Iowa Supreme Court has noted, however, the elements of causation and motive in the wrongful discharge context "'are factual in nature and generally more suitable for resolution by the finder of fact.'" [*26]  Lloyd, 686 N.W.2d at 229 (quoting Fitzgerald, 613 N.W.2d at 282). As explained by the Fitzgerald court,
Generally, causation presents a question of fact. Thus, if there is a dispute over the conduct or the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the conduct, the jury must resolve the dispute. Additionally, any dispute over the employer's knowledge of the conduct is generally for the jury, as well as the existence of other justifiable reasons for the termination.
Fitzgerald, 613 N.W.2d at 289 (internal citation omitted).
Here, several different inferences can be reasonably drawn from the evidence in the record on the issues of causation and justification for the termination of Near's employment which preclude summary judgment in favor of Eli Lilly. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Near, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Near's claim for and receipt of workers' compensation benefits was the determinative factor in Eli Lilly's decision to terminate his employment.
Foremost, there is contradictory evidence, and resulting differences of opinion, as to whether Near had in fact been cleared to return to work in December 2004, and as to the specific content of the parties' communications, or lack of understanding from those communications, [*27]  prior to the termination of Near's employment. Underlying the issue of whether Near had in fact been cleared to return to work by his doctor, is Near's ability to recall certain, specific events and conversations but not be able to recall others because of his medical condition. If the statements of Near are accepted as credible, a reasonable juror could find the reasons proffered by Eli Lilly for the termination are not supported by the underlying facts and, instead, were a pretext for wrongful discharge.
The court rejects Eli Lilly's contention that whether Near was, in fact, released to return to work in December 2004 is irrelevant. Eli Lilly asks this court to ignore the contradictory evidence regarding Near's medical release and, instead, focus solely on the decision-makers' "honest belief" about Near's ability to return to work. Contrary to Eli Lilly's position, however, the existence of a factual dispute as to whether Near had been released by his doctors, and the apparent lack of any supporting evidence showing he had in fact been released in December 2004, raises legitimate questions as to whether Crosley's and Ginden's stated beliefs were truly "honest" as argued by Eli Lilly [*28]  or were merely a pretext for illegal motivation as argued by Near.
In addition to raising genuine questions as to Eli Lilly's underlying justification for the termination, Near has also presented evidence supporting his claim that Eli Lilly was actively engaged in seeking to find reasons to deny his workers' compensation benefits. Near primarily relies upon a series of notes and correspondence between Eli Lilly and its workers' compensation carrier relating to Near's accident and entitlement to workers' compensation benefits. In Near's opinion, this written documentation shows he was clearly set up for firing by Eli Lilly in retaliation for his reporting and receipt of workers' compensation benefits. While Eli Lilly disputes the inferences Near draws from the notes and correspondence, the ultimate resolution of those disputes, and the true inferences to be drawn from the evidence, is for the fact-finding jury, not this court upon a summary judgment motion.
In sum, this court concludes Eli Lilly is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Near has shown genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the decision-makers [*29]  for the termination of his employment were motivated by his filing for and receipt of workers' compensation benefits. Viewing the evidence presented to the court in the light most favorable to Near, a reasonable juror could conclude his employment was terminated because of his workers' compensation claim and receipt of benefits. On the other hand, a reasonable juror could agree with Eli Lilly's position that Near's employment was legitimately terminated because he was absent from work without notice. Consequently, the decision-makers' actual motivation and justification for the termination, and whether they violated public policy in discharging Near, are questions for the jury to ultimately decide after considering the credibility of witnesses and weighing the relevant evidence to determine the truth of the matter.

B. Disability Claims
The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . discharge of employees . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Peyton v. Fred's Stores, 561 F.3d 900, 902 (8th Cir. 2009). Discrimination is defined to include
not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise [*30]  qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.
42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Peyton, 561 F.3d at 902.
Here, Near contends Eli Lilly failed to make reasonable accommodations for his limitations from a disability and terminated his employment because of the disability. (See First Amended Complaint, Count IV, ¶¶ 15-23.) In its' motion for summary judgment, Eli Lilly argues Near cannot sustain a claim of disability discrimination or failure to accommodate.
Near may survive Eli Lilly's motion for summary judgment by presenting either direct or inferential evidence of discrimination. Libel v. Adventure Lands of America, Inc., 482 F.3d 1028, 1034 (8th Cir. 2007)(citing Griffith v. City of Des Moines, 387 F.3d 733, 736 (8th Cir. 2004)).
Direct evidence in this context is not the converse of circumstantial evidence. "Rather, direct evidence is evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action."
. . . [I]f the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of discrimination, she must avoid summary judgment by creating the requisite inference [*31]  of unlawful discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Under this analysis, the employee bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.
Id. (citations omitted); see also Rehrs v. Iams Co., 486 F.3d 353, 356 (8th Cir. 2007).
Here, Near presents insufficient direct evidence of discrimination and, therefore, must create the requisite inference of unlawful discrimination to avoid summary judgment. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Near must show: (1) he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability. See, e.g., Buboltz v. Residential Advantages, Inc., 523 F.3d 864, 868 (8th Cir. 2008); Napreljac, 505 F.3d at 804; Libel, 482 F.3d at 1034; Rehrs, 486 F.3d at 356; Simpson, 425 F.3d at 542; Burchett v. Target Corp., 340 F.3d 510, 516 (8th Cir. 2003); Kellogg v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 233 F.3d 1083, 1086 (8th Cir. 2000); Ross, 380 F.Supp.2d at 1035.
If Near establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to Eli Lilly to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct. See Libel, 482 F.3d at 1034; Rehrs, 486 F.3d at 356; Ross, 380 F.Supp.2d at 1035. If Eli Lilly articulates such a reason, the burden returns to Near to show Eli Lilly's justification is a pretext for discrimination. See id. The ultimate burden of proving discrimination remains with Near. Ross, 380 F.Supp.2d at 1035.
Claims under the ICRA, Iowa Code Chapter 216, are evaluated under the same analytical framework utilized by federal [*32]  courts for assessing federal law. Tjernagel v. Gates Corp., 533 F.3d 666, 671 (8th Cir. 2008); Ross, 380 F.Supp.2d at 1035, n. 6.
Eli Lilly raises the following challenges as to whether Near's claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate fail as a matter of law.

1. Whether Near has a Disability Within the Meaning of the ADA
Disability is defined under the ADA as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); see also Kellogg, 233 F.3d at 1086-87 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)); Ross, 380 F.Supp.2d at 1035-36 (quoting Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 948-49 (8th Cir. 1999)(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2))). Here, Near contends he qualifies as disabled under all three subsections.
Beginning with the first definition, Eli Lilly argues Near was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA because he had only temporary medical restrictions and his limitations do not substantially limit any major life activity.
As explained by the Eighth Circuit,
[u]nder the ADA and ICRA, a disability means an "individual must have (1) 'a physical or mental impairment' that (2) 'substantially limits one or more major life activities' of the individual." Having a physical or mental impairment is not enough because the impairment must also comprise a substantial limitation of [*33]  a major life activity.
Tjernagel, 533 F.3d at 671-72 (citations omitted).
According to EEOC regulations, "an impairment is 'substantially limiting' if it renders an individual unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform, or if it significantly restricts the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform such an activity compared to the general population." Cooper v. Olin Corp., 246 F.3d 1083, 1088 (8th Cir. 2001)(citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i)-(ii)); see also Samuels v. Kansas City Missouri Sch. Dist., 437 F.3d 797, 802 (8th Cir. 2006)(same); Webner v. Titan Distrib., Inc., 267 F.3d 828, 834 (8th Cir. 2001)(same).
Several factors are considered in making this determination: "(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) its duration or anticipated duration; and (3) its long-term impact." Cooper, 246 F.3d at 1088 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2)(i)-(iii)); Samuels, 437 F.3d at 802 (same). "[T]emporary impairments, with little or no long-term impact are not disabilities." Samuels, 437 F.3d at 802. The examination of whether an impairment substantial limits an individual "in a major life activity must be made on a case by case basis." Fjellestad, 188 F.3d at 949.
Eli Lilly, in support of its argument that Near is not disabled under the ADA, relies upon the statements of Dr. Johnson. On January 7, 2005, Dr. Johnson gave Near a work release so he could "return to work at a sedentary job with minimal driving for only short distances of less than one mile." (Dr. Johnson Letter dated January [*34]  7, 2005; Return to Work Form dated January 7, 2005.) In a letter dated February 24, 2005, Dr. Johnson indicated Near was "doing very well":
I saw Mr. Near in my office on 02/24/05 for his posttraumatic vestibulopathy and migraines. He is doing very well. He is now on Amitriptyline 100 mg. q h.s. His vestibular therapy has eliminated his vertigo. His migraines are down to 1 debilitating headache per month, which we are trying to treat with Imitrex.
At this point, I have no restrictions on his activities. His impairment rating is 0%. He does have these persistent posttraumatic migraines, which may or may not last forever, but which we should be able to treat adequately. Patient is at maximum medical improvement.
(Dr. Johnson Letter dated February 24, 2005.)
Eli Lilly also points to deposition testimony by Near himself as evidence his medical restrictions on his ability to work were temporary. For example, when asked in March 2008 whether he was medically capable of effectively performing as a pharmaceutical sales representative with or without reasonable accommodation, Near responded: "I believe I am with and without." (Near Dep. Tr. at 211.) Near further testified that he had no current [*35]  restrictions on his driving. (Id. at 125.)
Eli Lilly also notes Near's employment history after his termination on January 7, 2005. Near was employed full time as a construction-management supervisor in Tampa, Florida from March to July of 2007. He voluntarily resigned this position because he was only able to come home on weekends, which was not conducive to spending time with his family. Near indicated during his deposition that he has also been an independent contractor for a telecommunications business, working out of his home performing direct sales. (Id. at 225.) He acknowledged he is able to perform the administrative tasks and duties that this job requires. (Id. at 227.) In an affidavit dated October 20, 2008, Near stated he had worked for Brad Deery Motors from April 2008 through July 2008, and for Quad City Business Systems from July 2, 2008, to October 17, 2008. (Near Aff. ¶ 3.)
In response, Near contends he has a permanent brain function impairment and denies he is doing well. In Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Document No. 83-3), his counsel explains: "although Terry Near may feel that he can do these tasks, he is not completely reasonable in his belief that [*36]  he can do all the above tasks because he continues to have brain functions impairment." (Id. ¶ 63.) Near relies upon the reports of Dr. Kenneth Mills, a neuropsychologist, and Dr. Thomas Hughes, an occupational physician.
According to the report of Dr. Mills, Near was assessed on December 12 and 13, 2005. (Dr. Mills Report at 1.) In his Conclusions and Recommendations, Dr. Mills states Near "would appear to meet criteria for a potential diagnosis of [Mild Traumatic Brain Injury]." Id. at 35. In evaluation of whether Near has a permanent impairment, Dr. Mills further states:
At the time of the current neuropsychological assessment, Mr. Near was 16 months post-injury. Although the majority of cognitive recovery from MTBI usually occurs within the first year after injury, the potential for slow recovery of some function can extend for several years.
This gentlemen's demonstrated anxiety and depression may respond favorably to a combination of appropriate psychoactive medication and effective psychotherapy. His emotional dyscontrol may also decrease concomitantly with any improvement of his mood dis order/adjustment disorder.
Mr. Near's cognitive abilities may continue to improve over the next year [*37]  or two, even in the absence of medical treatment. Therefore, in my professional opinion and to a reasonable degree of neuropsychological certainty, he does not appear to be at a point of Maximal Medical Improvement (MMI) for his demonstrated cognitive impairments. Since he is not at a point of MMI, it would be premature to assign any level of permanent mental impairment.
Id. at 37. As for the current limitation of function, Dr. Mills stated "Near's potential for gainful employment appears to be limited by his anxious depression, his impaired attention/concentration, and his impaired nonverbal intellectual function." Id.
Dr. Hughes evaluated Near on March 3, 2006, and re-evaluated Near on October 31, 2006. (See Dr. Hughes Report dated March 11, 2006; Dr. Hughes Report dated November 10, 2006.) In his first report, Dr. Hughes stated in part as follows:
Obviously, Mr. Near has incurred a diverse number of injuries. I would certainly believe that Mr. Near had most likely incurred a closed head injury and a post-concussive syndrome that was the basis for some of his early postinjury problems. Some of the more acute effects of the post traumatic injury such as the headaches, vertigo, depression, forgetfulness [*38]  and irritability have improved somewhat with time. The most relevant issue at this time is to acknowledge that Mr. Near had incurred some chronic traumatic brain dysfunction as a consequence of this accident and this would very likely explain at least in part his compromise of cognition function, adaptability and general intellectual dysfunction. He has had a negative MRI which merely indicates that there is no clear evidence of any gross structural disorder.
. . . It would certainly appear that the condition of Mr. Near would place him into a Class I mental status disorder in that he has depression, impulsivity, frustration, disorganization, memory deficits and cognitive compromise, but is able to perform most of the activities of daily living. . . . I would recommend a rating of 10% Impairment of the Whole Person in that he has retained his capacity to perform most of the usual activities of daily living although does appear to be compromised in more demanding circumstances.
(Dr. Hughes Report dated March 11, 2006 at 9-10.) In his report after the second evaluation, which focused on an ankle injury, Dr. Hughes summarized his opinion as to a permanent impairment rating for Near as follows: [*39] 
I think Mr. Near has a 10% Whole Person Impairment Rating based on his traumatic brain injury, 5 % based on his cervical symptoms which appear to be persistent, 5 % Whole Person Impairment Rating based on his continued low back dysfunction, and a 4% based on his left foot and ankle injuries. These were combined utilizing the Combined Values table arriving at a 22% Impairment of the Whole Person.
(Dr. Hughes Report dated November 10, 2006 at 7.)
Finally, Near relies upon statements by his wife, Laurae Near, in an affidavit dated October 20, 2008, which contradict his own testimony as to his ability to perform certain daily tasks.
After reviewing the record in the light most favorable to Near, the court finds there is a genuine issue for trial as to whether Near is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. In light of the conflicting evidence, especially among the opinions of the medical professionals, there are genuine issues as to whether Near's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Those questions of material fact must be resolved by the jury, not this court on summary judgment. The court is unable to conclude as a matter of law, as urged by Eli Lilly, that Near's impairment [*40]  and limitations were temporary and unsubstantial.
Because Near survives summary judgment under the first definition of disability, the court will not address the parties' arguments at this time as to the other two definitions. While the court questions whether Near's claim of disability may be submitted to the jury under all three definitions, those issues will be addressed and resolved as part of the trial proceedings.

2. Whether Near Was Qualified to Perform Essential Functions of Job
Eli Lilly also challenges Near's ability to prove the second element of his prima facie case: whether he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his job at the time of the alleged discrimination, with or without reasonable accommodation. Eli Lilly contends Near's own testimony establishes he was not qualified to be a sales representative at any time following the May 2004 automobile accident through the termination of his employment, and no accommodation Eli Lilly could have provided would have enabled him to perform the duties of that position. Consequently, in Eli Lilly's opinion, at the time Near's employment was terminated, Near was not a qualified individual with a disability under the [*41]  ADA because he could not perform the fundamental job duties of the sales representative position even with reasonable accommodation.
In response, Near concedes that his own deposition testimony establishes that at the time he was discharged, he was not capable of performing his job as an Eli Lilly sales representative, even with a reasonable accommodation. Near argues, however, that this fact alone does not entitle Eli Lilly to summary judgment on the ADA claims because Eli Lilly terminated his employment without affording him the opportunity to determine if there were any other jobs within the company that he would have been able to perform with or without a reasonable accommodation.
Near relies primarily on the Eighth Circuit's decision in Cravens v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 214 F.3d 1011 (8th Cir. 2000). According to the Cravens court,
[t]he determination of qualification involves a two-fold inquiry: (1) whether the individual meets the necessary prerequisites for the job, such as education, experience, training, and the like; and (2) whether the individual can perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. See Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 62 F.3d 1108, 1111-12 (8th Cir. 1995)(Benson). Although the employee at all times retains the burden of persuading the trier of fact that he [*42]  or she has been the victim of illegal disability discrimination, "once the plaintiff makes 'a facial showing that reasonable accommodation is possible,' the burden of production shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the employee." Id. at 1112 (quoting Mason v. Frank, 32 F.3d 315, 318-19 (8th Cir. 1994)).
Id. at 1016. In Cravens, the Eighth Circuit held that the "qualified individual" inquiry is not limited to the employee's existing job, but includes the potential reassignment or transfer to another position with the employer:
Although a "qualified individual with a disability" must be someone who can perform the essential functions of a job, the terms of § 12111(8) do not limit the "qualified individual" inquiry to the individual's existing job. Instead, the scope of the statute plainly includes a disabled individual who can perform a company job that said individual "desires." Id. Thus, on its face, § 12111(8) appears to include current employees with a disability who seek or desire transfer to another position within the company.
Id. at 1017.
The Cravens court noted the duty on an employer to consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation was implicitly recognized in Fjellestad, where the Eighth Circuit found the plaintiff had created a genuine issue of material [*43]  fact as to whether the employer could have reassigned her to a specific, vacant position. Cravens, 214 F.3d at 1018. The Cravens court concluded that the definition of "qualified individual with a disability" includes a disabled employee who cannot do his current job, but who desires and can perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of a vacant job within the company to which he could be reassigned. Id. In reversing the district court's entry of summary judgment for the employer, the Eighth Circuit found Cravens had generated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the employer could have reassigned her to other identified positions with the company. Id. at 1020.
After examining the record here in the light most favorable to Near, the court finds genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Eli Lilly could have reasonably accommodated Near by reassigning him to another position with the company. The ADA explicitly defines "reasonable accommodation" to include "reassignment to a vacant position", 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B), and while it is not necessarily required, the Eighth Circuit recognizes reassignment as a reasonable accommodation under appropriate circumstances. See Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 486 F.3d 480, 482-84 (8th Cir. 2007); Burchett, 340 F.3d at 517; Benson, 62 F.3d at 1114. The court believes [*44]  Near has made a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation through reassignment was possible under the circumstances of this case.
In response, Eli Lilly does not show that reassigning Near would have violated a company policy or placed an undue burden on the company. Instead, Eli Lilly argues Near's claim fails because he does not identify a specific position which was available at the time of the termination even though Eli Lilly gave him an opportunity to seek an open position.
The court rejects this argument because there is evidence in the record to dispute Eli Lilly's claim that it sufficiently assisted Near to find a reasonable accommodation for his limitations. Contrary to Eli Lilly's argument which implicitly places the sole burden on Near to identify a viable and available position, "an employer must . . . engage in an interactive process to identify potential accommodations that could overcome [the employee's] limitations." Burchett, 340 F.3d at 517.
The Eighth Circuit has repeatedly, and recently, noted that "[t]o determine whether an accommodation for the employee is necessary, and if so, what the accommodation might be, it is necessary for the employer and employee to engage in an 'interactive [*45]  process.'" Peyton, 561 F.3d at 902 (citing Fjellestad and Cravens); see also Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 870 ("If . . . an employee does request an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations are possible."); Canny v. Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Bottling Group, Inc., 439 F.3d 894, 902 (8th Cir. 2006)("Under the ADA, an employer must engage in an interactive process to identify potential accommodations that could overcome the employee's limitations.").
The interactive process is informal and flexible, enabling both employer and employee to identify the employee's limitations and accommodations. If the employee needs an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process.
Kratzer v. Rockwell Collins, Inc., 398 F.3d 1040, 1045 (8th Cir. 2005)(internal citation omitted).
As explained by the Eighth Circuit, for the purposes of summary judgment,

the failure of an employer to engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations are possible is prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith. Under these circumstances, we feel a factual question exists as to whether the employer has attempted to provide reasonable accommodation as required by the ADA.
Fjellestad, 188 F.3d at 952. To establish that an employer failed to participate in an interactive process, a disabled employee must show: (1) the employer knew [*46]  about the employee's disability; (2) the employee requested accommodation or assistance for his or her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodation; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.
Cravens, 214 F.3d at 1021; see also Peyton, 561 F.3d at 902; Buboltz, 523 F.3d at 870; Canny, 439 F.3d at 902.
Applying those principles here, this court finds Near has created a genuine issue of fact as to whether Eli Lilly acted in good faith and engaged in an interactive process of seeking reasonable accommodations for his limitations. When viewed in the light most favorable to Near, a trier of fact could reasonably agree with Near that Eli Lilly did not have a complete understanding of Near's mental impairment and his ability to communicate with or respond to his supervisors. As discussed above, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Near had in fact been cleared to return to work in December 2004, and as to the specific content of the parties' communications, or lack of understanding from those communications, prior to the termination of Near's employment.
In Cravens, the Eighth Circuit noted the "breakdown in communications that apparently occurred [there was] [*47]  especially troubling in a large company like [defendant], where workers 'may not be aware of the range of available employment opportunities.'" Cravens, 214 F.3d at 1022. The same can be said here. The breakdown in communications between Near and Eli Lilly, and the resulting misunderstandings, as alleged by Near is troubling.
If a jury finds Near's testimony to be credible, there is sufficient evidence to find Eli Lilly knew about Near's disability, Near requested accommodation or assistance for his disability, Eli Lilly did not make a good faith effort to assist Near in seeking accommodation; and Near could have been reasonably accommodated but for Ely Lilly's lack of good faith. On the other hand, the jury may reject his testimony and find Eli Lilly properly engaged in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodations were possible for Near's situation. Ultimately, a factual question exists as to whether Eli Lilly sufficiently attempted to provide reasonable accommodation as required by the ADA which must be decided by the jury at trial, not by this court under summary judgment considerations.

3. Whether Eli Lilly Had a Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Eli Lilly argues Near's discrimination [*48]  claim cannot survive summary judgment for the additional reason that Eli Lilly had a legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-pretextual reason for terminating his employment. According to Crosley and Ginden, they decided to terminate Near's employment because he was absent from work without notice from December 13, 2004 to December 23, 2004, failed to comply with repeated oral requests and voice-mails requesting that he return telephone calls, and failed to make contact with Ginden regarding non-completion of assigned tasks and performance management review. (Crosley Aff. ¶ 21; Ginden Aff. ¶ 14.) Again, Eli Lilly contends Near cannot prove that Ginden and Crosley did not honestly believe the stated reasons for discharging him.
The court disagrees. As previously discussed, there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether Near had been released by his doctors at the time Eli Lilly terminated his employment. The lack of supporting evidence showing Near had in fact been released in December 2004, in addition to the evidence indicating the interactive process between Near and Eli Lilly at a minimum broke down, discredits Eli Lilly's stated reasons for terminating Near and creates a genuine issue [*49]  whether the reasons for the termination were, in fact, legitimate. When viewed in the light most favorable to Near, there is sufficient evidence to conclude Eli Lilly's justification for the termination is merely a pretext for discrimination.
In sum, the court finds Near has created the requisite inference of unlawful discrimination to avoid summary judgment on the disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims. There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether he is disabled; whether he is qualified to perform the essential functions of his job at the time of the alleged discrimination, with or without reasonable accommodation; whether Eli Lilly failed to accommodate his disability limitations and/or failed to engage in an interactive process to find a reasonable accommodation; and whether Eli Lilly had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Near's employment or if, instead, Eli Lilly's justification is a pretext for discrimination. The jury will ultimately need to resolve the factual disputes underlying these issues by determining the credibility of witnesses and weighing the evidence. Eli Lilly is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, therefore, [*50]  on the disability claims asserted under the ADA and ICRA.

C. Claims Related to Disability Benefits
In their briefs, the parties entangled themselves into disputes as to the proper legal basis for the allegations set forth by Near related to disability benefits. Near appears to assert state common law claims for the disability benefits. Eli Lilly argues the claims are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. The court agrees with Eli Lilly.
Eli Lilly sponsors an Employee Welfare Plan ("Welfare Plan") and an Extended Disability Plan ("EDL Plan") for the purpose of providing its employees with certain benefits, including disability benefits. The EDL Plan is a "Component Plan" of the Welfare Plan. Subject to its terms and conditions, the EDL Plan offers a "Company-Provided Disability Benefit" and, for those eligible employees who elect to pay for it, an enhanced disability benefit called the "EDL Plus Disability Benefit."
The Welfare Plan grants the Employee Benefits Committee ("EBC"), its administrator, the power to interpret its terms (as well as the terms of each Component Plan) and decide any and all matters arising under the plan. The Welfare Plan and [*51]  the EDL Plan include mandatory administrative claim procedures that are summarized by the EDL Plan's Summary Plan Description ("SPD"). The EDL Plan requires an "Employee" who intends to file a claim for benefits to notify the EBC.
The EBC has delegated authority to determine eligibility for benefits under the EDL Plan to Eli Lilly's Benefit Plan Review Committee. To be eligible for benefits under the EDL Plan, an employee must have "exhausted the benefits under the short-term disability or temporary illness pay program."
Under Count I of his amended complaint, Near alleges Eli Lilly breached its agreement with Near to pay insurance benefits, including disability benefits, which he was qualified to receive under his employment agreement. (See First Amended Complaint, Count I, ¶¶ 10-11.) Based on the limited allegations set forth in Count I, the claim appears to be a state common law action for breach of contract.
Near also incorporates a claim for disability benefits under Count II, the claim for wrongful discharge addressed in Part A above. (See First Amended Complaint, Count II, ¶ 11.) As reflected in the briefing, Near believes he is entitled to disability benefits under the EDL Plan [*52]  even though he never made an administrative claim for the benefits prior to the termination of his employment. He offered the following explanation during his deposition:
I was entitled to be able to apply for them prior to my termination, but I was separated from the company four weeks into a 16-week period of medical reassignment. . . . I was not given the ability to apply for a benefit that I had paid for for ten years.
(Near Dep. Tr. at 189.) At the time of termination, Near was approximately six and one-half months into the twelve months of Illness Pay before he would have even been eligible for EDL Plus Benefits. These allegations appear to assert a state common law tort action for wrongful discharge.
Under either a breach of contract or a wrongful discharge theory, this court finds Near's state common law claims for disability benefits are preempted by ERISA and fail as a matter of law. ERISA supercedes "any and all State laws insofar as they ... relate to any employee benefit plan" covered by ERISA. 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a); see Lindsay v. Cottingham & Butler Ins. Servs., 763 N.W.2d 568, 573 (Iowa 2009).
Congress enacted ERISA to "protect . . . the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries" by setting out substantive regulatory requirements [*53]  for employee benefit plans and to "provid[e] for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts." 29 U.S.C. § 1001(b). The purpose of ERISA is to provide a uniform regulatory regime over employee benefit plans. To this end, ERISA includes expansive preemption provisions, see ERISA § 514, 29 U.S.C. § 1144, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation would be "exclusively a federal concern."
ERISA's "comprehensive legislative scheme" includes "an integrated system of procedures for enforcement." This integrated enforcement mechanism, ERISA § 502(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), is a distinctive feature of ERISA, and essential to accomplish Congress' purpose of creating a comprehensive statute for the regulation of employee benefit plans. . . . Therefore, any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore preempted.
Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 208-09, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004)(quoted case citations omitted). As further explained by the Eighth Circuit,
The Supreme Court has observed [the] preemption language is "conspicuous for its breadth." FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 58, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990). The Court has acknowledged, however, that "[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit [*54]  plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law 'relates to' the plan." Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 100 n. 21, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983). In determining whether a state action "relates to" an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA, we employ a two-part test. Wilson, 114 F.3d at 716. A law relates to a covered employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA if it has (1) "a connection with" or (2) "reference to such a plan." California Div. Of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 324, 117 S.Ct. 832, 136 L.Ed.2d 791 (1997).
Parkman v. Prudential Ins. Co., 439 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir. 2006).
Here, the state-law claims alleged by Near clearly relate to a covered employee benefit plan and duplicate the ERISA civil enforcement remedies. ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B) provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary "to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). As explained by the Supreme Court,
This provision is relatively straightforward. If a participant or beneficiary believes that benefits promised to him under the terms of the plan are not provided, he can bring suit seeking provision of those benefits. A participant or beneficiary can also bring suit generically to "enforce his rights" under the plan, or to clarify any of his rights to future benefits.
Aetna Health Inc., 542 U.S. at 210. Section 510 of ERISA provides: [*55] 
It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan . . . or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan.
29 U.S.C. § 1140.
Near's claims related to disability benefits fall squarely within the ambit of these ERISA provisions. The Supreme Court has held similar state law claims are preempted by ERISA. See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 135-45, 111 S.Ct. 478, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990)(holding ERISA preempted state law wrongful discharge claim that employee was unlawfully discharged to prevent his attainment of benefits under a plan covered by ERISA; having "no doubt" the "claim is prototypical of the kind Congress intended to cover under § 510"); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 62-63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987)(holding employee's common-law contract and tort claims are preempted by ERISA); Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 43-49, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987)(holding common-law breach of contract and tort claims relate to an employee benefit plan and, therefore, are preempted by ERISA); c.f., Parkman, 439 F.3d at 771-72 (holding state law fraud claim is preempted by ERISA); Lindsay, 763 N.W.2d at 573 (ERISA preempts state common law regarding enforceability of non-compete forfeiture provisions in deferred compensation [*56]  plan). The court finds the same conclusion must be reached here: Near's state law claims related to disability benefits are preempted by ERISA.
The court has considered but rejects Near's argument that his claim of retaliation as related to disability benefits is not preempted by ERISA because it involves a one-time calculation of employee benefits. Near primarily relies upon Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed. 1 (1987) and Kulinski v. Medtronic Bio-Medicus, Inc., 21 F.3d 254 (8th Cir. 1994). After reviewing those cases, the court finds Near's reliance on the principles set forth therein are misplaced and his arguments are completely without merit.
Because Near's state common law claims for disability benefits relate to a covered employee benefit plan, the claims are preempted by ERISA and judgment shall be entered in favor of Eli Lilly on Count I and partially on Count II as it relates to disability benefits.

D. Near's Motion to Amend Petition
In response to Eli Lilly's arguments regarding the application of ERISA provisions to his claims, Near filed a motion to amend his complaint to specifically allege that provisions of ERISA apply, if the court finds so.
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), "a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave [*57]  when justice so requires." As stated by the United States Supreme Court,
[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be "freely given."
Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962).
In the words of the Eighth Circuit, "[g]iven the courts' liberal viewpoint towards leave to amend, it should normally be granted absent good reason for denial." Popp Telcom v. American Sharecom, Inc., 210 F.3d 928, 943 (8th Cir. 2000)(referring to Foman for the "classic" good reasons for rejecting an amendment). Denial "is appropriate only in those limited circumstances in which undue delay, bad faith on the part of the moving party, futility of the amendment, or unfair prejudice to the non-moving party can be demonstrated." Roberson v. Hayti Police Dept., 241 F.3d 992, 995 (8th Cir. 2001)(citing Foman).
The inclusion of a claim based on facts already known or available to both sides does not prejudice the non-moving party. A liberal amendment policy, however, is in no way an absolute right to amend. Where an amendment would likely result in the burdens of additional discovery [*58]  and delay to the proceedings, a court usually does not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
Popp Telcom, 210 F.3d at 943 (citations omitted); see also Baptist Health v. Smith, 477 F.3d 540, 544 (8th Cir. 2007)("there is no absolute right to amend and a court may deny the motion based upon a finding of undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies in previous amendments, undue prejudice to the non-moving party, or futility").
Here, the court finds Near's motion to amend should be denied because the proposed amended claims are futile. Near fails to present sufficient evidence to sustain his claims under the provisions of ERISA. As to any alleged right to disability benefits, the undisputed facts establish Near neither exhausted his Illness Pay in order to be entitled to receive disability benefits under the EDL Plan nor exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing suit. It is undisputed that Near never became eligible for disability benefits and he never made a claim for any such benefits. Under such facts, his claim of entitlement to disability benefits fails as a matter of law.
The court also finds any claim of retaliation or interference Near asserts under section 510 of ERISA fails as a matter of law.
Section 510 of ERISA makes it unlawful for an employer [*59]  to discharge a participant in an employee benefit plan "for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1140. To prevail under § 510 [Near] must show that [Eli Lilly] had a specific intent to interfere with [his] pension benefits, but that may be shown by circumstantial evidence.
Register v. Honeywell Federal Mfg. & Technologies, 397 F.3d 1130, 1136-37 (8th Cir. 2005).
This specific intent is present where the employee's (future or present) entitlement to protected benefits is a motivating factor in the employer's decision. A factor is motivating if it can be said that it has "a determinative influence on the outcome."
Koons v. Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 367 F.3d 768, 777 (8th Cir. 2004)(internal citation omitted).
Even after reviewing the record in the light most favorable to Near, the court is unable to find any specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial on a claim of interference under section 510. There is no evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude the decision-makers of Eli Lilly had a specific intent or motivation to interfere with Near's potential future entitlement to disability benefits under the EDL Plan. The mere allegations in Near's pleadings and briefs are insufficient to save the claim from summary judgment. There is simply no evidentiary connection, [*60]  in this court's view, between the termination of his employment and his potential entitlement to any EDL Plan disability benefits.
The court finds Near's claim for future disability benefits is in line with a similar claim rejected by the Eighth Circuit in Kinkead v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 49 F.3d 454 (8th Cir. 1995) under the following analysis:
[T]o establish a prima facie case of deliberate interference with prospective benefits under § 510, a claimant must demonstrate a causal connection between the likelihood of future benefits and an adverse employment action. While Kinkead's supervisor was aware of her claims of continuing medical disability, § 510 of ERISA does not prohibit firing an employee who becomes less productive because of an illness or disability. Kinkead has presented no evidence that her termination was motivated by a desire to prevent her application for additional disability benefits. Thus she failed to establish even a prima facie case of interference with the attainment of additional benefits.
Id. at 456 (internal citation omitted).
Likewise, here, Near has presented no evidence that the termination of his employment was motivated by a desire to prevent his application for disability benefits. Therefore, he has failed to establish a prima facie case of [*61]  interference under section 510 of ERISA.
Because the proposed amendments for claims under ERISA fail as a matter of law, Near's Motion to Amend Petition shall be denied.

V. CONCLUSION
Eli Lilly & Company's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 56) is granted in part and denied in part. Terry Near's Motion to Amend Petition (Document No. 86) is denied.
This case shall proceed to trial on the claims of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, disability discrimination and failure to accommodate. Judgment shall be entered in favor of Eli Lilly on claims related to disability benefits as alleged in Count I and partially incorporated in Count II of the First Amended Complaint.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
