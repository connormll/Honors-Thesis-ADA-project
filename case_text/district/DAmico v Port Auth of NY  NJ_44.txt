MEMORANDUM & ORDER
VITALIANO, D.J.,
Aggrieved by the termination of his employment, on October 4, 2012, James A. D'Amico initiated this action against his former employer, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (the "Port Authority"), and his former supervisors, Joseph Pappalardo, Diane Zalewski, and Frank Mirovsky, for alleged violations of the First Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. ("ADA"), the New York Civil Service Law § 75-b ("§ 75-b"), and the New York City Human Rights Law, New York City Administrative Code § 8-502(a), et seq. ("NYCHRL"). Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all claims, and for the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in its [*2]  entirety.

Statement of Facts1
D'Amico was hired by the Port Authority on May 29, 1985 as a maintenance worker. Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement ("Defs. 56.1") at ¶¶ 1, 3. Over the course of 26 years, he worked his way up to maintenance unit supervisor at LaGuardia Airport, a FM-4 position, to which he was appointed in 2003. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 5. During the relevant times, three coworkers had supervisory authority over plaintiff: Frank Mirovsky, Manager of Airport Maintenance at LaGuardia Airport; Joseph Pappalardo, Chief Maintenance Supervisor for the Structural Unit at LaGuardia Airport; and Diane Zalewski, Assistant Chief of Maintenance at LaGuardia Airport. Defs. 56.1 at ¶¶ 6-8; Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Counter-Statement ("Pls. 56.1") at ¶¶ 6-8. D'Amico's responsibilities as maintenance unit supervisor included supervising field personnel and outside contractors, overseeing snow removal, preparing budgets, and authorizing the purchase of equipment and materials. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 11. D'Amico managed approximately 27 maintenance service and supply contracts for which he processed invoices, monitored funds, and ordered materials. Id at ¶ 12.
Though D'Amico had received positive feedback and regular promotions prior [*3]  to 2009, his work performance began to suffer in the aftermath of a painful divorce. D'Amico Dep. at 52:12-57:7. On March 16, 2009, plaintiff received a counseling session with Pappalardo and Zalewski, as well as a written memorandum from Pappalardo, stating that plaintiff had failed to pay invoices, keep proper records, and had an excessive sick/absence record. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 13; Declaration of Kathleen Gill Miller ("Miller Decl."), Ex. G. The memorandum acknowledged that D'Amico was "going through a difficult time in his personal life" because of a difficult divorce, but that his "recent performance" and "similar issues that have arisen in the past" prompted Pappalardo to meet and reiterate the position's expectations. Miller Decl., Ex. G. Pappalardo referred D'Amico to the Employee Assistance Program if he needed additional help with his personal challenges.2 Id.
On May 19, 2009, Pappalardo sent a memorandum advising D'Amico that his sick days for the first 4 1/2 months exceeded Port Authority standards.3 Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 14. Overall, in 2009, plaintiff took 26 sick days spanning six different occasions. Id. at ¶ 16. On July 27, 2009, D'Amico received a performance evaluation which [*4]  rated him as "fully competent" on most categories but "below standard" on attendance, verification of work performed, and accuracy of invoices and payment. Id. at ¶ 19; Pls. 56.1 at ¶ 19. The evaluation is signed by D'Amico. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 19.
On October 16, 2009, plaintiff filed a confidential and anonymous complaint with the Port Authority's Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") accusing Pappalardo of misappropriating Port Authority property (tiles), billing for unworked overtime, and stealing money from a deceased employee. Id. at ¶ 17. He also accused a nonparty employee of stealing tiles. Id OIG investigated the allegations, but, on December 13, 2010, the investigation was closed for lack of evidence of wrongdoing. Id at ¶ 18. OIG found D'Amico's allegations unsubstantiated. Id.
Throughout the balance of 2009 and early 2010, D'Amico's work performance continued to suffer. On January 6, 2010, a contractor that repaired doors for LaGuardia's revolving doors notified the Port Authority that it had put the contract on hold due to unpaid invoices. Id. at ¶ 20. The contractor stated that "several phone messages were left and e-mails sent to [D'Amico] with no response." Miller Decl., [*5]  Ex. M. This prompted Pappalardo to ask Zalewski to check D'Amico's office for any other invoices. Id. The search revealed a "stack of delinquent invoices." Id. Both Pappalardo and Zalewski confronted D'Amico about the invoices, and met a second time to follow up, at which time they reminded him of the March 16, 2009 meeting where they discussed similar issues of letting invoices go unpaid and otherwise neglecting his responsibilities. Id. D'Amico "admitted that [he was] falling behind on [his] work and that [he] would do whatever was necessary to catch up, including staying on [his] own time." Id. These events were then summarized in a memorandum from Pappalardo to D'Amico, entitled "Failure to Perform FM-4 Responsibilities," which further warned D'Amico that it served as a "final warning" and that future failures to pay invoices would result in disciplinary proceedings." Id.
On March 22, 2010, plaintiff once again went on sick leave, and remained on sick leave, for just shy of two months. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 21. D'Amico testified that the Port Authority's Office of Medical Services ("OMS")4 put him on medical leave because he was vomiting blood. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 22. D'Amico returned for [*6]  one week in May, but again began vomiting blood. Id. As a result, he was put back on sick leave. Id. He did not report to work for the rest of that calendar year. Id. at ¶ 21.
During the course of these episodes, on June 10, 2010, Mirovsky sent a memorandum to Robin Martin, the Director of OMS, advising her that D'Amico had been out since May 24, 2010. He noted that, prior to his brief return in May, D'Amico had "a poor attendance record over the past few years" and "his job performance has been deteriorating which has resulted in his supervisors discussing his performance with him on several occasions." Miller Decl., Ex. P. Mirovsky requested an evaluation to "determine whether or not there exists a medical condition that would adversely affect" D'Amico's ability to perform his duties. Id. He also sought an estimated date for D'Amico's return to work and advice as to whether any medical restrictions would be ordered. Id.
As the year rolled on, D'Amico's supervisors became increasingly concerned. On August 9, 2010, Pappalardo sent a memorandum to Mirovsky detailing "unusual behavior," by Pappalardo's account, D'Amico had displayed in their last interaction. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 26; Miller [*7]  Decl., Ex. Q. D'Amico appeared distressed, had failed to bring his medical disposition slip into the office, let his airport identification expire, and had shared his personal difficulties at home. Miller Decl., Ex. Q. On August 20, 2010, following 100 sick day absences, Mirovsky repeated these observations to Medical Director Martin, asking that D'Amico submit to a fitness evaluation and, if he was found fit, an estimate to when he could return to work. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 27. The request memorandum also stated that D'Amico's "performance has been deteriorating for at least the last 2-3 years" and that he had been counseled on "his substandard performance, failure to make deadlines and inattention to the technical details and requirements of his job." Miller Decl., Ex. R. Mirovsky noted that D'Amico's position included responsibilities that were "potentially dangerous" and expressed concern that his "performance ha[d] deteriorated to a point that he will not be able to function effectively" in his role. Id. "His inability to focus, function effectively, and to meet his responsibilities," he wrote, "has become apparent to his supervisors." Id. The memorandum sought an assessment of whether [*8]  "an underlying medical condition" had "precipitated or exacerbated his substandard performance." Id.
On September 3, 2010, D'Amico was seen by Dr. Francine Silver, a Port Authority psychologist, for a fitness evaluation. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 29. She noted D'Amico was taking several sedating medications and complaining of sleeplessness, depression, and anxiety. Id. She deemed him not fit for work. Id. D'Amico reported to Dr. Silver periodically through the rest of 2010, and authorized her to speak to his personal psychiatrist, Dr. Ahmad, his psychologist, Dr. Issacoff, and his clinical social worker, Sandra Kelly. Id. at ¶ 30. Dr. Kelly told Dr. Silver, in December 2010, that in her opinion as one of his treating health care providers, D'Amico was not fit to return to work. Id. Dr. Isaacoff afforded Dr. Silver the same opinion on February 25, 2011. Id at ¶ 31.
Time moved on; little else did. On May 16, 2011, Dr. Issacoff wrote to Dr. Silver advising that, on April 13, 2011, "D'Amico asserted his perception of his complete and permanent inability to function at his job." Id. at ¶ 40. Around the same time, on April 29, 2011, D'Amico told Dr. Silver that he would not be able to return to work [*9]  and had applied for a New York State disability retirement, saying this was "the right thing to do" because his ability to drive and make good decisions had been impaired. Silver Aff. at ¶ 22. Dr. Silver testified that D'Amico understood his decision, and its concurrent finding that D'Amico was no longer medically qualified to perform his work duties, would be reported to Dr. Fisher, the Chief Medical Officer of OMS. Id. She then did communicate this decision to Dr. Fisher, reporting D'Amico as permanently disabled. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 35; Silver Aff. at ¶ 22.
The trail divides here. D'Amico denies ever making these statements, or ever suggesting that he believed he should file for disability retirement. D'Amico Dep. at 195:13-198:18. However, notes from Dr. Ahmad, dated March 29, 2011, also state that D'Amico had applied for New York State disability retirement benefits. Id. at ¶ 45. Corroborating this account, Dr. Issacoff wrote, on June 3, 2011, to the New York State Retirement System referencing a disability questionnaire he had filled out for D'Amico on March 21, 2011. Id at ¶ 41. The letter stated that his patient suffered from "major depression" which had become severe, and that [*10]  his "disorders leave him permanently disabled and therefore, unable to work at his job in the Port' Authority of New York and New Jersey." Silver Aff., Ex. 3.
On April 29, 2011, Dr. Fisher sent a memorandum to Thomas Bosco, the General Manager of LaGuardia, informing him that D'Amico had been found to be no longer fit to perform the duties of a maintenance unit supervisor. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 37; Miller Decl., Ex. T. The memorandum stated that Human Resources would contact plaintiff about an accommodation, if feasible. Miller Decl., Ex. T. D'Amico was copied on the document and recalls seeing it at the time it was sent, but denies that he was ever contacted to discuss an accommodation. Id.; Pls. 56.1 at ¶ 37.
The smoldering controversy soon ignited. On May 9, 2011, Human Resources sent a letter to plaintiff at his last known address advising him that he was found to be medically unfit to perform his duties and that he could file for a disability retirement or explore alternate placement. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 38. Plaintiff denies ever seeing this letter because it was sent to the wrong address. Pls. 56.1 at ¶ 38.
There is also a most instructive separate trail. Parallel to these goings on, D'Amico [*11]  applied for Social Security disability benefits on August 5, 2011, stating that he suffered from "depression," "anxiety," "panic attacks," "obsessive/compulsive disorder," "other psychiatric disorders," "celiac disease," and "ulcers." Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 42; Miller Decl., Ex. V.5 It reported that he had stopped working on March 15, 2010 because of his disabling condition. Id.
On August 15, 2011, the Port Authority sent D'Amico a letter advising him of his termination and right to a hearing under the terms of the applicable union contract. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 43. Plaintiff received the letter, but says that, on advice from Dr. Silver, he opted not to request the hearing. Id.; Pls. 56.1 at ¶ 43.
The final note sounded, on October 11, 2011, when the Director of HR sent D'Amico a letter advising him that he had been determined medically unfit to perform his duties, and that having waived his right to a hearing challenging that determination, he was terminated effective October 2, 2011. Id. at ¶ 44. The Port Authority's sick/absence records for 2011 show that D'Amico was carried as sick until his termination. Id. at ¶ 49. He did not work a single day in 2011. Id. He was recorded as taking 189 sick [*12]  days. Id. D'Amico is now classified retired on, disability by the New York State Retirement System. Id. at ¶ 50. In addition to these benefits, he also receives Social Security disability benefits. Id.

Standard for Summary Judgment
A federal district court must grant summary judgment upon motion and finding, based on the pleadings, depositions, interrogatory answers, admissions, affidavits, and all other admissible evidence, that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d (1986); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2004). In determining whether the moving party has met this burden, a court must construe all evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, resolving all ambiguities and inferences in its favor. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citing United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 994, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962)); Gibbs-Alfano v. Burton, 281 F.3d 12, 18 (2d Cir. 2002). However, "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (emphasis original); Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., 302 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Material facts are those which, given the substantive [*13]  law, might affect the suit's outcome. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
If the moving party makes a prima facie showing that there are no genuine issues of material fact, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and put forth "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Davis v. New York, 316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002); Fed. R. Civ, P. 56. In so doing, the nonmoving party may not rely on conclusory allegations or speculation. Golden Pac. Bancorp v. FDIC, 375 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing D'Amico v. City of New York, 132 F.3d 145, 149 (2d Cir. 1998)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 ("Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein."). Thus, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586). Nonetheless, the nonmoving party need not make a compelling showing; it need merely show that reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the proffered evidence. R.B. Ventures, Ltd. v. Shane, 112 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 1997).

Discussion
I. ADA Claims6
Defendants argue that D'Amico's ADA claims must fail because a) he cannot show he was a qualified person under ADA; b) ADA would not have required the Port Authority to tolerate D'Amico's chronic absenteeism; and c) D'Amico [*14]  could not show he had requested a reasonable accommodation or alternate replacement.
To make out a "prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, a plaintiff must show that: (1) [his] employer is subject to the ADA; (2) [he] suffers from a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (3) [he] could perform the essential functions of [his] job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) [he] was fired because of her disability." Ryan v. Grae & Rybicki, P.C., 135 F.3d 867, 869-70 (2d Cir. 1998). ADA defines a disability as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3))." 42 U.S.C. § 12102 (1994).
Defendants' doorstep argument that D'Amico did not suffer from a disability within the meaning of ADA, because he could not show his depression and anxiety substantially limited his ability to engage in a major life activity, such as working, fails. Principally, the argument relies on cases that predate the 2008 Amendments to ADA, effective January 1, 2009, which were intended to broaden the definition of "substantially limits" so that it would no longer be interpreted to "require a greater degree [*15]  of limitation than was intended by Congress." Pub. L. No. 110-325 § 2(a)(7) & (b)(5). Defendant clearly had a record of D'Amico's impairments due to his severe depression, anxiety, anger issues, and related drowsiness and grogginess from the medication used to treat that depression. It cannot be seriously disputed that D'Amico had a qualifying disability within the meaning of ADA.
On other themes of examination, though, plaintiff is not so fortunate. In a fundamental shortcoming, D'Amico was not a qualified person within the meaning of ADA because he was not otherwise qualified for his position—he could not "perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001)). What's more, when a claimant invokes the reasonable accommodation provision, "generally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. at 363 (2003)) (quotation marks omitted). "The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow [him] to perform the essential functions of [his] employment, including the existence of a vacant position for which [he] is qualified." [*16]  McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009). See also Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 137-38 (2d Cir. 1995).
D'Amico has failed to present any evidence that he could physically perform his job with or without an accommodation. "In the context of the ADA, reasonable accommodation may include, inter alia, modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties, and, under certain circumstances, 'reassignment to a vacant position.' 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)[.]" McBride, 583 F.3d at 97. As early as 2009, D'Amico received numerous counseling sessions and interventions, until he simply stopped coming to work. In 2010, D'Amico worked only one week between March 19 and the end of the year because he could not come to work without vomiting blood. He did not work a single day in 2011 up to his termination on October 2, 2011. In total, he was unable to report for work for 384 days. ADA does "not require employers to tolerate chronic absenteeism even when attendance problems are caused by an employee's disability." Lewis v. N.Y.C. Police Dep't, 908 F. Supp. 2d 313, 327 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Miscall v. Mara, 49 F. Supp. 2d 365, 374 n. 18 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).
Once D'Amico began seeking treatment for these issues, his medical team repeatedly deemed him unfit for work. He was sent home in May 2010; deemed unfit by Dr. Silver on September 3, 2010; deemed unfit by Dr. [*17]  Kelley in December 2010; and deemed unfit by Dr. Issacoff on February 25, 2011. Defs. 56.1 at ¶¶ 29-31. He continued to take sick leave until his termination on October 2, 2011. On D'Amico's own application for disability, he indicated that he had stopped working because of his disability on March 15, 2010—the first time he was sent home for vomiting blood, and a year and a half before his termination. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 42; Miller Decl., Ex. V. The Port Authority was told by D'Amico's own medical doctors that he was medically unfit for his position. Miller Decl., Exhibit T. D'Amico himself "asserted his perception of his complete and permanent inability to function at his job" to Dr. Issacoff on May 16, 2011. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 40; Silver Aff., Ex. 2. D'Amico has not disputed this determination. Once OMS found him medically unfit for work, Human Resources then contacted him by letter to let him know he could request an accommodation or seek an alternate placement, or, in the alternative, file for disability retirement. Miller Decl., Ex. U. He made no such request for an accommodation or alternate placement,7 and when he was subsequently terminated, he did not request a hearing. Miller Decl., [*18]  Ex. X.
To recapitulate, simply, D'Amico has offered no testimony or evidence that he was able to perform any essential functions of his job between March of 2010 and October 2011, either with or without an accommodation. He did not request at his 2009 counseling session, his 2010 counseling session, or at any time while on sick leave, for any particular accommodation that would have enabled him to return to work and satisfactorily complete his duties. Even if such efforts were documented, is it not clear what kind of accommodation would have permitted D'Amico to keep any job at the Port Authority. He has not identified in his papers any adjustments, devices, modifications, or alterations that would have enabled him to continue at his former position, or pointed to any vacant positions which would have accommodated his difficulties completing tasks and abysmal attendance record. And, in any case, the Port Authority was not aware of any request to that effect.
The Port Authority kept D'Amico in his position, on leave, for over a year and a half, between May of 2010 and October 2011, not counting the two months he was on leave prior to May 2010. It is difficult to understand what, exactly, [*19]  D'Amico believes they should have done to accommodate his absences. "The duty to make reasonable accommodations does not ... require an employer to hold an injured employee's position open indefinitely while the employee attempts to recover, nor does it force an employer to investigate every aspect of an employee's condition before terminating him based on his inability to work." Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000).8 D'Amico, unable to come to work, was not qualified to perform his job. "An essential function of any government job is an ability to appear for work and to complete assigned tasks within a reasonable period of time." Cino v. Sikorsky Aircraft, 42 F. Supp. 2d 147, 151 (D. Conn. 1998) aff'd 182 F.3d 898 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 217 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).9
There is, plainly, no evidence that D'Amico was a qualified person under ADA, and his ADA claims therefore fail as a matter of law.
II. First Amendment Claims
To establish a prima facie First Amendment retaliation claim, a public employee such as plaintiff must show (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected speech by speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was sufficient causal connection such that the speech was a motivating factor in the employment decision. Cobb v. Pozzi, 363 F. 3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Mandell v. County of Suffolk, 316 F.3d 368, 382 (2d Cir. 2003)).
At center stage here is the report by D'Amico [*20]  of alleged corruption and improprieties of Pappalardo and a nonparty to the OIG. The claim is without merit. D'Amico's First Amendment claim fails because he cannot show that his confidential and anonymous OIG complaint, made on October 16, 2009, was causally connected to his termination nearly two years later, on October 2, 2011.
D'Amico could possibly "establish a causal connection that suggests retaliation by showing that protected activity was close in time to the adverse action." Neroni v. Grannis, No. 3:11-CV-1485 (LEK) (DEP), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156822, 2014 WL 5782473, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 2014) (quoting Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir. 2009). But here, the OIG investigation was closed on December 13, 2010, based on a lack of evidence of wrongdoing, nearly a year before his termination. In the complete absence of any nontemporal conduct suggesting causality, it is baffling how, with the enormous gaps in time between anything touching on D'Amico's protected activity and the causal adverse action, the termination can support a finding of causality based solely on temporarily. To be sure, courts have found that significantly shorter periods are too remote and attenuate to constitute retaliatory action. See, e.g., Dhar v. City of New York, No. 15-CV-2698, 655 F. App'x 864, 2016 WL 3889108, at *2 (2d Cir. July 15, 2016) ("While temporal proximity can support an inference of retaliation for purposes of establishing a [*21]  prima facie case, the proximity must be very close.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Hollander v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 895 F.2d 80, 85-86 (2d Cir. 1990) (finding no causal connection when gap between protected activity and adverse action were three months apart); Markovic v. N.Y.C. Sch. Constr. Auth., No. 99-CV-10339, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214, 2002 WL 22043, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2002) (eight-month gap insufficient); Donlon v. Group Health Inc., No. 00-Civ.-2190 (MBM), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1001, 2001 WL 111220, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2001) (eight-month gap insufficient); Morris v. Lindau, 196 F.3d 102, 113 (1999) (two-year gap insufficient).
Plaintiff attempts to salvage his claim by suggesting that the adverse employment action was not simply his termination, but (a) the distribution of a "retaliatory" interoffice memorandum that "needlessly disclosed highly personal information" about him10 and (b) a change in protocol requiring him to hand deliver medical disposition forms rather than by facsimile. Pl. Mem. at 9.
These last straw "adverse employment actions" included by D'Amico occurred, as he claims, in August 2010—approximately 10 months after the only proffered protected activity in which he engaged. Again, he presents no evidence of causal connection, and assuming for argument's sake he is relying on temporality,11 as outlined above, such gaps in time cannot in the least support a claim for retaliation. It is dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.
III. State [*22]  and City Claims Against the Port Authority
Defendants demur that D'Amico's state and city claims must fail as a matter of law because neither New York state law nor the City's code provisions regarding discriminatory conduct apply to the Port Authority, which is a bi-state agency and immune from single state regulation.12 There is no controlling enactment that would make New York's antidiscrimination laws applicable to the Port Authority. Dezaio v. Port Auth. of NY. & N.J. 205 F.3d 62, 65 (2d Cir. 2000). A fortiori, plaintiff concedes that the City's code provisions do not apply either. Settecase v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J. 13 F. Supp. 2d 530, 535-36 (S.D.N.Y. 1998).
D'Amico contends that the same is not true with regard to § 75-b, New York's whistleblower statute. Plaintiff's argument reaches back to the Port Authority's birth. It was created upon Congressional approval of a Compact between the states of New York and New Jersey. See 42 Stat. 174 (1921); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 32:1 et seq.; N.Y. Unconsol. Law §§ 6401 et seq. The Supreme Court has held that "bistate entities created by compact ... are not subject to the unilateral control of any one of the States that compose the federal system." Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 42, 115 S. Ct. 394, 402, 130 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1994). It does not make the argument advanced by defendants a winner. That is because the law of a single state can have no effect on the Port Authority unless the legislature of the other [*23]  state enacted concurring legislation making the provisions of the law applicable "clearly and expressly." Evans v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., No. CIV.A. 99-5901 (JWB), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28259, 2003 WL 25749089, at *18 (D.N.J. July 1, 2003) aff'd, No. 04-4062, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 4349, 2006 WL 408391 (3d Cir. Feb. 23, 2006). See also Dezaio, 205 F.3d at 65; Rose v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 13 F. Supp. 2d 516, 523 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); Settecase, 13 F. Supp. 2d at 535-36; Baron v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 968 F. Supp. 924, 929 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).
Plaintiff points out that New Jersey and New York have enacted "substantially identical legislation" protecting whistleblowers, therefore satisfying the critical "concurred in" language. Pl. Mem. at 9. New York Civil Service Law § 75-b states:
A public employer shall not dismiss or take other disciplinary or other adverse personnel action against a public employee regarding the employee's employment because the employee discloses to a government body information ... which the employee believes to be true and reasonably believes constitutes an improper governmental action.
N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law § 75-b (1984) (amended 2015). New Jersey's law, the Conscientious Employee Protection Act ("CEPA"), states:
No employer or employer's agent, representative or designee shall discharge, discipline or otherwise penalize or threaten to discharge, discipline or otherwise penalize any employee because the employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, makes a good faith report, verbally or in writing, of a violation or suspected violation of this act.
N.J. Stat. § 34:19-1 (2007).
While the laws are admittedly similar, the inquiry does not end [*24]  there. The laws must have been enacted concurrently, or at least, must expressly state that they intend to amend the Compact and purport to apply to the Port Authority where the provisions are one of general application to the State. Hollingsworth v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., No. CIV.A. 06-571 (JAG), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50559, 2009 WL 1702293, at *4 (D.N.J. June 16, 2009) (quoting King v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 909 F. Supp. 938, 945 (D.N.J. 1995), aff'd, 106 F.3d 385 (3d Cir. 1996)). As relevant here, § 75-13 was enacted by New York in 1984, long before CEPA was enacted by New Jersey in 2007. Neither, informatively, makes reference to the Port Authority much less the Compact. If failsafe legislative intent exists, it was neither express nor clear. It is compelling, consequently, that § 75-b has no application to the Port Authority, that D'Amico has no valid claim under it, and that his attempt to state such a claim must be dismissed.
IV. State and City Claims Against the Individual Defendants
Defendants assert that the state and city claims must be dismissed as against the individual defendants, because, under these laws, liability must first be established against the employer/principal. Goodman v. The Port Authority, et al., No. 10 Civ. 8352 (RWS), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134921, 2013 WL 5313427, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2013). Such claim preclusion, however, only applies when liability is defeated on the merits, rather than because of immunity. Henry-Offor v. City Univ. of New York, No. 11 CIV. 4695 (NRB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84817, 2012 WL 2317540, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2012). Where the principal is immune, and, therefore, the merits [*25]  were not reached, the individual defendants may still be liable for aiding and abetting. Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 158 (2d Cir. 2004) (permitting individual defendant claims to go forward despite sovereign immunity against principal); Ya—Chen Chen v. City Univ. of N. Y., No. 11 Civ. 320 (CM), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130094, 2011 WL 5419792, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2011) (same); Kantha v. Blue, 262 F. Supp. 2d 90, 109 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (same); see also Daniels v. Wesley Gardens Corp., No. 10 Civ. 6336T, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45328, 2011 WL 1598962, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2011) (holding that "dismissal of the ... aiding and abetting cause of action" is appropriate only "where the dismissal against the employer/principal was on the merits").
Considering D'Amico's claims on the merits, a different caste of issue preclusion is fatal to them. NYCHRL provides that "[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this chapter, or to attempt to do so." N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-107(6). Plaintiff contends that § 8-107(1) (discriminatory discharge based on disability) and § 8-107(19) (interference with protected rights) were violated. But, the merits, that is, the lack of merits, has already been considered. Specifically, it has already been found that D'Amico's discharge was not discriminatory, and no protected rights were violated.
NYCHRL, certainly, also provides that a "person prohibited by the provisions of this section from discriminating on the basis of disability shall make [*26]  reasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability to satisfy the essential requisites of a job or enjoy the right or rights in question provided that the disability is known or should have been known by the covered entity." NYCHRL § 8-107(15)(a). Again, as has been demonstrated, faced with essentially the same burden under other laws, D'Amico plaintiff has provided no evidence that any accommodation could have enabled him to "satisfy the essential requisites of the job." He even declined the Port Authority's last ditch offer at the time of termination hearing to proffer one. Defs. 56.1 at ¶ 43.
It is true that NYCHRL is broader ADA, and whether indefinite leave is an undue hardship is usually a question of fact for the jury.13 See Vangas v. Montefiore Med Ctr., 6 F. Supp. 3d 400, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Yet, that rule of thumb admits to exceptions. Here, summary judgment remains appropriate. In Vargas, for instance, the plaintiff had cancer, and was unsure when she would be able to return to work as she was seeking further treatment from various specialists. Id. at 406-07. Here, D'Amico had been certified by OMS as medically unfit for his position on account of a permanent disability. Miller Decl., Ex. T. Unlike Vargas, there is absolutely no indication that his condition [*27]  would change, and, again, D'Amico declined to attend a hearing regarding the availability of an accommodation. D'Amico offers no evidence to dispute the conclusion that he was no longer medically able to report to work or perform any portion of his duties then or at any time in the future. See, e.g., Magill v. Precision Sys. Mfg., Inc., No. 5:01-CV-1482, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16923, 2006 WL 468212, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2006) (noting that where plaintiff claimed she "was medically unfit to work due to psychological trauma," she was therefore "unable to perform the essential functions of her job, regardless of whether [defendant] attempted to accommodate her").14
The individual defendants did not aid or abet any unlawful activity. Therefore, D'Amico's claims against them pursuant to NYCHRL also fail.15

Conclusion
For the reasons discussed, the motion by defendants for summary judgment is granted in its entirety.
The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly and close this case.
So Ordered.
