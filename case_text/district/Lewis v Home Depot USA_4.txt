Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff is proceeding in this matter pro se. This employment discrimination case is before the Court on the motion for summary judgment (Doc. 74) filed by the defendant, Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. ("Home Depot" or "Defendant").
In Plaintiff's amended complaint, he asserts claims for alleged sexual harassment/hostile work environment, retaliation, race discrimination, and wrongful termination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. ("Title VII"). (Doc. 52, Am. Compl.). He also claims that Home Depot failed to accommodate his disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621, et seq. ("ADA"). (Id.).
For the reasons stated below, I recommend that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED.

I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact are present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant carries [*2]  its burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "Mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to create a dispute to defeat summary judgment." Bald Mountain Park, Ltd. v. Oliver, 863 F.2d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir. 1989). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmovant must raise "significant probative evidence" that would be sufficient for a jury to find for that party. LcChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998); Chemsource, Inc. v. Hub Group, Inc., 106 F.3d 1358, 1361 (7th Cir. 1997). "Conclusory, uncorroborated allegations by a plaintiff in ... [a] deposition will not create an issue of fact for trial sufficient to defeat a well supported summary judgment motion." Solliday v. Federal Officers, 413 F. App'x 206, 207 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Earley v. Champion Int'l Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. 1990)).
It is not the court's function to scour the record in search of evidence to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Instead, the court relies on the nonmoving [*3]  party to identify the evidence which creates an issue of triable fact. Bombard v. Fort Wayne Newspapers, Inc., 92 F.3d 560, 562 (7th Cir. 1996). Resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).
Because Plaintiff filed his complaint pro se, his complaint will be liberally construed and "held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). All reasonable inferences will be made in Plaintiff's favor. Duke v. Cleland, 5 F.3d 1399, 1402 (11th Cir. 1993).

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
In light of the foregoing summary judgment standard, the undersigned finds the following facts for the purpose of resolving Home Depot's motion for summary judgment only.
Home Depot hired Plaintiff on January 6, 2014 as a general warehouse associate ("GWA") at its Locust Grove, Georgia warehouse. (Doc. 77, Deposition of Plaintiff Asa A. Lewis, Sr. ["Lewis Dep."], at 24).1 Plaintiff's responsibilities included, inter alia, loading, unloading, sorting, staging, and transporting products into and out of the Locust Grove distribution center. (Doc. 85-4 at 32-33). Plaintiff's work required that he be able to operate mechanical equipment such as [*4]  reach trucks, forklifts, and similar equipment. (Id.).
As part of the hiring process, Plaintiff received training regarding Home Depot's nondiscrimination and harassment policies. (Lewis Dep. at 25-27). Plaintiff understood that Home Depot has a policy prohibiting sexual harassment and that there are multiple avenues for lodging a complaint. (Id.).
Plaintiff testified that he cannot recall the first time he felt that he was sexually harassed at Home Depot, but he believes that "around February" 2014, his coworker April Reed "invited [him] to the restroom to engage in inappropriate acts." (Lewis Dep. at 94-95). Plaintiff testified that Reed told him that he was looking good that day, he should keep it up, and if he ever wanted a quickie, he could meet her in the bathroom. (Id. at 95). Plaintiff claims that from February 2014 through August 2014, he was "continuously sexually harassed" by April Reed, but he cannot identify "every single day, every single time and every single person involved" because "[i]t's so vast," and the sexual harassment "was consistent. It did not end." (Id. at 96-98; Lewis Aff. ¶ 2). Plaintiff claims that Reed said something "inappropriate" to him every shift he [*5]  worked, but admits that she did not reference going to the bathroom for a sexual act every shift. (Lewis Dep. at 97-98). Her comments varied, from "having sex to giving me head to showing me her ... ass ... and ... asking [Plaintiff] ... if he could see [if] her panties were falling down." (Id. at 97, 99). Plaintiff testified that Reed "laughed" when she allegedly made these comments, like "you know you want it," and that he also laughed and told her to "stop and how ridiculous" she was. (Id. at 99). He testified that he also made joking comments to her, like "Get to work"; "stop sexually harassing me in front of other employees"; and "you know what I'm saying, stop, get your ass to work." (Id. at 102-03).
Plaintiff testified that not all communications were sexually charged; there were times where he and Reed had other "jokes that we joke about, work or anything like that, yes, we did." (Lewis Dep. at 104). Plaintiff admits that at times, he and Reed had perfectly appropriate conversations. (Id. at 102). When asked if Plaintiff ever said anything inappropriate to Reed, he testified that one time when he came back to work after being sick, he complimented her and told her "you look [*6]  good, you look really good, ... but you've always been losing weight," which, in Plaintiff's words, "could ... have been taken as inappropriate ... Yes." (Id. at 104-05).
Plaintiff claims that in addition to the unwanted sexual comments, Reed also touched him inappropriately, "from patting me on my backside to try to grab my hand, rub my back." (Lewis Dep. at 111). By way of example, Plaintiff testified that Reed would just walk up and say, "[H]ey, how you doing today," and then pat him on his backside. (Id. at 181). Plaintiff described the touch as "more of a pat (indicating), not a grab or a rub." (Id.). He described the touches to his back as "more of a rub conversation." (Id.). Plaintiff estimated that Reed patted him on the backside more than twice, but less than ten times; that she tried to grab his hand several times, "but less than ten"; and she touched or rubbed his back "at least ten" times while she was talking to him. (Id. at 113).
Plaintiff asserts that he complained to his supervisor, Carl Billings, as well as other managers and Home Depot HR representatives (including a former quality control supervisor and "Yolanda; Malaika; Rob") about Reed's behavior, and told "[a]ll [*7]  of them" about the sexual comments. (Lewis Dep. at 107-08). According to Plaintiff, each person that he told promised to look into the situation and get back with him, but none of them did; nor did anyone take any action to curtail Reed's behavior.2 (Id. at 107-10).
Plaintiff testified that one time when he was speaking with both Reed and his supervisor Billings, Reed interrupted them and told Plaintiff to "just take your ass to the bathroom, or something to that effect, and get ready for me to go to work on you." (Id. at 103). Instead of Billings saying anything to Reed about her inappropriate behavior, Billings threw his hands up, and said, "[H]ey, if you all need some space, I can give you some space." (Id.; Lewis Aff. ¶ 6). Plaintiff responded, "Carl, I told you about her sexually harassing me. She just did it in front of you, you're not going to say anything?" (Lewis Dep. at 103). According to Plaintiff, Billings and Reed just chuckled, and Billings told him, "I'm just joking with you." (Id.).
On May 2, 2014, after an incident that Billings characterized as involving "poor communication," Billings verbally counseled April Reed with regard to Home Depot's policy on respect, [*8]  and added a "manager's note" to her personnel file. (Doc. 80-2 at 1). On May 6, 2014, Reed received another verbal reprimand for an altercation with a GWA (which may have been Plaintiff), which ended with both Reed and the associate yelling at each other while on the receiving dock in front of other employees. (Doc. 74-5 at 74; Jones Decl. ¶ 16; Doc. 80-2 at 82, ¶ 5). Reed was counseled that such conduct was not acceptable in the workplace, and that the way Reed was communicating showed a lack of respect. On May 12, 2014, Reed was issued a written Final Warning disciplinary notice, notifying her that any further violations of Home Depot's Standards of Performance would result in additional disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. (Doc. 74-5 at 74; Doc. 80-2 at 2).
Plaintiff claims that after he complained about Reed, Reed and other coworkers (mostly "Amy" and "Mike Vera," friends of Reed's) "harassed" him by following him to the bathroom, by complaining about Plaintiff taking long bathroom breaks, and also by threatening to have him fired if he did not perform his work properly. (Lewis Dep. at 120-121, 123-24, 126-27, 130-33). Plaintiff testified that after [*9]  his coworkers complained several times to his supervisor Billings that Plaintiff was staying in the bathroom too long, Billings verbally counseled him that he needed to watch how long he was in the bathroom because he was being unproductive, and that could be counted against him. (Id. at 134). Plaintiff does not claim that he was ever formally disciplined for taking lengthy bathroom breaks. (See id. at 196; Doc. 77-1 at 1; Doc. 77-2 at 43).
According to Plaintiff, despite the alleged retaliation and harassment from his coworkers, his work at the distribution center was "excellent" at all times, and his supervisors corroborated that assessment by telling him that he was "one of their best forklift drivers." (Lewis Dep. at 144-45).
In addition to Home Depot's nondiscrimination and harassment policies, Plaintiff's new-hire orientation also covered Home Depot's attendance and punctuality rules. (Lewis Dep. at 30-31). During the relevant time period, Plaintiff's regular work schedule was Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. (Id. at 124). In his deposition, Plaintiff testified that he understood and was aware of Home Depot's policy that if he was going to be late or absent [*10]  from work, he was required to call the warehouse, press extension six for the call-out line, and record a message at least one hour before his shift. (Id. at 50-51). Plaintiff understood that Home Depot checked the messages every day, then transcribed the messages and entered them on a call-out log spreadsheet. (Id. at 51; Doc. 74-5, Declaration of Malaika Jones, Home Depot Human Resources Generalist at the Home Depot distribution center in Locust Grove ["Jones Decl."], ¶ 3).
In recognition of its employees' personal needs, Home Depot allowed each non-probationary associate (employed for more than 120 days) six absences, eight tardy/leave-early's, and six missed punches (referred to collectively as "occurrences") during an anniversary year. (Jones Decl. ¶ 4; Doc. 74-5 at 37 ["Attendance and Punctuality Policy for DC and RLC Hourly Associates"]). Subsequent or additional occurrences, including absences, were addressed using Home Depot's progressive discipline process. (Doc. 74-5 at 37).
Associates who had been employed for less than 120 days were classified as probationary employees and were subject to more stringent discipline standards than non-probationary associates. Under Home Depot's [*11]  attendance and punctuality policy, distribution center associates employed less than 120 days received a "Final Warning" if they received three occurrences during the first 120 days, and were subject to termination if they received an additional occurrence before the 120-day period expired. If an associate received a Final Warning during probation but did not have additional violations during the probationary period, the associate was treated as having three "occurrences" under the policy for the non-probationary remainder of their anniversary year. (Jones Decl. ¶¶ 4-5).
As noted above, Plaintiff began working for Home Depot at the Locust Grove distribution center on January 6, 2014, and his probationary period ended May 6, 2014. (Jones Decl. ¶ 6). On May 1, 2014, Plaintiff received a "Final Warning" progressive disciplinary notice related to his attendance and discussed it with his supervisor, Carl Billings. As of that date, Plaintiff had exceeded the number of permitted occurrences, and was subject to termination of his probationary employment. (Lewis Dep. at 62-64; Doc. 74-5 at 45). Instead of terminating Plaintiff, Billings explained to Plaintiff that he was issuing him a Final [*12]  Warning instead as "an early Christmas present." (Lewis Dep. at 64). As a result, as of May 6, 2014, Plaintiff's attendance record included three occurrences within the meaning of Home Depot's attendance and punctuality policy. (Jones Decl. ¶ 6).
Plaintiff has suffered from sickle cell disease his entire life.3 According to Plaintiff's physician, Plaintiff experiences "occasional flare ups from time to time that can be painful." (Doc. 77-1 at 2). On or about May 6, 2014, Plaintiff's first day of non-probationary status, Plaintiff requested permission to use a turret truck because he was on pain medication, and he told his coworker/coordinator, April Reed, and a supervisor, Kevin Harper, that he "did not feel safe operating the reach truck," which required standing and moving the truck around the facility. (Lewis Dep. at 57-58, 67, 150). Plaintiff was offered the option of working in the area called the bin, where Home Depot keeps smaller products and associates walk rather than drive motorized equipment. (Id. at 60). However, because of the pain Plaintiff was experiencing from his waist down to his ankles, Plaintiff concluded that "walking was not an option." (Id.). Plaintiff then went [*13]  to speak with Yolanda Silvey in Human Resources, who basically told Plaintiff the same thing, that if he was unable to operate the equipment, his only option was to work in the bin area. (Id.). In response, Plaintiff told Silvey, "Well, if that's the case, then I'm going to go ahead and leave because you guys are leaving me without an option." (Id. at 60-61). Silvey explained that if he left work, he would be issued an attendance point or occurrence for that. (Id. at 61, 69). Nevertheless, Plaintiff left work early that day, got a doctor's note, and brought the note back to work the next day. (Id. at 70).
The doctor's note was dated May 6, 2014 and was signed by Anthony Onyegbula, D.O., with the Center of Hope for Cancers and Blood Disorders, in Stockbridge, Georgia. (Doc. 77-1 at 2). The note was addressed "To Whom It May Concern," and stated:
Mr. Asa Lewis is a patient of my practice. Mr. Lewis has a history of sickle cell disease and experiences occasional flare ups from time to time that can be painful. It is recommended during these flare ups, that the patient have the ability to utilize equipment at his employment in order for him to perform his duties. Mr. Lewis' condition [*14]  is monitored on a monthly basis. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the office at the number above.
(Id.). According to Plaintiff, when he returned to work on May 7 and May 8 with his doctor's note, Home Depot permitted him to work on the turret truck as he had requested. (Lewis Dep. at 61, 149). It was around this time that Plaintiff began discussing with HR his possible need for intermittent medical leave due to his sickle cell condition. (Id. at 56-57, 60, 67).
On May 9, 2014, Plaintiff contacted Home Depot's HR call center to ask about applying for an intermittent medical leave of absence. Plaintiff was mailed a leave of absence package with forms that he needed to complete and return. (Lewis Dep. at 89; Doc. 77-1 at 21-30). Plaintiff recalls being advised as to the requirements for leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and being told that he was not eligible under the FMLA because he had not been employed at Home Depot for a long enough period of time. But he was informed that Home Depot had its own medical leave-of-absence process and procedures. (Lewis Dep. at 90-91).
Between May 6, 2014 and May 28, 2014, Plaintiff was absent from work on May 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 20. [*15]  (Lewis Dep. at 81-82; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 7-8). Plaintiff provided another doctor's note for his absences between May 9-16. (Lewis Dep. at 83). Plaintiff returned to work on May 23 and worked through May 28, and then did not report to work at the distribution center from May 29, 2014 through August 6, 2014. (Lewis Dep. at 81-82, 106; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 8-9; Doc. 85-4, Lewis Aff., ¶ 10). From May 29, 2014 until August 6, 2014, Plaintiff called the call-out line nineteen times. (Jones Decl. ¶ 9).4
On May 27, 2014, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). (Doc. 52-1 at 1 [May 2014 EEOC Charge]). On the charge form in the space provided for indicating what the alleged discrimination was based on, Plaintiff checked the boxes for "Retaliation," "Sex," and "Disability." Plaintiff indicated that the discrimination was a continuing action that commenced at the earliest February 1, 2014, through, at the latest, May 27, 2014. (Id.). The text portion of the charge form alleges that Plaintiff is a person with a disability; that on or around February 1, 2014, April Reed began sexually harassing him and refused to stop; that he complained [*16]  to his supervisor, Carl Billings, and the Human Resources department; and after he complained, an accommodation he needed for his disability was denied, other individuals began harassing him, and Reed's sexual harassment continued. The last paragraph alleges that Plaintiff believed he had been discriminated against because of his sex (male) and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices, in violation of Title VII, and because of his disability, and in retaliation for opposing unlawful employment practices, in violation of Title I of the ADA. (Id.).
In June 2014, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Home Depot with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") concerning his request on May 6, 2014 to work on the turret truck instead of his regular equipment, the reach truck, because of pain and the medication that he was taking. (Lewis Dep. at 186-88). In his OSHA complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Home Depot tried to force him to work while under medication, in violation of OSHA rules. (Id.; Doc. 85-4 at 39). Plaintiff claimed that his doctor had advised him not to operate heavy machinery while on medication because it made him drowsy, but Plaintiff did not [*17]  submit any documentation to OSHA (or Home Depot) from his doctor restricting Plaintiff from operating machinery while under medical treatment. (Doc. 85-4 at 39-40). After investigating Plaintiff's claims, OSHA found that Plaintiff had voluntarily left the job site without approval, and that his claims were unsubstantiated and without merit, and dismissed his complaint. (Id.; Lewis Dep. at 187-88).
Plaintiff filed an appeal, requesting that the U.S. Department of Labor review the dismissal of his OSHA complaint. (Doc. 85-4 at 41-43). In his appeal statement, Plaintiff reiterated that despite the fact that he showed his manager and HR representative the two bottles of prescription pills he had with him, the only two options he was offered were working on the reach truck equipment or in the bin area, and he refused both options for safety reasons. Plaintiff also claimed that the actions by Home Depot were in retaliation for Plaintiff's repeated complaints of sexual harassment by a coworker. (Id. at 42-43). Plaintiff's appeal apparently was denied. (See Lewis Dep. at 187-89).
On June 3, 2014, Yolanda Harper (senior manager with Home Depot's Medical & Health Management Department) sent Plaintiff's [*18]  physician, Dr. Onyegbula, a request for more information about the work restrictions/accommodations that Home Depot had received from the physician's office. (Doc. 85-2 at 50-53). Among other things, Home Depot asked for a clarification of the physician's earlier note stating that during flare-ups, Plaintiff needed to "have the ability to utilize equipment at his employment in order to perform his duties." (Id. at 53). Dr. Onyegbula filled out a questionnaire clarifying that his opinion was that during flare-ups, "Mr. Lewis does not have the ability to utilize equipment at his employment in order to perform his duties." Id. (emphasis added). Dr. Onyegbula further opined that Plaintiff's condition caused episodic flare-ups periodically that would prevent Plaintiff from performing his regular job functions, and during crises, it would be "practically impossible for [Plaintiff] to work." (Id. at 57). The completed form was signed by Plaintiff's physician and dated June 29, 2014, but the document apparently was never transmitted to Home Depot. (Id. at 58; Lewis Dep. at 91-92; Hessinger Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; Jones Decl. ¶ 10).
On July 8, 2014, Rob Carpenter and Malaika Jones contacted Plaintiff [*19]  to tell him they had not yet received the additional medical paperwork that Home Depot required from his physician with regard to Plaintiff's medical leave of absence. (Lewis Dep. at 91; Hessinger Decl. ¶ 7; Jones Decl. ¶ 10; Doc. 83, Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Mat. Facts ["PSMF"], ¶ 10). In response, Plaintiff provided a copy of the accommodations questionnaire that his medical provider had completed. (PSMF ¶ 12; Hessinger Decl. ¶ 7; Jones Decl. ¶ 10). After reviewing the additional medical information, Home Depot determined that the accommodation it could offer was intermittent leave whenever Plaintiff experienced a flare-up. On July 9, 2014, Home Depot approved Plaintiff's requested medical leave of absence retroactively, which meant that all of Plaintiff's violations of Home Depot's attendance and punctuality policy between May 6, 2014 and his return to work on August 6, 2014 were excused and did not count as attendance "occurrences." (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 7; Jones Decl. ¶ 10; PSMF ¶¶ 13-14). Plaintiff acknowledges that he would have been terminated for his attendance violations if those absences had not been protected by Home Depot's retroactive approval of his May 9, 2014 request for [*20]  a leave of absence. (Lewis Dep. at 93).
On July 30, 2014, Plaintiff's physician wrote a letter releasing Plaintiff to return to work on August 6, 2014 with no restrictions. (Doc. 74-5 at 61; DSMF ¶ 27). Plaintiff met with Home Depot's Rob Carpenter and Malaika Jones on August 5, 2014 to discuss Plaintiff's return to work. (DSMF ¶ 28). During the meeting, Plaintiff told Mr. Carpenter that he did not have any work-related restrictions; he was not requesting an accommodation; and there was nothing to prevent him from safely operating the material handling equipment. (Id.; Hessinger Decl. ¶ 8; Doc. 77-1 at 36-38, Lewis Dep. 162-65 & Ex. 9 ["Interactive Reasonable Accommodation Process" form]).
Plaintiff testified that on or about August 7, 2014, he met again with Malaika Jones in HR and complained that prior to his May-August leave of absence, Carl Billings had forbidden him to wear a tie to work, for safety reasons, in accordance with Home Depot's safety policy. However, Plaintiff stated that he learned that during his leave of absence, a white employee named Joe had been permitted to wear a suit and tie to work every day in the same area where Plaintiff worked, and Plaintiff thought that [*21]  was racism. (Lewis Dep. at 139-43). Ms. Jones told Plaintiff that she was not familiar with Home Depot's policy on wearing ties to work, but she would look into it and get back with him. (Id. at 142). Ms. Jones subsequently located Joe and instructed him that he was not permitted to wear a tie due to safety-related concerns. (Jones Decl. ¶ 17).
On or about August 11, 2014, Plaintiff advised Rob Carpenter that he actually did have a request for an accommodation; he wanted to obtain permission to attend follow-up appointments and receive periodic medical treatments for approximately the next two months. Based on a secret tape recording that Plaintiff says he made of his meeting on August 11, 2014 with Mr. Carpenter and Ms. Jones, Plaintiff contends that he was assured all of his "future" absences would be "protected," that he was already on intermittent leave, and the only thing he needed to provide were the dates of his upcoming appointments.5 (Doc. 84, Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF, ¶ 69). In light of Plaintiff's pro se status, the undersigned has endeavored to listen to and consider the recordings Plaintiff has supplied and relied on to support his contentions. (Doc. 86, Lewis Flash Drive, File [*22]  No. 140811_003).6 The undersigned has also reviewed the "Interactive Reasonable Accommodation Process" form that Rob Carpenter completed to document Plaintiff's request for accommodation and the interactive process that Mr. Carpenter, Malaika Jones, and Plaintiff engaged in on August 11, 2014. (Doc. 77-1 at 39-40 ["IRAP form"]. After listening to the recording from August 11, 2014, Plaintiff's summary of the conversation is not a completely accurate characterization of what was said at that meeting.
Plaintiff's recording and the IRAP form both indicate that during the meeting, Plaintiff confirmed that as of August 6, 2014, he was released to return to work with no restrictions, he did not need any accommodations, he was capable of doing "everything," and there was "nothing" he could not do. (Doc. 77-1 at 38-39; Doc. 86, Lewis Flash Drive, File No. 140811_003). By August 11th, however, Plaintiff had apparently changed his mind and indicated that he now wanted the accommodation of being able to attend future doctor visits and hydration treatments without his absences being treated as attendance occurrences. (Doc. 77-1 at 39). Rob Carpenter indicated that Plaintiff's request would be considered [*23]  and treated as an accommodation through intermittent leave, but Home Depot would need to document it so that Plaintiff could obtain approval for the intermittent leave. Mr. Carpenter asked Plaintiff to get the appropriate documentation from his physician so that any doctor's appointments tied to his medical condition—and his medical condition alone—would not be counted against him as "occurrences" or attendance violations. (DSMF ¶ 29; Doc. 77-1 at 39 ¶ 1). Ms. Jones informed Plaintiff that to obtain the accommodation of being able to attend his future doctor's appointments, Home Depot would need "documentation from your health care provider identifying work restrictions, that would be if you get those appointments" [Plaintiff responded, "yes, ma'am"], "we would put that on there." (Doc. 86, Lewis Flash Drive, File No. 140811_003). Mr. Carpenter then stated, "so I think our best bet is to have you bring in those [Plaintiff: "absolutely"], and then we will do this one over again once we have that [Plaintiff: "okay"], so we can then sign off and say, hey, and that will give us some time to partner, too, to make sure that's an accommodation that we can make" [Plaintiff: "that can be made, [*24]  exactly"]. Mr. Carpenter continued, "And if that's the case, we will sign this tomorrow stating that our accommodation that we're going to do is that we're going to give you intermittent FMLA [Plaintiff: "yes, sir"] prior to you being eligible with that. But that will protect your time tied to your medical condition [Plaintiff: "And I truly appreciate it, yes, sir"]." Mr. Carpenter continued, "Now, of course, like I mentioned, common cold, you're late because your car is broken down, your wife has truck trouble, you know, all that kind of stuff [Plaintiff: "exactly, exactly"], that's still accountable. But anything tied to your medical condition, that would be covered under FMLA; you would not have accountable time, and that would be protected." [Plaintiff: "And I truly appreciate it. I truly appreciate it"]. (Doc. 86, Lewis Flash Drive, File No. 140811_003; Lewis Dep. at 165-67). Mr. Carpenter made clear that if Plaintiff provided the requested information from his doctor, Home Depot was willing to approve Plaintiff for intermittent FMLA leave so that he could attend his doctors' appointments. Plaintiff agreed to produce the required documentation: "I'll leave at 2:30 and call my [*25]  doctors and have them get everything together, and I can pick that up hopefully today, and bring it in with me tomorrow." Carpenter replied, "Yes, the sooner you can get it, the better." Plaintiff responded, "I just want to make sure that we do have all the documentation so I can be protected." Mr. Carpenter replied, "Yes. No, I mean that makes sense because God forbid, something happens this week [Plaintiff: "exactly"] and you need to call in, then you'll be covered." [Plaintiff: "Absolutely. Thank you."]. Carpenter then stated, "Okay, good, awesome, man. We're good for now. We'll still have to get back together on this." Then they briefly discussed that upon Plaintiff's return to work on August 6, 2014, he had been offered the opportunity to change departments, but Plaintiff confirmed that he wanted to return to the same area he had been working in before he was out, the shuttle put-away, rather than a different location. (Doc. 86, File No. 140811_003; Lewis Dep. at 197-98).
Plaintiff testified that his intention was to provide Home Depot with a list of his doctors' appointments for the next six months so Home Depot would know when he would be absent from work, but he never provided [*26]  that information to Home Depot. (Lewis Dep. at 184-86). Plaintiff acknowledged that without such a note from his doctor, Home Depot's policy required that he would have to report each absence on the call-out line. (Id. at 186; Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 30).
After returning to work on August 6, 2014, Plaintiff worked August 7-9 and August 11-15, but did not return to work at Home Depot after August 15 until September 24, 2014, when he returned to Home Depot and was terminated. (DSMF ¶ 31). During Plaintiff's absence after August 15th, Plaintiff called the call-out line some days. He also occasionally called Rob Carpenter directly. (Lewis Dep. at 152).
Plaintiff avers in his affidavit that on August 25, 2014, Malaika Jones called him and informed him that they still needed to complete the medical leave of absence ("MLOA") documentation from the August 11, 2014 meeting, and Plaintiff should continue to call the call-out line like he was doing so that his absences would not be treated as attendance violations.7 (Lewis Aff. ¶¶ 18, 23; Lewis Dep. at 189; Jones Decl. ¶ 13; see also Doc. 74-5 at 70 [email dated August 23, 2014 from Rob Carpenter to Malaika Jones ("Please call [Asa Lewis] to inform [*27]  him that he did not complete the process for the intermittent LOA accommodation. Tell him that he needs to complete the process in order for us to give him the accommodation and protect his absences tied to his illness.")]). Even after Plaintiff's late August phone call with Ms. Jones, Plaintiff did not provide any information from his doctor before the decision to terminate his employment was made. (Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 35; Lewis Dep. at 171-72; Jones Decl. ¶ 13; Hessinger Decl ¶¶ 10-11).
When no further information from Plaintiff's doctor was provided, Rob Carpenter asked that a compilation be prepared showing Plaintiff's attendance violations in August and September. (Jones Decl. ¶ 13). Based on Home Depot's time records and call-out log information, the compilation indicated that Plaintiff had approximately 29 "occurrences" (pursuant to Home Depot's attendance and punctuality policy) during his non-probationary period of employment, in addition to three "occurrences" carried over from his probationary period, for a total of 32 "occurrences." (See Jones Decl. ¶ 14).
In late August 2014 and again in the second week of September 2014, Mr. Carpenter contacted Doug Hessinger [*28]  (Home Depot's Senior Manager of Associate Relations with responsibility for the Locust Grove distribution center) to express concern that Plaintiff had been absent without medical documentation since August 15, 2014. (Hessinger Decl. ¶¶ 2, 10). Mr. Carpenter informed Mr. Hessinger that Ms. Jones had contacted Plaintiff by phone in late August to remind him that the process for receiving intermittent leave approval was not complete, and Plaintiff had assured her that he understood the process, he was going to his doctor the next day, and he expected to return to work "on Wednesday." (Id. at ¶ 10). By the second week of September, however, Plaintiff was still absent from work and had not provided any medical documentation to support either his absences or a planned return to work. (Id. ¶¶ 9-11; Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 37).
As a general rule, an associate with ten absence "occurrences" during an anniversary year is terminated. (Jones Decl. ¶ 15). Not including Plaintiff, more than ten associates in the same position as Plaintiff at the distribution center were terminated in 2014 for attendance violations. (Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 40; Jones Decl. ¶ 15). Plaintiff quibbles with the number of [*29]  Plaintiff's absences Home Depot calculated in response to Mr. Carpenter's request, but Plaintiff admits that by September 24, 2014, Plaintiff's calculations show that he had 28 "occurrences." (Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 41; Doc. 74-5 at 72).
After looking into Plaintiff's attendance record, Mr. Hessinger states that he became concerned about ensuring consistent enforcement of company policy. Mr. Hessinger also knew that Plaintiff was aware of the process for requesting medical leave based on Plaintiff's May 2014 request. (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 11; Pl.'s Resp. to DSMF ¶ 39). Based on Plaintiff's attendance records, his spotty compliance with the company's call-out policy, and his failure to provide the required medical information despite Plaintiff's demonstrated familiarity with the process for requesting a medical leave of absence and/or intermittent leave as an accommodation, Mr. Hessinger made the decision that Plaintiff's employment should be terminated. (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 11).
Mr. Hessinger informed Mr. Carpenter that he had made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, but asked Mr. Carpenter to wait to advise Plaintiff of his termination until after Mr. Hessinger had had the opportunity [*30]  to confer with individuals in the Employment Practices Department regarding the termination. (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 14).
On September 24, 2014, Mr. Carpenter met with Plaintiff and terminated his employment. The termination notice provided to Plaintiff stated: "On multiple dates, Asa Lewis failed to follow proper call in procedures. From 8/11/14 to 9/24/14, Asa had 32 days of failing to call the call in line within 1 hour of his scheduled start time of 6 am. Based on the Company's investigation, it has been determined that this conduct violated the Company's attendance and punctuality standards. Asa S. Lewis['s] employment with Home Depot is terminated."8 (Doc. 74-6 at 66).
After Plaintiff was terminated, he filed another charge of discrimination with the EEOC on November 28, 2014. (Doc. 52-1 at 3 [November Charge]). In the November Charge, Plaintiff alleged that throughout his employment with Home Depot, he complained of unfair treatment to his supervisor, Carl Billings, and to HR, and on September 24, 2014, he was discharged. The reason given for his termination was "failing to contact the employer while on leave." (Id.). In the area of the charge form for indicating what the alleged discrimination [*31]  was based on, Plaintiff checked the boxes for "Race" and "Retaliation." The boxes for discrimination based on sex or disability were left blank. The November Charge indicates that the earliest date the alleged discrimination took place was March 1, 2014, and the latest date was September 24, 2014, the day Plaintiff was terminated. In the text portion of the charge, Plaintiff stated that he believed he had been discriminated against based on his race (African American), in violation of Title VII. (Id.).
On September 11, 2014, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a notice of right to sue in connection with his May 2014 EEOC Charge. (Doc. 52-1 at 2). With regard to Plaintiff's November Charge, the EEOC issued a notice of right to sue on December 12, 2014. (Doc. 52-1 at 4). Plaintiff's initial complaint was filed in federal court on January 13, 2015. (Doc. 3, Compl.). In February 2016, Plaintiff was granted leave to file an amended complaint, which was docketed on February 10, 2016. The Amended Complaint is now the operative complaint before this Court. (Doc. 52, Am. Compl.).
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint asserts Title VII claims for alleged sexual harassment/hostile work environment, retaliation, [*32]  race discrimination, and wrongful termination. Plaintiff also claims that Home Depot failed to accommodate his disability in violation of the ADA. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint seeks money damages in the amount of $2,228,960.00, plus costs and fees. (Doc. 52 at 8). On July 14, 2016, Home Depot filed the instant motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 74). The motion has been fully briefed and is before the Court for its consideration.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Title VII Race Discrimination Claim
Title VII prohibits employment discrimination with respect to an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's race. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). To prevail on a Title VII race discrimination claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 980-81 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing Clark v. Huntsville City Bd. of Educ., 717 F.2d 525, 529 (11th Cir. 1983)). Such discriminatory intent may be established either by providing direct evidence of discrimination or by showing circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Where, as here, there is no direct evidence, a claim of discrimination is proven by circumstantial evidence and is generally evaluated under the burden-shifting McDonnell Douglas framework. E.E.O.C. v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002); see also Rainey v. Holder, 412 F. App'x 235, 237 (11th Cir. 2011).
Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff must [*33]  first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Once the plaintiff employee has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason behind the complained-of employment action. Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-56, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981). If the employer proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, the burden shifts again to the employee to show that the employer's proffered reason is a pretext for a discriminatory motive. Id. at 256.
A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified to do the job; (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside his class more favorably. Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam)).
In this case, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of race. Plaintiff's sole allegation of race discrimination pertains to his desire to wear a tie at work (where he worked around heavy machinery), and being told that for safety reasons, he was not permitted to do so, whereas a white employee named Joe was allegedly permitted to wear a tie during Plaintiff's [*34]  leave of absence. The evidence shows that as soon as Plaintiff brought the issue to the attention of HR's Malaika Jones, she inquired about the matter and subsequently advised the other employee that he too was prohibited from wearing a tie due to safety concerns. Plaintiff has failed to allege or establish that he suffered an adverse employment action with regard to not being permitted to wear a tie to work.
To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to assert that he was unlawfully terminated based on race discrimination, that claim also fails. Plaintiff has failed to point to a single comparator, outside of his protected class, who had similar attendance issues and violations of company policy, yet was treated more favorably. Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff has also failed to argue or point to any evidence from which the court could infer that Home Depot's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was a pretext for intentional race discrimination. See Brooks v. County Comm'n of Jefferson County, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (proof of pretext requires proof that the reason is false and the real reason is intentional discrimination).
For the reasons stated, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Title VII race discrimination [*35]  claim(s).

B. Title VII Sexual Harassment/Hostile Work Environment Claim
Plaintiff next asserts that throughout the entire period of his employment with Home Depot (from January to September 2014, during which time he reported to work less than 100 days), he was subjected to a sexually hostile work environment by his coworker/area coordinator, April Reed. Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Reed verbally and physically sexually harassed him by making inappropriate and unwelcome comments, by attempting to pat his bottom, grab his hand, and rub his back, and by following him to the bathroom as he attempted to perform his job duties. Plaintiff contends that Ms. Reed's constant offensive comments and inappropriate, unwelcome touching constituted sexual harassment, and that her conduct caused him so much stress that his sickle cell disease flared up and he became unable to work.
In addition to race discrimination, Title VII prohibits employment discrimination with respect to an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's sex. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). "Employees of either gender may experience discrimination or harassment in a variety of different forms, one of which [*36]  is unwelcome sexual advances." Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1274 (11th Cir. 1999). Although Title VII does not mention the term "sexual harassment," courts have long recognized that Title VII prohibits such conduct. Id. Actionable sexual harassment occurs when inappropriate sexual conduct causes a hostile work environment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of work. Hulsey v. Pride Rests., LLC, 367 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir. 2004).
To establish a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim under Title VII, an employee must allege and prove: (1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) that he was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment, such as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other conduct of a sexual nature; (3) that the harassment was based on his sex; (4) that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) that a basis exists for holding the employer liable. Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1245; Hulsey, 367 F.3d at 1244.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to show that the conduct complained of was "sufficiently severe or pervasive" to alter the conditions of his employment and create a hostile work environment. (Doc. 74-1 at 18 [citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993)]). Sexual harassment constitutes [*37]  sex discrimination only when the harassment alters the terms or conditions of employment. Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1245. To survive summary judgment on a sexual harassment hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a reasonable jury could find that his workplace was permeated with "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult ... sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 (1993) (citing Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399 (1986)).
The "severe and pervasive" element contains both an objective and a subjective component. To be actionable, the challenged conduct must create an environment that is both objectively hostile or abusive (the reasonable person standard) and an environment that the plaintiff himself perceives to be abusive (the subjective standard). See Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2002).
In determining whether an environment is "hostile" or "abusive," the court must consider the entirety of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. Id. (citing Allen v. Tyson Foods, 121 F.3d 642, 647 (11th Cir. 1997)); Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S. Ct. at 371. As the Supreme [*38]  Court explained in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275 (1998), "simple teasing ... offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the 'terms and conditions of employment.' ... We have made it clear that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment ...." Id. at 788, 118 S. Ct. at 2283-84.
In this case, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of establishing the fourth element of a prima facie sexual harassment hostile work environment claim. Plaintiff has provided insufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that Reed created a workplace filled with intimidation and ridicule that was sufficiently extreme, severe, or pervasive to alter Plaintiff's working conditions.
Plaintiff's testimony is insufficient to show that Reed's conduct was objectively severe or pervasive. Plaintiff has provided no specifics as to the dates, times, or frequency of the alleged offensive comments, except that they began "around February" 2014. (Lewis Dep. at 94). Plaintiff claims that from February 2014 through August 2014, he was "continuously sexually harassed" by April Reed, but it is undisputed that Plaintiff was out on approved medical leave for much of May 2014; he was [*39]  out again between May 29 and August 6, 2014, and he only worked nine days in August prior to his termination. Plaintiff claims that Reed said something "inappropriate" to him every shift he worked, but he admits that her comments varied, and not all were sexual references; at times he and Reed had perfectly appropriate conversations, and there were times when both of them joked and complimented each other. Plaintiff testified that Ms. Reed "laughed" when she allegedly made some of her comments to him, like "you know you want it," and that he also laughed and told her to "stop and how ridiculous" she was. Plaintiff testified that he also may have said inappropriate things to Ms. Reed.
With regard to the alleged incidents of unwanted touching, Plaintiff estimated that Reed patted him on the backside more than twice, but less than ten times; that she tried to grab his hand several times, "but less than ten"; and she touched or rubbed his back "at least ten" times while she was talking to him. (Lewis Dep. at 113). There are no allegations that such unwanted touching was overtly sexual in nature. Defendant argues that the bar set in the Eleventh Circuit for conduct to be considered severe [*40]  or pervasive is "extraordinarily high," and the complained of conduct does not rise to the level of being sufficiently extreme, severe, physically threatening, or humiliating to survive summary judgment. (Doc. 89 at 8 & n.16 [citing Moore v. Treatment Centers of Am. Group, LLC, 972 F. Supp. 2d 1359, 1366 (M.D. Ga. 2013)]). The undersigned agrees. Courts in this circuit have rejected sexual harassment claims that are objectively far more serious than the conduct at issue in this case. See, e.g., Moore, 972 F. Supp. 2d at 1367 (citing Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1247-49) (finding that the following conduct was insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim: (1) one instance in which the alleged harasser said to [plaintiff] Mendoza, "I'm getting fired up"; (2) one occasion in which the alleged harasser rubbed his hip against Mendoza's hip while touching her shoulder and smiling; (3) two instances in which the alleged harasser made a sniffing sound while looking at Mendoza's groin area and one instance of sniffing without looking at her groin; and (4) the alleged harasser's "constant" following and staring at Mendoza in a "very obvious fashion"); Guthrie v. Waffle House, Inc., 460 F. App'x 803, 805-07 (11th Cir. 2012) (harassment not sufficiently severe or pervasive where, over a period of eleven months, one supervisor grabbed plaintiff's buttocks two to five times; asked her on a date between 10 [*41]  and 20 times; talked "dirty" to her by expressing his desire on five occasions to "fuck her" and "lick her all over"; spoke openly about having sex in another waitress's van in the parking lot; shoved her into the dishwashing sink; told plaintiff she could pee in his mouth; told plaintiff 15 times that she would not date him because he is black; and put his arms around her in a sexual manner; yet despite the alleged harassment, the plaintiff did not call the company's hotline for almost a year); Simmons v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., 391 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1133 (S.D. Ala. 2005) (finding that defendant's conduct in touching plaintiff's breasts on four to five occasions over a period of eight months was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the employee's terms or conditions of employment); see also Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 579, 584-85 (11th Cir. 2000) (eight episodes of touching, partial exposure, staring and complimenting in six or seven months, plus repeated invitations to lunch during the same period, were not frequent enough to constitute actionable sexual harassment), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 974 (11th Cir. 2008); Lockett v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 315 F. App'x 862, 863-67 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished decision) (finding no hostile work environment where plaintiff's co-worker "would talk about sexual positions"; described in graphic terms sexual acts he would perform on her, including [*42]  lick her "p-u-s-s-y"; told her "that she needed 'to get with a real guy'"; stuck his tongue out at her two or three times; and "touched her bottom quickly").
Plaintiff has also failed to establish that he subjectively perceived the harassment to be severe or pervasive. There is no evidence that he ever reported the alleged harassment to Home Depot's hotline, used Home Depot's internal grievance procedures, or submitted a written complaint to anyone at Home Depot. There is also no evidence in the record that Reed's conduct unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff's performance on the job. Plaintiff testified that he was "great" at his job, and that throughout his employment, management viewed him as one of Home Depot's "best forklift drivers." (Lewis Dep. at 108, 144). During his deposition, Plaintiff described his work performance as "excellent," even during the periods when he claims he was being sexually harassed. (Id. at 144).
Most damaging to Plaintiff's claim that he subjectively believed his work environment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of his employment is the fact that when Plaintiff returned to work in August 2014 after his months' long [*43]  leave of absence, Home Depot offered him the opportunity to change his work area as an accommodation (which would have moved him away from the alleged harasser), but Plaintiff declined the offer and expressed his desire to continue working in the shuttle put-away area, rather than a different location. (Doc. 86, File No. 140811_003; Lewis Dep. at 197-98); Guthrie, 460 F. App'x at 805-07 (finding that plaintiff did not subjectively believe environment to be severe and pervasive where plaintiff sought re-employment at the same restaurant); Lockett, 315 F. App'x at 866 (concluding that the plaintiff lacked a subjective belief that she experienced severe or pervasive harassment when she willingly returned to a working environment in close proximity to the alleged harasser).
Plaintiff does not argue that Reed's conduct was physically threatening; rather, Plaintiff contends that Reed's comments and occasional touching were offensive and unwelcome. Plaintiff has neither alleged nor shown that he sought any kind of medical care for mental or emotional distress. Although concrete psychological harm is not required, "[t]he effect on the employee's psychological well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the [*44]  environment abusive." Lockett, 315 F. App'x at 866 (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S. Ct. at 371). Plaintiff has also failed to present any probative medical evidence connecting his sickle cell crises to the alleged incidents of unwanted comments or touching, or demonstrating that he missed work "because of" the alleged events. Plaintiff simply has not shown that the alleged harassment unreasonably interfered with his work performance. The evidence does not support a subjective belief that Reed's conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a hostile working environment.
Looking at the totality of the circumstances, I find that the comments and conduct alleged by Plaintiff, as subjectively offensive as they may have been, do not rise to the level of harassing conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment. Plaintiff has also failed to point to sufficient evidence to establish that his conditions of employment were altered by his co-worker's conduct. Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1245-47 (collecting cases setting standards for a Title VII sexual harassment violation).
For the reasons stated, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff has not made out an actionable claim for sexual [*45]  harassment hostile work environment under Title VII. Accordingly, I RECOMMEND that Home Depot's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's sexual harassment claim.

C. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff next alleges that he was unlawfully retaliated against for complaining about and opposing discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII. (Am. Compl. at 7). Plaintiff alleges that after he complained about Reed allegedly sexually harassing him, Reed and two of her friends/coworkers retaliated against him by following him to the bathroom and complaining to management about the length of time he spent in the bathroom. Plaintiff also contends that he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about sexual harassment and discrimination. (Lewis Dep. at 146; Am. Compl. at 7). Retaliation claims are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973).
To establish a claim of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege and show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was some causal relation between the two events. Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., 513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir. 2008). To establish the causal connection element, a plaintiff [*46]  need only show that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated. Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999). To do so, "the plaintiff must generally show that the decision maker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse employment action." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). The causation element may be shown by the temporal proximity of the complaint to the adverse employment action. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007). However, the timing of the events must be "very close." Id. (stating that a three-to-four-month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action was insufficient to show causation).
Under McDonnell Douglas, "once the plaintiff has made out the elements of the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a non-discriminatory basis for its employment action." Springer v. Convergys Customer Mgmt. Group, Inc., 509 F.3d 1344, 1347 (citing Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1093 (1981)). If the employer does so, the presumption is eliminated, and the plaintiff is given an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason offered by the employer is a pretext for discrimination. Id. At all times, the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuading the finder of fact that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1093.
A plaintiff alleging [*47]  unlawful retaliation can show that he engaged in a protected act under Title VII through evidence of either "participation" or "opposition." White v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., No. 1:03-cv-00002-GET, 2006 WL 2443848, at *25 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 21, 2006). An act of participation requires the existence of a Title VII proceeding or investigation. Id. (citing Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir. 1999)). Making informal complaints to superiors about suspected illegal discrimination may also qualify as protected expression, but such complaints are protected under the opposition clause of Title VII. Id. (citing Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir. 1997)); see also Rollins v. Fla. Dep't Of Law Enf't, 868 F.2d 397, 400 (11th Cir. 1989) ("[W]e recognize that the protection afforded by the statute is not limited to individuals who have filed formal complaints, but extends as well to those, like [the plaintiff], who informally voice complaints to their superiors or who use their employers' internal grievance procedures.").
Here, for purposes of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, the undersigned will assume that Plaintiff both informally complained to superiors about Reed's alleged sexual harassment, and formally engaged in protected activity by filing an EEOC charge of discrimination in May 2014 alleging claims under Title VII and the ADA. Based on those assumptions, I find that Plaintiff has satisfied the first element of his retaliation claim.
With regard to [*48]  the alleged retaliatory behavior by Reed and her coworkers, though, Plaintiff has failed to establish that he suffered an adverse employment action. Plaintiff testified that after Reed and her coworkers began following him to the bathroom and complaining about how long Plaintiff was staying in the bathroom, Plaintiff's supervisor counseled him that he needed to watch how long he was in the bathroom because he was being unproductive, and that could be counted against him. (Lewis Dep. at 120-121, 124, 126-27, 130-34). Plaintiff acknowledges, however, that he was never formally disciplined for taking lengthy bathroom breaks. (Id. at 196). Thus, as to Reed and her coworkers, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the adverse employment action and causation elements of a prima facie retaliation claim.
With regard to Plaintiff's termination, it is undisputed that termination is an adverse employment action. Plaintiff, however, has presented no evidence that a causal link existed between his alleged protected activity (i.e., filing an EEOC charge of discrimination in May 2014) and Plaintiff's termination approximately four months later, on September 24, 2014. Thomas, 506 F.3d at 1364 (concluding that a three-to-four-month [*49]  disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action was insufficient to show causation); Brown v. Ala. Dep't. of Transp., 597 F.3d 1160, 1182 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that a three-month timespan between the protected activity and the adverse action was too long).
Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because he has not demonstrated a causal connection between any protected activity and a materially adverse action taken against him. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was at least a four-month interval between his alleged complaints to his supervisor, HR, and the filing of his EEOC charge in May 2014, and his termination at the end of September 2014. Contrary to Plaintiff's claim of retaliatory conduct, two months after Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge, Home Depot approved, retroactively, the medical leave of absence that he had requested so that his employment status would not be in jeopardy. There was no temporal proximity between his alleged protected activity and his termination. Without any other evidence showing causation or a retaliatory motive, this is insufficient to establish a prima facie case.
Even if Plaintiff were able to establish an inference [*50]  of retaliation on the basis of the timing between his "complaints" and his termination, a causal connection would still be lacking. This court has repeatedly held that "any inference of retaliatory intent otherwise created by a short lapse of time can be dispelled when intervening factors [i.e., other reasons for the adverse action arising after the protected activity] are established." Wu v. Southeast-Atlantic Beverage Corp., 321 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1337 (N.D. Ga. 2004) (citing cases).
In this case, the uncontroverted evidence shows that after Plaintiff returned to work, with no restrictions, on August 6, 2014, Plaintiff was told on August 11, 2014 (and again on August 25th) that in order to be approved for intermittent medical leave as an accommodation (so that he could attend future doctors' appointments and not have his absences count as attendance violations or occurrences), he needed to provide appropriate documentation from his doctor; Plaintiff agreed to do so; but failed to provide Home Depot with the required medical documentation. Plaintiff was aware that his employer's attendance policy required that if he was going to be absent from work, and he did not have a doctor's note, he had to call out in accordance with the call-out policy. (Lewis Dep. at 184-86). [*51]  Plaintiff was absent from work (without any supporting medical documentation) from August 16, 2014 until September 24, 2014, when he returned to Home Depot and was terminated.
Under Home Depot's medical leave of absence policy, an associate has 15 calendar days after the last day worked to submit medical documentation to support a medical leave of absence, which meant that Plaintiff's deadline for submitting medical documentation for his absences starting August 16, 2014 was August 30, 2014. (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 9; Doc. 85-2 at 7).
Nevertheless (and contrary to his deposition testimony), Plaintiff now argues that he was not required to submit any additional supporting medical documentation because his absences after August 15, 2014 were covered and protected by his original medical leave of absence. (See Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Mat. Facts ¶¶ 25-26). In support of his argument, Plaintiff cites to an incomplete portion of Home Depot's "Reestablishing Eligibility for Leave" policy. The policy provides:
If the associate returns to work and: ... [is] not actively at work for thirty (30) consecutively scheduled calendar days on a full-time basis, and subsequently becomes unable to work again, a [*52]  Medical Leave, which may or may not be covered under FMLA, will again be made available, but the original leave start date plus days worked will be used to calculate the general one-year limit on Medical Leave.
(Doc. 85-2 at 11).
Plaintiff apparently interprets that provision to mean that because he did not work 30 consecutive days after he returned to work on August 6, 2014, that all of his subsequent absences were protected under his initial medical leave of absence. His argument, however, is not supported by the text of the policy, which on its face concerns the method to be used to calculate the one-year limit on medical leave rather than whether supporting medical documentation or certification (or re-certification) by the employee's health care provider is necessary. See Green v. Medco Health Solutions of Texas, LLC, 560 F. App'x 398, 401 (5th Cir. 2014) (affirming summary judgment on disability discrimination claim despite plaintiff's arguments that employer's attendance policy had an exception or could be interpreted differently). Plaintiff's argument is also directly contradicted by the tape recording that he submitted of the August 11th meeting, where he was informed that in order to have his future treatment-related absences covered, he needed to provide [*53]  supporting medical certification from his physician, as documented in the "Interactive Reasonable Accommodation Process" form dated August 11, 2014 that Rob Carpenter completed to document Plaintiff's request for accommodation. (Doc. 77-1 at 39-40). Plaintiff does not dispute that he was asked twice to provide supporting medical documentation, that he twice agreed to provide it, and that he failed to do so.
Plaintiff has pointed to no probative evidence tending to show that he was fired for any reason other than those stated by Home Depot, or that Home Depot's articulated reasons for terminating him were mere pretext. Plaintiff has also failed to produce any evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's alleged complaints of sexual harassment were the "but for" cause of his termination. See University of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar,     U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533 (2013) (holding that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation).
For the reasons stated, I RECOMMEND that summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII.

D. ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim
Summary judgment is also warranted on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim, under the ADA. In Plaintiff's [*54]  amended complaint, he alleges that Home Depot failed to accommodate him by not granting him leave, and then terminating him. (Am. Compl. at 8 ¶16).
Under the ADA, an employer may not discriminate against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to ... discharge of employees." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). "[T]he term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes ... not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical ... limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an ... employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business ...." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is "otherwise qualified," and unless the employer can show undue hardship. Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007). The burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365.
To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was discriminated [*55]  against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Id. at 1255-56. A plaintiff's failure to prove any element of his prima facie case defeats his ADA failure-to-accommodate claim. Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F. Supp. 3d 470 483 (E.D.N.C. 2015). Once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee cannot reasonably be accommodated, because the accommodation would impose an undue hardship to the employer. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365.
A qualified individual with a disability is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The plaintiff, in other words, "must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). "Thus, if [the plaintiff] is unable to perform an essential function of his ... job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a qualified individual [*56]  and, therefore, not covered under the ADA." Id. (internal quote marks omitted).
For purposes of this motion for summary judgment, Defendant has assumed that Plaintiff is disabled, as defined in the ADA. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA because Plaintiff has failed to show that he was able to meet the most essential function of any position — regular attendance. (Doc. 74-1, Def.'s Br., at 24 [citing Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 287 (11th Cir. 1997) (regular attendance is an essential function); Vaughn v. Nationsbank Corp., 137 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1325 (N.D. Ga. 2000)]). Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff performed his job adequately when he was at work, but rather argues that Plaintiff's excessive absences prevented him from performing those functions, and that his presence was an essential element of his job that he failed to satisfy. See id.; see also Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994) (listing cases). As Defendant notes, Plaintiff did not work in a Home Depot store; he worked in a fast-paced warehouse where every position was critical and attendance was key. (Doc. 89 at 2).
In response, Plaintiff argues that his attendance problems were directly attributable to the sexual harassment, racial discrimination, hostile work [*57]  environment, and retaliation that he experienced at work, and therefore his absences were caused by Defendant. (Doc. 82, Pl.'s Br., at 28-29). Plaintiff, however, has offered no probative evidence to tie his absences to the alleged harassment or race discrimination, and he consistently represented to Defendant that his absences were due to his sickle cell disease. More importantly for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, Plaintiff has failed address or show that he was capable of performing the essential functions of his employment position "with or without reasonable accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). He has also failed to identify what reasonable accommodation he sought, but was denied, that would have allowed him to perform his job's essential functions. Plaintiff, therefore, has failed to establish a prima facie case.
The record shows that when Plaintiff provided a doctor's note on May 7, 2014 stating that he should be permitted to "utilize equipment" to perform his job, Home Depot permitted Plaintiff to use the alternate equipment that he specifically requested. (Lewis Dep. at 67, 70, Ex. 2; Hessinger Decl. ¶ 3). When Plaintiff became unable to work as a result of his sickle cell disease [*58]  in May through August, as confirmed by his physician, Plaintiff sought, and was granted the reasonable accommodation of a leave of absence, and Defendant retroactively applied his leave approval to his attendance occurrences instead of terminating him for violating the attendance policy. (Hessinger Decl. ¶ 7; Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 950 (11th Cir. 2015) (leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation)).
Plaintiff was released to return to work, without restrictions, on August 6, 2014. At that time, Plaintiff verified to his employer that he was ready and capable of returning to work with no restrictions, and was not requesting any accommodations for his disability. When asked during his deposition to identify what reasonable accommodation he was seeking after he returned to work on August 6, 2014, Plaintiff testified, "From August to September? At this point I couldn't answer that question." (Lewis Dep. at 221).
Notwithstanding Plaintiff's testimony, it is undisputed that the only accommodation Plaintiff sought after he returned to work on August 6, 2014 was the ability to attend doctors' appointments and obtain periodic hydration treatments. When an employee requests an accommodation from his employer, pursuant to the ADA, [*59]  the ADA contemplates an open, interactive process between the employer and employee to "identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome the limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
In this case, as part of the interactive process, Defendant asked Plaintiff to provide supporting medical documentation from his physician so that Defendant could evaluate whether it was able to approve Plaintiff's accommodation request. Plaintiff admits that he was asked on August 11, 2014 to submit documentation from his physician regarding his accommodation request related to future absences; he was told again on August 25 that Defendant required written documentation from his doctor to protect his absences; Plaintiff agreed to provide such documentation the next day, but failed to do so; and Plaintiff never provided anything from his physician regarding his continued absences after August 15, 2014, his last work day, through the date of his termination. The record evidence clearly indicates that Defendant engaged in the interactive process, and made reasonable efforts to communicate with Plaintiff and to provide a reasonable accommodation based on [*60]  the available information. Plaintiff, however, caused a breakdown in the interactive process when he failed to provide any medical documentation outlining his work limitations or certifying that Plaintiff required intermittent leave in order to attend doctor's appointments and obtain medical treatment for his sickle cell disease. Accordingly, Defendant cannot be held liable for failure to make reasonable accommodations. EEOC v. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc., 774 F.3d 127, 132 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that if an employer engages in an interactive process with the employee, in good faith, for the purpose of discussing alternative reasonable accommodations, but the employee fails to cooperate in the process, then the employer cannot be held liable under the ADA for a failure to provide reasonable accommodations); see also Williams v. Revco Discount Drug Ctrs., Inc., 552 F. App'x 919 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination and retaliation claims, where plaintiff admitted his physician never submitted any paperwork his employer sought); Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrs., 500 F. App'x 860, 870 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff's ADA failure-to-accommodate claim where plaintiff failed to provide any medical documentation to support her accommodation request, thus causing a breakdown in the interactive process); Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F. Supp. 3d 470, 485, 490 (E.D.N.C. 2015) (holding that an employer may request [*61]  current medical documentation to assess reasonable accommodation under the ADA, and where the plaintiff took no reasonable steps, remained silent, did not complete paperwork, and remained out of work, the plaintiff "utterly failed in his duties under the ADA").
To the extent that Plaintiff contends Defendant violated the ADA by terminating his employment due to violations of its attendance policy, courts have recognized that an accommodation that requires an employer to ignore prior misconduct, including violations of its attendance policy, is not the kind of reasonable accommodation mandated under the ADA. See, e.g., Green, 560 F. App'x 398, 402 (5th Cir. 2014); Brookins v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 90 F. Supp. 2d 993, 1007 (S.D. Ind. 2000) ("To the extent [the employee] argues that [the employer] should have overlooked his long string of absences, this is not an 'accommodation' that is required by the ADA.").
Finally, to the extent Plaintiff asserts that his failure-to-accommodate claim arose after May 27, 2014, the date of his first EEOC Charge, his claim is likely administratively barred.
Both Title VII and the ADA require a plaintiff to first exhaust the available administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC before filing a lawsuit in court. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001) (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2); Maxwell [*62]  v. Inner Harbour, Ltd., No. 1:08-CV-2925-RWS, 2009 WL 1045478, at *1-2 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 20, 2009) (stating that the administrative filing requirements are the same for claims brought under Title VII and the ADA). An ADA plaintiff may not bring any claim in his lawsuit that was not included in his EEOC charge. See Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970) ("the 'scope' of the judicial complaint is limited to the 'scope' of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination")). Thus, a plaintiff is precluded from pursuing any ADA claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in his EEOC charge, or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. Id.; Thomas v. Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., 508 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1275 (N.D. Ga. 2007); see also Coon v. Ga. Pac. Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1568-69 (11th Cir. 1987) (limiting plaintiff's action in court to single claim contained in plaintiff's EEOC charge).
Plaintiff's first EEOC charge is dated May 27, 2014, and includes an allegation that he was discriminated and retaliated against because of his disability, in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 52-1 at 1). The charge alleges that the latest date the alleged discrimination took place was May 27, 2014. (Id.). Plaintiff's second EEOC charge, dated November 28, 2014, bears a different [*63]  charge number, and does not appear to be an amendment of his first charge. (Id. at 1, 3). Plaintiff filed his second EEOC charge after the dismissal of his first charge and after his termination. The second charge, however, does not in any way indicate a claim of failure to accommodate or disability discrimination, under the ADA. (Id. at 3). The allegations are limited to discrimination based on race and retaliation. Plaintiff's second charge alleges that throughout his employment, he complained of unfair treatment and on September 24, 2014, he was discharged for failing to contact his employer while on leave. (Id.).
As noted above, Plaintiff's second charge does not mention failure to accommodate or even allude to the ADA or any disability. Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to assert a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA with regard to the period of Plaintiff's employment from May 28, 2014 through September 24, 2014, Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for such a claim. See Perry v. American Red Cross Blood Servs., 651 F. App'x 317, 323-24 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies where her ADA charge of discrimination alleged that she was terminated for excessive call-ins [*64]  and absenteeism, but failed to mention "failure to accommodate" or the date of the alleged failure to accommodate).
Based on the cited authority, and f or all the reasons stated, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's ADA failure-to-accommodate claim be GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, I RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 74) be GRANTED in its entirety.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED, this 9th day of January, 2017.
