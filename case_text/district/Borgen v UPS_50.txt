MEMORANDUM

Proceedings: (In Chambers) Order DENYING Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 33)
Defendant United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) moves for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication of issues on Plaintiff Orville Borgen's employment disability discrimination complaint.

I. FACTS

A. Plaintiff's Hiring and Initial Diagnosis
Plaintiff started working for UPS on June 21, 2010. UF P 1.1 Initially, Plaintiff worked as a preloader, made $7.25 or $7.50 per hour, and was responsible for loading delivery trucks with packages. Id. PP 3-6.
In late 2011, Plaintiff was diagnosed with choroideremia, an eye condition that causes difficulty with night vision and peripheral vision. Id. ¶¶ 7-8. At the time of his diagnosis, Plaintiff's condition rendered him legally blind. SS ¶ 392. Plaintiff notified UPS of his diagnosis no later than early 2012. UF ¶ 10.
UPS's accommodation process instructs employees seeking a job-related accommodation to notify the HR Service Center, their HR Representative, or their manager/supervisor. Id. ¶¶ 11-12; Dkt. 33-32, [*2]  Declaration of June Listi (Listi Decl.) ¶ 4, Ex. 4. UPS then sends the requesting employee a Request for Medical Information (RMI) form to be completed by the employee's treating physician. UPS then meets with the employee to review the RMI and identify reasonable accommodations. UF ¶¶ 13-14; Listi Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 4.
UPS sent Plaintiff an RMI on February 2, 2012. It was completed by Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Veena Raiji, on February 28, and returned to UPS on March 15. UF ¶¶ 16-19; Listi Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 5. In response to a question identifying the "specific function(s) of the position that the employee is unable to perform," Dr. Raiji wrote: "[Plaintiff] cannot work varying shifts (legally cannot drive, legally blind)"; "Cannot grasp/control packages due to limited peripheral vision"; and "Should not operate powered equipment (cannot see in dim illumination & has limited depth perception/peripheral vision)." UF ¶ 27; Listi Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 5. Dr. Raiji further identified general restrictions based on Plaintiff's eye condition: "Employee cannot work in dim illumination," and "Is physically able to lift/move packages, however, peripheral vision is limited (only has central islands of vision)." [*3]  UF ¶ 27; Listi Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 5. Dr. Raiji noted Plaintiff was "able to perform desk-based jobs which do not require peripheral vision or depth perception," and was "best suited for clerical/secretarial/desk work." UF ¶ 28; Listi Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 5.
On June 7, Plaintiff met with HR Supervisor Lloyd2 to complete an accommodation checklist. Plaintiff placed stars next to job duties that would be difficult based on his medical restrictions. UF ¶¶ 22-23; Dkt. 33-35, Declaration of Stacy Fode (Fode Decl.) ¶ 2, Ex. 6. Plaintiff did not put a star next to the job duty that described working "varying shifts." UF ¶ 24; Fode Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 6.

B. Plaintiff's Jobs Post-Diagnosis
1. Data Supervisor
UPS did not have any available jobs that accommodated Plaintiff's medical restrictions and suggested Plaintiff participate in the Manager Assessment and Placement Program (MAPP). UF ¶¶ 32-34. Plaintiff successfully completed MAPP, and in November 2012 was offered a position as a part-time data management supervisor, a desk job in a well-lit office. Id. ¶¶ 35-36, 38. Plaintiff was in the position from November 2012 to January 2014, was paid $14.50, and worked a 10:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. shift. Id. ¶¶ 39-42. Plaintiff [*4]  then expressed an interest in other positions. Id. ¶¶ 43.
2. Dispatch Supervisor
From January to September 2014, Plaintiff worked as a part-time package dispatch supervisor, a desk job in a well-lit office. Id. ¶¶ 45, 48-49. The job paid $16.49, with Plaintiff's typical shift being 3:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. Id. ¶¶ 46-47. The job required Plaintiff to go in the HUB (a UPS warehouse) to make last minute changes to delivery drivers' routes, although this duty was not listed in the dispatch supervisor job description. Id. ¶¶ 50-52; SS ¶ 431. On May 20, Plaintiff emailed his supervisors and HR expressing concerns that going into the HUB violated his doctor's restrictions. UF ¶ 53.
3. Package Center Supervisor
In September 2014, UPS moved Plaintiff to a new position as a part-time package center supervisor, a customer service role in a well-lit office. UF ¶¶ 54-55, 59. The position paid $16.49, with Plaintiff's shift being Tuesday through Saturday, 2:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. UF ¶¶ 60-63. After Plaintiff made various complaints, including having to work Saturdays alone and walk home in the dark, UPS changed his shift to Monday through Friday, 12:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Id. ¶¶ 62-64; SS ¶¶ 450-462.
Through [*5]  various emails and in-person conversations, Plaintiff requested going back to his prior shift times (10:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., or 3:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.) or moving his shift back thirty minutes (11:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) because it was dangerous for him to walk home after 5:30 p.m., when it was already dark. Id. ¶¶ 65, 68-70; SS ¶¶ 463-470. Supervisor Day denied Plaintiff's request. UF ¶ 71; SS ¶ 469-471; Borgen Decl. ¶ 28, Ex. 19.
On March 2, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a formal complaint of discrimination to California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, alleging he was subject to discrimination based on disability, denied a good faith interactive process, denied or forced to transfer, and denied reasonable accommodations. SS ¶ 473; Borgen Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. 64.
From September to November 2015, Plaintiff asked Supervisor Day if he could move his shift up thirty minutes because he had trouble getting home, as the days were getting shorter due to daylight savings time. SS ¶¶ 491-492. Day did not make the change. Id. ¶¶ 495-496.

C. Plaintiff Leaves UPS
On November 9, 2015, Plaintiff met with Supervisor Day and on-road supervisor Luis Calvillo to discuss Plaintiff's issues related to appropriate [*6]  dress, arriving at his scheduled start time, working every scheduled day, and working his entire 5.5-hour shift. UF ¶¶ 75-77; Dkt. 33-33, Declaration of Luis Calvillo ¶ 6, Ex. 17. Plaintiff again requested an adjustment to end his shift at 5:00 p.m. in order to travel home safely from work, but Day said, "No, you need to work the schedule I gave you," and that if Plaintiff didn't like it, he could quit. SS ¶¶ 505-515; Borgen Decl. ¶¶ 44-45. At the end of the meeting, Day told Plaintiff that if he left work early he would be considered terminated, disability or not. SS ¶ 517; Borgen Decl. ¶ 46.
After that meeting, Plaintiff left work before his shift was over and never returned. UF ¶ 79. On November 10 and 13, 2015, HR Manager Valdiviez sent Plaintiff text messages regarding his absence. Id. ¶¶ 80-81; Valdiviez Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 18. Plaintiff responded that he would report "early on Monday," but did not show up. Id. ¶¶ 82-83; Valdiviez Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 18.
On November 30, 2015, UPS sent Plaintiff a 3-day notice asking him to respond to the letter with documentation justifying his absence, or face disciplinary action, including discharge. UF ¶ 84; Valdiviez Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 19. On December 7, [*7]  after receiving nothing, UPS sent Plaintiff a voluntary separation letter terminating his employment for unexcused absences. Id. ¶ 85; Valdiviez Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 20. UPS sent Plaintiff a second 3-day notice on March 28, 2016, and after Plaintiff did not respond, on April 4, UPS sent another voluntary separation letter and officially terminated Plaintiff's employment. UF ¶¶ 86-88; Valdiviez Decl. ¶ 14-15, Exs. 22-23.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense — or the part of each claim or defense — on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "This burden is not a light one." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). But the moving party need not disprove the opposing party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Rather, if the moving party satisfies this burden, the party opposing the motion must set forth specific facts, through affidavits or admissible discovery materials, showing that there exists a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 323-24; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
The "mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly [*8]  supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of fact is a genuine issue if it reasonably can be resolved in favor of either party. Id. at 250-51. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury . . . could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [non-movant] is entitled to a verdict . . . ." Id. at 252. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. at 248.
"[A] district court is not entitled to weigh the evidence and resolve disputed underlying factual issues." Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Discrimination
Subsection 12940(a) of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940-12951, makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge an employee because of the employee's "physical disability" unless the employee, "because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1).
Under FEHA, discrimination can be established with either direct or indirect evidence. See [*9]  Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354-55, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). In cases without direct evidence, California courts interpreting FEHA apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework and other federal employment law principles. See id. Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case, which "requires the employee to show that he or she (1) suffered from a disability, (2) was otherwise qualified to do his or her job, and (3) was subjected to adverse employment action because of the disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 378, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). "The prima facie burden is light; the evidence necessary to sustain the burden is minimal." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010). If the Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence, sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact . . . that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355-56. "If the employer sustains this burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears," and the plaintiff must then show "the employer's proffered reasons as pretexts for discrimination, or [] offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive." Id.
1. Direct Evidence of Discriminatory Motive
"Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory [*10]  animus] without inference or presumption." Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Comments may constitute direct evidence of discrimination, see Metoyer v. Chassman, 504 F.3d 919, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2007), but "'statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself'—do not constitute direct evidence of decision makers' 'substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.'" Reid v. Google, Inc., 50 Cal. 4th 512, 536, 113 Cal. Rptr. 3d 327, 235 P.3d 988 (2010) (quoting Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring).
Plaintiff has failed to proffer direct evidence of disability discrimination. Several of Supervisor Day's comments regarding Plaintiff's disability were made more than a year prior and were "unrelated to the decisional process itself," Reid, 50 Cal. 4th at 536, while others are more accurately considered circumstantial because they require an inferential step to establish discrimination. For instance, it is not obvious that Day's comment that Plaintiff needed to "work his shift" directly reflects Day's allegedly discriminatory attitude toward Plaintiff. Compare Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221 (holding manager's statement that he "did not want to deal with another female after having dealt with" one female manager to be direct evidence).
Plaintiff's evidence of discrimination is properly characterized [*11]  as circumstantial, and thus the Court applies the McDonnell Douglas framework.
2. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
UPS contends Plaintiff's termination was unrelated to his disability. "[A]n employer has treated an employee differently 'because of' a disability when the disability is a substantial motivating reason for the employer's decision to subject the employee to an adverse employment action." Alamillo v. BNSF Railway Co., 869 F.3d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Wallace v. Cty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 128, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016)).
Plaintiff has stated a prima facie case of disability discrimination. UPS's argument, that Plaintiff was fired because he stopped showing up to work, and not because of his disability, is circular. Although UPS may have fired Plaintiff because of his absenteeism, Plaintiff alleges his absences were caused by his disability—specifically, his eye condition interfered with his ability to finish his scheduled shift because he could not safely walk home after dark—and that he was fired for that reason. See SS ¶¶ 456-459, 461, 468-470, 506-512, 519-520, 525-530; McMillan Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 34. A jury could reasonably find the requisite causal link between the Plaintiff's disability and his absenteeism and conclude that UPS terminated him because of that disability. See Humphrey v. Memorial Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001) (employee raised a triable [*12]  issue of fact that she was terminated because of her disability where her disability caused the absenteeism and tardiness for which she was fired); Norris v. Allied-Sysco Food Servs., Inc., 948 F.Supp. 1418, 1434 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (where employer stated in writing that reason it terminated plaintiff was her continuing unavailability for work and reasonable jury could have concluded she was unavailable for work because of her disability, a triable issue existed regarding whether plaintiff's disability was a motivating factor in employer's decision to terminate her).
3. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reasons
Under FEHA, "[i]t is the employer's honest belief in the stated reasons for firing an employee and not the objective truth or falsity of the underlying facts that is at issue in a discrimination case." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 436, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007).
UPS argues that it legitimately terminated Plaintiff because of absenteeism, but it is undisputed that his absenteeism occurred because of his disability. Plaintiff contends, and UPS does not dispute, that his eye condition rendered him legally blind and night blind, which made it unsafe for him to travel home in the dark. It is also undisputed that UPS was aware of Plaintiff's condition and the difficulties it posed for him in getting home. See, e.g., SS ¶¶ 456-457, [*13]  491-492; McMillan Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 34. Indeed, Supervisor Day was aware of Plaintiff's issues when he repeatedly denied Plaintiff's requests to end his shift at 5:00 p.m. instead of 5:30 p.m. SS ¶¶ 491-492, 505-512, 517.
"[C]onduct resulting from a disability is considered to be part of the disability, rather than a separate basis for termination." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139-40 (9th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff's absence was due to his disability and is considered part of the disability. By pointing to Plaintiff's absenteeism as the reason for his termination, UPS has all but conceded Plaintiff's disability was a motivating factor in its termination decision. See McInteer v. Ashley Distrib. Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1286 (C.D. Cal. 2014) ("By citing [plaintiff's] absences as a basis for termination, Defendants ipso facto cited his disability.").
The Ninth Circuit has addressed similar circumstances. In Humphrey, an employee suffered from OCD, which she claimed caused her to be chronically late or absent from work. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1134. Her employer terminated her and its "stated reason for Humphrey's termination was absenteeism and tardiness." Id. at 1139. However, the Circuit reasoned that the "link between disability and termination is particularly strong" where a "known disability [] leads to discharge for performance inadequacies resulting [*14]  from that disability," and held that "a jury could reasonably find the requisite causal link between a disability of OCD and Humphrey's absenteeism and conclude that [the employer] fired Humphrey because of her disability." Id. at 1140.
In Livingston, an employee suffered from a vision impairment that affected her ability to safely drive and walk outside after dark. Livingston, 388 Fed. Appx. 738, 739 (9th Cir. 2010). Livingston's supervisor initially granted her request to work a modified schedule to minimize night driving, but denied it the following year. Id. When Livingston refused to work her scheduled shift, she was fired. Id. Citing Humphrey, the court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the employer: "Because Livingston has presented evidence that her disability prevented her from completing her scheduled shift, and that she was fired for this reason, she has raised a triable issue of material fact that she was terminated because of her disability." Id. at 741-42.3
As in Humphrey and Livingston, there is undisputed evidence of a causal link between Plaintiff's disability and his absenteeism, and a jury could reasonably conclude that UPS fired Plaintiff because of his disability. UPS's firing of Plaintiff on the basis of absenteeism necessitated by his disability does not constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. UPS is not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.
UPS's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's discrimination claim.

B. Retaliation
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must show (1) he was engaged in protected activity, (2) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Raad v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1196-97 (9th Cir. 2003). The familiar burden-shifting framework applies to retaliation claims under FEHA. Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000).
UPS does not contest that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity when he (1) requested accommodations and (2) repeatedly complained about UPS's [*16]  failure to reasonably accommodate his disability, and that he suffered an adverse employment action. Instead, UPS seeks summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff has not shown a causal link between the protected activity and his termination and thus cannot establish a prima facie case or pretext.
"Essential to a causal link is evidence that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity." Cohen v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982). Unlike Title VII retaliation claims, the requisite causal link for retaliation claims under FEHA is not but-for causation, but rather a "substantial motivating factor." Alamo v. Practice Mgmt. Info. Corp., 219 Cal. App. 4th 466, 477, 161 Cal. Rptr. 3d 758 (2013).
It is undisputed Plaintiff repeatedly complained about his schedule, and requests to change it to accommodate his disability were repeatedly denied, including on November 9, 2015, Plaintiff's last day at UPS. See Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 507 (9th Cir. 2000) ("[W]hen adverse employment decisions are taken within a reasonable period of time after complaints of discrimination have been made, retaliatory intent may be inferred."). Similar to his disability claim, Plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue on the causal link between Plaintiff's repeated requests/complaints regarding accommodation and his termination.
UPS's Motion [*17]  is DENIED as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

C. Reasonable Accommodation & Interactive Process
1. Legal Standard for Subsections 12940(m) and (n)
Subsection 12940(m) of FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee" unless the accommodation would produce "undue hardship." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). "The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are (1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 373.
Under subsection 12940(n), "an employer must engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." Id. at 380. "Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n.22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). "Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party [*18]  who fails to participate in good faith." Id.
If a plaintiff has a known disability and is a qualified individual, an employer cannot prevail on summary judgment "unless it establishes through undisputed facts that . . . reasonable accommodation was offered and refused" or that it "did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000).
2. Analysis of Plaintiff's 12940(m) and (n) Claims
A factual dispute exists as to whether Plaintiff was offered a reasonable accommodation or whether the informal process broke down, and, if so, which party was responsible.
Plaintiff's initial shift in the package center supervisor role was Tuesday through Saturday, 2:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. UF ¶¶ 62-63. After his first or second week, Plaintiff emailed HR Supervisor Orencia regarding his concerns about working alone on Saturdays, and asked why in moving jobs his hours had changed to "ones I specifically said would force my unsafe travel to and from work due to my visual impairment." McMillan Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 18. Orencia discussed the matter with Supervisor Day and HR Manager Valdiviez, [*19]  with Day eventually adjusting Plaintiff's shift to Monday through Friday, 12:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., so that he "would be [at UPS] more in daylight." Id.; McMillan Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 70, Borgen Depo. 245:19-25, 246:1-24; Borgen Decl. ¶ 21.
Despite the shift adjustment, Plaintiff was still traveling home in the dark and asked Day to give him an earlier shift. Borgen Decl. ¶ 21. Day refused, and told Plaintiff, "This is the best shift you're getting and I don't want to hear you complain." Id. ¶ 22. Plaintiff then emailed Valdiviez alleging several disability-related complaints, including Day's refusal to assign Plaintiff an earlier shift. Borgen Decl. ¶ 25, Ex. 26. Plaintiff thereafter emailed Day, again asking for an earlier shift. Id. ¶ 28, Ex. 19. Day replied, "We have meet [sic] your accommodations and this is the best fit for you as well as UPS. We are in no way violating your restrictions[.]" Id. Plaintiff asked again, and Day responded, "Not being considered at this time." Id. From then until the next year, there is no evidence anyone from HR followed up with Plaintiff regarding his shift times.
It is undisputed Plaintiff's physician had not restricted his ability to work specific shifts. [*20]  It is also undisputed Plaintiff refused to return to his physician to request additional, shift-based restrictions when prompted by UPS HR. UF ¶ 74; Dkt. 33-31, Declaration of Jorge Parra (Parra Decl.) ¶ 5, Ex. 15; Id. ¶ 6. UPS contends these failures are fatal to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims.
It is also undisputed, however, that UPS was aware Plaintiff's physician had restricted him from working "varying shifts"4 or in dim light, and noted Plaintiff could not drive and was both legally blind and night blind. UF ¶ 27; Listi Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 5. Nor is it disputed that Plaintiff made repeated and specific complaints to UPS that ending his shift in the dark was unsafe due to his disability. Compare King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 444 (doctor's note necessary because employee had not "establish[ed] that he communicated his distress to his supervisors or made the kind of specific request for a modified work schedule required to trigger an employer's duty to provide accommodation"). Under these facts, a reasonable jury could find that FEHA obligated UPS to do more than simply tell Plaintiff to go back to his physician. See Livingston, 388 Fed. Appx. at 740-41 (collecting cases for the proposition that "an employer has a duty [*21]  to accommodate an employee's limitations in getting to and from work"); id. ("[Employer] had a duty to accommodate [employee's] inability to finish her scheduled shift, even though her disability did not affect her ability to function effectively [in the position].").
Allen v. Pacific Bell, 348 F.3d 1113 (9th Cir. 2003) is distinguishable. In Allen, the employee's physician had restricted the employee to sedentary positions and the employee later asked to be reassigned to his prior, non-sedentary position. Id. at 1115. Pursuant to company policy, the employer requested the employee submit medical documentation showing his physical condition had improved. Id. Because the employee failed to submit medical evidence, the Ninth Circuit concluded the employer had complied with its obligations under FEHA. Id. Unlike Allen, Plaintiff's request for a shift adjustment would not have required UPS to take actions inconsistent with the limitations placed by his physician.
The Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that UPS met its statutory duty to engage in a good faith interactive process. UPS's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims.

D. Failure to Prevent Discrimination
Under FEHA, it is an unlawful employment [*22]  practice for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Courts interpret a failure to prevent discrimination claim to be essentially derivative of a FEHA discrimination claim. See Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998). Because Plaintiff's FEHA claims survive summary judgment, UPS's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's failure to prevent discrimination claim.

E. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
UPS concedes that Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim rises and falls with his FEHA claim. Because Plaintiff has established triable issues of fact on his FEHA claim, UPS's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
UPS's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in its entirety.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
