Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
On September 19, 2022, Defendants Department of Homeland Security and Alejandro Mayorkas (collectively, "Defendants") filed a Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"). ECF No. 71. On November 17, 2022, Plaintiff [*2]  Michael A. Rehfeldt ("Plaintiff") filed an Opposition to the Motion ("Opposition"). ECF No. 91. On November 21, 2022, Defendants filed their Reply. ECF No. 93.
The Court held a hearing on the Motion on December 7, 2022. ECF No. 95. Edric Ming-Kai Ching, Esq., appeared on behalf of Defendants. David Norken, Esq., Elbridge Zenichi Smith, Esq., Nicole M. Diaz, Esq., and Rachel L. Petro, Esq., appeared on behalf of Plaintiff. After carefully considering the Motion, applicable law, the record in this case, and arguments of counsel, the Court GRANTS the Motion for the reasons set forth below.
BACKGROUND
I. Factual Background
The following facts are undisputed. Plaintiff began working as a Criminal Research Specialist for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (the "Agency") in 2008 at the Honolulu International Airport ("Airport"), assisting special agents with criminal and alien casework. ECF No. 72, Defendants' Concise Statement of Facts ("Defs. CSF") ¶ 1. The Agency is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
In March of 2011, Deputy Special Agent in Charge Marjorie Thompson ("DSAC Thompson") informed Plaintiff that he was needed to work on a priority data mining immigration [*3]  case. Defs. CSF ¶ 2; ECF No. 71-1 at 10. With this new assignment, on April 22, 2011, Plaintiff was relocated to office 110 in 595 Ala Moana Boulevard (the "Main Building") so that he could be co-located with the associated intelligence group, for efficiency and to facilitate communication. Defs. CSF ¶ 2; ECF No. 72-4 at 6. Upon arrival, Plaintiff reported directly to Supervisory Special Agent James Hrysyzen ("SSA Hrysyzen") and was assigned to review and scan approximately 400 immigration case files ("A-files"). Defs. CSF ¶ 3.
On April 29, 2011, SSA Hrysyzen received a text message that Plaintiff was admitted to Queen's Medical Center for an unknown viral infection. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 10, 72-7 at 2. Plaintiff was incapacitated from April 27, 2011, to May 6, 2011, due to "fever, hospitalization." ECF Nos. 72-8 at 2. Plaintiff submitted a request for sick leave from May 12, 2011, to May 20, 2011, based on "hospitalization for abdominal infection." ECF No. 72-9 at 3. Plaintiff was hospitalized again in late September 2011, though his physicians were unable to find the cause of his health problems. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 11, 72-6 at 15; see also Defs. CSF ¶ 4.
In December 2011, Plaintiff notified [*4]  Special Agent in Charge Wayne Wills ("SAC Wills") that Plaintiff's physician opined that it was possible "something in [his] work environment triggered those episodes." ECF No. 72-11 at 2; see also Defs. CSF ¶ 5. SAC Wills, thereafter, contacted Federal Occupational Health ("FOH") to expedite air quality testing at the building and asked that the A-files be examined. ECF No. 72-10 at 2-3.
On December 28, 2011, Nira Cooray ("Cooray"), an industrial hygienist retained by FOH, arrived to conduct the on-site investigation. Defs. CSF ¶ 6; ECF 71-1 at 12. After interviewing occupants of each office, including Plaintiff, Cooray recommended that Plaintiff not work on the A-files. Defs. CSF ¶ 6; ECF No. 72-6 at 6. SSA Hrysyzen then removed the A-files from Plaintiff's office. Defs. CSF ¶ 6; ECF No. 72-6 at 6. In February 2012, agreeing with Cooray's recommendation, SSA Hrysyzen removed Plaintiff's scanner from Plaintiff's office to prevent him from scanning A-files. Defs. CSF ¶ 7; ECF Nos. 72-13 at 6, 72-14 at 2-3. SSA Hrysyzen then notified U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration stated that no one was to touch the A-files until tests [*5]  were conducted. Defs. CSF ¶ 7; ECF Nos. 72-13 at 6, 72-14 at 2-3. Cooray finished up her testing on March 5, 2012. Defs. CSF ¶ 8; ECF No. 71-1 at 12.
A. FOH Reports
On March 15, 2012, SAC Wills received a draft of the Phase 1 FOH Report ("Draft Phase 1 Report"). Defs. CSF ¶ 10. The Draft Phase 1 Report recommended that: (1) Plaintiff not work on the A-files; (2) the Agency clean the office and implement a cleaning regimen for the office and air conditioners; and (3) the Agency conduct sample testing for the A-files. Defs. CSF ¶ 10; ECF No 72-12 at 13-14. A redacted version of the Draft Phase 1 Report was made available to all employees in mid-April 2012. Defs. CSF ¶ 11; ECF No. 72-15 at 11-12. Pursuant to the Draft Phase 1 Report, on April 26, 2012, the air-conditioning units for all Agency employees in the Main Building, including the unit in Plaintiff's office, were serviced. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 13, 72-19 at 2.
Around June 20, 2012, SAC Wills obtained a copy of the Phase 2 FOH Report ("Phase 2 Report"), which indicated that: (1) Plaintiff's medical history indicated that Plaintiff was allergic to iodine, but that a clinical correlation was necessary to determine whether the presence of [*6]  iodine "can actually elicit symptoms experienced by the employee"; (2) the carpets had been steam cleaned; and (3) Plaintiff had not been working on the A-files since the Phase 1 Report investigation. Defs. CSF ¶ 13; ECF No. 72-12 at 25, 28, 30-31. The Phase 2 Report recommended that the Agency redefine Plaintiff's activities so that he would not be in contact with the A-files, as iodine might have been present in some of the papers. ECF No. 71-12 at 25-26. The Phase 2 Report also included recommendations about cleaning offices and implementing systemic cleaning. Id.
In a letter dated June 15, 2012, Plaintiff's doctor, Dr. Cyril Goshima ("Dr. Goshima"), noted that there may be a connection between Plaintiff's illness and his work environment, and stated that Plaintiff would remain on sick leave until Dr. Goshima received the Phase 2 Report. ECF No. 72-20 at 2. In a disability certificate dated June 23, 2012, Dr. Goshima, noted that Plaintiff was incapacitated and unable to work from June 11, 2012, to June 24, 2012, due to respiratory insufficiency. ECF No. 72-8 at 2. The disability certificate also indicated that, after June 24, 2012, Plaintiff was permitted to return to work for up [*7]  to four hours per day. Id. Plaintiff received a copy of the Phase 2 Report on July 3, 2012. Defs. CSF ¶ 16.
B. Plaintiff's Requests for Accommodation
Around June 25, 2012, Plaintiff made a verbal request to DSAC Thompson to be relocated back to the Airport, which DSAC Thompson declined because management wanted to keep Plaintiff's work group together for collaboration purposes. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 14, 72-5 at 4, 6. DSAC Thompson also communicated to Plaintiff that the Agency could identify another position at a different location for Plaintiff if it was determined that the Main Building was causing his health issues. ECF No. 72-5 at 7. Plaintiff also made a request for Office of Workers' Compensation benefits, which was initially denied. Defs. CSF ¶ 15; ECF No. 73-10. This denial was later vacated, and Plaintiff received partial benefits. Defs. CSF ¶ 15; ECF No. 73-11.
In a letter dated July 19, 2012, and a disability certificate dated July 24, 2012, Dr. Goshima affirmatively linked Plaintiff's health problems to his work environment. Defs. CSF ¶ 17; ECF Nos. 72-8 at 2, 72-23 at 2. In a July 30, 2012 letter ("07/30/2012 Letter"), Plaintiff's counsel requested that Plaintiff be allowed to [*8]  work remotely for the time being, until FOH could reinspect Plaintiff's work environment in the Main Building. ECF No. 72-24 at 3. In a letter dated August 2, 2012, Dr. Goshima noted that Plaintiff could not be released to his work environment until the conditions were eliminated or reduced. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 15, 72-25 at 3. Dr. Goshima also stated that Plaintiff could return to his full duties in an alternative non-toxic environment, such as working from home or another building. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 15, 72-25 at 3.
In a letter dated August 3, 2012 ("08/03/2012 Letter"), SAC Wills denied Plaintiff's request to work remotely because Plaintiff's position included handling confidential information, which required Plaintiff to be in a secure facility. ECF No. 72-26 at 3. SAC Wills was also concerned that working from home would cause Plaintiff to lose interpersonal contact and the ability to collaborate. Id. This letter also stated that Plaintiff could wear protective equipment if he needed to work with the A-files and use various types of leave. Id. at 2-3. In addition, the letter stated that the recommendations of the Phase 2 Report were being addressed and SAC Wills alerted Reasonable Accommodations [*9]  Coordinator Tina Plunkett. Id. at 3.
In a Reasonable Accommodation form dated August 10, 2012, Plaintiff requested to be relocated to his old office at the Airport "or at a newer building located at the same 595 Ala Moana address." ECF No. 72-27 at 3; see also Defs. CSF ¶ 20. That same day, Plaintiff also submitted a Voluntary Leave Transfer Program ("VLTP") application, on which Plaintiff noted that he had 146 hours of annual leave and 9 hours of sick leave remaining. ECF No. 72-29 at 3. DSAC Thompson advised SAC Wills to deny Plaintiff's VLTP application on the grounds that Plaintiff did not have a qualifying medical emergency or that Plaintiff had not yet exhausted his unused accrued leave. ECF No. 72-30 at 2. On August 14, 2012, Plaintiff initiated counseling at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). ECF Nos. 71-1 at 23, 72-6 at 5, 92-1.
C. Plaintiff's Relocation to the Main Building's Annex and Fusion Center
On August 17, 2012, the Agency granted Plaintiff's accommodation request and moved Plaintiff to the Main Building's annex on August 20, 2012. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 16, 72-6 at 4. DSAC Thompson cleaned Plaintiff's cubicle before Plaintiff's transfer. ECF No. 72-5 at [*10]  5. In a letter dated November 9, 2012 ("11/09/2012 Letter"), Dr. Goshima stated that Plaintiff's symptoms had subsided and that Plaintiff could not return to his original office until the area was deemed non-toxic. Defs. CSF ¶ 22; ECF No. 72-31 at 7. Plaintiff's asthma worsened while in the annex, but he did not inform management. Defs. CSF ¶ 23; ECF No. 72-4 at 7.
A report dated December 21, 2012 ("12/21/2012 Report"), concluded that the Agency had implemented the recommendations in the Phase 2 Report. ECF No. 72-12 at 35-36. In February 2013, Cooray conducted another inspection after other employees complained of alleged hazards, but she was unable to state whether their issues were caused by the work environment. Defs. CSF ¶ 27. In a letter dated February 15, 2013, SAC Wills informed Plaintiff's counsel that the 12/21/2012 Report supported Plaintiff's return to his former office in the Main Building. Defs. CSF ¶ 25; ECF No. 72-33 at 2.
In an email dated March 1, 2013, Plaintiff notified SAC Wills that: (1) Plaintiff inspected his former office in the Main Building, and it appeared clean, (2) Dr. Goshima informed Plaintiff it was reasonable for him to return to his former office, and [*11]  (3) Plaintiff was ready to return to his former office. ECF No. 71-1 at 18, 72-34 at 3. That same day, Plaintiff returned to his former office. Defs. CSF ¶ 26; ECF No. 71-1 at 17.
Around May or June 2013, Plaintiff began to develop a cough, but he did not inform management. ECF No. 72-4 at 8. It was not until February 4, 2014, that Plaintiff notified the Agency of Plaintiff's need for further accommodation, when Plaintiff's counsel and doctors made a request. Defs. CSF ¶ 28; ECF Nos. 72-4 at 8, 73-6 at 2, 73-7 at 2, 73-8 at 2. Plaintiff was thereafter reassigned to an office at the Fusion Center, located at 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, where Plaintiff stayed until his retirement in December 2016. Defs. CSF ¶ 31; ECF Nos. 71-1 at 20, 72-6 at 4-5, 73-4 at 2.
II. Procedural Background
On April 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants for unlawful employment discrimination. ECF No. 1. In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts three causes of action: (1) violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for subjecting Plaintiff to a hostile work environment based on reprisal ("Count I"); (2) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for failure to failure to provide reasonable accommodation ("Count II"); and (3) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for subjection [*12]  Plaintiff to a hostile work environment for unlawful employment discrimination based on disability ("Count III"). ECF No. 8 at ¶ 86-104. On September 19, 2022, Defendants filed the instant Motion. ECF No. 71.
LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Accordingly, this Court shall grant summary judgment if "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "A fact is material if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law." Miller v. Glenn Miller Prods., Inc., 454 F.3d 975, 987 (9th Cir. 2006).
The moving party bears the initial burden of clearly establishing the lack of any triable issue of fact by the record properly before the court and supporting evidentiary material must be construed most favorably to the non-moving party. Puletasi v. Wills, CIVIL NO. 05-00291 HG-KSC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107275, 2006 WL 8451351, at *3 (D. Haw. Nov. 21, 2016) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Summary judgment must be entered if non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case." Kim v. Potter, 474 F. Supp. 2d 1175, at 1184-85 (D. Haw. 2007) (citing Broussard v. Univ. of Cal. At Berkeley, 192 F.3d 1252, 1258 (9th Cir. 1999)) (citations omitted).
DISCUSSION
I. Defendant's [*13]  Facts are Deemed Admitted
Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(e), a party opposing a motion for summary judgment must submit a concise statement that admits or disputes each fact set forth in the movant's concise statement. Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(g), "[f]or purposes of a motion for summary judgment, material facts set forth in a movant's concise statement will be deemed admitted unless controverted by a separate concise statement of the opposing party."
Plaintiffs filed a Concise Statement of Facts in support of their Opposition. ECF No. 92. Plaintiffs' Concise Statement of Facts, however, does not indicate whether Plaintiffs admit or dispute any of the facts asserted by Defendant. The Court thus deems admitted the facts set forth in Defendant's Concise Statement of Facts, pursuant to Local Rule 56(g).
II. Count I and Count III
In his Opposition, Plaintiff withdraws Count I and Count III. ECF No. 91-1 at 8, 31. Local Rule 7.8 requires parties to meet and confer before the filing of any motion to thoroughly discuss the substance of such contemplated motion and any potential resolution.
In waiting until after the Local Rule 7.8 conference to withdraw claims in his Opposition—i.e., after Defendants expended time and expense to file the Motion as to all claims—Plaintiff violated [*14]  the spirit of Local Rule 7.8. "The entire purpose of the Rule 7.8 conference is to avoid the need for litigation over claims that will be conceded." Dolan v. Aero Micronesia, CIVIL NO. 19-00671 JAO-KJM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177753, 2020 WL 5790379, at *2 (D. Haw. Sept. 28, 2020). These claims should have been withdrawn or otherwise resolved before the filing of this Motion.
In light of Plaintiff's abandonment of Counts I and III, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in Defendants' favor on these claims. The Court now considers Plaintiff's sole remaining claim, Count II—that Defendants denied him reasonable accommodations as a qualified individual with a disability under The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 ("ADA"). ECF No. 8 at 19.
III. Count II
A. Plaintiff's Requests for Accommodation Before June 29, 2012 are Time-Barred
Plaintiff argues that there is a genuine dispute about whether the Agency was required to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodation as of April 2011. ECF No. 91-1 at 24. The Court finds, however, that requests for accommodation prior to June 29, 2012 are time-barred.
The Rehabilitation Act requires the federal government to provide reasonable accommodations for an employee's disability. Puletasi, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107275, 2006 WL 8451351 at *7. Title I of the ADA governs when determining whether a federal agency has reasonably accommodated the known physical or mental limitations of a disabled employee. Id.
To bring a claim [*15]  under the Rehabilitation Act, a federal employee must first exhaust administrative remedies. Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir. 2003). Federal regulations require aggrieved persons to consult an EEOC Counselor within 45 days of the date of the alleged discriminatory matter to try to informally resolve the matter. Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)). Failure to comply with this regulation is fatal to an employee's discrimination claim, and recovery for discrete acts of discrimination occurring outside the statutory time period will be precluded. Id. (citing Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1105 (9th Cir. 2002)); Jamile v. Island Movers, Inc., CIVIL NO. 16-00196 SOM-KJM, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *6 (D. Haw. Apr. 7, 2017).
Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to accommodate Plaintiff between April 2011 and August 20, 2012. ECF No. 91-1 at 10. Here, the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff did not contact an EEOC Counselor until August 14, 2012. ECF Nos. 71-1 at 23, 72-6 at 5, 92-1. Given the 45-day requirement under the regulations, requests for accommodation that occurred prior to June 29, 2012 are untimely. The Court will thus only consider Plaintiff's claim regarding facts that occurred after June 29, 2012.
B. Defendants are Entitled Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's Claim to the Extent it is Based on Events Occurring on or After June 29, 2012
Under the Rehabilitation Act, a public entity must "make reasonable modifications in policies, [*16]  practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability[.]" Kim, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 1190 (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)). In other words, a government employer "has the affirmative duty to provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of their employees." Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(B)(5)(A)) (citations omitted). When analyzing reasonable accommodation claims, the court first considers whether the employee is a person with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. Id. (citing Coons v. Sec'y of the United States Dep't of the Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir. 2004)).
Once an employer is aware of the need for accommodation, the ADA requires the employer to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate and reasonable accommodations. Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); see Jamile, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *3. "The interactive process requires: '(1) direct communication between the employer and the employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective.'" Jamile, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *3 (quoting Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2001)). If an accommodation is rendered ineffective, the employer should continue the interactive process to find an alternative reasonable accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139 (stating, [*17]  "the duty to accommodate is a continuing duty that is not exhausted by one effort") (citing McAlindin v. Cnty. of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1237 (9th Cir. 1999)).
The court then considers whether the employee was provided some reasonable accommodation. In considering when an accommodation was reasonable, the court "undertakes a fact-specific, individualized analysis of the disabled individual's circumstances and the accommodations that might allow [the employee] to meet the job's standards." Id. (citing Wong v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 192 F.3d 807, 818 (9th Cir. 2002)). "An employer need only provide a reasonable accommodation, not necessarily the accommodation that the employee requests or prefers." Jamile, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *4 (citing Zivkovic, 302 F.3d at 1089).
A reasonable accommodation must enable the employee to perform the duties of the position. Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B) (defining "reasonable accommodation" as "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position")).
A plaintiff-employee has the initial burden of producing evidence sufficient to make at least a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation was possible. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1191 (citing Buckingham v. U.S., 998 F.2d 735, 739-40 (9th Cir.1993)). If the plaintiff fulfills [*18]  that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant-employer to produce rebuttal evidence that the requested accommodation was not possible, was unreasonable, or would be an undue burden. Id. (citations omitted).
1. Plaintiff Has a Disability as Defined by the ADA
The ADA defines a disability as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(a). Major life activities include activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. Kim, 474 F. Supp. 2d at 1188 (citing Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002)).
There is no dispute that Plaintiff has a disability. Plaintiff has shown that his asthma and allergies affected major life activities, such as walking, carrying heavy items, doing household chores, working, and his mental comprehension. ECF No. 92-4 at 3. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has disability as defined by the ADA.
2. The Agency Engaged in the Interactive Process with Plaintiff and Provided Reasonable Accommodation
The burden is on Plaintiff to show that he was not provided a reasonable accommodation and that a reasonable accommodation was possible. As the Court previously stated herein, any request for accommodation made before June 29, 2012, is time-barred. The Court analyzes [*19]  Plaintiff's requests for accommodation on or after June 29, 2012, in turn below.
a. Plaintiff's July 30, 2012 Letter Request
Plaintiff argues that there is a genuine dispute about whether the Agency engaged in the interactive process regarding Plaintiff 07/30/2012 Letter request. ECF No. 91-1 at 18. The Agency communicated with Plaintiff as intended by the interactive process in response to Plaintiff's 07/30/2012 Letter requesting remote work. Cf. Jamile, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *5 (finding that the employer did not engage in the interactive process when they failed to reply to the employee's request for accommodation nor offer the employee accommodations provided to other employees).
In the 08/03/2012 Letter, SAC Wills denied Plaintiff's request and posed alternative accommodations, including Plaintiff wearing protective gear or using various types of leave. ECF No. 72-26 at 3. The fact that SAC Wills did not provide the accommodation that Plaintiff preferred does not mean Plaintiff was not provided a reasonable accommodation. See Jamile, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53653, 2017 WL 1348507, at *4.
Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his request to work remotely was a reasonable accommodation. Due to the confidential and classified nature of his work, Plaintiff needed [*20]  to be in a secure facility and co-located with the associated intelligence group. ECF No. 72-26 at 3. Working remotely would not have allowed Plaintiff to meet the standards of his job. The Court thus finds that the Agency engaged in the interactive process and Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show that working remotely was a possible reasonable accommodation.
b. Plaintiff's VLTP Request
Plaintiff argues that there is a genuine dispute about whether the Agency could have accommodated Plaintiff by approving his request to participate in VLTP. ECF No. 91-1 at 18-20. In their Reply, Defendants attach a declaration from Supervisory Human Resources Specialist for the Department of Homeland Security Lena Garcia ("HRS Garcia"). ECF No. 93-1. HRS Garcia states that "the Screening Committee for VLTP applications denies applications if the applicant has more than 80 hours of paid leave available." Id. at 2.
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not produced evidence sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether he qualified for VLTP and that approving his VLTP application would have been a reasonable accommodation. At the time of his application, Plaintiff had 146 hours of annual [*21]  leave and 9 hours of sick leave. ECF No. 72-29 at 3. Based on the undisputed statements in HRS Garcia's declaration, the Court finds that Plaintiff's VLTP application would have been denied. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to show that approving Plaintiff's VLTP application would have been a possible reasonable accommodation.
c. Plaintiff's Requests for Relocation
i. Annex
Plaintiff argues that there is a genuine dispute about whether the Agency was aware that the annex was not an effective accommodation. ECF No. 91-1 at 26. Plaintiff supports his argument with a declaration from Administrative Officer Marjorie Rodrigues ("AO Rodrigues") and testimony from SSA Hrysyzen. Id. at 26-28. AO Rodrigues stated in her declaration that she informed SAC Wills about her concerns that the annex was filthy and that she told her first-line supervisor, Deputy Special Agent in Charge Frank Cabbadu, that Plaintiff was working in a filthy environment and she was concerned it would affect his health. ECF No. 92-10 at 3-4. SSA Hrysyzen stated awareness about Plaintiffs' problems with the annex as to the cleanliness. ECF No. 92-8 at 8.
Although the Agency was aware that the annex was dirty, this does not demonstrate [*22]  the Agency knew of Plaintiff's physical limitations while in the annex. The Agency believed the annex to be in better condition than the Main Building—AO Rodrigues states that SAC Wills told her that he, "knew the annex was dirty, but it wasn't as bad as the Main Building." ECF No. 92-10 at 4. Additionally, Dr. Goshima's 11/09/2012 Letter informed the Agency that Plaintiff's symptoms subsided while Plaintiff was at the annex. ECF No. 72-31 at 7.
Furthermore, Plaintiff, himself, requested to be relocated to "a newer building located at the same 595 Ala Moana address" on his Reasonable Accommodation form. ECF No. 72-27 at 3. Although Plaintiff now argues that the annex was an ineffective accommodation, Plaintiff never notified the Agency, nor did the Agency have reason to know, that Plaintiff's disability worsened in the annex. The Court finds that the Agency was not aware of Plaintiff's physical limitations while in the annex and thus was not aware of Plaintiff's need for further accommodation.
ii. Fusion Center
The Agency provided reasonable accommodation in response to Plaintiff's February 2014 request to relocate. When the Agency received notice that Plaintiff's health issues continued [*23]  in the Main Building, the Agency promptly relocated Plaintiff to the Fusion Center when a position for an intelligence resource became available. Defs. CSF ¶ 28; ECF Nos. 72-6 at 4-5, 73-4 at 2. Plaintiff does not dispute that relocation to the Fusion Center was an effective accommodation. ECF No. 91-1 at 30, fn. 12.
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden in making a facial showing that the Agency failed to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodation. There is no material issue of fact as to the reasonable accommodation offered by the Agency.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 71).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, December 22, 2022.
