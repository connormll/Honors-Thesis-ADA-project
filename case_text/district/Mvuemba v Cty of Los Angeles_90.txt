ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION [34]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Omoyi Mvuemba ("Mvuemba") filed his First Amended Complaint ("FAC") against Defendant County of Los Angeles (the "County") alleging violations of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. (See ECF No. 11 ["FAC"].) Pending before the Court is the County's Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication. (ECF No. 34.) Mvuemba filed an Opposition (ECF No. 35), and the County filed a Reply (ECF No. 43). Having considered the record in this case, applicable law, oral argument, and the parties' briefs, the Court GRANTS the County's Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication. (ECF No. 34.)

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
This dispute arises from the [*2]  County's alleged failure to provide Mvuemba with reasonable disability accommodations for a spinal condition. (FAC ¶¶ 2, 15.) Mvuemba began his employment with the County in 2004 as a Medical Case Worker for the Department of Mental Health. (ECF Nos. 34-17, 36 ["UF"] ¶ 2.)1 Since 2008, Mvuemba suffers from a chronic spinal health condition which includes "cervical radiculitis, lumbar spasms, and scoliosis." (UF ¶ 3.) In 2011, Mvuemba aggravated his condition and his subsequent requests for reasonable disability accommodations are what give rise to this dispute. (Id.)

A. Requests for Special Accommodations

1. First Request—January 2011
On January 7, 2011, Mvuemba submitted a request to his supervisors, Patricia Nwaekeke and Reina Turner, to stand and walk for five minutes out of each hour. (UF ¶ 15.) The request was based on a written note from Mvuemba's treating physician, Dr. Rodriguez, who advised against "prolonged sitting." (UF ¶ 17.) The County contends that it "accommodated" the request and documented the approval in writing (Lara Decl. ¶¶ 6-15; Turner Decl. ¶ 15; Def. Ex. BB), while Mvuemba contends that not only was the request denied, but Turner warned that his pay would [*3]  be docked and withheld if he choose to stand and walk for five minutes every hour (Mvuemba Dep. 278:18-280:20, Sept. 17, 2014). He also contends that he never saw the County's alleged documentation approving of his reasonable accommodation requests and his request for an "Interactive Process Meeting" ("IPM") to discuss the disability accommodation was denied. (Id.)
The County contends that Mvuemba then proceeded to stand and walk for five minutes of every hour and his pay was never reduced. (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 16-17; Lara Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.) Mvuemba claims that he did not stand every hour because he "was afraid of being punished for following [his] doctor's orders, as had been threatened," and he only stood when he could no longer tolerate the pain. (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 9.)
On August 12, 2011, Mvuemba sent an e-mail to a County official complaining that changes made to his work schedule interfered with his previously approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 3; see Part II.C.2.) Mvuemba sent an August 23, 2011, e-mail to Nwaekeke complaining that she violated federal health laws by publishing his workers compensation information during a meeting. (Mvuemba [*4]  Decl. ¶ 5.) On September 22, 2011, Mvuemba sent an e-mail to a County official claiming that his supervisors forced him to sit next to hostile co-workers, which was contrary to the recommendations from his doctors. (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 3.)
On October 13, 2011, Mvuemba's requested an alternate work schedule and the County held an IPM that same day to discuss the request, yet denied it. (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 34.) A similar request was also denied in November. (Id.) Mvuemba sent a November 9, 2011, e-mail to a County official claiming that he was being singled out and treated differently, but provided no examples. (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 6.)

2. Second Request—December 2011
In December 2011, Mvuemba submitted a new medical note from Dr. Rodriguez recommending Mvuemba stand five minutes every hour. (Mvuemba Dep. 291:15-293:12.) Mvuemba contends that Turner instructed him to not follow the recommendation and threatened to dock his pay if he followed it. (Id.) On December 9, 2011, Mvuemba was placed on "temporary total disability" ("TTD") at the request of Dr. Capen, and remained out of work until February 6, 2012. (UF ¶ 43.)

3. Third Request—February 2012
On February 8, 2012, Mvuemba submitted another request [*5]  for reasonable accommodations. (UF ¶ 23.) He requested the following: (1) authorization to stand and stretch for five minutes out of each hour; (2) limited the gripping, grasping, and squeezing of the right hand; (3) assistance regarding relocation to a separate unit; and (4) a change in work schedule from full-time to 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., four days a week. (Id.) This request was supported by a note from a physician assistant, M. Jabeen, that recommended Mvuemba "stretch" for five minutes every hour and "[n]o repetitive/prolonged typing/writing, fine manipulation, pinching/squeezing, gripping motion." (UF ¶¶ 25, 30.)
That same day, Mvuemba's supervisors, Nwaekeke and Turner, held an IPM with the County's head personnel technician, Rachel Buitrago, to discuss the requests for reasonable accommodation. (UF ¶ 24.) Following the IPM, the County prepared a "Work Hardening Modified Agreement" ("WHMA") which stated that Mvuemba "[w]ill be allowed 5 min. every hour to stretch." (UF ¶¶ 27-28.) The WHMA did not mention gripping and grasping, but that request was discussed, and Nwaekeke and Turner verbally notified Mvuemba that he should "self-monitor" his gripping as requested. (UF ¶¶ 31-32.) [*6]  The WHMA was signed by Nwaekeke and Mvuemba. (UF ¶ 27.) Mvuemba, however, claims that his gripping request was not accommodated, and the County failed to follow-up with Drs. Capen and Baker to seek clarification, as promised. (Mvuemba Dep. 394.)2 Mvuemba did not make any verbal or written request at the IPM regarding relocation to a separate unit, nor did he provide any medical note to support the request. (UF ¶¶ 35, 38.) The County did accommodate Mvuemba's work hours request, and Mvuemba was notified that under California law, he was only entitled to a lunch break if he worked more than five hours. (UF ¶¶ 41-42.)
Following the February 8 IPM, Mvuemba worked one day—February 13—and then did not return to work until October 22, 2012. (UF ¶ 44.) The County claims that Mvuemba's doctors cleared him to return to work on February 22, 2012, yet Mvuemba claims that he was rendered temporarily disabled from February 22 through October 22, 2012. (Def. Ex. SS.)
On February 27, 2012, while out on TTD, Mvuemba was placed on a six-month "Plan for Individual Improvement" ("PII"). (UF ¶ 135.) The purpose of the PII was to closely monitor and evaluate Mvuemba's performance "to determine whether [he] [*7]  achieved and sustained improvement[.]" (UF ¶ 138.) The County claims that this was imposed as a result of Mvuemba's unsatisfactory conduct and performance at work, while Mvuemba claims it was done in retaliation against his disability accommodation requests. See supra Part II.B (discussing Mvuemba's disciplinary record at work).

4. Fourth Request—October 2012
When Mvuemba returned to work October 22, 2012, he submitted the following reasonable accommodation requests to his supervisors: (1) be provided an ergonomic work station; (2) be relocated to a different facility; (3) be assigned to different supervisors at a different unit, pending relocation; (4) limit the amount of gripping, grasping, and squeezing by his right hand; (5) be allowed to stand and stretch for five minutes each hour; and (6) change his work schedule from full-time to 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., four days a week. (UF ¶ 47.) Mvuemba submitted a note from Dr. Capen recommending an ergonomic workstation, a "new supervisor/unit," and "limit[ed] gripping, grasping and squeezing." (UF ¶¶ 45, 50, 67, 71.) The County held an IPM that same day to consider the requests. (UF ¶ 48.) The IPM meeting notes indicate that Mvuemba was [*8]  approved for an ergonomic work station, would be "temporarily assigned a new unit and new supervisor," and the County would seek further clarification from Dr. Capen regarding the gripping. (UF ¶¶ 51, 59, 67, 72.) IPM notes indicate that Mvuemba was instructed to self-monitor his limited gripping, grasping, and squeezing." (UF ¶¶ 74-75.) Mvuemba did not make a request to stand and stretch for five minutes each hour during the IPM. (UF ¶ 77.)
Despite the County's policy of not transferring employees who are on a PII (UF ¶ 66), Mvuemba was transferred that day to a new unit with new supervisors—Kecia Coker and Lise Ruiz— and proceeded to work part time for several days (UF ¶ 45). The County submitted a request for an ergonomic workstation on October 30, 2012. (UF ¶ 52.) On November 8, 2012, the parties prepared and signed a "Work Hardening Transitional Assignment Agreement" ("WHTAA"), which stated: "Ergonomic evaluation is in the process of being scheduled." (UF ¶¶ 53-54.) The ergonomic evaluation was conducted by a contractor on November 13, 2012, and a recommendation was provided to the County—the equipment was delivered January 13, 2014. (UF ¶¶ 55-56, 57.)

5. Fifth Request—November [*9]  2012
On November 1, 2012, Mvuemba submitted a medical note from Dr. Capen which requested the County "move [Mvuemba] to another facility." (UF ¶ 60.) The County's internal records indicate that it would "seek clarification regarding the restriction of moving to another facility," and several attempts to contact Dr. Capen's office failed because Dr. Capen never returned the County's calls. (UF ¶¶ 61-62.) The County's human resources department determined that relocation to a new facility was not reasonable and would constitute an undue hardship for the County because the County did not have another facility that would meet Mvuemba's physical work restrictions and limitations. (UF ¶¶ 64-66.) The County's internal procedures preclude transferring an employee to a new facility when they are on a PII. (UF ¶ 66.) The County continued attempts to contact Dr. Capen up until Mvuemba was placed on TTD for the last time. (UF ¶ 63.)

6. Complaint Made Under the County's Policy of Equity
The County Intake Specialist Unit ("CISU") is responsible for conducting an initial investigation of any complaint by a County employee alleging a potential violation of the County's "Policy of Equity" ("POE"). (UF [*10]  ¶ 4.) If the CISU determines that there was a potential violation of the POE, the matter is referred to the County Equity Oversight Investigation Unit ("CEIU"), which then presents its findings to the County Equity Oversight Panel ("CEOP"). (UF ¶¶ 5-6.) The CEOP is an independent oversight body which reviews investigations and makes recommendations to the County's department heads. (UF ¶ 7.) The POE states that the "CEOP shall receive a thorough briefing from and have the opportunity to question the CEIU investigator(s) who handled the investigation." (UF ¶ 11.)
In November 2012, Mvuemba made a complaint to the County under the POE alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. (UF ¶ 9.) Mvuemba later met with CEIU investigator Chequita Gladney. (Id.) Gladney's supervisor, Crystal Lewis, then presented the investigation findings to the CEOP. (UF ¶ 10.) The CISU never sent a "Letter of Determination" to Mvuemba. (UF ¶ 13.) The County asserts that it was not required to send Mvuemba a letter (Gladney Decl. ¶ 11), while Mvuemba claims that a letter was required under the POE provision which states the following: "When required the involved Department shall issue all required administrative [*11]  action letters to the subject or, where appropriate, inform the subject that the complaint was founded, unfounded or unresolved. At the same time, the involved Department shall issue a letter to the complainant indicating the status of administrative action." (Def. Ex. B at 69.)

7. Final Follow-up
On November 21, 2012, the County sent Mvuemba an "Interactive Process Meeting Follow-Up Letter" which addressed the accommodations discussed and provided as a result of the October 22 meeting. (UF ¶ 58.) On December 18, 2012, Dr. Barker declared Mvuemba TTD, and Mvuemba never returned to work. (UF ¶ 45.)

B. Disciplinary Actions

1. The County's Disciplinary Policy
The County utilizes a "progressive discipline" process, which involves escalating stages of discipline based on the work or behavior deficiencies. (UF ¶ 79.) The first stage of discipline is a verbal warning, followed by a "Confirmation of Counseling Memorandum," and then a "Letter of Warning." (UF ¶¶ 79-81.) The fourth stage of discipline is an "Improvement Needed" rating on the individuals annual performance evaluation ("PE") and the imposition of a PII. (UF ¶ 82.) Disciplinary measures can further extend to suspensions without pay, [*12]  reductions, and discharges. (UF ¶ 84.)

1. Disciplinary Actions from 2008-09
The County first began the progressive discipline process with Mvuemba in 2008 as a result of work and behavioral issues. (UF ¶ 85.) Mvuemba's 2008-09 PE indicates that he had inconsistent attendance, did not follow established policies and procedures when reporting scheduled and unscheduled absences, and was verbally counseled. (UF ¶ 87.) In June, 2009, Mvuemba sent an e-mail to his co-workers and supervisors accusing a co-worker of a "terrorist attack on [his] spatial territory" and warning the co-worker to "NOT step to (sic) my face again . . . make me perceive you like some tyrant or dictator." (UF ¶¶ 89-90.) On July 17, 2009, Mvuemba was issued a Confirmation of Counseling for violating the Code of Ethics, and was warned that his behavior could result in further disciplinary action. (UF ¶ 90.)
On August 14, 2009, Mvuemba had another conflict with a coworker. (UF ¶ 92.) The co-worker allegedly told Mvuemba that she did not like the smell of his food and then sprayed air freshener in the office. (Id.) Mvuemba then complained to supervisors that he was "attacked by chemical hazardous spray" and demanded the [*13]  coworker be removed from her cubical. (UF ¶ 93.) The County then conducted three informal counseling sessions regarding his workplace behavior. (UF ¶ 93.)

2. Disciplinary Action from 2009-10
Mvuemba's annual PE for March 2009 to February 2010 indicated an overall evaluation of "competent," but included multiple negative markings. (UF ¶ 94.) The PE noted an "Improvement Needed" rating for his personal relations, a counseling for disrupting the workplace, "a demonstrated [] lack of attention to detail and thoroughness" for his work product with examples, thirteen unexcused absences, conflicts with four different co-workers, but improved performance with closer supervision. (UF ¶ 94-99.)

3. Disciplinary Action From 2010-11
On July 26, 2010, Mvuemba received a "Confirmation of Meeting" memorandum regarding unscheduled absences. (UF ¶ 101.) From September 2010 to November 2010, Mvuemba failed to follow the County's call-in policy for missing work on four different occasions. (UF ¶ 102.) The failure to adhere to the call-in policy resulted in four counseling sessions—August 19, September 29, October 21, and November 23—conducted in accordance with the County's progressive discipline policy. [*14]  (UF ¶ 103.) Mvuemba was warned that a "[f]ailure to correct [his] behavior will result in disciplinary action." (UF ¶ 108.)
On December 13, 2010, Mvuemba notified his supervisor that he would be leaving early, but did not file the proper forms. (UF ¶ 109-10.) He then left early on December 14 without notifying his supervisor or filing the proper forms, and then failed to follow proper procedures when arriving late to work on December 15. (UF ¶ 111-12.) Mvuemba failed to follow procedures again on December 27. (UF ¶ 112.) Mvuemba received a Letter of Warning on January 6, 2011 for his failure to comply with the County's leave policies. (UF ¶ 113.) Mvuemba filed his first accommodation request and was allegedly threatened the next day. Mvuemba's subsequent PE—covering March 2010 through February 2011—noted an "Improvement Needed" rating under "Work Habits." (UF ¶ 115.) The PE provides a long list of Mvuemba's workplace deficiencies, to include failure to follow procedures, a lack of attention to detail, and "marginal" compliance with work instructions. (UF ¶¶ 116-18.) The County asserts that the "Improvement Needed" rating was given as result of Mvuemba's repeated deficiencies at work [*15]  (Nwaekeke Decl. ¶¶ 35-37), while Mvuemba contends that the rating was a result of his requests for disability accommodations (Mvuemba Dep. 283). The PE also served to place Mvuemba on a "Corrective Action Plan" which required "immediate improvement in the identified areas" or else Mvuemba would be "placed on a six-month plan for individual improvement." (UF ¶ 119.)

3. Disciplinary Action From 2011-12
Mvuemba's next PE—covering March 2011 through February 2012—was also marked as "Improvement Needed." (UF ¶ 120.) The PE states that Mvuemba demonstrated weaknesses in amount of work, timeliness of work, accuracy, thoroughness, oral expression, written expression, observance of working hours, attendance, observance of rules, compliance with instructions, application to duties, and performance with minimum instructions. (UF ¶ 122.) His performance was significantly impacted by numerous prescheduled appointments for which Mvuemba did not properly request time off. (UF ¶ 123.) The PE specifically notes that Mvuemba "consistently failed to follow through with his task of contacting case managers and returning phone calls regarding pending applications." (UF ¶ 125.) During this period, Mvuemba's [*16]  inability follow directions and attend work on time continued. (UF ¶ 126-32.) Among numerous other performance deficiencies, the County claims that Nwaekeke had to complete Mvuemba's timecard on one occasion (Def. Ex. W), while Mvuemba claims that he completed the timecard as instructed (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 29). The County also claims that Mvuemba failed to send out his assigned memos on October 5, 2011 (Def. Ex. W), while Mvuemba asserts that it was impossible for him to complete the assignments in the allotted timeframe (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 8). Mvuemba also contends that Nmaekeke was "harassing him" about his work assignments in November 2011, and he felt scared to take his break. (Mvuemba Decl. ¶ 2.)

4. Disciplinary Actions from 2012-13 and Imposition of PII
On February 27, 2012, Mvuemba was placed on a six-month PII. (UF ¶ 135.) The PII states that its purpose is to assist in enhancing Mvuemba's performance and his "performance will be monitored closely and evaluated to determine whether you have achieved [ ] sustained improvement[.]" (UF ¶¶ 137-38.) The County contends that the disciplinary decision-makers that imposed the PII "had no knowledge of [Mvuemba's] disability, and did not consider [*17]  [Mvuemba's] disability in making any of their decisions." (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Nwaekeke Decl. ¶¶ 7, 77-79; Coker Decl. ¶ 9.) Mvuemba responds that his October 2012 supervisor, Coker, was aware of his disability accommodation requests when he returned to work that fall. (Coker Dep. 64.) The County also asserts that the imposition of the PII "had no relation to [Mvuemba's] requests for accommodations and were not based thereon." (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 7-9, 33-35; Nwaekeke Decl. ¶¶ 7, 77-79.) Mvuemba responds that his supervisor Turner threatened to dock his pay if he stood for five minutes every hour and "pressured [him] to show her [his] doctor's notes." (Mvuemba Decl. ¶¶ 3, 15.)

C. Previous Administrative Proceedings

1. Workers Compensation Claims
Mvuemba's workers compensation claims with the County date back to at least 2007, when he suffered a work-related neck and spine injury. (UF ¶ 148.) On January 11, 2011, the Workers Compensation Appeals Board issued a "Stipulation with Request for Award" finding that Mvuemba sustained a work-related injury to his "neck, back and psyche" on "a continuous trauma basis" from May 16, 2007 through March 24, 2008. (UF ¶ 149.) Mvuemba was determined to [*18]  be 29 % disabled and awarded workers compensation and future medical care from the County for his mental and physical conditions. (UF ¶¶ 150-52.) In June 2011, Mvuemba filed a "Petition to Reopen for New and Further Disability" claiming that his "neck, back, and psyche" had deteriorated. (UF ¶ 153.) This petition is still pending. (UF ¶ 154.)

2. Department of Labor Investigation
In or around 2011, the Department of Labor ("DOL") conducted an independent investigation of the County in response to Mvuemba's complaint alleging that "his rights were violated under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") when he was reprimanded and harassed for allegedly taking medical leave." (UF ¶ 155.) A reprimand letter from the County regarding Mvuemba's absences triggered the complaint to the DOL. (UF ¶ 157.) The County explained to the DOL investigator that the reprimand letter was not issued due to Mvuemba's FMLA leave, but instead due to Mvuemba's failure to follow County policy and his inability to complete work assignments. (Id.) The DOL determined that Mvuemba's rights were not violated under the FMLA and requested Mvuemba follow proper protocol when taking leave. (UF ¶ 158.) Mvuemba made several [*19]  requests to the DOL to reopen his case, all of which were denied. (UF ¶ 159.)

III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On February 7, 2012, Mvuemba filed an amended complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") making the following allegations against the County: disability discrimination, failure to make reasonable accommodations, failure to engage in good-faith IPMs, and retaliation. (UF ¶ 144.) The U.S. Department of Justice issued a "Right-to-Sue Notice" on November 21, 2013. (UF ¶ 147.)
On April 12, 2013, Mvuemba filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair and Equal Housing ("DFEH") raising the same allegations against the County as found in the EEOC complaint. (UF ¶ 142.) The DFEH issued a "Right to Sue Notice" that same day, which permitted Mvuemba to file a private civil action under FEHA. (UF ¶ 143.)

IV. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate if, viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are no genuine disputed issues of material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing [*20]  law," and a dispute as to a material fact is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative," the Court may grant summary judgment. Id. at 249-50 (citation omitted). At the summary judgment stage, the Court "does not assess credibility or weigh the evidence, but simply determines whether there is a genuine factual issue for trial." House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 559-60, 126 S. Ct. 2064, 165 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006).
The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issue of fact for trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. To meet its burden, "the moving party must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Once the moving party satisfies its initial burden of production, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 1103. "As a general matter, the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer's motion for summary judgment." [*21]  Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd. P'ship, 521 F.3d 1201, 1207 (9th Cir. 2008).

V. DISCUSSION
The County's Motion of Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment or adjudication on each cause of action in the ten-count FAC. (ECF No. 34.) Count 1 asserts discrimination in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq. Count 2 asserts a failure to make reasonable disability accommodations in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). Count 3 asserts a failure to engage in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). Count 4 asserts retaliation in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq. Count 5 asserts harassment in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq. Count 6 asserts a failure to prevent discrimination, retaliation, and harassment in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq. Count 7 asserts discrimination in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. Count 8 asserts retaliation in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12203. Count 9 asserts harassment in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. And Count 10 asserts a failure to prevent discrimination, retaliation, and harassment in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.

A. Statute of Limitations for FEHA Causes of Action
The County first argues that all of Mvuemba's causes of action under FEHA (Counts 1-6) are barred due to a "failure to exhaust" California administrative remedies. (Def. Br. at 10.) The County [*22]  claims that Mvuemba did not file his DFEH complaint until April 12, 2013, and California law requires all administrative complaints be filed within one year of the alleged unlawful employment practice. (Id.) The County argues that as a result, all alleged unlawful employment practices occurring before April 12, 2012, that serve as the basis for Counts 1-6 are time barred. (Id.)

1. Continuing Violation Doctrine
"Under FEHA, the employee must exhaust the administrative remedy provided by the statute by filing a complaint with [DFEH] and must obtain . . . a notice of right to sue in order to be entitled to a civil action in court based on violations of FEHA." Romano v. Rockwell Int'l, Inc., 14 Cal. 4th 479, 59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114, 1121 (Cal. 1996) (citing Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12960, 12965(b)). Section 12960 requires that the DFEH complaint be filed within one year "from the date upon which the alleged unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred" barring exceptions related to delayed discovery. Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d).
California's continuing violation doctrine is an exception to the one-year statutory period, and states that "an employer is liable for actions that take place outside the limitations period if these actions are sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct that occurred within the limitations period." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, 1140 (Cal. 2005). "The continuing violation [*23]  doctrine applies where alleged discrimination is based on a temporally related and continuous course of conduct; 'discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time-barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.'" Lewis v. City of Fresno, 834 F. Supp. 2d 990, 995 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (quoting Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1140).

2. Application
In order to determine whether the continuing violation doctrine applies in this case, the Court must first identify the alleged violations that occurred during the one-year statutory period. The Court must then decide whether these violations are "sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct" that occurred outside the statutory one-year period. See Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1140.
The one-year FEHA statutory period ranges from April 12, 2012, to April 12, 2013—it is undisputed that Mvuemba filed his DFEH complaint on April 12, 2013. In April, 2012, Mvuemba was out of work on TTD and did not return until October, 22, 2012. He then left work permanently on December 18, 2012. Thus the Court can only examine alleged violations that occurred from October 22, 2012 through December 18, 2012. Mvuemba made two special accommodation requests during this period—on October 22 and November 1—and in each instance the County held an IPM or took immediate action, and [*24]  no request was denied. The County ordered an ergonomic work station, transferred Mvuemba to a new work unit, and granted Mvuemba a new supervisor.
The only arguable unlawful conduct occurring after April 12, 2012, relates to Mvuemba's POE complaint.3 Mvuemba alleges that the County violated the POE when (1) the CISU failed to send Mvuemba a Letter of Determination following the November 2012 hearing, and (2) when the County allowed the lead investigator's supervisor—and not the investigator herself—attend the POE hearing. Assuming that the County was required to send the letter and the lead investigator was required to attend the hearing—both of which the County refutes—the County's failure to follow internal administrative procedures is not "sufficiently linked" to the alleged violations that occurred outside the statutory period. The POE encompasses a broad spectrum of conduct, and the Court rejects the argument that POE violations themselves, regardless of the underlying conduct, satisfies the "sufficiently linked" requirement of the continuing violation doctrine. See Anderson v. Reno, 190 F.3d 930, 936-37 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding pattern of sexual harassment conduct to be sufficiently related); Green v. Los Angeles Superintendent of Sch., 883 F.2d 1472, 1480-81 (9th Cir. 1989) (finding series of discriminatory conduct [*25]  may constitute a continuing violation). At no point during the pre-statutory period did the County fail to comply with a post-complaint administrative task or fail to comply with a hearing attendance policy. The alleged unlawful conduct before the one-year statutory period consists primarily of the County's alleged denial of standing/stretching requests and threats, both of which are "discrete discriminatory acts" that did not pervade the one-year statutory period. See Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1140. The undisputed facts show that during the one-year statutory period, Mvuemba was authorized to stand for five minutes every hour for all days he worked and never received any threats. Since the Court's focus is on the County's acts and conduct, general violations of the POE occurring during and before the statutory period fall short of satisfying the "sufficiently linked" requirement.
Sensing a lack of evidence, Mvuemba argues that the DFEH complaint, which alleges a "continuing violation" of FEHA, "entitle[s] plaintiff to recover for the County's unlawful practices before and after April 12, 2012." (Opp. Br. at 18.) He also argues that the FAC alleges that "the County has repeatedly and uniformly violated plaintiff's [*26]  FEHA rights both before and after April 12, 2012." (Id.) The continuing violation doctrine is not a pleading standard satisfied in a DFEH or federal complaint. Instead, the doctrine requires the Court to examine "actions" and "conduct." Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1140. Mere pleadings are legally insufficient to satisfy the continuing violation doctrine.
Since the continuing violation doctrine does not apply in this case, all alleged unlawful practices by the County occurring before April 12, 2012, are statutorily precluded from Counts 1-6. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d). Whether or not the alleged unlawful conduct that occurred during the statutory period is sufficient to make prima facie cases for the other FEHA causes of action is discussed supra.

B. Discrimination in Violation of FEHA and the ADA
Counts 1 and 7 both allege disability discrimination. Count 1 is brought under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., and Count 7 is brought under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. The County argues that Mvuemba failed to make a prima facie case for discrimination under both FEHA and the ADA. (Def. Br. at 12, 23.)

1. FEHA Discrimination—Count 1
FEHA provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for "an employer, because of the . . . physical disability . . . of any person . . . to discriminate against [*27]  the person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). To make a prima facie case of discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must provide evidence that:
(1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered from an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests a discriminatory motive.
Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113 (Cal. 2000). An "adverse employment action" not only includes the "so-called 'ultimate employment actions' such as termination or demotion, but also the entire spectrum of employment actions that are reasonably likely to adversely and materially affect an employee's job performance or opportunity for advancement in his or her career." Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1138.
Mvuemba's FEHA discrimination claim is limited to the universe of facts occurring after April 12, 2012. See infra Part V.A. As the result, the Court will only analyze the third element of Mvuemba's discrimination prima facie case—"suffered an adverse employment action"—as it is dispositive for Count 1. The only alleged adverse employment actions occurring after April 12, [*28]  2012, is the County's "denial of due process in its POE investigation." (Opp. Br. at 23.) This consists of (1) the County's failure to send Mvuemba a Letter of Determination following the POE complaint hearing, and (2) a supervisor attending the POE hearing in place of the lead CEIU investigator. Assuming, without deciding, that these actions are in fact violations of the POE, the relevant question then becomes whether or not these actions are "reasonably likely to adversely and materially affect" Mvuemba's job performance or opportunity for advancement. See Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1138.
The answer is no. There is no evidence or even allegations that these "due process" violations affected Mvuemba's employment in any manner. There is also nothing in the record to suggest that Mvuemba quit his job because the lead investigator did not personally attend his hearing and he did not receive a Letter of Determination. Mvuemba does not identify, and the Court cannot find, any authority that holds that an internal procedural due process violation, alone, constitutes an adverse employment action. Since these due process violations are the only alleged adverse employment actions during the one-year FEHA statutory period, [*29]  the Court finds that there is no genuine disputed issue of material fact, and the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count 1. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

2. ADA Discrimination—Count 6
The ADA prohibits employers from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Both parties agree that to make a prima facie case for discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove that he or she "(1) is disabled; (2) is qualified; and (3) suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability." Snead v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2001). This type of discrimination action is commonly referred to as a "disparate treatment" claim. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 609, 113 S. Ct. 1701, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1993).4 Discrimination claims under the ADA, however, are subject a three-step burden-shifting framework. First, "an employee challenging an adverse employment action has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination." Curley v. City of North Las Vegas, 772 F.3d 629, 632 (9th Cir. 2014). Second, the "burden then shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory . . . reason for the adverse employment action." Id. Third, "[i]f the employer does so, then the burden shifts back to the employee to prove that the reason given by the employer was pretextual." Id.

i. Step 1—Mvuemba's Prima Facie Case of Discrimination
The County makes two arguments against Mvuemba's prima facie case of ADA disparate treatment discrimination. First, the County asserts that Mvuemba "cannot establish he was qualified to perform the essential functions of [his] position." (Def. Br. at 23.) The only support for this argument is the County's one-sentence assertion that Mvuemba's "work performance deteriorated as evidenced by the progressive discipline." (Id. at 12.) Work performance deterioration fails to prove that Mvuemba was "not qualified," and therefore the Court summarily rejects this first argument.
Second, the County argues that Mvuemba "cannot establish . . . that he suffered any adverse employment action due to his disability." (Motion at 23.) Adverse employment actions are defined broadly and not limited to such actions as discharges, transfers, or demotions. See Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1118 (9th Cir. 2002). "Among those employment decisions that can constitute an adverse employment action are termination, dissemination of a negative employment reference, issuance of an undeserved negative performance review and refusal to consider for promotion." Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000).
Mvuemba claims he was subject to the following [*31]  adverse employment actions because of his disability: (1) the County "repeatedly and unreasonably refused to accommodate" his disability; (2) the County failed to engage in the IPM process; (3) the County issued him "an unfairly critical employment review"; (4) the County subjected him to "unwarranted workplace discipline"; (5) the County denied his "due process in its POE investigation"; (6) the County denied him lunch breaks; and (7) the County denied him a "tolerably quiet cubical." (Opp. Br. at 23.) Only two of these allegations are potentially adverse employment actions—the "unfairly crucial employment review" and "unwarranted workplace discipline."
A failure to accommodate is a separate cause of action under the ADA, see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A), and cannot serve as an adverse employment action for purposes of Count 7. Since the Ninth Circuit includes an adverse employment action as an element of a prima facie failure-to-accommodate claim, see Allen, 348 F.3d at 1114, it is therefore illogical to then conclude that an employer's failure to accommodate is an adverse employment action. This would make the cause of action an element of itself.5 Likewise, the alleged failure to "engage in the IPM process" is also not an adverse [*32]  employment action under the ADA. The Ninth Circuit has addressed the interactive process requirements when a plaintiff raises a failure-to-accommodation cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). See, e.g., Zivkovic v. So. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1088-89 (9th Cir. 2002).
The "denial of due process" during the POE investigation is also not an adverse employment action. See, infra, Part V.B.1 (explaining that a due process violation is not an adverse employment action under FEHA). Mvuemba offers no federal authority to suggest otherwise. While Mvuemba does not even argue that he was legally entitled to a lunch break, the Court finds that there is no federal authority holding that "deni[ed] lunch breaks" constitute an adverse employment action. The Court also finds that a lack of a "quite cubical" is not an adverse employment action and Mvuemba cites not federal authority to the contrary. In light of what actions are considered adverse employment actions—termination, transfers, demotions, adverse reviews—the Court finds that a lawfully denied lunch break and a noisy cubical are well outside the legal parameters of adverse employment actions. Since the issuance of an "undeserved negative performance review" constitutes an adverse employment action, see Brooks, 229 F.3d at 928, the [*33]  Court accepts Mvuemba's claims of an "unfairly critical employment review" and "unwarranted workplace discipline" as sufficient for a prima facie case of disparate treatment discrimination. The factual basis for these claims is the negative PE and the imposition of a PII in February 2012.

ii. Step 2—Burden Shifted to the County
Finding the first step satisfied, the burden then shifts to the County to prove a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged "underserved negative performance review" and "unwarranted workplace discipline." See Curley, 772 F.3d at 632.
The County presents an overwhelming amount of legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and undisputed evidence to justify the adverse employment actions. The evidence dates back to 2008, and systematically follows the County's Progressive Discipline to address Mvuemba's poor performance and behavior at work. It is undisputed that every PE since 2008 contained negative marks for attendance and work habits. Mvuemba received multiple Letters of Warning and counseling sessions, and was even warned that he would be placed on a PII if his performance did not improve. Mvuemba's spinal condition and disability accommodation requests are not referenced in any disciplinary [*34]  record, and Mvuemba does not argue otherwise. Based on the undisputed facts in this case, the County easily satisfies its burden of providing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for issuing a negative PE and placing Mvuemba on a PII in February 2012—there is overwhelming undisputed evidence that Mvuemba failed to adequately perform and follow procedures at work.

iii. Step 3—Mvuemba's Burden to Prove Pretext
If an employer can articular a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the employee must then demonstrate that the employer's "articulated reason is a pretext for unlawful discrimination by either directly persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., 292 F.3d 654, 658-59 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).6 The employee's "evidence must be both specific and substantial to overcome the legitimate reasons put forth by [the employer]." Id. at 659 (original emphasis). "Disputing only one of several well-supported, independently sufficient reasons for [an adverse employment action] is generally not enough to defeat summary judgment." Curley, 772 F.3d at 633.
Mvuemba fails [*35]  to carry this burden at step three. Mvuemba argues that "[c]ommunications between Mr. Mvuemba and his supervisors clearly demonstrate the County's discriminatory intent in taking adverse employment actions against him." (Opp. Br. at 24.) Mvuemba's identified "communications" merely consist of emails he sent supervisors complaining about his co-workers, his lunch schedule, and his attempts to call-in late to work. While Mvuemba does contest a few of the County's assertions that he failed to comply with work procedures, the record contains no less than seven undisputed instances of Mvuemba violating work policies or behaving unsatisfactorily at work during the months leading up to his PII. (UF ¶¶ 124, 127, 128, 130, 131, 132, 134.) There is no "specific and substantial" evidence of pretext anywhere in the record, and the Court is thoroughly unpersuaded "that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated" the County. See Aragon, 292 F.3d at 658-59. The evidence of disciplinary problems is overwhelming, and the argument for pretext is feeble, at best.
Mvuemba failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason advanced by the County was a pretext, and therefore summary judgment is appropriate [*36]  for Count 6.

C. Count 2—Failure to Make Reasonable Disability Accommodations in Violation of FEHA
The County argues that Mvuemba failed to make a prima facie showing under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)—failure to make reasonable disability accommodations. (Def. Br. at 16.) FEHA declares that "[i]t shall be unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupation qualification . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). "An employer's failure to provide reasonable accommodation is a violation of the statute even in the absence of an adverse employment action." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359, 373 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007).
As previously discussed, see infra Part V.A, all FEHA claims must be based on factual allegations occurring after April 12, 2010. Mvuemba made two requests for accommodations during this period. The first request was made on October 22, 2012, and sought an ergonomic work station, a new work facility, limited gripping, a new supervisor, five minutes of standing every hour, and a part time work schedule. The second request was made on November 1, 2012, and was for a new work facility. The County argues that all of these requests were accommodated. [*37]  (Def. Br. at 17.) Mvuemba, however, argues that "In October, November and December 2012, the County continued its harsh and unreasonable refusal to comply with the reasonable requests for accommodation[.]" (Opp. Br. at 11.) The only facts offered in support of this claim is the County's "refus[al] to provide Mr. Mvuemba with an ergonomic workstation" because it arrived "428 days" after the request. (Id.)
The following facts are undisputed: (1) an IPM was held on the same day as the October 22 request; (2) the ergonomic workstation was approved that day; (3) the County submitted the workstation request eight days later; (4) the parties signed an agreement on November 8 which stated the "[e]rgonomic evaluation is in the process of being scheduled"; and (5) a contactor conducted the ergonomic evaluation on November 13. Nothing in this set of facts suggest that Mvuemba's request was not accommodated by the County. Mvuemba wants the Court to believe that a delayed arrival of approved equipment is sufficient evidence to find the County liable for failure to make reasonable disability accommodations. This argument is proffered in the face of undisputed evidence that Mvuemba left work one month [*38]  after the ergonomics contractor submitted his recommendation to the County, and he never returned. Mvuemba identifies no authority that suggests the delayed arrival of equipment following an approved accommodation request is actionable under FEHA. Mvuemba makes no assertion of bad faith and all undisputed facts indicate that the County all of the proper steps to accommodate the request.
The Court finds that there are no genuine disputed issues of material fact, and the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count 2. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

D. Count 3—Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of FEHA
The County argues that Mvuemba failed to make a prima facie case for failure to engage in the good-faith interactive process required under FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12926.1(e), 12940(n). Section 12940(n) provides it shall be an unlawful employment practice for employers "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with the employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).
Once again, the limited universe of facts is fatal for this FEHA claim. Mvuemba made two reasonable accommodation requests during the FEHA statutory period, and the County took immediate steps to address both [*39]  requests. The County even held an IPM the same day as one of the requests. Mvuemba fails to identify a single fact that supports his allegation that the County failed to engage in the interactive process during this period, and as a result, the County is entitled to summary judgment on Count 3. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

E. Counts 4 and 8—Retaliation in violation of FEHA and the ADA
Counts 4 and 8 both allege retaliation. Count 4 is brought under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., and Count 8 is brought under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12203.

1. FEHA Retaliation—Count 4
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding[.]" Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). "California cases hold that in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz, 116 P.3d at 1130.
Again, the FEHA one-year statutory period is fatal for this cause of action. This cause of action [*40]  fails at the second element of a prima facie case because Mvuemba cannot point to any adverse employment action during the one-year statutory period. See Part V.B (finding no adverse employment action). Mvuemba did file a POE complaint during the statutory period, but he permanently left work the next month and there is no evidence in the record that the County subjected Mvuemba to an adverse employment action in the one month before he left. As a result, the Court finds that there are no genuine disputed issues of material fact, and the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law for Count 4. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.

2. ADA Retaliation—Count 8
The ADA provides that "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "To make a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, an employee must show that: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the two." Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosp., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004).
An ADA retaliation [*41]  cause of action follows the same burden-shifting framework used in an ADA discrimination cause of action. See infra Part V.A.2; Curley, 772 F.3d at 632. After the employee makes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to prove a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason, which then shifts the burden back to the employee to prove the proffered reason is pretextual. Curley, 772 F.3d at 632.

i. Step 1—Mvuemba's Prima Facie Case of Retaliation
Mvuemba's FAC claims that two particular accommodation requests prompted the County to retaliate. (FAC ¶¶ 96-99.) The first was the January 7, 2011, request which sought five minutes of stretch and standing every hour. The second was the February 8, 2012, request which sought four different accommodations. According to Mvuemba, his "request for reasonable disability accommodations was a motivating reason for the County's decisions to issue [him] an unwarranted negative PE, delay the review of [his] PE for nearly one-year [sic], and impose the discriminatory and harassing six-month PII against [him]. (FAC ¶ 99.) While not specifically raised in the FAC or argued in his brief, Mvuemba was also allegedly denied an accommodation request in December 2011.
Requesting a reasonable [*42]  accommodation for a disability is a protected activity, Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dept. of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004). And a negative performance evaluation is an adverse employment action. See, infra, Part V.B.2.i. The third element of a prima facie case requires a causal link between the protected activity and adverse employment action. Mvuemba argues the following: "Communications between Mr. Mvuemba and his supervisor clearly demonstrate that the County was punishing plaintiff for asserting his rights to reasonable accommodations of his disability and good-faith interactive process meetings." (Opp. Br. at 27.) He continues: "Further, the County's discriminatory and retaliatory acts against Mr. Mvuemba coincided with his reasonable requests for accommodation and for interactive process meetings." (Id.)
Mvuemba's assertion that e-mail exchanges with the County "clearly" demonstrates retaliation is untethered to any facts in the record. Not only does Mveumba fail to cite any "communication," but the Court can find no evidence of such "clear" retaliation. The only communication in the record between the date of the last request and the issuance of the negative PE is a series of e-mails from Mvuemba to his supervisors complaining about his lunch [*43]  breaks. The record is replete with e-mail complaints from Mvuemba but very few responses, and no retaliatory comments from the County. The Court also notes that the County did not deny any of the February 8 requests, and even conducted an IPM to discuss the requests. The Court does not find any communications in the record to support a prima facie case of retaliation.
"It is true that very close temporal proximity between a protected activity and an adverse employment action can be sufficient evidence of a causal link between the two to support a prima facie showing of retaliation." Curley, 772 F.3d at 634 (emphasis added). See, e.g., Vasquez v. County of L.A., 349 F.3d 634, 646 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding no causal link where "the protected activity occurred thirteen months prior to the alleged adverse action" and the plaintiff failed to provide other "evidence of surrounding circumstances that show a retaliatory motive"); Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) ("A nearly 18-month lapse between the protected activity and adverse employment action is simply too long, by itself, to give rise to an inference of causation.").
Mvuemba was issued his negative PE on or about February 28, 2012. This adverse employment action occurred twenty days after his February 2012 request, three months after his December 2011 [*44]  request, and over thirteen months after his January 2011 request. The January 2011, request occurred well over a year before the adverse employment action and lacks the necessary temporal proximity. The Court, however, will accept Mvuemba's argument that the twenty-day and three-month periods for the other two requests satisfy the close temporal proximity requirement for demonstrating a causal link. "[C]onstru[ing] the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party," Nelson v. City of Davis, 571 F.3d 924, 928 (9th Cir. 2009), the Court finds that Mvuemba has made a prima facie case for retaliation on the sole basis of a very close temporal proximity, see Curley, 772 F.3d at 634. Step one in the burden shifting framework is satisfied.

ii. Step 2—Burden Shifted to the County
Finding the first step satisfied, the burden then shifts to the County to prove a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the alleged "underserved negative performance review" and "unwarranted workplace discipline." See Curley, 772 F.3d at 632.
The Court incorporates the County's justifications for the nondiscriminatory reasons discussed in Part V.B.2.ii. The record is saturated with evidence regarding Mvuemba's workplace troubles. The County can provide numerous legitimate, undisputed, and nonretaliatory reasons [*45]  for the negative PE and subsequent PII. The County has carried its burden at step two.

iii. Step 3—Mvuemba's Burden to Prove Pretext
To defeat summary judgment with a showing of pretext, Mvuemba must demonstrate that (1) the County's proffered reason is unworthy of credence, or (2) retaliation was the more likely motivation. See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1062-63 (9th Cir. 2002).
Similar to the Court's analysis in Part V.B.2.iii, Mvuemba fails to carry this burden at step three. There is simply no evidence in the record to indicate pretext for unlawful retaliation or for the Court to believe that retaliation was the more likely motivation. Considering the County's approval of the February 8 requests, the through justification for the negative PE, and the lack of any retaliatory communications from the County at any point during Mvuemba's employment, the Court concludes that Mvuemba failed to demonstrate that the County's reasons were pretextual. As a result, Mvuemba did not make a prima facie case of discrimination and the County is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count 8.

F. Counts 5 and 9—Harassment in Violation of FEHA and the ADA
Counts 5 and 9 both allege harassment. Count 5 is brought under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., and Count 9 is brought [*46]  under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.

1. FEHA Harassment—Count 5
Government Code section 12940 makes it unlawful for "an employer . . . because of . . . physical disability . . . to harass an employee[.]" Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(j)(1). "Discrimination claims" and "harassment claims" are distinct under FEHA. Miller v. Dept. of Corr., 36 Cal. 4th 446, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77, 86 n.5 (Cal. 2005). "[H]arassment focuses on situations in which the social environment of the workplace becomes intolerable because the harassment (whether verbal, physical, or visual) communicates an offensive message to the harassed employee." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 788, 219 P.3d 749 (Cal. 2009). "Harassment is not conduct of a type necessary for management of the employer's business of performance of the supervisory employee's job." Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333, 1336 (Cal. 1998). Therefore, "commonly necessary personnel management actions such as hiring and firing, job or project assignments, office or work station assignments, promotion or demotion, performance evaluations, . . . deciding who will and who will not attend meetings, deciding who will be laid off, and the like, do not come within the meaning of harassment." Id.
Mvuemba's harassment claim is based entirely on "commonly necessary personnel management actions." See id. He claims he was harassed because the County failed to accommodate his requests, failed to engage in the interactive process, [*47]  issued an unwarranted performance evaluation, and placed him on an unwarranted PII. (FAC ¶ 75; Opp. Br. at 28.) All of these factual allegations are management decisions, made by supervisors at the County, and unrelated to the social environment of the workplace. Because personnel management actions do not constitute harassment under FEHA, summary judgment in favor of the County is appropriate for Count 5.

2. ADA Harassment—Count 9
This cause of action is based on the same factual allegations found in Mvuemba's FEHA harassment claim. (FAC ¶ 104.) While not raised by the County, the Court questions whether the Ninth Circuit recognizes a cause of action for harassment under the ADA. The Court finds no Ninth Circuit case recognizing such a claim, and other lower courts have noted the absence as well. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. John Muir Med. Ctr., No. 09-0731, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25589, 2010 WL 1002641, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2010) ("The Ninth Circuit has not determined whether a plaintiff can maintain a [harassment] claim under the ADA.").
Both parties failed to bring this issue to the Court's attention, and have instead requested the Court to apply the prima facie factors from other jurisdictions. The Court declines this invitation and holds that Count 9 is not cognizable claim upon which relief can be granted. [*48]  Therefore, the County is entitled to summary adjudication on Count 9.

G. Counts 6 and 10—Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Retaliation, or Harassment
Counts 6 and 10 both allege failure to prevent discrimination. Count 6 is brought under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq., and Count 9 is brought under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.

1. FEHA Failure to Prevent—Count 6
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Since the Court has previously determined that Mvuemba was not discriminated, retaliated against, or harassed during the one-year FEHA statutory period, a claim for failure to prevent such conduct automatically fails. See Lelaind v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008). The County is entitled to summary judgment on Count 6.

2. ADA Failure to Prevent—Court 10
Similar to Count 9, the Ninth Circuit does not recognize a "failure to prevent discrimination, retaliation, or harassment" cause of action under the ADA. The parties do not contend otherwise. In the alternative, since the Court found that Mvuemba was discriminated or retaliated against, Count 10 must necessarily fail. The County is entitled to summary judgment on Count 10.

H. Available Remedies
Since the Court has found that [*49]  the County is entitled to summary judgment on all counts, the County's arguments regarding damages are moot.

VI. CONCLUSION
The Court hereby GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles' Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication in its entirety. (ECF No. 34.)
IT IS SO ORDERED.
