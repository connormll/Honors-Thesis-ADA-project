MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the court on defendant MVM, Inc.'s ("MVM") motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. MVM seeks dismissal of plaintiff Wanda Colón-Pagán's complaint, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; Puerto Rico's Act No. 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 501 et seq.; Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141; and Puerto Rico's Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185(a) et seq. (Docket Nos. 1 & 65.) I recommend that MVM's motion be DENIED for the reasons set forth below.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Colón is a 47 year old female who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 1992. (Docket No. 69-2, at 1; Docket No. 72-20, at 2.) She also suffers from Degenerative Disc Disease. (Docket No. 65-10, at 2.) For some time prior to [*2]  October 1, 2004, Colón was employed as a Detention Officer by a government contractor known as U.S. Premier, which provided security services at Puerto Rico's Aguadilla Service Processing Center ("SPC") at 505 Gun Road, Ramey Base, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico 00604. (Docket No. 65-2, at 1-2, ¶ 3, at 5-6, ¶ 25.) The SPC holds alien detainees while they are subject to immigration removal proceedings.
On October 1, 2004, MVM replaced U.S. Premier as the party responsible for providing security services at the Aguadilla SPC under a new contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE"). (Docket No. 65-2, at 6, ¶ 26.) As part of the transition, MVM retained some U.S. Premier employees as its own. (Id.) Colón was among this group, and she began working for MVM on October 1, 2004. (Id. at 7.) As Colón and the rest of the group had already undergone security and medical screening pursuant to their employment with U.S. Premier, MVM did not require Colón or the others to undergo pre-employment physical examinations. (Id. at 6.)
MVM's contract with ICE required that MVM "furnish detention (unarmed guard) services, including management personnel, supervision, manpower, relief guards, . . . and supplies to [*3]  provide guard services seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours per day for the [SPC]." (Docket No. 65-4, at 4, ¶ C.) It also provided that, "Pursuant to ICE instructions, the Contractor shall counteract civil disturbances, attempts to commit espionage or sabotage, and other acts that adversely affect the normal site conditions, the security and safety of personnel, property, detainees, and the general public." (Docket No. 65-4, at 19, ¶ A.) MVM initially commissioned Colón as a Detention Officer, but quickly promoted her to Supervisory Detention Officer on October 29, 2004.
The parties dispute whether the physical capabilities required of a Detention Officer were the same as those of a Supervisory Detention Officer under the ICE contract. (Docket No. 65-2, at 2, ¶ 7; Docket No. 72-2, at 2, ¶ 7.) Majid Bazzi, Project Manager for MVM at all times relevant, states in an affidavit that "all supervisory detention officers must meet the same physical and medical requirements for detention officers." (Docket No. 65-5, at 2, ¶ 5.) Colón contends otherwise, however, citing a contract provision regarding "Dual Positions": "A contract employee shall not hold the position of Detention Officer [*4]  and Supervisory Detention Officer simultaneously." (Docket No. 72-5, at 4, ¶ F.) MVM's contract with ICE defines "Detention Officers" as "Contractor's uniformed unarmed employees responsible for the security, care and supervision of detainees being detained or under DHS [Department of Homeland Security] proceedings. The officer is also responsible for the safety and security of the facility." (Docket No. 65-4, at 11.) A key element of a Detention Officer's duties is the readiness to respond to potential escapes or aggressive action on the part of the detainees, "[e]specially because some of the detainees are hardened criminals who are dangerous." (Docket No. 65-2, at 3, ¶ 10; Docket No. 72-2, at 3, ¶ 10.)
Supervisory Detention Officers, on the other hand, are obligated by the following duties:
1. Supervise all contract Detention Officers on each shift throughout the SPC and vicinity, which includes on-call transportation support.
2. Ensure that a periodic visual check of segregation cells, detention processing holding room and shower facilities is performed.
3. Oversee Detention Officers in performance of all duties and provide direction as appropriate.
(Docket No. 65-4, at 6.) ,The contract's [*5]  Explanation of Terms does not contain a definition of "Supervisory Detention Officer"; it defines only "Detention Officer."
Under the section heading "Health Requirements for All Detention Officers," the contract provides that, "The Contractor shall assign only employees who are in good health to work under this contract. Employees shall be without physical defects or abnormalities that would interfere with performing duties." (Docket No. 65-4, at 17.) This section also provides:
Prior to the officer's initial assignment or reassignment to the DHS site, the Contractor shall certify in writing to the COTR [Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, a DHS employee charged with administering the contract] that each Detention Officer is in full compliance with the following:
1. Detention Officers must be free from any serious physical illnesses, ailments, or maladies, including epilepsy.
. . .
4. Detention Officers shall not have heart, lung, skeletal, or other physical defects that would impair his/her ability to perform effectively in either normal or emergency situations.
5. Detention Officers shall possess unimpaired use of hands, arms, legs, and feet. Detention Officers shall be able [*6]  to run when necessary is [sic] capable of handling portable fire extinguishers, building fire hoses, and related equipment.
(Docket No. 65-4, at 17-18.)
At some point, Colón began having attendance problems. She admits that "it was a lot of absences . . . [l]ike a lot of them . . . ." (Docket No. 65-6, at 7.) On January 11, 2005 Bazzi gave Colón a memorandum reprimanding her for excessive absences. (Docket No. 65-15, at 1, ¶ 4.) On April 20, 2005, Bazzi gave her a final written warning for excessive absenteeism. (Id.) Upon receiving this warning, Colón informed Bazzi that she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. At no point, however, did Colón ever request a reasonable accommodation. (Docket No. 65-2, at 11, ¶ 56.) Bazzi asked Colón to write the name of her affliction on the back of the reprimand, which she did. (Docket No. 65-2, at 8, ¶ 37.)
The parties dispute whether MVM knew of Colón's arthritis prior to this time. (Docket No. 65-2, at 8; Docket No. 72-2, at 14.) To support her contention that MVM knew or should have known, Colón submits an exhibit allegedly known as the SF85-P Federal Application, which is dated July 28, 2000 and contains a notation next to a list of medications that [*7]  says "Arthritis." (Docket No. 72-2, at 14, ¶ 38; Docket No. 72-14.) Colón alleges that she filled out this form when she first applied to be a Detention Officer, and that MVM should have had the form in their files had they wished to review it at some point. (Docket No. 1, at 7, ¶ 26.) Colón also cites an undated certification from her personal physician, Dr. Ricardo Cardona, confirming that Colón has had rheumatoid arthritis since 1992, but that she "is considered to be completely fit to work under treatment and medical evaluation . . . ." (Docket No. 69-2.) Colón asserts that she tendered this certification to Bazzi prior to her suspension, while Bazzi contends the opposite. (Docket No. 65-2, at 8, ¶ 41; Docket No. 72-2, at 15, ¶ 41.) In defense of its position that it was unaware of Colón's arthritis until Colón disclosed it to Bazzi, MVM cites to a pre-employment medical examination performed on Colón by Dr. Cardona on June 25, 2003, prior to Colón's employment with MVM. (Docket No. 65-13.) The results of that examination were reported on Standard Form 88 ("SF-88"). The form contains no reference to any arthritis, and indicates that Colón had "No diseases." (Id.)
In any event, after [*8]  giving the final warning to Colón, Bazzi proceeded to inform the MVM Human Resources Department and the Operations Coordinator, Nadja Williams, that Colón suffered from arthritis. (Docket No. 65-12, at 6.) Williams instructed Bazzi to refer to the ICE contract to determine what action to take. (Id. at 7.) Per his understanding of the contract's requirements, Bazzi then informed the COTR, Paul Muller, of Colón's condition. (Id.) Muller told Bazzi that, in keeping with the contract, Bazzi had to send Colón for a medical examination to determine whether she was "fit for duty." (Id.) Colón underwent such an exam, performed by Dr. Samuel I. Maduro, on August 22, 2005. (Docket No. 65-2, at 9, ¶ 45.) Dr. Maduro had been retained by MVM to perform medical examinations of Detention Officers working on the ICE contract. (Docket No. 65-8, at 1.) MVM provided Dr. Maduro with the certification of Dr. Cardona indicating that Colón suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis. (Docket No. 72-10, at 14.) It also provided Dr. Maduro with a radiologist's report indicating that Colón suffered from "Degenerative Disc Disease at L5-S1." (Id. at 15.)
Dr. Maduro reported the results of his examination on Standard Form 88 ("SF-88"), [*9]  the same form used by Dr. Cardona in June 2003. The form indicated that "Ms. Colón's physical examination was normal."1 (Docket No. 65-8, at 1; Docket No. 65-10.) It indicated diagnoses, however, of "Rheumatoid Arthritis" and "Degenerative Disc Disease at L5-S1." (Docket No. 65-10, at 2.) He also checked box No. 46.B labeled "EXAMINEE IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR." (Id.) He did not, however, fill in box No. 47, whose heading reads, "IF NOT QUALIFIED, LIST DISQUALIFYING DEFECTS BY ITEM NUMBER." (Id.) In a letter dated the same date as the examination, Dr. Maduro wrote:
At examination no acute Illiness [sic] or condition was noted. However patient's medical history of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Discogenic Disease are at [sic] major concern due to the medical and physical qualifications and guidelines for the job description and parameters given by the contractor and federal parameters.
The medical standard required for the job are [sic] also disqualifying in this case as well as the physical demands required.
(Docket No. 65-20.)
Upon receiving Dr. Maduro's report and letter, Bazzi spoke to Dr. Maduro, who told him that "it could happens [sic] that [Colon] would be at work one day and the next thing [*10]  you know she's in the floor." (Docket No. 72-9, at 5:23-25.) Dr. Maduro also told Bazzi that Colón "would not have the strength to subdue someone" if it became necessary. (Id. at 7:8-9.) MVM contends that Bazzi next informed MVM's Operations Coordinator and the Human Resources Department of Dr. Maduro's conclusion, but Colón disputes that this occurred. (Docket No. 65-2, at 10, ¶ 51; Docket No. 72-2, at 21, ¶ 51.) In any event, Dina Evans of MVM's Human Resources Department testified in her deposition that Bazzi completed a "Change of Status" form that recommended that Colón be terminated. (Docket No. 65-21, at 3.) Ms. Evans, along with Joe Morales, Human Resources Director of MVM, made the decision to terminate Colón. (Docket No. 65-21, at 2.) Colón was dismissed effective August 30, 2005. Her termination letter stated that the termination was "based on the fact that you do not fulfill the physical health conditions required to work at ICE PR contract [sic]. Likewise, you did not show evidence of your health condition when the contract was granted to MVM until after you were suspended for five days as consequence of you [sic] constant absences." (Docket 83-3.) Bazzi's testimony is [*11]  that "Ms. Colón was not terminated for excessive absenteeism." (Docket No. 65-15, at 2, ¶ 3.)
In his affidavit dated over a year later, Dr. Maduro stated that Colón "did not exhibit any of the pain, stiffness or swelling she described in the history portion of the medical examination." (Docket No. 65-8, at 1-2, ¶ 4.) He stated that, "Nonetheless, in my medical opinion, Ms. Colón is not medically qualified to work as a Detention Officer on the Contract." (Id. at 2.) He questioned Colón's ability to respond to emergency situations and expressed concern that her potential joint erosion would impair her in situations requiring strenuous activity. "These limitations would prevent Ms. Colón from running to catch an escaping detainee, physically subduing a detainee or performing any other physically demanding act." (Id. ¶ 4.)
Bazzi's deposition testimony was that he accepted Dr. Maduro's findings as truth. (Docket No. 86-11, at 13:11-12.) He "was not going to challenge a doctor." (Id.)
Bazzi later gave the following testimony:
Q: So, if we, if we take that disqualifying factor, okay?, and we extrapolate, and I know we're extrapolating[,] to any other work position that required strenuous physical ability, [*12]  she would not, she would not be able to perform those, as well. Correct?
A: That's correct.
(Docket No. 72-9, at 12:12-17.) Regarding the bearing that Bazzi's recommendation had on the decision to terminate Colón, Evans testified:
So, even if [the termination was] something that [Bazzi] wanted to have happened or didn't want to have happened, the contract requirements are just that, the contract requirements. [Colon] didn't meet those requirements. So [that] was something that had to happen.
(Docket No. 65-21, at 4:18-22, at 5:1.) Evans, however, could not say which contract requirement Colón failed to comply with. (Id. at 5.) Nor could Morales. (Docket No. 65-7, at 11.) Additionally, Evans stated that, "Being in human resources, that doesn't mean that we're the contract experts. So I typically would not question a project manager [Bazzi] that has given me enough information to have led me to believe that what he is saying is -- is accurate." (Docket No. 90-4, at 11:8-12.) She stated, "I had no reason to question the project manager." (Id. at 12:20.) The project manager had not identified, however, which contract requirements were not met by Colón. (Id. at 26:13-17.)
Colón filed a Charge of Discrimination [*13]  with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on November 2, 2005, alleging violations of the ADA and Title VII. (Docket No. 1, at 2, ¶ 4.) On October 10, 2006 Colón received a Notice of Right to Sue, dated September 29, 2006. (Id.)
On December 6, 2006, Colón successfully passed a Transportation Safety Officer ("TSO") Pre-Employment Medical Evaluation. The physician that performed the evaluation concluded: "Very good physical health except occasional bronchitis and controlled rheumatism." (Docket No. 72-20, at 7, ¶ 5.) Colón's expert, Dr. Luis Olivari, MD, contends that the duties of a TSO are similar to those of a Supervisory Detention Officer at MVM. (Id.) Dr. Olivari concludes that Colón falls under Class I of the "Criteria for Classification of Functional Status in Rheumatoid Arthritis" by the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria. (Id. at 6, ¶ 4.) Class I is for those "Completely able to perform usual activities of daily living (self-care, vocational, avocational)." (Id.) Finally, Colón successfully passed a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) at the Forensic Capacity Evaluation Center in San Juan. (Id. at 7, ¶ 6.) The conclusion of the FCE was that, "When considering [*14]  Ms. Colón [sic] former position as a Supervisory Detention Officer, she meets all the requirements and qualifies for all the essential functions of that job." (Id. ¶ 7.)
II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment "should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). It is therefore the moving party's burden to show "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc., 454 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). "A genuine issue exists when, based on the evidence, a reasonable jury could resolve the issue in favor of the non-moving party." Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc., 454 F.3d at 66 (citing Fajardo Shopping Ctr., S.E. v. Sun Alliance Ins. Co. of P.R., 167 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999)). "Further, a fact is material if it has the 'potential to affect the outcome of the suit.'" Id. (quoting Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000)). The facts are to be taken "in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. . . ." CMI Capital Mkt. Inv., LLC v. Gonzalez-Toro, 520 F.3d 58, 61 (1st Cir. 2008). "[T]he role of the court at the summary judgment stage is to 'examine[ ] the entire record "in the light most flattering to the nonmovant and indulge all reasonable inferences in that party's favor."'" Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc., 454 F.3d at 66 (quoting Cadle Co. v. Hayes, 116 F.3d 957, 959 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994)).
III. DISCUSSION
I note as a threshold matter that plaintiff's counsel [*15]  has violated no less than four of the Local Rules for the District Court of Puerto Rico. First, Local Rule 56(c) calls for a "short and concise" answer to a movant's statement of uncontested facts. Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, Local Rule 56(c) (2004). Plaintiff's counsel violated this rule by submitting a 25 page statement in response to defendant's statement, which was only 12 pages long. Second, Local Rule 7.1(e) provides that a "memorandum of law in support of or in opposition to . . . a motion for summary judgment . . . shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages." Local Rule 7.1(e). Plaintiff's counsel violated this rule by submitting a 29 page opposition memorandum. Third, Local Rule 7.1(e) also provides that "[a]ll memoranda shall be . . . in a font size . . . no less than twelve (12) points." Local Rule 7.1(e). Plaintiff's counsel violated this rule by submitting both an opposition memorandum and a surreply in an 11 point font. Finally, both plaintiff's and defendant's counsel violated Rules 7.1(c) and 7.1(e) by respectively submitting a surreply brief and a reply brief in excess of 10 pages. Local Rule 7.1(e) is "unambiguously clear." Ortiz v. Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Hotel, 422 F. Supp. 2d 336, 339 (D.P.R. 2006). I am within my rights to strike plaintiff's violative pleadings. Id. Rules are written to be followed. Counsel should be aware [*16]  that judges generally follow them and disfavor ignoring them.
A. ADA
Colón's primary cause of action is the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.2, a federal statute over which this court has subject matter jurisdiction. The purpose of the ADA is to bring about "the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities." Colón has satisfied the regulatory requirements of the ADA by first filing a charge with the EEOC and receiving notice of the right to sue. In order for her to establish a prima facie case under the ADA, she must establish:
(1) that [s]he suffers from a disability or handicap, as defined by the ADA . . ., that
(2) [s]he was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of [her] job, either with or without reasonable accommodation, and finally that
(3) [MVM]3 took an adverse employment action against [her] because of, in whole or in part, [her] protected disability.
Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Lessard v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 175 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 1999)); see also Rivera-Mercado v. Scotiabank de P.R.-Int'l, 571 F. Supp. 2d 279, 294 (D.P.R. 2008); Torres-Almán v. Verizon Wireless Puerto Rico, Inc., 522 F. Supp. 2d 367, 382 (D.P.R. 2007). Under the framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), Colón bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. If she is successful, the burden shifts to MVM "to 'articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision and to produce credible evidence [*17]  to show that the reason advanced was the real reason'." Freadman v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 105 (1st Cir. 2005)); see Rodriguez Diaz v. Big K-Mart, 582 F. Supp. 2d 147, 151 n.3 (D.P.R. 2008).
1. Disability
The first question is whether Colón qualifies as "disabled" under the ADA.
The term "disability" means, with respect to an individual-
(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;
(B) a record of such an impairment; or
(C) being regarded as having such an impairment. . . .
42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
Colón does not seriously contend that she is disabled under the first definition. Indeed, she asserts that her condition "doesn't prevent me from functioning in anything, okay? It's just -- again, it's just like saying, 'Well, I have a headache,' but you keep on working." (Docket No. 65-6, at 6:6-9.) Moreover, she states, "it has never, ever prevented me from -- I mean, from functioning in any way." (Id. at 6:12-13.) She says, "this is nothing." (Id. at 6:15-16.) Dr. Cardona essentially concurs with this assessment, as do Dr. Olivari and the Forensic Capacity Evaluation Center. Accordingly, Colón does not fit the definition of "disabled" under the first formulation of the definition.
The parties have devoted the majority of their arguments to addressing the third [*18]  formulation of the definition, and the issue of whether MVM regarded Colón as having an impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities. "The 'regarded as' prong of the Act 'exists to cover those cases in which myths, fears, and stereotypes affect the employer's treatment of an individual, because Congress has recognized that society's accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.'" Castro-Medina v. Procter & Gamble Commercial Co., 565 F. Supp. 2d 343, 365 (D.P.R. 2008) (quoting Ruiz Rivera v. Pfizer Pharms., LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 82-83 (1st Cir. 2008)). "[A] person is 'regarded as' disabled within the meaning of the ADA if a covered entity mistakenly believes that the person's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities." Murphy v. UPS, 527 U.S. 516, 521-22, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 144 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1999); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(l)(1). "[T]hese can be very fact-driven," Lessard v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., 175 F.3d at 199, "individualized inquir[ies]." Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d at 238. "[T]he mere fact that an employer is aware of an employee's impairment is insufficient to demonstrate either that the employer regarded the employee as disabled or that that perception caused the adverse employment action." Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 109 (3d Cir. 1996). "[I]t is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual . . . . These misperceptions often 'resul[t] from stereotypic assumptions not [*19]  truly indicative of . . . individual ability.'" Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999) (citations omitted).
Under the ADA, "working is a major life activity . . . ." Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp., 168 F.3d 538, 542 (1st Cir. 1999); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(I). Here, Colón alleges that she was regarded as limited in the activity of working at the SPC. (Docket No. 72, at 8, ¶ 2.) She thus satisfies the threshold requirement of alleging limitation in a major life activity, and the inquiry turns to the more complex question of whether she was perceived as "substantially limited" in that activity.
The First Circuit has adopted the EEOC's regulation defining "substantially limits" in the context of working as:
significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
Tardie v. Rehab. Hosp., 168 F.3d at 542 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)) (holding that "the fact that [the employer] may have regarded [the employee] as unable to work more than 40 hours per week, and thereby unable to perform her particular job, does not mean that [the employer] regarded her as being substantially limited in the major life activity [*20]  of working"). An employer that perceives the employee as being unable to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes regards the employee as disabled. Cook v. Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 10 F.3d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 1993)4.
Here, MVM contends that it merely made an objective decision to terminate Colón on the basis of its contract with ICE. By its own admission, however, MVM's project manager, Bazzi, agreed that Colón would not be able to perform "any other work position that required strenuous physical ability . . . ." (Docket No. 72-9, at 12:14-15) (emphasis added). Surely the subset of all jobs requiring "strenuous physical ability" is vast enough to constitute a "class of jobs" or a "broad range of jobs." See, e.g., Cook v. Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 10 F.3d at 25 (inability to perform positions such as "community living aide, nursing home aide, hospital aide, and home health care aide" constituted a "broad range" of jobs); 29 C.F.R. app. § 1630.2(j)(3) ("an individual who has a back condition that prevents the individual from performing any heavy labor job would be substantially limited in the major life activity of working because the individual's impairment eliminates his or her ability to perform a class of jobs. This would [*21]  be so even if the individual were able to perform jobs in another class, e.g., the class of semi-skilled jobs."); cf. Murphy v. UPS, 527 U.S. at 524 ("evidence that [an employee] is regarded as unable to meet the [Department of Transportation regulations for driving a commercial vehicle] is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether [the employee] is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills."). Thus, not only does Bazzi's admission underscore his belief that Colón was substantially impaired in the ability to perform her particular job, but it more importantly exposes his belief that Colón was incapable of performing a class or broad range of jobs.
Bazzi's statement is not to be taken as isolated or divergent from the opinion of MVM as a whole. Bazzi alone made the recommendation that Colón be terminated, and Evans stated that she would not question his recommendation; she and others in Human Resources were not "contract experts." (Docket No. 90-4, at 11:9.) Indeed, neither Evans nor Morales could even recall which provision of the contract Colón could not satisfy. In other words, it would appear that whatever recommendation Bazzi made was destined to dictate [*22]  Colón's fate. His regard for Colón therefore had more meaning than the regard that any other employee of the organization might have had for her. Bazzi's assessment of Colón arguably represented MVM's position as a whole. Accordingly, as Bazzi appears to have regarded Colón as substantially impaired, it would also be reasonable to conclude that MVM held this same regard.
MVM, however, seeks to use its contractual obligations to ICE as a shield. It contends that it was merely adhering to the contract in terminating Colón, but it cites no law to support the proposition that adherence to contractual obligations provides insulation from ADA liability. MVM also baldly concludes that allowing Colón to continue working "would have constituted a violation of the Contract" (Docket No. 66, at 20, ¶ 2), where there is no certainty in such a conclusion. First of all, it would be reasonable to conclude that the more strenuous physical requirements of a Detention Officer do not apply to a Supervisory Detention Officer such as Colón. Indeed, the section of the contract defining the duties of a Supervisory Detention Officer contains none of the physical requisites enumerated in the section on Detention [*23]  Officers. (Docket No. 65-4, at 6.) Even assuming, arguendo, that Colón were bound by the provisions governing ordinary Detention Officers, it is still unclear that her continued employment would have violated those provisions. Page C-36 of the contract provides that "Detention Officers shall not have . . . skeletal, or other physical defects that would impair his/her ability to perform effectively in either normal or emergency situations." (Docket No. 65-4, at 17, ¶ 4) (emphasis added). While it is undisputed that Colón suffered from a skeletal defect, there is no empirical evidence that her disease impaired her ability to perform effectively in any situation. Rather, the evidence is that she has always performed her job in a satisfactory fashion, and that she even earned a promotion within one month of starting her job at MVM. Thus, MVM has no basis to rely on its contract with MVM as a defense, and even if it did, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the contract did not obligate MVM to terminate Colón. Accordingly, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MVM regarded Colón as significantly restricted in her ability to perform a broad range of jobs.
As [*24]  to the final definition of "disabled" under the ADA, the issue is whether there was a "record of" Colón's impairment. The parties did not seriously address this issue. "To have a record of . . . an impairment, a plaintiff must have a history of, or been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limited a major life activity." Castro-Medina v. Procter & Gamble Commercial Co., 565 F. Supp. 2d at 364 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(k)). "[T]o successfully establish an ADA claim the employee, in making the employment decision, must rely on the record indicating that the plaintiff has or had a substantially limiting impairment." Castro-Medina v. Procter & Gamble Commercial Co., 565 F. Supp. 2d at 365 (quoting Rivera-Mercado v. Scotiabank de P.R.-Int'l, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 287). Dr. Maduro submitted a report and a letter to Mr. Bazzi at MVM concluding that Colón suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and deeming her unfit to work. (Docket Nos. 65-10 & 65-20.) It would be reasonable to conclude that Bazzi relied on these submissions in formulating his decision to recommend that Colón be terminated. There remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Bazzi and the rest of the relevant MVM personnel relied in part on these records in terminating Colón.
2. Discrimination
MVM contends that it was simply relying on the opinion of an independent medical examiner in its decision to terminate [*25]  Colón, and that it therefore had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating Colón. This claim goes to the second element of Colón's ADA claim: whether she was terminated because of her disability. Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 29 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 802-05). "This showing is easily made, and, once achieved, triggers a presumption of discrimination. At that point, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d at 30 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). "The trier of fact then focuses on the main event: deciding whether the evidence adduced is sufficient to sustain a finding of discriminatory intent on the part of the defendant." Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d at 30 (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)).
"[A]n employer cannot insulate itself from liability under the ADA merely by asserting its belief that a[n] . . . employee's known disability will limit her ability to perform a particular job to such an extent as to disqualify her from employment." Id. at 29. Both Bazzi and Morales testified that they would not question the opinion of a doctor, who in this case opined that the employee's known disability disqualified her from employment. [*26]  This may well have been their honest belief, but "[e]ven if the employer's belief is honestly held, on particular facts a jury still might conclude that it rested on an unfounded stereotype (and, therefore constituted discrimination)." Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., 283 F.3d at 29 (citing Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2002)). It is true that "obtaining a physician's detailed assessment and then acting in accordance with it can be persuasive evidence that an employer has based its decision on an individualized inquiry into the applicant's capabilities. But a physician's endorsement does not provide complete insulation. An employer cannot evade its obligations under the ADA by contracting out personnel functions to third parties . . . ." Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., 283 F.3d at 31 (internal citations omitted). "While an employer need not be unfailingly correct in its assumptions, its subjective beliefs about an applicant's limitations must have a sufficient factual foundation to make them objectively reasonable." Id. at 33 (citing Cook v. Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 10 F.3d at 26-27). The Gillen court held:
The short of it is that a medical opinion is often cogent evidence of nondiscriminatory intent-in some instances, it may even be enough to justify summary judgment-but the mere obtaining of such an opinion does not automatically absolve the employer from liability [*27]  under the ADA. Cf. Bragdon [v. Abbott], 524 U.S. [624,] 650, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 [(1998)] (emphasizing that "courts should assess the objective reasonableness of the views of health care professionals without deferring to their individual judgments"). Thus, an employer cannot slavishly defer to a physician's opinion without first pausing to assess the objective reasonableness of the physician's conclusions.
Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., 283 F.3d at 31-32 (some internal citations omitted) (employer not entitled to summary judgment against employee's ADA claim that she was wrongly denied employment where doctor had concluded that she could not perform the essential functions of an Emergency Medical Technician because she was a genetic amputee without the use of one arm).
Here, MVM contracted out a personnel function to a third party, Dr. Maduro. MVM's employees admit that they accepted Dr. Maduro's opinion without questioning it. There are, however, reasons to question the physician's conclusions and MVM's ultimate reliance on them. For one, it appears that Colón had adequately performed her job as a Detention Officer for U.S. Premier for some number of years before MVM replaced U.S. Premier. Also, Dr. Cardona found in his pre-employment examination of Colón in June 2003 that Colón was qualified [*28]  for the job, and this occurred just four months before Colón began working for MVM. Dr. Cardona later reaffirmed this assessment when he found Colón "completely fit to work under treatment and medical evaluation." Additionally, Colón performed her job at MVM without any complaints about her, and was even promoted within one month of being there. Beyond these facts are the circumstances of Dr. Maduro's examination itself. In performing his evaluation of Colón, Dr. Maduro did not even indicate what disqualifying defect Colón had on the SF-88 form. Dr. Maduro also admitted that Colón successfully completed the physical portion of his examination, inducing him to observe that she did not exhibit any "pain, stiffness, or swelling." (Docket No. 65-8, at 1, ¶ 4.) Finally, Colón has submitted evidence that she successfully qualified to be a Transportation Safety Officer, and also passed a Functional Capacity Evaluation. In light of all the foregoing factors, genuine questions remain as to the material fact of the reasonableness of Dr. Maduro's assessment of Colón and, and of MVM's readiness to accept it unquestioningly. There is yet uncertainty as to whether MVM terminated Colón due to simple [*29]  misperceptions about her arthritic condition.
3. Ability to Perform
The remaining element of Colón's ADA claim is her ability to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without reasonable accommodation. Colón admittedly never requested a reasonable accommodation. She accordingly has no cause of action for MVM's failure to provide one. Castro-Medina v. Procter & Gamble Commercial Co., 565 F. Supp. 2d at 376-77 (quoting Freadman v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d at 102-03) ("[Plaintiff's] accommodation claim nevertheless founders due to her failure to produce evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the employer was put on notice of a 'sufficiently direct and specific' request for her desired accommodation."). The inquiry thus becomes whether Colón was capable of performing the essential functions of her job without any accommodation. MVM does not argue that Colón was incapable of performing the essential functions of her job. (Docket No. 66.) The following is from José Morales' deposition:
Q: But at the time that Dr. Maduro offered his opinion, you knew that Ms. Colón had been performing all the essential functions of her -- of her job, correct?
A: To my knowledge, there was no complaint about that.
(Docket No. 72-17, at 5:3-8.) Furthermore, the testimony of Mr. Nelson Rivera, Colon's [*30]  Senior Supervising Detention Officer, was the following:
Q: [S]he never had any difficulty while she was at present at M.V.M. with, perform the duties . . .
A: That is correct.
Q: . . . of her position? Is that correct?
A: That is correct
(Docket No. 83-2, at 3-4.) These statements, the fact that MVM does not contest this issue, and the fact that Colón was deemed fit for duty by certain doctors all raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Colón's qualifications for her job. I recommend that MVM's motion for summary judgment be denied as to Colón's ADA claim.
B. State Law Claims
In addition to her ADA claim, Colón alleges that MVM violated Puerto Rico's Act No. 44 of July 2, 1985, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 501 et seq.; Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 5141; and Puerto Rico's Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185(a) et seq. MVM, however, asserts that Puerto Rico law cannot apply to this action because the land upon which Colón's claims accrued is allegedly a "federal enclave."
Under the United States Constitution, Congress has the:
Power to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the [*31]  United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the States in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.
Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., 997 F. Supp. 196, 199-200 (D.P.R. 1998) (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 17). Under this provision, "federal ownership of land within a state does not, without more, imply either a total or partial corresponding transfer of jurisdiction[.]" Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 200. Rather, a "state's consent to exclusive federal jurisdiction over the land acquired" by the United States is required, and "the federal government 'must indicate acceptance [of exclusive jurisdiction] to the governor of the state.'" Id. at 201 (quoting United States v. Johnson, 994 F.2d 980, 984 (2d Cir. 1993)). "The federal government may so indicate either formally, such as by proclamation, or 'by such manner as may be prescribed by the laws of the State where such lands are situated.'" Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 201 (quoting 40 U.S.C. § 255).
"'On July 27, 1945, the [United States] Secretary of War accepted by letter exclusive jurisdiction over all lands conveyed to the United States for which such jurisdiction had not been accepted' under 40 U.S.C. § 255, and 'on August 10, 1945, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed this letter, confirming the Secretary of War's acceptance of jurisdiction.'" Id. (quoting [*32]  People v. Koedel, 927 F.2d 662, 664-65 (1st Cir. 1991). "If [the land in question] was acquired prior to the Secretary of War's letter of July 27, 1945, that letter constitutes formal acceptance under § 255." Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 201.
MVM submits a map of the Aguadilla area, which is partitioned into subsections labeled with different letters. (Docket No. 65-5, at 6.) MVM also presents an affidavit signed by Bazzi, whose sworn testimony is that the SPC is located in an area marked "A." (Id. at 3.) The legend to the map indicates that the land marked "A" was acquired by "Condemnation Proceedings No. 25-18 - Law Filed December 6, 1939." (Id. at 7.) Colón does not directly deny this averment, but rather states in response to MVM's statement of uncontested facts that "[t]he proposed evidence also reveals that apparently the piece of land where the SPC is now located matched up at some point with what was back in 1939 identified as Area Code A. Whether the United States Government is still in possession of that specific portion of land is precisely the information that is missing . . . ." (Docket No. 72-2, at 24.) Colón having failed to contest Bazzi's contention, I therefore find that the land on which the SPC rests was in fact acquired in 1939. Accordingly, the United States acquired [*33]  exclusive jurisdiction over the land in section A of the map, including the SPC.
This does not, however, conclude the inquiry, because it is still possible for the United States to relinquish exclusive legislative jurisdiction. In 1970, Congress passed legislation providing that:
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary concerned may . . . relinquish to a . . . Commonwealth . . . of the United States, all or part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over lands or interests under his control in that . . . Commonwealth . . . . Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction . . . may be accomplished . . . as the laws of the . . . Commonwealth . . . may otherwise provide.
10 U.S.C. § 2683(a) (emphasis added); People, Puerto Rico v. Koedel, 927 F.2d at 665 n.4. At the time the United States accepted exclusive jurisdiction over the Ramey Air Force Base, the applicable Puerto Rico Commonwealth law was the Act of Febebruary 16, 1903, which provided the means by which the United States might forfeit exclusive jurisdiction over land that it had obtained from Puerto Rico: "upon the subsequent alienation by the United States of any land so acquired, the People of Porto Rico shall again have jurisdiction thereover." [*34]  1903 P.R. Laws, at 110, § 5; Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 200. Under this statute, it is necessary to inquire whether the United States has retained possession of the land upon which the SPC sits since originally obtaining exclusive jurisdiction.
I find that the United States Government has retained such possession. Colón argues otherwise, but with no evidentiary support. Documents obtained by Freedom of Information Act Request, which evidence communications between the United States General Services Administration ("GSA") and the United States Immigration and Naturalization Services ("INS") (the predecessor to ICE), refute Colón's stance. They show that, in 1990, a structure known as "Building 505," located at the former Ramey Air Force Base, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, was acquired by INS from GSA for use "as a detention center for illegal aliens pending their deportation." (Docket No. 65-23, at 6-7.) Given the similarities between "Building 505" and the SPC's address at 505 Gun Road, as well as the fact that the structure in question was to a be a detention center for illegal aliens, it is clear that the building referred to was the SPC, and that it has remained the property of the United States. (Docket No. 65-23, at 1, ¶ 2) (GSA's Real Property [*35]  Disposal Division "infer[s] from the similar building number and the street address that the property is the same as that referenced in [defense counsel's] inquiry").
Further inquiry is necessary, however, due to Puerto Rico's enactment in 1955 of a statute repealing the Act of 1903. The section titled "Reversion of jurisdiction to Commonwealth" provides that:
In the event that the United States ceases to be the proprietor of the lands or to be in possession of same, or in the event that they are not used for the purposes for which they were acquired, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico shall again have jurisdiction over the same.
P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 28, § 57 (emphasis added). Thus, the present Puerto Rico law requires not only that the United States retain possession of the land in question, but also that it use such land for the purpose for which it was acquired. The First Circuit has found that "[i]t is common ground" that the letter of the Secretary of War on July 27, 1945 "accept[ed] exclusive jurisdiction over all lands in Puerto Rico theretofore transferred to the United States for military purposes and as to which jurisdiction had not previously been accepted." Torrens v. Lockheed Martin Servs. Group, Inc., 396 F.3d 468, 471 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 200-01) (emphasis added). Here, it is this letter [*36]  upon which MVM relies to establish that the SPC rests in a federal enclave. MVM provides no evidence that the United States might have accepted jurisdiction upon some prior occasion. Accordingly, MVM is essentially arguing that jurisdiction over the land was accepted for military purposes, and I will therefore treat it as such given the dearth of any evidence or argument to the contrary.5 The question is therefore whether the SPC and the land upon which it rests continue to be used for military purposes. I conclude that they are not. See Puerto Rico v. Muskie, 507 F. Supp. 1035, 1060 (D.P.R. 1981) (holding, where Fort Allen, located in Puerto Rico, was to be used as temporary housing for Cuban and Haitian refugees, that "[t]he presently intended purpose of Fort Allen hardly classifie[d] it as a 'defense establishment.'") Indeed, MVM itself refers to the area as the "former U.S. Air Force Ramey Base. . . ." (Docket No. 66, at 22) (emphasis added). It also refers to the map as "showing the territory where the former Ramey Base was located . . . ." (Id.) (emphasis added). Finally, of the more than 2,700 acres originally contained within the Air Force Base (Docket No. 65-5, at 4, 7), 2,483.42 were given away to non-military pursuits between 1978 [*37]  and 1989. (Docket No. 65-5, at 8.) Accordingly, the land is no longer used for the purpose for which it was originally acquired, and the United States no longer has exclusive jurisdiction there if Puerto Rico's 1955 Act controls.
The key issue is therefore whether the Commonwealth law to be applied under 10 U.S.C. § 2683 is the 1903 Act or the 1955 Act. It is not a matter as simple as applying the more recent law, the law that in fact abrogated the older law. This is because "under the principal of 'federal enclave jurisdiction,' state law extant at the time of cession of exclusive legislative jurisdiction over a parcel of land by a state to the federal government still applies to the enclave until a federal law abrogates the state law." Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 205 (quoting James Stewart & Co. v. Sadrakula, 309 U.S. 94, 99, 60 S. Ct. 431, 84 L. Ed. 596 (1940)); Kelly v. Lockheed Martin Servs. Group, 25 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.P.R. 1998) (citing Celli v. Shoell, 40 F.3d 324, 328 n.4 (10th Cir. 1994)) ("the status quo at the time the federal enclave became an enclave is maintained no matter how much time has passed since the creation of the enclave, unless Congress acts to change the status quo."). Under this formulation, there is reason to treat the Ramey enclave as if locked in a time capsule, and not subject to any Puerto Rico laws passed subsequent to 1939. Such treatment would compel a finding that the 1903 Act controls.
However, the state [*38]  law extant in 1939 only applies to the extent it is not abrogated by federal law, and federal law provides the following:
[Exclusive federal jurisdiction] is necessarily temporary, to be exercised only so long as the places continue to be used for the public purposes for which the property was acquired or reserved from sale. When they cease to be thus used, the jurisdiction reverts to the State.
Atl. Marine Corps Cmtys., LLC v. Onslow County, 497 F. Supp. 2d 743, 755 (E.D.N.C. 2007) (quoting Fort Leavenworth R.R. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, 542, 5 S. Ct. 995, 29 L. Ed. 264 (1885)). Federal law also holds that "[t]he sovereignty of the United States over property acquired pursuant to Clause 17 [of Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution] ends with the reasons for the existence of the power and the disposition of the property." United States v. Goings, 504 F.2d 809, 811 (8th Cir. 1974) (citing S.R.A. v. Minnesota, 327 U.S. 558, 564, 66 S. Ct. 749, 90 L. Ed. 851 (1946)). In order to revest jurisdiction in a state, "the land must no longer be under the ultimate control of the federal government ready for use when needed for the military purposes for which it was dedicated." United States v. Goings, 504 F.2d at 812 (finding that "[w]hether the United States will ever exercise the reserved right to use the lands during periods of emergency is a contingency too remote for prediction," that "the United States no longer holds the property intact dedicated to the purposes and objects of Clause 17," and that, therefore, "[j]urisdiction must revert to the State."). Clearly, the [*39]  current federal law is in keeping with Puerto Rico's Act of 1955, and not with that of 1903. This is consistent with the case law of this court. Koren v. Martin Marietta Servs., Inc., 997 F. Supp. at 207 ("[T]he Court believes it would be discrepant to apply today to a federal enclave acquired in 1955 a state law enacted in 1917 if the state itself repealed that law in 1956."). Accordingly, I find that the United States relinquished exclusive jurisdiction over the land of the Ramey Air Force Base, including the SPC, when it ceased using such land for the military purposes for which it was originally accepted exclusive jurisdiction.
Having determined that Puerto Rico law applies to the SPC and the land on which it sits, I entertain the state law causes of action raised by Colón. First, I recommend that MVM's motion as to Law 44 be denied, as Law 44 is "the Puerto Rico law counterpart to the ADA." Ruiz Rivera v. Pfizer Pharms., LLC., 521 F.3d at 80 & 87 (finding that "Law 44 and the ADA are coterminous" and therefore dismissing the same claims under both). Law 44 was intended by the Puerto Rico legislature to be substantially the same as the ADA. Berríos v. Bristol Myers Squibb P.R., Inc., 51 F. Supp. 2d 61, 67 (D.P.R. 1999) (citing 1991 P.R. Laws 105; Ríos Jaimán v. Cidra Mfg. Operations of P.R., Inc., 98 TSPR 74, 1998 TSPR No. 74, 145 P.R. Dec. 746, 98 J.T.S. 73 (1998)) ("[t]he Puerto Rico legislature, by amending Law 44 in late 1991, sought to accommodate local law with the Americans with Disabilities Act, [*40]  its federal counterpart."). As MVM is not entitled to summary judgment with respect to the ADA, so too is it precluded from such a judgment with respect to Law 44.
Colón's next claim is under Puerto Rico's Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185(a) et seq. "Law 80 prohibits dismissal of employees without just cause." Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'n, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 28 (1st Cir. 1998)) (finding no violation of Law 80 where plaintiff had failed to refrain from contact with a co-worker whom he had allegedly sexually harassed) . "Under Law 80, once an employee proves that he was discharged and alleges that his dismissal was unjustified, his employer must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the discharge was for good cause." Id. Here, there is no dispute that Colón was discharged, and Colón has alleged that her dismissal was unjustified. (Docket No. 1, at 16-17.) MVM therefore bears the burden of establishing that Colón was terminated for good cause. MVM's reason for dismissing Colón is clear: that she did "not fulfill the physical health conditions required to work at ICE PR contract [sic]." (Docket 83-3.) She "was not terminated for excessive absenteeism." (Docket No. 65-15, at 2, ¶ 3.) Section 185(b) of Law 80 provides an exhaustive list of what constitutes "good cause" for the [*41]  discharge of an employee. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b. The most closely applicable source of good cause enumerated is "the attitude of the employee of not performing his work in an efficient manner, or of doing it belatedly and negligently or in violation of the standards of quality of the product produced or handled by the establishment." Id. § (b). Here, Colón performed her job sufficiently well to be promoted within a month of her hiring by MVM. MVM does not allege that she performed her work belatedly or negligently or at a low standard. Perceived physical inability to perform the expected duties, absent actual empirical evidence of such inability, is not listed as constituting good cause. Thus, it is recommended that MVM's motion be denied as to this cause of action.
Finally, I recommend that Colón's claims under Article 1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code also be permitted to proceed. "Discrimination in employment is a recognized cause of action under Article 1802, Puerto Rico's general torts statute." Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'n, Inc., 488 F.3d at 6-7 (citing Adams v. Corporate Realty Servs., Inc., 190 F. Supp. 2d 272, 279 (D.P.R.2002)); see also Toro Cotto v. Liga Puertorriquena Contra El Cancer, No. 04-1285(HL), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10434, 2007 WL 527661, at *6 (D.P.R. Feb. 14, 2007) (in light of testimony establishing mental suffering, damages warranted under Article 1802 for "defendants' negligence in not adhering to the ADA provisions . . . ."). As Colón has alleged [*42]  that MVM's negligence has caused her damages, her claim under Article 1802 survive an attempt at summary disposition.
IV. CONCLUSION
There remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MVM regarded Colón as unable to perform a broad range of jobs, and whether it terminated her on that basis. MVM also fails to establish that the SPC is on land subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction, meaning that Colón's state law claims may proceed as well, inasmuch as they still bear genuine issues of material fact. Accordingly, it is recommended that MVM's motion for summary judgment be DENIED as to all of Colón's claims.
Under the provisions of Rule 72(d), Local Rules, District of Puerto Rico, any party who objects to this report and recommendation must file a written objection thereto with the Clerk of this Court within ten (10) days of the party's receipt of this report and recommendation.
