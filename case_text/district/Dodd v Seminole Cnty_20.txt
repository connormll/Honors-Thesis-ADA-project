Opinion



ORDER
Plaintiff Susan Dodd moves for partial summary judgment. (Doc. 24 ("Dodd's Motion").) Defendant Seminole County, Florida ("Seminole") moves for summary judgment. (Doc. 25 ("Seminole's Motion").) The parties responded and replied. (Docs. 26-29.) On review, Dodd's Motion is granted, and Seminole's Motion is granted in part.

BACKGROUND1
This action concerns Dodd's employment and her agoraphobia. (See Doc. 1.) Dodd stopped driving in the late 1980s after fainting incidents. (Doc. 25-1, pp. 18:9-12, 21:1-22:6.) The fainting stopped but then Dodd developed agoraphobia. (Id. at 21:15-22:3.) Her agoraphobia causes panic attacks and anxiety. (Id. at 22:15-19.) She has not driven since. (Id. at 18:9-12.)
In September 2014, Dodd began working as a Recreation Specialist for Seminole. (Id. at 83:9-14.) She reported to Eric Klotz (then-Assistant Park Supervisor) and [*2]  Cindy Harkins (then-Park Supervisor). (Id. at 89:3-12; Doc. 25-3, p. 11:19-21.) In September 2015, Harkins notified Seminole of her intent to retire. (Doc. 25-2, p. 46:3-8.) Klotz was promoted to fill her spot, leaving a vacancy in Klotz's position. (Doc. 25-1, p. 97:1-5; Doc. 25-3, p. 22:11-13.) So in October 2015, Seminole posted a job opening for the Assistant Park Supervisor position. (Doc. 25-4, pp. 28-30.2 ) The posting stated applicants may be required to maintain a driver's license and asked applicants if they possessed and could maintain one. (Id.) Dodd applied for the position and answered "no" to that question. (Doc. 24-1, pp. 2-3 ¶¶ 7, 17; cf. Doc. 24-1, pp. 6-7 ¶¶ 7, 17.)

I. Friday
Seminole selected ten candidates to interview for the position, including Dodd. (Doc. 25-4, pp. 26-27.) The candidates were all interviewed on the same day—Friday, November 20, 2015. (Id.) The interview panel included Manager of Recreation Programming Robin "Shorty" Robbins, Park Supervisor Thomas Kelly, Park Supervisor Joseph Tilton, and Klotz. (Doc. 25-3, pp. 64:25-65:5; Doc. 25-4, p. 7:21; Doc. 25-5, p. 9:3-5; Doc. 25-6, p. 7:8-9; Doc. 25-7, p. 7:9-13.) Robbins led the panel and reported to [*3]  the Director of Leisure Services Joe Abel, who had the final decision-making authority on hiring. (Doc. 25-2, p. 46:15-19; Doc. 25-3, pp. 134:6-13, 145:12-20; Doc. 25-8, ¶ 2.)
During the interview, the panel did not ask Dodd about her ability to drive, nor did she tell the panel about her agoraphobia. (Doc. 24-2, p. 133:1-4; Doc. 25-9, pp. 131:10-13, 132:12-25.) Kelly did not know Dodd did not drive. (Doc. 25-6, p. 98:6-8.) Tilton did not recall any discussion of Dodd not driving. (Doc. 25-7, p. 58:1-9.) Robbins thought Dodd chose not to drive but could get a license if needed.3 (Doc. 25-4, p. 38:21-22.) Klotz knew Dodd did not drive—but he did not know why. (Doc. 25-9, p. 131:10-17.)
Right after Dodd's interview, at 3:04 p.m., Robbins emailed Human Resources ("HR"), communicating with Christina Brandolini:
Robbins: If [Dodd] ends up being our choice what is the timeline that we need and in what order does she need to get her driver's license? Before or after promotion . . .
Brandolini: What will the position entail? Are you planning to utilize the position to drive and if so what percentage of the job will require driving?
Robbins: We have two sites and it will involve driving between the [*4]  two. She used to have a driver's license so getting it back should not be a problem.
Brandolini: Since there will be some driving requirements with this position, she will need to have her driver's license prior to the promotion if [Dodd] is selected.
(Doc. 25-3, pp. 43-44; Doc. 26-3, pp. 47:17-18, 48:7-10; see also Doc. 25-4, p. 26.)4
After all the interviews were complete, the panelists discussed the candidates. (Doc. 25-5, pp. 9:25-10:10.) They were split on whom to select. (See id. at 11:9-18.) Klotz thought Dodd should get the position. (Id. at 11:14-15.) Kelly and Tilton believed Michael Baker should get it. (Id. at 11:12-13.) And Robbins thought Steven McKinney should get it. (Doc. 25-4, p. 120:3-6.) Robbins then asked Abel to join the panel's discussion. (Doc. 25-5, p. 11:19-25.) Abel got feedback from the panel on each finalist and directed the panelists not to talk to the candidates until a decision was made. (Id. at 12:1-5, 14:18-20.)
The resolution of this meeting is disputed. Abel says the panel could not agree, so he told them he would think about it over the weekend and give them his decision on Monday. (Id. at 14:4-9.) But Klotz and Kelly say by the end of the meeting, they [*5]  believed Dodd had been selected for the position. (Doc. 25-6, p. 33:3-9; Doc. 26-1, pp. 78:15-79:15.) Klotz remembers Robbins calling HR while Klotz was present and telling HR that Dodd was chosen for the position. (Doc. 26-1, pp. 80:13-23, 122:23-123:9.) Robbins instructed Klotz to discuss with HR whether they could offer Dodd the position contingent on her obtaining a driver's license.5 (Doc. 25-6, p. 34:4-8; Doc. 26-1, p. 80:19-21; Doc. 26-2, p. 61:3-5; Doc. 26-3, p. 24:2-8.)
That evening following the interviews, Klotz talked to Dodd about her interview.6 (Doc. 24-2, p. 134:2; Doc. 24-3, p. 87:8-13.) Klotz told her the interview went well and while he could not offer her the job, Dodd was selected for the position on the condition she either get a driver's license or ask for a reasonable accommodation because Robbins would not let her refuse to drive for no reason. (Doc. 24-2, p. 134:16-22; Doc. 24-3, p. 88:11-15; Doc. 25-9, p. 164:14-18.) He asked her whether she could get a license. (Doc. 24-3, p. 88:16-17.) And she told him she would ask for an accommodation. (Doc. 24-2, p. 134:23-24.) Klotz said he would get with HR on Monday and have everything taken care of. (Id. at 135:1-3.) [*6] 

II. Monday
Over the weekend, Abel says he contemplated the candidates. (Doc. 25-8, ¶ 4.) He contends he was ultimately persuaded by Tilton's and Kelly's recommendations of Baker as they were the most experienced park supervisors on the panel. (Id. ¶ 5.) Early Monday morning, Abel claims he told Robbins his stance on Baker and solicited her feedback. (Id. ¶ 8; Doc. 25-5, p. 17:17-24.) Abel says Robbins was on board, so he told her to move forward with the Baker selection. (Doc. 25-5, p. 18:1-4.)
That same morning, Klotz called Brandolini to let her know Dodd would likely submit a request for a reasonable accommodation.7 (Doc. 25-3, p. 220:2-23.) Brandolini then emailed Robbins, copying Abel:
Brandolini: I was told that the driver's license was a requirement for the position when it was first posted but was then removed in anticipation of [Dodd] applying and since she did not have her driver's license at the time, it was removed to enable her more time to obtain it. Last week the question was raised about when she [would] need it since there would be driving with the position. I just received a call from the park supervisor that she would not have to drive.
Robbins: The requirement was not [*7]  lifted for [Dodd], I asked that her application be allowed through because she should be able to get her driver's license if chosen for the position. I would not support hiring someone without a Driver's License, and [Klotz] was told this. I will clarify again with him, but we are not flexible on this issue.
(Id. at 40.)
Around 2:00 p.m., Klotz met Dodd at the bus stop when she arrived for work and told her Robbins would not give her the job unless she got a driver's license. (Doc. 24-2, p. 146:1-8.) While Dodd was with him, Klotz called Robbins to ask for a reasonable accommodation for Dodd, but Robbins said Dodd would have to get a license. (Id. at 146:10-19; Doc. 24-4, pp. 26:18-27:3.)
About two and a half hours later, Robbins emailed Klotz, copying Abel:
After considering the interviews and reviewing all comments made by the interview team over the weekend, I had some second thoughts about our selection on Friday for the Assistant Supervisor position. Based on the interview sheets, it would appear that Mike Baker was the top choice by two of the reviewers . . . [and would be] the top pick for the job. [Dodd] would have been third and possibly fourth without your advocacy.
In light [*8]  of this, and after conversation and confirmation from our Director who also thought about it all weekend, we have decided to make the offer to Mike Baker. Susan Dodd is a valuable asset to the team as a Recreation Specialist at the softball complex, but does not have the education level, qualifications or skill set to fill the job of Assistant Supervisor at a general level as required by the job description.
Further, it was made clear at Friday's wrap-up with [Abel] that you were to contact HR regarding and resolve the issue with [Dodd's] driver's license prior to discussing with [Dodd]. Indicating to [Brandolini] that she wouldn't need to drive is not a resolution to this, as I clearly indicated on Friday that this was a necessary component of the job. If you recall, I also indicated that on Nov 9th when you and [Harkins] let me know why she wasn't on the approved list for interviews. At that time you assured me that it would not be a problem.
If you indicated to [Dodd] today or Friday that she was our choice, you went outside of the direction you were given by [Abel] and myself on Friday. It concerns me that she apparently responded to you with requesting "reasonable accommodation" [*9]  when an offer was not to be made.
I know I indicated that you had more of a say in this decision than the other members of the panel because the position reports to you and you have [your] vision for the facility. However the rest of the panel feels overwhelming in favor of another candidate and that would be Mike Baker. I will be making a position offer to him tomorrow. You may have your choice of him or Gary Kines in the Softball Complex Assistant position.
(Doc. 25-3, pp. 45-46.)
About twenty minutes later, Dodd emailed Brandolini:
I understand that I was chosen to be Assistant Park Supervisor for the Seminole County Softball Complex where I am currently employed on the condition I obtain a driver's license. At this time I do not have one and I am formally requesting a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. I have been here for 14 months and driving has never been an issue.
(Doc. 25-11, p. 4.) A short while later, Dodd sent the same email to Robbins. (See Doc. 24-2, p. 10.) Brandolini also forwarded Dodd's email to Robbins and Abel, stating:
Brandolini: We will have to discuss the reasonableness of the request as it pertains to the essential functions of the position:
Robbins: [Abel] [*10]  and I have made the decision to offer this to someone else and [Klotz] has been advised of this. This email confirms that [Klotz] did discuss this with [Dodd] when he was told not to.
Brandolini: If you all would like to discuss this I am available, but all the candidates, including [Dodd] should be advised that those with decision making authority for this position are still evaluating the candidates and no definitive selection has been made and no notice of selection is submitted.
(Doc. 25-11, p. 4.)

III. The Fallout
Tuesday morning, Klotz responded to Robbins' email from the previous afternoon about the Baker selection, copying Abel. (Doc. 25-3, p. 45.) Klotz disagreed with Robbins' assessment of Dodd's qualifications, reminding her he had asked the panel, and everyone agreed she was qualified. (Id.) Klotz also disputed what Robbins had told him on Friday:
[A]fter you got off the phone with HR informing them that [Dodd] would be the choice we had talked about whether the position should require a license. You said you were told we would have to instruct HR that it was not part of the job description and you said that accommodation is one thing, but you were not okay with someone making [*11]  the personal choice not to drive. You instructed me to get with HR on Monday to work out the license situation before offering the position.
To my mind, there was only one way it could have been worked out at this point. That would have been for me to tell HR that [Dodd] said she was going to get her license. I told [Dodd] that I was not offering the position to her, but that a driver's license was required for the position and she would have to obtain it to be able to be hired in the position. She, at that point, requested the ADA reasonable accommodation. I then called HR as directed to update on the status of [Dodd's] license. If she had said she would have no problem and "I'll get it" we would have gone forward without incident so it was reasonable for me to go to [Dodd] and find out if she would comply before contacting HR. Otherwise, we would have been at the same point when you got off the phone with them on Friday.
(Id.)
Later that morning, Robbins responded to Dodd's email of the previous afternoon requesting an accommodation:
Robbins: I regret any misunderstanding that has occurred through any discussion of this position with you outside of the interview process. [Klotz] does [*12]  not have the final decision making authority for this position. We are still evaluating the candidates and no notice of selection has been submitted.
Dodd: There is no misunderstanding. I was told if I got my license the job was mine. It is a fact that you called HR on Friday November 20th that I was the choice for Assistant Park Supervisor. During that phone call the drivers license was discussed. I had formally requested a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.
Robbins: [Dodd], you were misinformed. I did not call HR on Friday, and I did not indicate to them that you were the final choice.
(Doc. 24-2, pp. 8-9.)
Tuesday afternoon, Robbins emailed Klotz, copying Abel and Brandolini:
Just to follow up with our discussion this afternoon—The final decision on the position will be made by Joe Abel and myself. The process then involves HR and a notice of selection. After that is complete, then a formal offer is made through HR. Please do not have any further conversation with [Dodd] or any of the other candidates from this point on. We will pick this up again next week when I get back from the holiday weekend.
(Doc. 26-5, p. 2.)
Michael Baker was hired for the Assistant Park Supervisor position. [*13]  (Doc. 24-1, p. 4 ¶ 36; cf. Doc. 24-1, p. 10 ¶ 36.) On November 25, 2015, after learning she would not be offered the position, Dodd submitted a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). (Doc. 24-2, p. 173:14-18, pp. 14-15.) A year later, Dodd quit. (Doc. 25-9, p. 191:14-15.)
Dodd sued Seminole for discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and Florida Civil Rights Act ("FCRA"), violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and breach of contract. (Doc. 1.) She moves for partial summary judgment on one of Seminole's defenses, and on elements of her retaliation claim. (Doc. 24.) Seminole moves for summary judgment on all of Dodd's claims. (Doc. 25.) With briefing complete (Docs. 26-29), the matter is ripe.

STANDARDS
Summary judgment is appropriate only "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). As to issues for which the movant would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and support its motion with credible evidence showing that no reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party on the essential [*14]  elements of its case. Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop. in Green & Tuscaloosa Cntys., 941 F.2d 1428, 1438 (11th Cir. 1991)).
As to issues for which the nonmovant would have to prove the movant has two options: (1) it may simply point out an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case; or (2) it may provide "affirmative evidence demonstrating that the nonmoving party will be unable to prove its case at trial." Four Parcels, 941 F.2d at 1438 (citing Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325). "The burden then shifts to the non-moving party, who must go beyond the pleadings and present affirmative evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists." Porter v. Ray, 461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006).
"A factual dispute is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Four Parcels, 941 F.2d at 1437 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, Battle v. Bd. of Regents, 468 F.3d 755, 759 (11th Cir. 2006), so that "when conflicts arise between the facts evidenced by the parties, [the court] credit[s] the nonmoving party's version," Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir. 2005).

ANALYSIS

I. Discrimination (ADA & FCRA)
Dodd brings disability discrimination claims under the ADA and FCRA, arguing Seminole did not promote her because of her disability.8 (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 27-38, 53-63.) The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies to ADA claims.9 See Barber v. Cello P'ship, 808 F. App'x 929, 934-35 (11th Cir. 2020). First, [*15]  the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnel Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). If she does so, then the burden shifts to the employer "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." Id. If it does so, then the plaintiff must show the reason is pretext. Id. at 804-05.

A. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Dodd must show: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. See Holly v. Clairson Indus. L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). Seminole argues Dodd cannot establish the last element.10 (Doc. 25, pp. 14-17.)
Seminole says there is no evidence Abel, the decisionmaker for the position, knew or regarded Dodd as disabled before he made his selection. (Doc. 25, pp. 14-15.) But there is a dispute over when a selection was made and what key players knew. Abel claims he decided to hire Baker for the position on Monday morning, November 23, 2015, before Abel knew Dodd requested a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 25-5, p. 17:17-24; Doc. 25-8, ¶ 6.) But other evidence contradicts this assertion. For example, Robbins emailed Brandolini on Monday at 12:25 p.m., copying Abel, about [*16]  the driver's license and Dodd—an irrelevant conversation if Abel told Robbins that morning he picked Baker. (Doc. 25-3, p. 40.) Abel was notified by email at 4:52 p.m. on Monday that Dodd requested a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 25-11, p. 4.) And Tuesday morning, Robbins told Dodd that candidates were still being evaluated and no decision had been made. (Doc. 24-2, p. 9.)
There is a dispute of fact concerning when Abel decided to hire Baker over Dodd and what he knew when he made that decision. So Seminole has not shown summary judgment is warranted based on Dodd's prima facie case.

B. Legitimate Reason
Seminole argues even if Dodd could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, Seminole had a legitimate reason not to promote Dodd. (Doc. 25, pp. 18-19.) To satisfy the second step of the McDonnell Douglas standard, the defendant must articulate "a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision." Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1183-84 (11th Cir. 1998). While this burden is not onerous, the defendant must do more than present a hypothetical reason; "instead, it must raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff by making that decision." Id. at 1184 (cleaned up).
Seminole explains, with [*17]  evidence in support, that it promoted Baker over Dodd because he was the internal candidate recommended by the two most experienced park supervisors on the interviewing panel. (Doc. 25, pp. 18-19; Doc. 25-3, pp. 45-46; Doc. 25-8, ¶ 5.) As this presents a genuine dispute of fact on why Dodd was not promoted, Seminole has satisfied its burden under the McDonnell Douglas standard. See Jay v. Auburn Univ., 829 F. App'x 393, 398-99 (11th Cir. 2020).

C. Pretext
Now the burden shifts back to Dodd to provide evidence that Seminole's proffered reason is pretext for discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804-05.
The Court "must, in view of all the evidence, determine whether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997) (cleaned up). The Court "must evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Id. (cleaned up).
Dodd has provided sufficient evidence to cast doubt on Seminole's proffered [*18]  reason for hiring Baker. Seminole claims they never selected Dodd for the position, and Abel chose Baker Monday morning because Baker was the internal candidate recommended by the most experienced park supervisors. (Doc. 25, pp. 9-10 ¶¶ 23, 25-26; Doc. 25-8, ¶¶ 3-5.) But Dodd presented evidence she was selected for the position on Friday. (Doc. 26-1, p. 78:15-79:15; Doc. 25-6, p. 33:3-9, 82:15-20; see also Doc. 25-3, pp. 45-46 ("I had some second thoughts about our selection on Friday").) Monday came, Dodd requested a reasonable accommodation, and Baker was offered the position instead. (See Doc. 24-1, pp. 4 ¶ 36, 10 ¶ 36; Doc. 24-2, pp. 146:10-19, 9-10; Doc. 24-4, pp. 26:18-27:3.)
As there is evidence that Dodd was originally selected and the decision was changed after she made a request for a reasonable accommodation, a jury could find Seminole's proffered reason for selecting Baker was pretext for discrimination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193-95 (11th Cir. 2004); E.E.O.C. v. Phoebe Putney Mem'l Hosp., Inc., 488 F. Supp. 3d 1336, 1351-52 (M.D. Ga. 2020). So summary judgment on Dodd's discrimination claims is not warranted.

II. Failure to Accommodate (ADA & FCRA)
Seminole also moves for summary judgment on Dodd's failure to accommodate claims under the ADA and FCRA. (Doc. 25, p. 21.) In a failure to accommodate claim, [*19]  the disability discrimination occurred "by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010). The plaintiff must have demanded an accommodation to put the defendant on notice. See Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999).
Seminole argues Dodd cannot prove Abel knew about Dodd's accommodation request before making his final decision. (Doc. 25, p. 21.) As explained, there is a factual dispute over when a final decision for the position was made—before or after Dodd made an accommodation request. See supra Section Analysis, I.A.; (see also Doc. 25-8, ¶¶ 4-6; cf. Doc. 25-3, p. 40; Doc. 24-2, pp. 8-9.) So summary judgment on Dodd's failure to accommodate claims is not warranted.

III. Retaliation (ADA & FCRA)
Seminole also moves for summary judgment on Dodd's claims of retaliation under the ADA and FCRA. (Doc. 25, pp. 13-20.) Dodd moves for partial summary judgment on Seminole's affirmative defense of exhaustion, and elements of her retaliation claims. (Doc. 24, pp. 5-15.) The Court begins with exhaustion.

A. Exhaustion
Seminole raises this defense: "Plaintiff's claims of retaliation should be dismissed as she failed to exhaust the administrative prerequisite of raising retaliation claims in her Charge of Discrimination." [*20]  (Doc. 10, p. 14 ¶ 9 ("Exhaustion Defense").) Dodd moves for summary judgment on Seminole's Exhaustion Defense.11 (Doc. 24, pp. 5-10.)
"An employee making a discrimination claim under the ADA must first exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC." Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2018). This ensures the EEOC has the "first opportunity to investigate the discriminatory practices and perform its role in obtaining voluntary compliance and promoting conciliation efforts." Id. (cleaned up). While it is inappropriate to add new acts of discrimination in a complaint not included in the EEOC charge, the scope of the EEOC charge should not be strictly interpreted. See id. The proper inquiry is "whether the plaintiff's complaint is like or related to, or grew out of, the allegations contained in the EEOC charge." Id. at 1328 (cleaned up).
Dodd seeks summary judgment on Seminole's Exhaustion Defense, because although the Charge does not have "Retaliation" checked off, her retaliation claims are like, related to, or grew out of the allegations in the Charge. (Doc. 24, pp. 5-10.) The Court agrees. The Charge noted discrimination based on disability occurred on November 24, 2015. (Doc. 28-2.) [*21]  The Charge explains Dodd believes she was discriminated against based on her disability because she asked for a reasonable accommodation based on her disability and was denied a promotion to Assistant Park Supervisor. (Doc. 28-2.) As this conduct underlies her retaliation claims, the Charge is sufficiently related as to satisfy the exhaustion requirement. (See id.; cf. Doc. 1, ¶¶ 4-21, 39-44, 70-77); see Batson, 897 F.3d at 1328; Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004). So summary judgment is granted in Dodd's favor as to Seminole's Exhaustion Defense. See Kearse v. Mayor & Aldermen of City of Savannah, Ga., No. CV413-089, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202397, 2019 WL 6247669, at *8 (S.D. Ga. Nov. 21, 2019).

B. Substantive Claim
Turning to the merits, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework also applies to ADA retaliation claims.12 See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, Dodd must show: "(1) statutorily protected expression; (2) adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action." Id.
Dodd moves for summary judgment on the first two elements.13 (Doc. 24, pp. 11-14.) Rather than argue the merits, Seminole contends it is procedurally improper for Dodd to move for summary judgment on a part of her retaliation claim. (Doc. 27, pp. 10-11.) Seminole is incorrect.
Under Rule 56, "[a] party may move for summary judgment, [*22]  identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added); see also Davis v. City of Apopka, 424 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1171-72 (M.D. Fla. 2019).
There is no dispute Dodd engaged in a classic statutorily protected expression—requesting a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 24-2, pp. 9-10); see Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). And there is no dispute Dodd suffered an adverse employment action—not being promoted. (See Doc. 24-1, pp. 2 ¶ 7, 4 ¶ 36; cf. Doc. 24-1, pp. 6 ¶ 7, 10 ¶ 36); see McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir. 1994). Given the lack of factual dispute, summary judgment is granted in Dodd's favor on the first two elements of her retaliation claims. See Bhogaita v. Altamonte Heights Condo. Ass'n, Inc., 765 F.3d 1277, 1285-87 (11th Cir. 2014).
This leaves the third element—a causal link. Seminole argues Dodd cannot show a causal link between her request for a reasonable accommodation and the failure to promote her. (Doc. 25, pp. 17-18.) "A plaintiff satisfies this element if she provides sufficient evidence of knowledge of the protected expression and that there was a close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse action." Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) (cleaned up). Seminole says Abel decided to hire Baker before he knew about Dodd's request for a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 25, p. 18.) But as discussed, this is a disputed fact. See supra Sections Analysis, [*23]  I.A., II. In the light most favorable to Dodd, Abel learned of Dodd's request for a reasonable accommodation at least by Monday afternoon and candidates were still being evaluated Tuesday morning. (See Doc. 24-2, p. 9; Doc. 25-11, p. 4.) So Seminole has not shown Dodd cannot establish causation.
Continuing with the burden shifting framework, as with the discrimination claims, Seminole has articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for selecting Baker over Dodd and Dodd has rebutted this reason with evidence of pretext. See supra Sections Analysis, I.B, C. So summary judgment is not warranted on Dodd's retaliation claims based on causation.

IV. Section 1983
Dodd also sues under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 78-87.) Seminole argues Dodd's § 1983 claim improperly stems from an ADA violation and alternatively, Dodd cannot show Seminole is liable under Monell. (Doc. 25, pp. 21-22.)

A. Section 1983 & the ADA
Seminole says Dodd's § 1983 claim is improperly based on rights created by the ADA. (Doc. 25, pp. 21-22.) "As a general proposition, plaintiffs may bring a case of action pursuant to section 1983 to remedy violations of both the federal constitution and federal statutes." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1530 (11th Cir. 1997). But § 1983 cannot be used to enforce a federal statute when the statute [*24]  itself forecloses such enforcement. Id. The ADA "provide[s] extensive, comprehensive remedial frameworks" so "a plaintiff may not maintain a section 1983 action in lieu of—or in addition to—a[n] . . . ADA cause of action if the only alleged deprivation is of the employee's rights created by . . . the ADA." Id.
Dodd argues she is not seeking to redress rights created by the ADA in her § 1983 claim; instead she alleges violations of her constitutional rights—specifically, the Equal Protection Clause ("EPC") and the Due Process Clause. (Doc. 26, pp. 16-17.)
The EPC provides that "[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const. amend. XIV § 1. This "is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). Dodd alleges she was denied equal protection of the laws because she was treated differently based on her disability. (See Doc. 1, ¶¶ 79, 80, 86.) While this overlaps with her ADA claim, Dodd is suing the municipal defendant for a separate violation—a constitutional deprivation. So she may seek redress through § 1983. See Burks v. Coastal Ala. Cmty. Coll., No. 1:20-00069, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108279, 2020 WL 3405236, at *3-4 (S.D. Ala. June 19, 2020); Harris v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., No. 1:07-CV-2086, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139667, 2009 WL 10665027, at *10-12 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 9, 2009); see also Rylee v. Chapman, 316 F. App'x 901, 907 (11th Cir. 2009) (discussing § 1983 claim based on disability discrimination under the EPC).
But Dodd's due process allegations [*25]  meet a different fate. Dodd alleges she was deprived of due process because she was not provided a reasonable accommodation. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 83, 84.) But a reasonable accommodation is a protection afforded by the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5). The Constitution does not require states to make special accommodations for individuals with disabilities. See Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S.C. 356, 367-68 (2001). So summary judgment is granted for Seminole on Dodd's § 1983 claim to the extent it is based on a violation of due process. (See Doc. 1, ¶¶ 78-87.)

B. Monell Liability
As Dodd can pursue her § 1983 claim based on a violation of the EPC, the Court turns to Seminole's argument that her claim still fails because she has not shown Seminole is liable under Monell. (Doc. 25, p. 22.)
"[A] local government may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents." Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs. of City. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). But it "may be held liable for acts or policies of individuals to whom it delegated final decisionmaking authority in a particular area." Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1291 (11th Cir. 2004).
As there is evidence in the record that Abel possessed final decisionmaking authority for hiring in Seminole's Parks and Recreation Division, and he selected Baker over Dodd for the position, summary judgment is not warranted on Dodd's § 1983 claim against Seminole. [*26]  (Doc. 25-8, ¶¶ 2, 5); see Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 484-85, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1986); Willingham v. City of Valparaiso Fla., 638 F. App'x 903, 906-08 (11th Cir. 2016).

V. Breach of Contract
Last, Seminole moves for summary judgment on Dodd's breach of contract claim. (Doc. 25, pp. 22-24.) "For a breach of contract claim, Florida law requires the plaintiff to plead and establish: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) a material breach of that contract; and (3) damages resulting from the breach."14 Vega v. T-Mobile, USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256, 1272 (11th Cir. 2009). Seminole argues no contract was formed. (Doc. 25, pp. 23-24.) The Court agrees.
"To prove the existence of a contract, a plaintiff must plead: (1) offer; (2) acceptance; (3) consideration; and (4) sufficient specification of the essential terms." Vega, 564 F.3d at 1272. Dodd alleges a contract was formed when she was offered the position by Klotz and she accepted. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 89-90; Doc. 26, p. 18.) But it is undisputed that Klotz explicitly told Dodd he could not offer her the job. (Doc. 24-3, p. 88:10-13; Doc. 25-9, pp. 164:21-165:2.) Without an offer, no contract was formed, and Dodd cannot succeed on a breach of contract claim. See Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. AAR Aircraft Servs., Inc., 167 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1317-18 (S.D. Fla. 2016). So summary judgment is granted in Seminole's favor on Count VIII. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 88-93.)

CONCLUSION
It is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:
1. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is (Doc. 24) is GRANTED.
2. Defendant's Motion [*27]  for Summary Judgment (Doc. 25) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART:
a. Seminole's Motion is GRANTED as to Count VII (§ 1983) on the Due Process portion of the claim and Count VIII (breach of contract);
b. In all other respects, Seminole's Motion is DENIED.
3. This action will proceed to trial on Count I (ADA discrimination), Count II (ADA failure to accommodate), Count III (ADA retaliation) solely on causation, Count IV (FCRA discrimination), Count V (FCRA failure to accommodate), Count VI (FCRA retaliation) solely on causation, and Count VII (§ 1983) as to the Equal Protection Clause only. (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 27-87.)
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Orlando, Florida, on May 25, 2021.
