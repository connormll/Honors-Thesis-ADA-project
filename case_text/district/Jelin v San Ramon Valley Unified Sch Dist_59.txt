Opinion



ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This case arises from allegations that Defendant San Ramon Valley Unified School District discriminated against its employee Plaintiff Barbara Jelin because of her disability. She also alleges that Defendant did not comply with its obligations to make a reasonable accommodation for her or engage in the interactive process, failed to pay wages or reimburse her, and retaliated against Plaintiff for making complaints about her work conditions.
Currently before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment on all claims. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion. Specifically, the Court grants the motion [*2]  as to the following claims: (1) failure to pay wages or reimbursement; and (2) federal and state retaliation based on Plaintiff's lodging of complaints about the directive not to provide legally mandated services, the filing of the § 910 form, a colleague's refusal to submit Plaintiff's absence record regarding jury duty, and Plaintiff's decision to leave work at a "reasonable time." The Court DENIES the motion as to the federal and state discrimination claims and the retaliation claim regarding the filing of EEOC documents, as well as the state claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodation and the failure to engage in the interactive process. The claims that survive summary judgment are limited by the statute of limitations to the extent discussed in the body of this order.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following are the undisputed facts, unless otherwise noted.1 Plaintiff has been employed by Defendant as a school psychologist since 2006, and her position is salaried rather than hourly. Ly Decl., ¶ 2, Ex A. ("Jelin Tr.") at 124:24-125:4. In this position she prepares assessment reports and communications with parents and staff through email. Jelin Decl., ¶ 4. Plaintiff sustained an [*3]  injury to her hands and wrists in November 2006. Jelin Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 5. She first requested reasonable accommodation for her carpal tunnel syndrome in June 2008 and submitted follow-up documentation about her request in August 2008. Jelin Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 4. Her doctor recommended use of voice recognition software to limit the amount of typing Plaintiff was required to do. Id.
Although she can perform her essential job functions with the assistance of voice recognition software, Plaintiff states that Defendant purchased the necessary voice recognition software but failed to properly install it until March 2018. Jelin Decl., ¶ 5. Defendant did not provide competent technicians to diagnose and fix the problems with the program, and would not allow one technician, who was learning the software, to continue working with her. Jelin Decl., ¶ 5.
Because she did not receive the help she thought she needed from Defendant, Plaintiff sought to fix the issue on her own, even though Defendant told her she should not resort to self-help. Jelin Decl., ¶ 6. She purchased the voice-activated computer programs and two laptop computers, and she also designed and purchased the necessary components for [*4]  an ergonomic workstation that Defendant did not provide for her. Jelin Decl., ¶ 6. Among the issues were that Defendant installed incompatible programs and did not properly install one of the programs due to a failure to address certain usernames, passwords, and permissions that were required to access email. Jelin Decl., ¶ 7. After resolving the issues on the programs, the dictation software worked on her personal computer but stopped working when the computer was connected to Defendant's server. Jelin Tr. at 47:8-21. On the computers that Defendant issued to her for work purposes, the dictation software did not work efficiently because Microsoft Outlook disengages and the program makes many mistakes. Id. at 49:21-50:7.
In 2017, Defendant lost a USB component for her accommodated keyboard and Plaintiff was required to purchase a replacement keyboard and mouse when a replacement USB was not provided. Jelin Decl., ¶ 7. Plaintiff provided the names of three outside experts to resolve the technical issues she was experience with the voice recognition software, but Defendant would not permit an outside expert to assist because it had its own employees to perform this work. Jelin Decl., [*5]  ¶ 8; Jelin Tr. at 98:24-100:6 (Plaintiff sought to have the Research Engineering and Assistance Technology ("RET") program assess and adjust her workstation). It was not until December 2017 that Defendant approved bringing in a consultant to properly install the necessary computer programs and otherwise set up an ergonomic workstation. Jelin Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 7.
Plaintiff has also raised allegations that Defendant assigned her a heavy workload for most years that she has worked in her position, except for 2006 to 2009 and 2017, and when she was asked for help with the workload her requests were denied. Jelin Tr. at 82:14-83-9; Ly Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. E, Plaintiff's Supp. Interrogatory Responses, at 4-5. Plaintiff believes her heavy workloads were motivated by her disability based, at least in part, on conversations she had with several co-workers. In 2007, her former colleague Joanne Biandi laughed and wished her good luck and told her that certain individuals in the administrative office had "some issues" with her. Jelin Tr. at 88:16-21. She also had conversations with colleague Shirley Converse in 2013-2014 who told Plaintiff that her supervisors, Linda Raleigh-Thom and Karen Heilbronner, [*6]  were upset and not happy with Plaintiff and Ms. Converse did not understand why Plaintiff was not receiving additional assistance with her workload when other school psychologists were. Id. at 96:1-12; 97:1-11. In 2016, her colleague Amy Scott was assigned to assist Plaintiff, and Ms. Scott told Plaintiff that she had been assigned to help individuals with a lighter workload and she was not sure why there was a delay in assigning her to help with Plaintiff's workload. Id. at 87:8-15. None of these colleagues told Plaintiff that she was assigned a heavy workload and denied help because of her disability. Id. at 88:22-89:5, 97:18-21, and 88:4-88:7.
Although Plaintiff is a salaried employee, she testified that Defendant has not paid her full wages since 2008 because she works longer hours than the 7.25 hours permitted under the bargaining agreement between Defendant and her union, the San Ramon Valley Education Association. Jelin Tr. at 128:20-129:22. The bargaining agreement provides that she must obtain prior approval from her supervisor for extra pay on days when she works over 7.25 hours, and Plaintiff is aware of that requirement. Id. at 129:23-130:6. She was not approved to work [*7]  overtime. Id. at 81:2-13. In addition, Plaintiff purchased a computer, at least two versions of dictation software (Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking), a computer mouse, and a negative tilt keyboard, which Defendant has not reimbursed her for although they were necessary to reasonably accommodate her disability. Id. at 135:5-137:5. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that she needs to seek pre-approval for equipment that she intends to seek reimbursement for and Defendant has told her to stop purchasing equipment. Id. at 139:13-140:11.
In addition to a heavy workload, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant created a hostile work environment because her supervisors Shawn Wells and Skye Larsch criticized her because she was not completing her work, such as reports and assessments. Jelin Tr. at 104:19-105:16. She testified that Ms. Wells and Ms. Larsch raised their voices at Plaintiff when they communicated their dissatisfaction with the timeliness of Plaintiff's work. Id. at 105:11-25. She further testified that she believed Ms. Wells' yelling was motivated by her disability because Ms. Wells knew the accommodations were not in place and the technology was not functioning properly, taking time [*8]  away from Plaintiff's work. Id. at 106:14-25.
In October 2015, Plaintiff was called to jury duty. Id. at 151:10-16. She testified that Ms. Wells would not mark her absence in the school's computer system when Plaintiff asked her to do so because she was off-site for jury duty and could not submit the required form herself. Id. at 151:19-24. She testified that Ms. Wells asked her to find a way to not complete jury duty and would not assign someone to cover her duties for her while absent. Id. at 151:22-24. Plaintiff characterized Ms. Wells's actions as not being "helpful" and refusing to go "to bat to try to get someone to cover." Id. at 152:2-5.
On November 6, 2015, Plaintiff hyperextended and injured her left thumb when a power cord wrapped around her thumb as she was picking up documents and a laptop. Jelin Tr. at 57:20 61:9. Plaintiff, accompanied by her union representative, attended a meeting with Director of Certificated Personnel Melanie Jones Utler, Principal Shawn Wells, and former Special Education Program Supervisor Doris Kwok on November 13, 2015. Id., 171:11-171:15. Plaintiff was asked how she injured her thumb (id. at 66:5-66:10), and then Plaintiff was asked to leave the [*9]  meeting. Id. at 66:19-23. Defendant then placed Plaintiff on leave as there was a concern that Plaintiff would "comply with her physical restrictions and accommodations that were agreed to and safely perform her job duties." Ly Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. D ("Jones Tr." at 57:2-16). In a declaration filed in support of Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Ms. Jones characterized the reason for placing Plaintiff on leave as "a concern Ms. Jelin could not safely perform her job and responsibilities with her injury." Jones Decl., ¶ 3.
Plaintiff testified that Defendant retaliated against her when she complained that her supervisors directed her in the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 school years not to provide the designated instructional services that a student is supposed to receive as part of their Individual Education Plan. Jelin Tr. at 109:19-110:7, 110:11-111:1. With respect to Plaintiff's work as a school psychologist, these students receive a certain number of counseling minutes per week. Id. at 110:4-7. She was told not to provide the service minutes, but she was also told that the service minutes would be made up at a later date, which she acknowledges is permitted. Id. at 114:4-16. Plaintiff [*10]  responded to the directions that she should not provide the service minutes by telling her supervisors that the service minutes were required by law. Id. at 114:1-2. Plaintiff spoke to members of the school board on June 13, 2016 about the directive not to provide mandated services. Id. at 160:8-22. One of the individuals present at the school board meeting was Keith Rogenski, the assistant superintendent. Id. at 160:21-22. Because she spoke up about the need to provide the service minutes, Defendant assigned her a heavy workload, refused to provide working accommodations, and directed her to see the students before and after school. Id. at 143:1-13. She testified that she was required to work long days and was not allowed to turn down assignments, whereas other employees were allowed to go home after a nine-hour day, could turn down assignments, and were paid overtime or were permitted to use flex time. Id. Plaintiff also testified that she was reprimanded in June 2016 for complaining about the directive not to provide services, id. at 148:25-149:3, although Defendant told her that the reprimand was for an unprofessional comment she made to a colleague. Id. at 149:12-23.
Plaintiff [*11]  testified that Ms. Wells retaliated against her when she ended her work day between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., by making slanderous comments about her to staff, parents, and students during the 2015-2016 school year. Id. at 154:2-8, 155:3-7. The parents became upset that she was leaving at this time and did not realize that Ms. Wells had directed staff to stop providing their children with their services. Id. at 155:18-156:1.
Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on January 27, 2016 and she also filed a Government Code § 910 Tort Claim Form with the San Ramon Valley Unified School District on March 11, 2016. Compl., Exs. 1 & 2. DFEH issued a right-to-sue letter to Plaintiff on February 10, 2016. Jelin Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. 3. The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter to Plaintiff on August 1, 2016. Ly Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.
Plaintiff testified that she was subjected to retaliation for filing the EEOC charge and the § 910 Tort Claim Form. Jelin Tr. at 156:4-23. She testified that she was retaliated against in receiving the § 910 Tort Claim Form because no one knew where to find the form and therefore she was delayed in filing her claim. Id. at 156:14-17. [*12]  She also testified to being required to attend multiple meetings and receiving excessive email in which the meetings would be summarized incorrectly. Id. at 156:17-19. She reiterated that her accommodations were not in place, her computer was not working, and the iPads had not been set up for her return. Id. at 156:20-23. She also described escalating verbal attacks after filing the form. Id. at 157:2-6. She testified that neither Ms. Wells nor Ms. Jones have acknowledged being aware that she submitted the § 910 Tort Claim Form, but she believes they were aware she had done so, particularly because Ms. Jones may have seen her filling out the form and turning it in. Id. at 157:18-158:13.
Plaintiff also testified to being retaliated against for filing a questionnaire with the EEOC in October 2015. Id. at 171:1-4; Jelin Decl., Ex. 8. She believes that her filing of the October 2015 EEOC questionnaire resulted in the November 6, 2015 meeting in which she was placed on leave. Id. at 171:5-15. She testified that she contacted the EEOC to inform it that she was placed on leave after filing her questionnaire and the EEOC employee she spoke to responded that she was not surprised because the EEOC [*13]  had notified human resources about it. Id. at 172-16-22. With respect to the January 27, 2016 EEOC charge that resulted in the right-to-sue letter, she testified to being retaliated against by not being allowed to work or utilize the accommodations that she received from an outside vendor (Bob's Foam) and by assigning her to two schools that are known to have difficult administrators. Id. at 172:1-12. Plaintiff also noted that she was retaliated against by being required to make up work and draft responses during the summer, not being allowed to have the RET program assist her in setting up the accommodations, and by failing to provide her with a working computer. Id. at 172:1-4.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On October 17, 2016, Plaintiff Barbara Jelin filed a complaint against Defendant San Ramon Valley Unified School District. Plaintiff raised the following claims: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); (2) disability discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (3) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of state law; (4) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of state [*14]  law; (5) failure to pay wages or reimbursement in violation of state law; (6) retaliation in violation of the California FEHA; and (7) retaliation in violation of the ADA. Defendant answered the complaint on January 9, 2017.
Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on April 1, 2018.2 The Court held a hearing on the motion on May 21, 2018.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted if "the pleadings, discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 56(c). Material facts are those which may affect the outcome of the case. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute as to a material fact is genuine if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Id. The court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and give it the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter, but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. See Balint v. Carson City, 180 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden [*15]  of informing the court of the basis for its motion, and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the moving party will have the burden of proof at trial, it must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. On an issue where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the moving party can prevail merely by pointing out to the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the opposing party "may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading;" rather, it must set forth "specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250. If the nonmoving party fails to show that there is a genuine issue for trial, "the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Statute of Limitations
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims under the ADA and FEHA relating to conduct occurring prior to January 27, 2015 are time barred, except for the claim regarding unpaid wages and reimbursement. [*16]  Under both statutes, Plaintiff was required to file an administrative charge before bringing suit. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1);3 Cal. Gov't Code § 12965(b). Generally, a federal charge must be filed within 180 days of when the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). That time period is extended to 300 days when a complainant "has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief." Id. "A claim is time barred if it is not filed within these time limits." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002).
Plaintiff filed a charge with the EEOC on January 27, 2016. Because California has a Worksharing Agreement with California's DFEH, an administrative charge filed with one agency is deemed to be simultaneously filed with the other agency. See 29 C.F.R. § 1626.10(c); EEOC v. Dinuba Med. Clinic, 222 F.3d 580, 585 (9th Cir. 2000) (explaining that constructive filing is made possible by "worksharing" agreements," which designate the EEOC and the state agency as each other's agents for the purpose of receiving charges); Stiefel v. Bechtel Corp., 624 F.3d 1240, 1244 (9th Cir. 2010) (filings made only with the state agency are considered simultaneous filings with the EEOC for purposes of satisfying the 300-day limit); Green v. Los Angeles Cnty. Superintendent of Schools, 883 F.2d 1472 (9th Cir. 1989) (same). Therefore, Plaintiff's charge was considered constructively filed with the DFEH on January 27, 2016.
The FEHA includes a statute [*17]  of limitations that bars recovery for actions occurring more than one year before the filing of a complaint with the DFEH. See Jumaane v. City of Los Angeles, 241 Cal. App. 4th 1390, 1402, 194 Cal. Rptr. 3d 689 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015). Claims arising under ADA's Title I, which governs employment discrimination, are subject to the forum state's statute of limitations for personal injury actions. See Earl v. Clovis Unified School District, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153718, 2012 WL 5304738, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 25, 2012) (citing Pickern v. Holiday Quality Foods Inc., 293 F.3d 1133, 1137 n.2 (9th Cir. 2002)). In California, the statute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years from the date the complaint was filed. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1.
By virtue of the Workingsharing Agreement, Plaintiff filed her DFEH complaint on January 27, 2016. Under the FEHA, she is barred from recovering for conduct that occurred prior to January 27, 2015. Plaintiff's opposition concedes that the FEHA ordinarily bars claims for actions occurring more than one year before the filing of a DFEH complaint, unless the continuing violations doctrine applies, noting in her opposition that "[e]verything is timely as to acts from January 27, 2015 . . . " Dkt. No. 38 at 10. For the ADA claims, she filed her lawsuit on October 17, 2016, and therefore she is barred from recovering under the ADA for conduct that took place prior to October 17, 2014. However, Plaintiff seeks to recover for conduct that extends back to at least 2008 [*18]  when she first requested an accommodation for her disability. She contends that all of her claims are timely under the continuing violation doctrine.
The watershed decision on the nature of the continuing violations doctrine in federal discrimination law is Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). There, the Supreme Court held that recovery is precluded under the doctrine for discrete acts that occurred outside the statutory limitations period and that "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time-barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." Id. at 113. While the Ninth Circuit had previously contemplated "two methods by which a plaintiff may establish a continuing violation," see Douglas v. Cal. Dep't of Youth Auth., 271 F.3d 812, 822 (9th Cir. 2001), the Supreme Court expressly declined to adopt the continuing violations theory arising out of "serial violations." Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114; see also Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 2003) ("In Morgan . . . the Supreme Court substantially limited the notion of continuing violations."); Lelaind v. City & County of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1092 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (concluding that the continuing violation doctrine is only applicable to hostile work environment claims after Morgan).
Under the FEHA, however, the Supreme Court of California has declined to adopt this distinction and held that the continuing violations doctrine may be applicable to discrimination [*19]  and retaliation claims, in addition to hostile work environment claims, where the plaintiff complains of a continuing course of unlawful conduct. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1057-59. Under California law, "[t]he continuing violation doctrine requires proof that the conduct occurring outside the limitations period was (1) similar or related to the conduct that occurred within the limitations period; (2) the conduct was reasonably frequent; and (3) the conduct had not yet become permanent." Jumaane, 241 Cal. App. 4th at 1402. "'[P]ermanence' in the context of an ongoing process of accommodation of disability, or ongoing disability harassment, should properly be understood to mean the following: that an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment will be futile." Id. (quoting Richards v, CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001). "[T]he statute of limitations begins to run . . . either when the course of conduct is brought to an end, as by the employer's cessation of such conduct or by the employee's resignation, or when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in vain." Id. (emphasis in original).
Plaintiff's opposition [*20]  focuses on the argument that her federal and state discrimination claims are not time barred because Defendant engaged in a pattern of failure to engage in the interactive process and provide reasonable accommodations for approximately 10 years. For her federal claims, she explains that her claims that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate or engage in the interactive process are subsumed by her discrimination claim because there is no separate cause of action for those claims under federal law. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's motion unfairly circumscribes her discrimination claim when it claims that she alleged she was discriminated against through discrete acts (e.g., the thumb injury and resulting leave of absence and the heavy workload). While California law permits this type of ongoing serial violation theory, federal law does not, unless the claim is raised as a hostile work environment claim. Plaintiff clarified in her opposition to the motion that she has not pleaded and is not pursing a hostile work environment claim. Therefore, Plaintiff is barred from raising her federal claims with respect to conduct that occurred prior to October 17, 2014, regardless of whether [*21]  that conduct was related to actions that occurred after that date. Whether other portions of the federal claims survive a statute of limitations analysis is addressed more fully below.
For the state-law claims relating to the interactive process and reasonable accommodation, Defendants contends that Plaintiff should have been on notice that the breakdown in the attempts to provide a reasonable accommodation had become permanent and that a reasonable person would not have waited ten years to bring these claims. In Richards, the California Supreme Court addressed the similar question of how long a plaintiff may wait to raise the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disability in the context of the statute of limitations and "permanence":
[W]e find merit in [the employer's] argument that permitting an employee indefinitely to delay the filing of a lawsuit based on the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate disability or on disability harassment would be contrary to the FEHA's statute of limitations and potentially prejudicial to the employer. When "the hope that conditions will improve or that information conciliation may succeed" is unreasonable, as when an employer makes [*22]  clear that it will not further accommodate an employee, justification for delay in taking formal legal action no longer exists. If the employer has made clear in word and deed that the employee's attempted further reasonable accommodation is futile, then the employee is on notice that litigation, not informal conciliation, is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights. Barring a constructive discharge, it is at that point that the statute of limitations for the violation begins to run.
Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 822-23 (internal citation omitted).
Defendant did not put forth specific evidence as to when Defendant took certain actions or failed to take certain actions, such that Plaintiff should have been on notice that any further attempts at conciliation would be in vain. While under certain circumstances a person would not wait ten years to bring these claims, under others a reasonable person could wait that long. Defendant may have made promises to Plaintiff about continuing to work on the issues raised about the software and her workstation or Defendant may have made several attempts to troubleshoot the issues by reinstalling the software or asking Plaintiff to try different protocols for using [*23]  her equipment, all of this punctuated annually by the summer break in the school year. Defendant has failed to make the showing that Plaintiff should have been "on notice that litigation, not informal conciliation, is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights." As the burden falls on Defendant to establish that here is no triable issue of fact on an affirmative defense, Defendant has failed at least for the state law claims of discrimination, reasonable accommodation, and interactive process. The retaliation claims are more closely tied to conduct that is temporally fixed, making them easier to evaluate under the statute of limitations. The Court addresses the application of the statute of limitations as to those particular claims below.

B. Discrimination Claims
The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The burden-shifting analysis that the Supreme Court set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) for Title VII cases has been adopted for motions for summary judgment in the ADA context. See Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (9th Cir. 2003). To establish the prima facie case of disability discrimination, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is a person with a [*24]  disability under the ADA; (2) she is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodations, and she is able to perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. See Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012). The amount of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case of discrimination is "minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence," and may be based on "either a presumption arising from the factors such as those set forth in McDonnell Douglas" or by direct evidence of discriminatory intent." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994).
If Plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, then a presumption arises that Defendant's conduct, if left unexplained, was more likely than not prompted by her disability. See Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 575, 98 S. Ct. 2943, 57 L. Ed. 2d 957 (1978). The burden shifts to Defendant "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If Defendant presents a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the reason given is a pretext offered by Defendant to conceal the discriminatory purpose. Id. at 804.
The California standard for proving a disability discrimination claim is essentially [*25]  the same as the federal standard:
plaintiff initially has the burden to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. The plaintiff can meet this burden by presenting evidence that demonstrates even circumstantially or by inference, that he or she (1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) was subject to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability.
Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (Cal. Ct. App. 2010). The same burden-shifting standard articulated in McDonnell Douglas applies to California disability discrimination claims that are based on indirect evidence. See Wallace v. Cnty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 123, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016).
In its motion, Defendant focuses on Plaintiff's allegations that she was discriminated against by being placed on leave after the November 13, 2015 meeting, assigned a heavy workload, not reasonably accommodated, and generally harassed by her colleagues and supervisors.

1. The November 13, 2015 Meeting
Regarding the November 13, 2015 meeting, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case because she cannot show that she could continue to work despite the loss of the use of her hand because [*26]  of the injury from hyperextending it. See Smith v. Clark Cnty. School District, 727 F.3d 950, 958-59 (9th Cir. 2013) (the burden is on the plaintiff to show the ability to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation). This argument is not persuasive because the accommodation Plaintiff had been seeking all along -- the voice recognition software -- would have permitted her to perform the essential functions of her job even with the injury from the hypertension.
Second, it argues that even if Plaintiff can make out her prima facie case, Defendant's concern for Plaintiff's safety was a "legitimate, nondiscrimination reason" for placing her on leave. Defendant has only put forward evidence from Ms. Jones, who attended the November 13, 2015 meeting, about the reason for the decision to place Plaintiff on leave. In a declaration filed in support of Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Ms. Jones characterized the reason for placing Plaintiff on leave as "a concern Ms. Jelin could not safely perform her job and responsibilities with her injury." Jones Decl., ¶ 3. In her deposition, Ms. Jones stated that Plaintiff was placed on leave because she would not "comply with her physical restrictions and accommodations that were [*27]  agreed to and safely perform her job duties." Ly Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. D ("Jones Tr." at 57:2-16). The gist of her statement was that Defendant could not count on Plaintiff to follow the reasonable accommodations it had given her, so it placed her on leave for her safety.
On its face, the reason Ms. Jones provided under oath in her deposition suggests that Plaintiff's disability was the reason for the leave of absence. Ms. Jones's declaration statement more clearly evinces a concern for Plaintiff's safety as a reason for the leave of absence. Even if the burden were to shift to Defendant and this concern for Plaintiff's safety were considered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to pretext. In light of Defendant's alleged failure to provide functioning voice recognition software, which Plaintiff contends would have sufficient to accommodate her thumb injury,4 there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether the reason proffered by Defendant is subterfuge for its true reasons for placing Plaintiff on leave. See Wallace v. Cnty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 133-34, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016) ("Under California law, '[w]hen an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer [*28]  may not require that the employee take a leave of absence.'") (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is denied as to allegations that Plaintiff was discriminated against by being placed on a leave of absence after the November 13, 2015 meeting.

2. Heavy Workload
Defendant has not disputed Plaintiff's allegations and testimony that she was assigned a heavier workload than her colleagues except for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2017. As set forth above regarding the applicable statute of limitations, Plaintiff is not barred from raising claims under the ADA for work assignments on or after October 17, 2014. Under California law, the work assignments before January 27, 2015 are similar or related to the assignments after that date and the conduct was reasonably frequent because it occurred in about half of the years at issue. Defendant has not established as a matter of undisputed fact that the conduct had become permanent such that the continuing violations doctrine does not apply to the FEHA claim based on the assignments.
Defendant's motion argues that Plaintiff cannot meet the third requirement of the prima facie case that her heavy workload [*29]  was motivated by her disability because of various statements from her colleagues Ms. Biandi, Ms. Converse, and Ms. Scott that her supervisors were unhappy with her or that they were not sure why she was not offered help sooner with her workload. Defendant argues that this evidence fails to raise a triable issue of a causal connection between the assignments and Plaintiff's disability.
Plaintiff responds that all of the circumstantial evidence should be considered - not just these comments from her colleagues - that the heavy workload assignments were motivated by her disability. Moreover, she provided undisputed evidence that other, non-disabled school counselors were treated more favorably than she was with respect to workload, flex time, and overtime. This evidence raises a triable issue of fact as to whether she was discriminated against by being assigned a heavy workload as a result of her disability.

3. Failure to Reasonably Accommodate
Plaintiff alleged that Defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate her disability by providing functioning voice recognition software, not allowing use of an outside vendor to implement the software, and failure to provide a negative tilt workstation [*30]  are adverse employment actions motivated by her disability. These issues persisted into the statutory period, so the claims are not barred in their entirety by the statute of limitations. The continuing violations doctrine applies to pre-limitations period conduct under California law, although ADA claims based on conduct before October 17, 2014 are barred.
Defendant raises two arguments in its motion. First, it argues that Plaintiff's claim cannot survive because Defendant's evidence shows that it did not allow the use of an outside vendor because Defendant had its own employees to implement the reasonable accommodations, which was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. However, Defendant has not provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to implement an effective reasonable accommodation (i.e., functioning voice recognition software). See Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001) (a "reasonable accommodation must be effective, in enabling the employee to perform the duties of [her] position"). It has also not provided any reasons for not implementing the requested negative tilt workstation accommodation. If its internal resources were sufficient to provide these requested accommodations, [*31]  which Defendant does not argue were unreasonable, then Defendant has offered no basis for excusing its failure to implement them. Moreover, Plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact that Defendant's reason for not paying for outside vendor was a pretext through evidence that she offered to hire an outside expert to implement the accommodations at her own expense.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that the reasonable accommodations she requested were denied because of her disability. In her opposition, Plaintiff argued that she does not need to demonstrate that the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation was motivated by her disability because a denial of a reasonable accommodation is an adverse employment action in and of itself. Shortly after Defendant filed its reply brief, the Ninth Circuit held that "[t]he ADA treats the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation as an act of discrimination if the employee is a 'qualified individual,' the employer receives adequate notice, and a reasonable accommodation is available that would not place an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business." Snapp v. Untied Transportation United, 889 F.3d 1088, 2018 WL 2168653, at *4 (9th Cir. 2018). It explained that "there exists [*32]  no stand-alone claim for failing to engage in the interactive process. Rather, discrimination results from denying an available and reasonable accommodation." Id. Thus, Plaintiff need not demonstrate discriminatory motive. Instead, the federal failure to reasonably accommodate claim dovetails with the state failure to reasonably accommodate claim.
For the reasons discussed below with respect to the state claim, a triable issue of fact remains on whether there was an available and reasonable accommodation and Defendant failed to meet its duty under the ADA and FEHA to implement that reasonable accommodation.

4. Hostile Work Environment
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that it created a hostile work environment because of Plaintiff's disability. Plaintiff alleged that her supervisors yelled at her and blamed her for not completing her assessments on time. In her opposition, however, she explained she has not raised a separate claim for hostile work environment. However, she clarified that she has claims that Defendant engaged in additional adverse employment actions not addressed in Defendant's motion. Specifically, she claims that she was denied overtime, flex time, support [*33]  services, and a working computer. As Defendant did not address these alleged adverse actions, the Court denies the motion as to them at this time. However, whether they are barred in whole or in part by the statute of limitations or are too minor to constitute adverse action has not yet been determined.

C. Reasonable Accommodation Claim
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation in violation of state law. Under California law, Plaintiff must prove the following elements to establish this claim: (1) she has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) she is a qualified individual (i.e., she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. See Cuiellette v. City of Los Angeles, 194 Cal. App. 4th 757, 766, 123 Cal. Rptr. 3d 562 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011). A "reasonable accommodation" means "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Id. Examples of reasonable accommodations are "[j]ob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Swanson v. Morongo Unified School District, 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 968, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014). "Employers must make reasonable accommodations to the [*34]  disability of an individual unless the employer can demonstrate that doing so would impose an 'undue hardship.'" Prilliman v. United Airlines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 947, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997). "[T]he burden of proving the availability of a reasonable accommodation rests on the employee." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Nieman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984-85, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008).
Defendant's only basis for challenging Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim under state law is that because she has asked for an ergonomic workstation, including a sit-down workstation with a negative tilt keyboard, and voice recognition software, since 2007 to the present, the statute of limitations bars it. As noted above, however, the California Supreme Court has permitted the application of the continuing violation doctrine for FEHA disability discrimination cases. Furthermore, in her opposition, Plaintiff highlights the fact that Defendant finally did implement the requested accommodation in March 2018, ten years after she first requested the accommodation. Jelin Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 7. Although Defendant has not challenged her reasonable accommodation claim on the grounds that her requested accommodation was not reasonable, the fact that Defendant did implement the requested accommodation strongly diminishes any argument to the contrary. Defendant takes issue with Plaintiff's [*35]  reference to the March 2018 implementation of the reasonable accommodation because that implementation occurred after the fact discovery cut-off date of November 30, 2017, and contends that the Court should not consider this evidence because it will be duly prejudiced by its inability to conduct discovery and challenge the assertions. As Defendant hired the consultant and provided the accommodation, no prejudice could come to Defendant in considering evidence about the consultant's work in 2018, evidence which Defendant has equal if not greater access to than Plaintiff.
The statute of limitations does not bar Plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate her disability under state law, so the motion is denied as to this claim.

D. Interactive Process Claim
Plaintiff has also raised a claim based on Defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process under state law. "Failure to engage in this process is a separate FEHA violation independent from an employer's failure to provide a reasonable disability accommodation, which is also a FEHA violation." Wysinger v. Auto Club of So. Cal., 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424-25, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007) (internal quotations and citations omitted). "FEHA requires an informal process with the employee to attempt to identify reasonable accommodations, [*36]  not necessarily ritualized discussions." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015). "Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Swanson, 232 Cal. App. 4th at 971-72.
The interactive process terminates when the employer "implement[s] an accommodation that is effective in allowing the applicant or employee to perform the essential functions of the job." 2 Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 2 § 11069(c)(8); see also A.M. v. Albertsons, LLC, 178 Cal. App. 4th 455, 464, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009) ("None of the legal authorities that Albertsons cites persuades us that the legislature intended that after a reasonable accommodation is granted, the interactive process continued to apply in a failure to accommodate context.").
Defendant does not challenge this claim substantively, but merely argues that her "examples of failure to engage in [the] interactive process are actually her demands for reasonable accommodation, which is a separate cause of action." Specifically, Defendant cites Plaintiff's testimony that Defendant failed to meet its obligations [*37]  under the interactive process by refusing to allow her to use an outside expert to implement the reasonable accommodations she seeks. When asked if Defendant ever refused to hold an interactive process meeting, Plaintiff stated that she "didn't need a meeting per se, I needed the actual follow-through." Jelin Tr. At 120:21-25.
Plaintiff argues that Defendant's "denial of a duty to hire an outside vendor (or allow [Plaintiff] to do so) to implement an effective accommodation is a repudiation of Gov. Code § 12940(n) and an admission of bad faith in the interactive process," citing Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d at 1137-38. Humphrey held that "[t]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Id. at 1137.
It appears undisputed that Defendant engaged in the process and considered Plaintiff's proposal of supplementing Defendant's implementation efforts with those of an outside expert. The mere fact that Defendant concluded that it was not reasonable to hire a third party when it had internal resources might have been incorrect but that does not necessarily demonstrate that it engaged in the interactive [*38]  process in bad faith. At the same time, Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact about Defendant's good faith in engaging in the process because she has submitted a declaration that after ten years of considering Plaintiff's requests it finally approved bringing in a consultant to properly install and set up her workstation with the requested accommodations in December 2017 and completed the set up in March 2018. See Jelin Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 7.
With respect to the issue of whether the statute of limitations has run on the interactive process claim or the continuing violation doctrine applies, the evidence about the March 2018 accommodation cuts both ways to some extent. On the one hand, the fact that Defendant continued to engage in the process and eventually hired an outside consultant as Plaintiff requested supports the conclusion that continued efforts at informal conciliation would not be futile. See Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823. On the other hand, Defendant hired the consultant over a year after Plaintiff instituted this lawsuit, which arguably suggests that "further efforts to end the unlawful conduct [would] be in vain" and the only option left was litigation. Id. As all reasonable inferences must be drawn [*39]  in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has raised a triable issue. Further, Defendant has not put forward sufficient evidence to identify when Plaintiff should have been on notice that additional informal conciliation was futile.
Based on the evidence submitted by the parties, the Court denies summary judgment on the interactive process claim.

E. Failure to Pay Wages or Reimbursement
Plaintiff also claims that Defendant owes her a substantial amount in back pay and reimbursement for expenses. To establish a claim for unpaid wages, Plaintiff must show: (1) that she performed work for Defendant; (2) Defendant owes Plaintiff wages under the terms of the employment; and (3) the amount of unpaid wages. See Cal. Civil Jury Instruction 2700 (setting forth elements of Cal. Labor Code §§ 201, 202, 218). Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's claim is barred for alleged violations that occurred four years before the complaint was filed, as four years is the statute of limitations for breach of a written contract. See Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 337.
Plaintiff first points out that Defendant did not raise the Section 337 statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in its answer. A party who fails to properly raise an affirmative defense in the [*40]  answer generally waives that defense. See In re Cellular 101, Inc., 539 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2008) ("In responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense . . .," quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). However, the Ninth Circuit has "liberalized the requirement that defendants must raise affirmative defenses in their initial pleadings." Magana v. Commonwealth of the N. Mar. I., 107 F.3d 1436, 1446 (9th Cir. 1997). In its discretion, the Court may permit a party to raise an affirmative defense for the first time on summary judgment but "only if the delay does not prejudice the plaintiff." Id. The Court will consider this defense.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff was required to obtain pre-approval for any overtime, which Plaintiff acknowledged in her deposition that she did not obtain. Plaintiff responds that even though the contract required prior approval of overtime, she was directed to work beyond the contracted hours. Without citing any evidence or authority, Plaintiff contends that the direction to perform the work that resulted in overtime constituted the pre-approval. That argument is unpersuasive. As to the reimbursement issue, Defendant similarly argues that Plaintiff has acknowledged that the Defendant required her to obtain pre-approval for any expenses she wanted reimbursed, [*41]  but she refused to obtain pre-approval. Plaintiff's complaint also did not identify under which statute or common law theory she is pursing these claims. In her opposition, Plaintiff acknowledged that she is not aware of any case law on point. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment as to overtime and reimbursement.

F. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff's complaint also raises state and federal retaliation claims but does not specify under which specific provision of law the claims arise. Defendant moved for summary judgment of all of the alleged retaliation claims under the ADA and the FEHA. At the hearing on the motion, Plaintiff announced that she was not necessarily seeking relief under these particular civil rights statutes for certain retaliation claims, such as the claim that she was retaliated against for serving on a jury. Following the hearing, Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief clarifying that her complaint intended to raise the state-law retaliation claims under the following statutes: (1) complaints about not providing required services to students under Cal. Labor Code § 1102.5; (2) service on a jury under Cal. Labor Code § 230(a); and (3) requested reasonable accommodation under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). Defendant objected [*42]  that Plaintiff's supplemental brief was filed in disregard of Local Rule 7-3(d) that requires the Court to pre-approve the filing of additional memoranda or other documents after a reply has been filed. It contends that identifying these statutory provisions after summary judgment is fully briefed and discovery has closed is highly prejudicial. Even if the Court were to consider the supplemental brief, Defendant argues that the motion should still be granted on these claims for the reasons articulated in its opening brief.
While it is long-established that failure to allege legal theories does not require dismissal of a complaint, see Fontana v. Haskin, 262 F.3d 871, 877 (9th Cir. 2001), "in defending against a summary judgment motion . . . the plaintiff must identify a viable legal basis for relief based upon the record." Pardo v. Mecum Auction Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49931, 2017 WL 1217198, at *7 n.12 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 31, 2017) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); United States v. Ritz, 721 F.3d 825, 827 (7th Cir. 2013); Transamerica Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Sykes, 171 F.3d 553, 555 (7th Cir. 1999)). A complaint's failure to plead a specific legal theory or even mistakenly citing the wrong statute that applies to a given claim is not necessarily fatal, "provided the error is corrected in response to the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the defendant is not harmed by the delay in correct." Hatmaker v. Memorial Medical Ctr., 619 F.3d 741, 743 (7th Cir. 2010).
Plaintiff cited Labor Code § 230(a) and § 1102.5 in her opposition to the motion on the retaliation claims, but otherwise she did [*43]  not identify or discuss these particular statutes at any point before summary judgment briefing was complete and failed to provide any justification for not doing so. Plaintiff's inaction deprived Defendant of the opportunity to conduct discovery and move for summary judgment on all of the bases for Plaintiff's claims. Further, Plaintiff disregarded the Court's rules by filing her supplemental brief without seeking leave of Court first. While the Court does not condone this conduct, these newly-identified grounds for Plaintiff's retaliation claims do not change the outcome because the legal test for each type of alleged retaliation is essentially the same under state law. Thus, the Court will move to the merits of each basis for Defendant's motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claims,5 but cautions Plaintiff not to engage in unauthorized filings.
The general framework for all of the retaliation claims that are currently before the Court is essentially the same. The Ninth Circuit applies the Title VII framework to ADA retaliation claims. See Brown, 336 F.3d at 1186. To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must establish that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) she suffered [*44]  an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064 (9th Cir. 2002). An adverse employment action by an employer must be "materially adverse, 'which means . . . it might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'" Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006). Causation is shown by "evidence that engaging in the protected activity was one of the reasons for [her] [the adverse employment action] and that but for such activity" the adverse employment action would not have been taken. Id. at 1065. In some cases, "causation can be inferred from timing alone where an adverse employment action follows on the heels of protected activity." Id. If Plaintiff makes out this prima facie case, the burden shifts to Defendant to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the action. See Pardi v. Kaiser Permanente Hosp., Inc., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004). If Defendant is unable to make that showing, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to demonstrate whether those reasons were pretextual. Id.
The standard is generally the same for a retaliation claim under the FEHA. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). However, the California courts have articulated the following as the definition of "adverse employment action": something that "materially [*45]  affects the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, rather than simply that the employee has been subjected to an adverse action or treatment that reasonably would deter an employee form engaging in the protected activity." McRae v. Dep't of Corrections, 142 Cal. App. 4th 377, 386, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under § 1102.5, "a plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected activity, that she was thereafter subject to adverse employment action by her employer, and there was a causal link between the two." Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif, 39 Cal. 4th 260, 287-88, 46 Cal. Rptr. 3d 638, 139 P.3d 30 (2006). A claim for retaliation for jury service under Labor Code § 230(a) is subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas. See Gonzalez v. Schneider Elec. USA, Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140628, 2015 WL 6081857, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 14, 2015) (citing Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente, Int'l, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1108-09, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007)).

1. Confronting Plaintiff's Supervisors about the Legally Mandated Services
There is undisputed evidence that Plaintiff's supervisors directed her to not provide legally mandated services to students during the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 school years, but also that the services would be provided at a later time. In each case, there is undisputed evidence that Plaintiff spoke up against these directions.
Defendant first argues that these claims are time barred to the extent they occurred prior to January 25, 2015. However, the evidence put forward on this motion [*46]  is indistinct about when these instances actually occurred. Based on the record currently before the Court, Defendant has not met its burden to prove that "no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for" it, which it must do because Defendant has the burden to prove an affirmative defense.
On the merits, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on these claims because Plaintiff's "speaking up" against these directions that she considered contrary to law does not constitute a protected activity. Under the § 1102.5(c), "protected activity" is "refusing to participate in an activity" that would result in a violation or noncompliance with a law or regulation. Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5(c). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's complaints to her supervisors were not protected activities because although her supervisors directed her not to provide the legally mandated services they later clarified that the services would be made up at a later date and, therefore, there was no unlawful activity. Defendant is correct in part. Complaining about a work condition is considered "reporting activity," not a refusal to act. See Robles, 158 F. Supp. 3d at 1007 (citing Tobin v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco Police Dep't, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54917, 2015 WL 1885632, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2015). There is no evidence that she refused to follow her supervisors' decision to scale [*47]  back service to the students.
Another issue that is fatal to Plaintiff's claim under this statute is that she has not raised a triable issue of fact that her actions opposing the directive resulted in retaliation. Plaintiff testified that she was retaliated against by being assigned a heavier workload. No one ever admitted or implied that the work assignments were made in retaliation for her opposition, and Plaintiff has not provided any other evidence that her workload was connected to her complaints aside from her speculation. There is also a disconnect between her claim that the heavy workload is connected to her complaints and her testimony that she had a heavy workload for several years before the 2013 2014 school year (the first year she asserts she raised her concerns with her supervisors). Thus, Plaintiff has not shown any link between her opposition and the work assignments. Plaintiff has not even established the presumption of a causal connection that can result from events happening in close proximity to each other because she does not provide any specific evidence about instances where her work assignments increased after making her opposition known.
Finally, Plaintiff has [*48]  also provided evidence that she was reprimanded in June 2016. Plaintiff admits that the official reason for the reprimand was that she exhibited unprofessional behavior toward a colleague, but she testified that she believes that real reason for the reprimand was retaliation for her complaints. Plaintiff has not provided any evidence for this undisclosed motive except for her speculation, which is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact on a retaliation claim.

2. Lodging Complaints with the School Board about the Legally Mandated Services
Relatedly, Plaintiff alleges that she was discriminated against for lodging complaints with the school board on June 13, 2016 in opposition to the directive that she withhold legally mandated services. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has no evidence to establish a causal connection between her statements at the school board meeting where none of her supervisors were present, and her supervisors' retaliation for opposing their directive. Plaintiff has not put forward any of this evidence to raise a triable issue of fact, and therefore summary judgment is warranted on this specific claim.

3. Filing the § 910 Tort Claim Form
On March 11, 2016, Plaintiff [*49]  filed a § 910 Tort Claim Form with Defendant. As a result of that protected activity, she claims that Defendant retaliated against her by: (1) taking too long to provide the form to her because no one knew where to locate it; and (2) forcing her to attend multiple meetings, receiving excessive email, not having reasonable accommodations in place, and not providing working computers.
The first allegation of retaliation -- the delayed provision of the form -- must fail. First, the alleged retaliation occurred before she filed her complaint, cutting against causation. More fundamentally, however, such a trivial action would not deter a reasonable employee from complaining about violations. See Brooks, 229 F.3d at 928.
On the claims that she was retaliated against after filing the charge, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection because she does not have any evidence that Defendant actually knew she had engaged in any protected conduct in filing the § 910 form. See Raney v. Vinson Guard Serv., Inc., 120 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir. 1997). Plaintiff argues that there is evidence of knowledge and causation because she testified that Ms. Jones likely saw her completing the form, which implies that Defendant had knowledge and that filing the § 910 form resulted in Defendant [*50]  retaliating against her. However, Plaintiff acknowledged that Ms. Jones has denied ever being aware that Plaintiff submitted the form. Even drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, mere speculation about Ms. Jones's knowledge in the face of her denial of any such knowledge is insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact regarding causation. Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Defendant's favor on this retaliation claim.

4. Filing EEOC Documents
Plaintiff has also alleged that she was retaliated against for filing an EEOC questionnaire6 in October 2015 as well as the EEOC on January 25, 2016 that resulted in a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. Plaintiff contends that she was retaliated against for the October 2015 charge during the November 13, 2015 meeting when she was placed on leave. She contends that she was further retaliated against for the January 25, 2016 EEOC charge because she was not allowed to return to work, she was later assigned to two schools that were known to have the most difficult administrators, and she was not allowed to use the ergonomic set-up for her workstation that she purchased from Bob's Foam.
As to the October 2015 charge, Defendant argues that [*51]  her retaliation claim fails for several reasons. First, it argues that Plaintiff has proffered no evidence, aside from her oral representation, that she filed an EEOC questionnaire in October 2015. However, in her opposition Plaintiff provides a copy of the EEOC questionnaire, which is dated October 7, 2015, contains a Bates stamp, and which Plaintiff represents was produced to Defendant on February 7, 2017. Second, Defendant contends that she has not demonstrated that there is a causal connection between the questionnaire and the November 13, 2015 meeting because Plaintiff testified that no one at the meeting stated that they were placing her on leave to retaliate for submitting the questionnaire. However, Plaintiff has submitted evidence that the EEOC informed Defendant about the questionnaire, although there is no evidence in the record that anyone at that specific meeting knew she had filed it.7 However, the November 13, 2015 meeting took place approximately five weeks after she filed the questionnaire. Because of the adverse employment action occurred shortly after engaging in the protected activity of filing the EEOC questionnaire, it is reasonable to infer, drawing all inferences [*52]  in favor of Plaintiff as the non-moving party, that there was a causal connection.
Third, even if Plaintiff can make out her prima facie case regarding the October 2015 charge, Defendant contends that it has provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action of placing her on leave. For the reasons discussed above regarding a discrimination claim based on the decision to place on her a leave of absence, Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact about whether that reason was mere pre-text.
Regarding the January 25, 2016 EEOC charge, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact that a causal link exists between the protected activity and the retaliation. Defendant relies on testimony from Plaintiff that she knows the two actions were related because she spoke to an EEOC employee who told her that she was not surprised that she was placed on leave after the November 13, 2015 meeting because Defendant had been informed about the EEOC charge. Defendant appears to argue that the filing of the October 2015 questionnaire could not be the causal link between the January 2016 charge and the retaliatory acts. However, the close timing [*53]  of all of the protected activities and alleged retaliatory acts events (the October 2015 questionnaire, the November 2015 meeting, the leave of absence, the January 2016 charge, and the allegation that she was not allowed to return to work and even when she was she was subjected to several retaliatory measures) establishes that Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact on causation and the October 2015 questionnaire and Defendant's knowledge of it could be part of that causal chain. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion as to both EEOC document-related retaliation claims.

5. Colleague's Refusal to Submit Plaintiff's Absence Form
Plaintiff alleges that her supervisor Ms. Wells retaliated against her in October 2015 by refusing to mark her as absent in the computer attendance system when she was out for jury duty in violation of California Labor Code § 230(a). "Minor or relatively trivial adverse actions or conduct by employers of fellow employees that, from an objective perspective, are reasonably likely to do no more than anger or upset an employee cannot properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment and are not actionable." Malais v. Los Angeles City Fire Dept., 150 Cal. App. 4th 350, 357, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 444 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007) (citing Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1054). The allegedly retaliatory [*54]  conduct at issue here -- a colleague's refusal to do Plaintiff the favor of marking her absence for jury duty in the school's computer records -- does not rise to the level of a material action. Viewed objectively, it is no more than an insignificant slight from a coworker. In addition to the trivial nature of the alleged conduct, Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence that she suffered any negative repercussions as a result of this conduct, further demonstrating that there is no triable issue of fact that this action had a detrimental effect on her employment. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment on this retaliation claim.

6. Leaving Work at a "Reasonable Time"
Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendant retaliated against her for ending her work day at a "reasonable time," which she defines as between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., by Ms. Wells, who subsequently made slanderous statements about her to staff, parents, and students in the 2015 2016 school year. Plaintiff's testimony about these actions is undisputed.
Defendant argues that leaving work at a time that Plaintiff considered reasonable is not a protected activity. Plaintiff concedes that it is not a protected [*55]  activity in her opposition. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion as to the retaliation claim that is based on leaving work at a "reasonable time."

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion. Specifically, the Court grants the motion as to the following claims: (1) failure to pay wages or reimbursement; and (2) federal and state retaliation based on Plaintiff's lodging of complaints about the directive not to provide legally mandated services, the filing of the § 910 form, a colleague's refusal to submit Plaintiff's absence record regarding jury duty, and Plaintiff's decision to leave work at a "reasonable time." The Court denies the motion as to the federal and state discrimination claims and the retaliation claim regarding the filing of EEOC documents, the state claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, the failure to engage in the interactive process. The claims that survive summary judgment are limited by the statute of limitations to the extent discussed in the body of this order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
