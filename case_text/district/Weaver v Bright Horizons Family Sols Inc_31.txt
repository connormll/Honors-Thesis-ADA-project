MEMORANDUM

Proceedings: (In Chambers) Order GRANTING Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 38)
Defendants Bright Horizons Children's Centers, LLC (BHCC) and Bright Horizons Family Solutions, Inc. (BHFS) move for summary judgment.

I. UNDISPUTED FACTS1
Plaintiff Gregory Weaver brings the present action as personal representative of the estate of Marcie Weaver. In 1994, Ms. Weaver was hired by BHCC as a teacher.2 Pl's Resp. to Defs.' Undisputed Facts (PRUF) 21. She eventually became the Marketing and Events Coordinator. PRUF 22. BHCC provides medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), California Family Rights Act (CFRA), and Extended Medical Leave, which is provided for employees who exhaust their FMLA and CFRA leave.3 PRUF 32. In March 2011, Ms. Weaver requested six weeks of leave under the FMLA for a surgery needed for a medical condition; this leave began on March 11, 2011. PRUF 34-35. Ms. Weaver was granted an extension of her leave until May 18, 2011, PRUF 36, and another extension until June 13, 2011, PRUF 38-39
Ms. [*2]  Weaver returned to work in June 2011. PRUF 40. She was allowed to work from home when needed and other employees performed some of her main duties when she was unable to perform them. PRUF 41-42. Ms. Weaver was also provided three days off every three weeks for chemotherapy, PRUF 45, until she requested leave again in August 2011. PRUF 47-48. Because Ms. Weaver had exhausted her FMLA leave, BHCC provided her leave under its Extended Medical Leave policy to commence August 17, 2011. PRUF 49-50. On October 3, 2011, Ms. Weaver returned to work. PRUF 52. BHCC again accommodated Ms. Weaver by allowing her to work from home as needed, having other employees perform some of her job duties, and giving her time off for treatments. PRUF 53. Ms. Weaver did not tell BHCC that she needed alternate accommodations when she returned to work in June 2011 or when she returned in October 2011. PRUF 54. On January 13, 2012, Ms. Weaver requested further leave because of her chemotherapy treatment. PRUF 56.
BHCC granted further leave under the Extended Leave Policy to commence on January 20, 2012. PRUF 58. On January 31, 2012, BHCC received a doctor's certification form indicating that Ms. Weaver could not [*3]  work a full eight-hour workday; this form did not include an anticipated return date. PRUF 59-60. On this date, BHCC also received a leave of absence request form indicating that Ms. Weaver anticipated returning to work on March 19, 2012. PRUF 61. In March 2012, Ms. Weaver requested an extension of her leave through May 21, 2012. PRUF 62. Ms. Weaver's leave entitlement under the Extended Medical Leave policy was exhausted on April 13, 2012. PRUF 63. BHCC granted Ms. Weaver's request for leave until May 21, 2012 as an accommodation. PRUF 64. On April 23, 2012, BHCC sent a letter to Ms. Weaver asking that she complete and return an Accommodations Request Form (ARF). PRUF 65.
On May 7, 2012, BHCC received an ARF indicating that Ms. Weaver could not last an eight-hour day and this limitation would last until July 1, 2012. PRUF 66-67. The ARF did not suggest any accommodations that would allow Ms. Weaver to return to work. PRUF 68. On June 8, 2012, BHCC sent a letter to Ms. Weaver notifying her that her leave of absence had been extended through July 1, 2012 and that her need for continued leave would be re-evaluated at that time; the letter requested an ARF and invited Ms. Weaver to contact [*4]  BHCC to discuss any reasonable accommodations that would enable her to work. PRUF 72-74. On June 26, 2012, BHCC received an ARF indicating that Ms. Weaver could not work a full eight-hour workday and this limitation would last until September 15, 2012; the ARF did not suggest any accommodations. PRUF 75-76. BHCC granted this extension. PRUF 77.
On September 4, 2012, BHCC sent Ms. Weaver a letter informing her of her upcoming leave expiration and requested that she contact them to schedule a return to work or provide documentation that she could not return. PRUF 84. On September 17, 2012, BHCC received an ARF indicating that Ms. Weaver was limited in her ability to concentrate, walk, stand, and perform manual tasks. The ARF also stated she could not last an eight-hour workday and the limitations would last until January 2, 2013. PRUF 85-86. No accommodations were suggested. PRUF 86. BHCC granted further leave of absence through January 2, 2013. PRUF 87.
On December 5, 2012, Kristen Anderson, a BHCC employee, and Travis sent Ms. Weaver a letter notifying her of the upcoming expiration of her leave and requesting that she contact them to schedule her return to work or inform BHCC of her [*5]  inability to return. PRUF 92. On December 14, 2012, BHCC received an ARF which indicated Ms. Weaver could not work a full day and was limited in her ability to lift, walk, and perform manual tasks. PRUF 93. The ARF stated the limitations would last through July 1, 2013 and did not suggest any accommodations. PRUF 94.
Travis and Sara Hannah, a BHCC employee, sent Ms. Weaver letters on December 20, 2012 and January 11, 2013 informing her that her position had been eliminated due to budget cuts. PRUF 95. These letters stated BHCC received Ms. Weaver's ARF indicating she could not work a full day and offered Ms. Weaver a part-time teaching position working six hours a day, five days a week. PRUF 96. Further, the letters advised Ms. Weaver to consult with her doctor regarding potential accommodations and invited her to discuss with BHCC the feasibility of these accommodations. PRUF 97.
On January 16, 2013, Ms. Weaver responded in a letter indicating she could not take the position as her physical condition prevented her from working six hours a day, five days a week. PRUF 98. The letter requested that her leave be extended until July 2013 and her position in the company be re-evaluated then. [*6]  PRUF 99. BHCC extended Ms. Weaver's leave through June 3, 2013, at which time BHCC would re-evaluate Ms. Weaver's ability to return to work. PRUF 102. On May 24, 2013, Anderson and Travis sent Ms. Weaver a letter regarding the upcoming expiration of her leave and requesting she contact them to schedule her return or inform them of her inability to return to work. PRUF 103. On June 5, 2013, BHCC received an ARF stating Ms. Weaver was limited in her ability to lift, walk, stand, and perform manual tasks. PRUF 104. The ARF affirmatively stated that no accommodations were suggested at that time and specified that because Ms. Weaver was receiving chemotherapy until December 1, 2013, her doctor could not set a potential return date until evaluating Ms. Weaver's condition after the therapy. PRUF 106. BHCC extended Ms. Weaver's leave through July 1, 2013. PRUF 107. On July 1, 2013, BHCC terminated Ms. Weaver's employment. PRUF 113. Plaintiff brings wrongful termination, employment discrimination, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) claims.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
"A party may move for summary judgment, [*7]  identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "This burden is not a light one." In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010). But the moving party need not disprove the opposing party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Rather, if the moving party satisfies this burden, the party opposing the motion must set forth specific facts, through affidavits or admissible discovery materials, showing that there exists a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 323-24; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). A non-moving party who bears the burden of proof at trial as to an element essential to its case must make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine dispute of fact with respect to the existence of that element of the case or be subject to summary judgment. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322.
The "mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of fact is a genuine issue if it reasonably can be resolved in favor of either party. Id. at 250-51. "[M]ere disagreement [*8]  or the bald assertion that a genuine issue of material fact exists" does not preclude summary judgment. Harper v. Wallingford, 877 F.2d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 1989). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury . . . could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [non-movant] is entitled to a verdict . . . ." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. at 248.
"A district court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment may only be based on admissible evidence." Oracle, 627 F.3d at 385. A party seeking to admit evidence bears the burden of proof to show its admissibility. Id. Courts need not scour the record to determine if evidence is admissible. Id. at 385-86. If an opposing party objects to the admissibility of proffered evidence, the onus is on the proponent to direct the Court to the documents and evidentiary principles that it claims make the evidence admissible. Id.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Evidentiary Issues
Much of Plaintiff's evidence comes from Ms. Weaver's declaration. The declaration is a 17-page 55-paragraph document that begins: "I make this statement for the purpose [*9]  of preserving my story and the truth about the devastating way my employment ended. I am making this statement so that, if at some point in the future, I am unable to provide testimony to this court my story can be told and somebody can read this story."4 Counsel admitted at the hearing that the declaration was an attorney-prepared document, and stated that Ms. Weaver had taken an unsigned version from his office to review after it was prepared. It appears the original complaint was filed on or about June 30, 2015, more than a month before the declaration was signed. Defendants were apparently first provided notice of the litigation on or about June 9, 2016, Dkt. #1, Ex. C, A, long after Ms. Weaver's death. The existence of this declaration was revealed for the first time when Plaintiff filed his Opposition to this Motion.5
Defendants contend the declaration is inadmissible. But the party opposing summary judgment need not produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; see Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c)(2). Rather, the questions are 1) whether the evidence could be submitted in admissible form at trial and 2) "if reduced to admissible evidence" would it be sufficient [*10]  to carry the party's burden at trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 327; Fed. R. Civ. P 56(c)(2). Ms. Weaver cannot testify to the contents of her declaration at trial because she is deceased. The Court, therefore, must determine whether the declaration itself — or portions of it - would be admissible at trial.
As an out-of-court statement submitted for the truth of its contents, Ms. Weaver's declaration is hearsay. The Court may allow hearsay under Rule 807 under the following circumstances6:
(1) the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness;
(2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;
(3) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts; and
(4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.
A district court has the discretion to admit a hearsay statement in "exceptional circumstances" so long as it meets the Rule's requirements. United States v. Bonds, 608 F.3d 495, 500 (9th Cir. 2010). The most important consideration is whether the hearsay has circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness "equivalent to those present in the traditional exceptions to the hearsay rule." Fong v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 626 F.2d 759, 763 (9th Cir. 1980). Factors courts consider in evaluating the trustworthiness of hearsay evidence include whether the declarant (1) was under oath, (2) made the statement voluntarily, (3) based the statement on personal knowledge, (4) contradicted any previous statement, and (5) had the statement preserved on videotape to afford the jury an opportunity to evaluate declarant's [*12]  demeanor. United States v. Sanchez-Lima, 161 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir. 1998).
Here, Ms. Weaver gave her statement voluntarily while under oath and, for the most part, based on personal knowledge. Although these factors would otherwise weigh in favor of application of the residual exception, it is apparent to the Court that consideration of other factors so significantly diminishes the statement's trustworthiness that the statement cannot be admitted into evidence. Notably, there was no effort made to permit Ms. Weaver to be deposed — or even to make the lawsuit known to Defendants — until Ms. Weaver was no longer available for cross-examination. Nor was the statement videotaped.7 Indeed, Defendants were not made aware of even the possible existence of the declaration until Plaintiff's opposition was filed - long after Ms. Weaver had passed away.
That the declaration was drafted by her attorney for use in her lawsuit after she was no longer available for cross-examination weighs heavily against its trustworthiness. See Wilander v. McDermott Inter., Inc., 887 F.2d 88, 92 (5th Cir. 1989). Ms. Weaver, as the original plaintiff, had an interest in presenting the facts related in her declaration in the light most favorable to her claims. Her initial statement makes that clear. Obviously, the statements were not spontaneous. [*13]  That the declaration was prepared and executed at least three years after the events described further diminishes its trustworthiness. See United States v. Sinclair, 74 F.3d 753, 759 (7th Cir. 1996) (stating that "immediacy of . . . knowledge is one of the key circumstances indicating trustworthiness"). The Court finds the declaration is not admissible under Rule 807(a).89
The parties also contest the admissibility of Plaintiff's declaration. Though Plaintiff is available to testify at trial, the Court must determine whether the contents of the statements would be admissible. See Williams v. Borough of W. Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 465 n.12 (3d Cir. 1989) ("[H]earsay evidence produced in an affidavit opposing summary judgment may be considered if the out-of-court declarant could later present that evidence through direct testimony, i.e., 'in a form that would be admissible at trial.'"). Defendants contend the statements in Plaintiff's declaration that purport to create genuine issues of material fact would be inadmissible hearsay at trial, as they describe statements made by Ms. Weaver. Defs.' Obj. at 6, 109-110. Plaintiff argues such statements would be admissible under the state-of-mind hearsay exception. Pl.'s Response to Defs.' Obj. at 7-8, 73-76. But
[t]he state-of-mind exception does not permit the witness to relate any of the declarant's [*14]  statements as to why he held the particular state of mind, or what he might have believed that would have induced the state of mind. If the reservation in the text of the rule is to have any effect, it must be understood to narrowly limit those admissible statements to declarations of condition — "I'm scared" - and not belief - "I'm scared because [someone] threatened me."
United States v. Emmert, 829 F.2d 805, 810 (9th Cir.1987). The Court finds this exception does not apply because the statements are offered to show why Ms. Weaver may have had certain states of mind. Further, to the extent such statements are limited to show that Ms. Weaver was in a good or bad mood - without disclosing why - they would fail to create genuine issues of material fact.
Plaintiff also submits the declaration of Michael Robbins as an expert to opine on whether Defendants engaged in an adequate reasonable accommodation process and whether they appropriately responded to Ms. Weaver's complaints. These opinions are not admissible because they rely on facts not in evidence, see Fed. R. Evid. 702, or offer legal opinions, see United States v. Boulware, 558 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir. 2009).

B. Employment Discrimination Claim
Plaintiff filed an employment discrimination claim against Defendants under section 12940(a) of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. [*15]  California has adopted the federal three-stage burden-shifting test for analyzing discrimination claims. See Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (citations omitted). This test requires the plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, after which the defendant has the burden to show a non-discriminatory reason for its action. Id. at 354-55. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff must show that the proffered non-discriminatory reason is a mere pretext for discrimination. Id. at 356. To prove a prima facie case of discrimination, a "plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Id. at 355. The Court finds Plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination because he has not shown that Ms. Weaver was qualified for the position from which she was terminated.
To be qualified for a position, a plaintiff must - with or without reasonable accommodations - be capable of performing the essential functions [*16]  of that position. See Hastings v. Dep't of Corr., 110 Cal. App. 4th 963, 970-71, 2 Cal. Rptr. 3d 329 (2003). Prior to her termination on July 1, 2013, Ms. Weaver - in response to Defendants' letter advising that her leave will expire - faxed a note from her doctor. Mot., Meyer Decl., Ex. 29. This note, received by Defendants on June 5, 2013, indicated that Ms. Weaver would require a leave of absence and that the doctor had no suggestions of accommodations that would allow Ms. Weaver to perform the essential functions of her job. Id. The note further explained that the doctor could not determine a potential return date for Ms. Weaver until her chemotherapy ended around December 1, 2013. Id. Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence showing that Ms. Weaver could have performed the essential functions of her job - even with reasonable accommodations - when she was terminated on July 1, 2013. See Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1060 (C.D. Cal. 2005) ("Numerous courts have held that attendance at work is an essential job function.") (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment on Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.
In his opposition, Plaintiff appears to advance claims for failure to reasonably accommodate and failure to engage in interactive process under subdivisions (m) and (n) of California Government Code section 12940. Opp. at 11-13. But because these claims were [*17]  not pleaded in Plaintiff's complaint, the Court need not consider them. Even if it did, these claims would fail.
The record shows that Defendants provided Ms. Weaver with reasonable accommodations - leaves of absence - until July 1, 2013. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) ("[R]easonable accommodation can include providing the employee accrued paid leave or additional unpaid leave for treatment."). Plaintiff argues that Defendants should have continued offering Ms. Weaver leave. Opp. at 4. In Ms. Weaver's last twenty-eight months of employment, Defendants provided twenty-three months of leave, including an eighteen-month period of consecutive leave leading to Ms. Weaver's termination. "Reasonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Id. at 226-27 (quotation omitted). In light of Ms. Weaver's extended leave and her doctor's indication in his June 5, 2013 note that he could not determine a return date until Ms. Weaver's chemotherapy ended on December 1, 2013, the Court finds no genuine dispute of material fact that Defendants failed to provide reasonable accommodation by not offering further leave.
"[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration [*18]  of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees' with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively. . . . [N]either side can delay or obstruct the process." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984-85, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (quotations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the record demonstrates Defendants engaged in a process aimed at trying to accommodate Ms. Weaver. Further, an "employer cannot be held liable for failing to engage in interactive process when the employee was in fact offered a reasonable accommodation." Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1195, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009) (quoting Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 229). Until the July 1, 2013 termination, Defendants provided Ms. Weaver with the accommodations she requested - leaves of absence. Nor is there any evidence that Ms. Weaver requested any accommodation other than a leave of absence. Plaintiff's claim as to Defendants' pre-termination conduct fails. See Dep't of Fair Employment & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743 (9th Cir. 2011) (granting employer's motion for summary judgment as to failure to interact claim where employee failed to suggest any potential accommodations not already considered by employer).
Plaintiff contends Defendants acted unlawfully by unilaterally deciding Ms. Weaver's leave was indefinite when terminating her. Opp. at 14. But Plaintiff cannot survive summary judgment for an interactive [*19]  process claim because there is no genuine issue of fact that a reasonable accommodation was available. See Nadaf—Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984. The Court similarly rejects Plaintiff's argument that Defendants should have considered Ms. Weaver for other positions before terminating her because Plaintiff has made no showing that Ms. Weaver could have performed the essential functions of those positions. See Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 264, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007) (FEHA limits "protective scope to those employees with a disability who can perform the essential duties of the employment position with reasonable accommodation."). Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue as to his failure to engage in interactive process claim.10

C. Wrongful Termination Claim
Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim is based on a violation of FEHA. Opp. at 19. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion as to this claim for the same reasons as above.

D. Breach of Contract Claim
Defendants contend Ms. Weaver acknowledged the at-will status of her employment. Mot. at 20. Plaintiff contends the parties formed an implied-in-fact contract that Ms. Weaver was no longer at will, pointing out that Ms. Weaver worked for a long time with good performance reviews. Opp. at 19-20. In a recent [*20]  case, the California Supreme Court held that an implied-in-fact agreement not to terminate without good cause cannot arise solely from an employee's many years of successful service, but the court confirmed that it is possible for an implied-in-fact agreement sufficient to overcome the statutory presumption of at-will employment to arise. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 336-44. However, an implied-in-fact agreement not to terminate without good cause cannot arise when there is an express agreement providing that employment is at will. See id. at 337 ("Where there is no express agreement, the issue is whether other evidence of the parties' conduct [creates an implied-in-fact agreement]."). An implied-in-fact contract requiring cause for termination is fundamentally inconsistent with an express at-will contract, and the terms of the express contract cannot be rewritten by implications arising from later conduct. See Camp v. Jeffer, Mangels, Butler, & Marmaro, 35 Cal. App. 4th 620, 630, 41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329 (1995), superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Salas v. Sierra Chemical Co., 59 Cal.4th 407, 427, 173 Cal. Rptr. 3d 689, 327 P.3d 797 (2014) (holding that the plaintiffs' "express at-will agreement precluded the existence of an implied contract requiring good cause for termination").
Here, Ms. Weaver was aware of and confirmed her at-will employment status as evidenced by her execution on June 20, 2005 [*21]  of the Employee Handbook acknowledgement stating that her "employment is at-will." Mot., Travis Decl., Ex. 35. Plaintiff cannot now introduce evidence of an altered relationship between the parties and indeed, there is no such evidence.11 As a result, Defendants were entitled to terminate plaintiff's employment at any time, with or without cause. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's breach of contract claim.

E. Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Claim
Because a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can only arise when there is a valid express or implied contract between the parties, Plaintiff's breach of covenant claim also fails. See Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2003).

F. IIED Claim
To plead a claim for IIED, a plaintiff must allege "(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). This claim is premised on the same conduct on which Plaintiff's employment discrimination claim is [*22]  based. As discussed above, Plaintiff fails to point to evidence that Defendants unlawfully discriminated against Ms. Weaver. Thus, these same evidentiary deficiencies cause his IIED claim to fail. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.12
