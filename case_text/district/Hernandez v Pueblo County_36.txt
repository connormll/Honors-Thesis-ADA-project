Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the court on "Pueblo County's Motion for Summary Judgment" (Doc. No. 41 [Mot.], filed August 31, 2020). Plaintiff filed her response in opposition (Doc. No. 46 [Resp.], filed November 5, 2020), and Defendant filed its reply (Doc. No. 47 [Reply], filed November 19, 2020).

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed her Complaint on July 30, 2019. (Doc. No. 1 [Compl].) Plaintiff asserts claims, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et. seq., that Defendant Pueblo County, DHS ("the County") discriminated against her on the basis of her disability. (See id.) Plaintiff alleges she has a permanent mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities and that she is regarded by her employer as having an impairment. (Id. at 4.)
Plaintiff states she was employed as a Technician for the County. (Id.) On November 2, 2018, Plaintiff applied for an internal position as Legal Technician with Child Support Service division of DHS. (Id.) Plaintiff [*2]  contends she was qualified and had five years of experience working with Child Support Services in El Paso County. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges she was the only candidate who applied for the Legal Technician position. (Id.) Plaintiff contends that when only one qualified applicant applies for a position, and if the applicant does not have a disqualifying action or performance improvement plan in place at the time of the job posting, the applicant should be awarded the position. (Id.) Despite being qualified for the position, Plaintiff was notified on December 27, 2018, that she was not selected to proceed in the hiring process. (Id.)
Plaintiff asserts a claim for "failure to hire" and "different terms and conditions of employment" on the basis of her disability. (Id. at 3.)

STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS
1. As identified in the online application for the Legal Technician Position, the County requires proficiency in Microsoft Word 2010. (Mot., Ex. A, Hernandez Application at 4.) The online portal specifically advises applicants of testing. (Id.) The job description for the Legal Technician position also lists the same proficiency standards. (Id. at 6.)
2. For existing employees, such as Plaintiff, [*3]  testing is valid for one year; thus, an employee must either pass the required testing process or present results from prior testing within the previous year. (Mot., Ex. B, Human Resources Invite/Testing Email.)
3. On December 5, 2018, Plaintiff was invited to test for the Legal Technician Position. (Id.) The invitation noted that Plaintiff was required to test for Microsoft Word 2010 and Basic Office Skills. (Id.)
4. Despite notice of the testing, Plaintiff "never made contact" with Human Resources to test and failed to show up for the test. (Ex. C, Testing data; email chain.)
5. One month later, in January 2019, Plaintiff resigned her employment with the County. (Doc. No. 24 at 3, § 4.)
6. For purposes of the Legal Technician position, the County uniformly requires all applicants and lateral transfers to have passed a test for and demonstrate proficiency in Microsoft Word 2010 and basic office skills. (Mot., Ex. E, Decl. of Tim Hart. ¶ 1.)
7. Proficiency in Microsoft Word 2010 and basic office skills are necessary in light of the fact that Legal Technicians use computers and online platforms to submit data and information about citizens who utilize County services, including, for example, [*4]  establishing support and medical orders and collecting child support for public assistance customers. (Id., ¶ 2.)
8. For four separate employment application cycles (both before and after Plaintiff's application cycle), all applicants were held to the same standard as Plaintiff with respect to testing requirements. (Mot., Ex. F, Testing results.)

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate if "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Once the moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial on a material matter." Concrete Works, Inc. v. City & County of Denver, 36 F.3d 1513, 1518 (10th Cir. 1994) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325). The nonmoving party may not rest solely on the allegations in the pleadings, but must instead designate "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A disputed fact is "material" if "under the substantive law it is essential to the proper disposition of the claim." Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 670 (10th Cir.1998) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is "genuine" if the evidence is such that it might lead a reasonable [*5]  jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Thomas v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 631 F.3d 1153, 1160 (10th Cir. 2011) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).
When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court may consider only admissible evidence. See Johnson v. Weld County, Colo., 594 F.3d 1202, 1209-10 (10th Cir. 2010). The factual record and reasonable inferences therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. Concrete Works, 36 F.3d at 1517. The following axioms have a bearing on summary judgment disposition—i.e., (1) that "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); (2) "the defendant should seldom if ever be granted summary judgment where his state of mind is at issue and the jury might disbelieve him or his witnesses as to this issue" id. at 256; and (3) "the plaintiff, to survive the defendant's motion, need only present evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in his favor," id. at 257.
Moreover, because Plaintiff is proceeding pro se, the court, "review[s] [her] pleadings and other papers liberally and hold[s] them to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys." Trackwell v. United States, 472 F.3d 1242, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted); see also Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972) (holding allegations of a pro se complaint "to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers"). At the summary judgment stage of litigation, [*6]  a plaintiff's version of the facts must find support in the record. Thomson v. Salt Lake Cnty., 584 F.3d 1304, 1312 (10th Cir. 2009). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007); Thomson, 584 F.3d at 1312.

ANALYSIS
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). When there is no evidence of direct discrimination, as here, courts use the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to evaluate an ADA discrimination claim premised on disparate treatment. Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co., 900 F.3d 1166, 1192 (10th Cir. 2018) (citing Hawkins v. Schwan's Home Serv., Inc., 778 F.3d 877, 883 (10th Cir. 2015)). The first McDonnell Douglas step requires Plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she "(1) is a disabled person as defined by the ADA; (2) is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired; and (3) suffered discrimination by an employer or prospective employer because of that disability." Dwitt v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 845 F.3d 1299, 1308 (10th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Once Plaintiff establishes a [*7]  prima facie case, under McDonnell Douglas the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the employment action in question. Lincoln, 900 F.3d at 1193 (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the second and third elements of her ADA claim. (Mot. at 5-7.)

A. Qualified to Perform Essential Functions of Job
First, Defendants argue Plaintiff was not qualified for promotion to the Legal Technician position. (Id.) To be qualified for transfer, Plaintiff was required to show that she could meet the essential functions of the Legal Technician position. Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1308. The Tenth Circuit has consistently held that courts place "considerable weight on an employer's judgment concerning a particular job's 'essential' functions.' " Kilcrease v. Domenico Transp. Co., 828 F.3d 1214, 1221-22 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). Courts "will not second guess the employer's judgment when its description is job-related, uniformly enforced, and consistent with business necessity." Id.
It is undisputed that the County has, for a period of years, required all applicants for the Legal Technician position to test for proficiency in Microsoft Word 2010. (Mot., Ex. F, Testing results.) Proficiency in Microsoft Word 2010 and basic office skills are necessary [*8]  in light of the fact that Legal Technicians use computers and online platforms to submit data and information about citizens who utilize County services. (Mot., Ex. E, Decl. of Tim Hart. ¶ 2.) Despite this job requirement and notice of the specific testing requirements, Plaintiff failed to sit for the testing. (Mot., Ex. C, Testing data; email chain.)1 Because the Microsoft Office 2010 requirement was uniformly applied among all applicants and is an essential job duty of a Legal Technician, and because Plaintiff failed to take the test, she has not met the second element of her ADA claim.
In her response, Plaintiff argues the County had a duty to engage in the interactive process to see if she could perform the essential functions of the job, with or without an accommodation. (Resp. at 10-12.) This argument fails for several reasons. First, Plaintiff's Complaint is devoid of any allegation that she is asserting a failure to accommodate claim. (See generally, Compl.) Indeed, Plaintiff specifically did not check the choice of "failure to accommodate disability" as a "conduct complained of in [her] claim." (Id. at 3.) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not permit [*9]  a party to raise new claims at the summary judgment stage as it may cause prejudice to the opposing party. Evans v. McDonald's Corp., 936 F.2d 1087, 1090-91 (10th Cir. 1991); see Tucker v. Union of Needletrades, Indus. & Textile Emps., 407 F.3d 784, 788 (6th Cir. 2005); Fisher v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 1073, 1078 (5th Cir. 1990) ("As the district court correctly noted, this claim was not raised in Fisher's second amended complaint but, rather, was raised in his response to the defendants' motion for summary judgment and, as such, was not properly before the court."). Because this claim was not asserted in Plaintiff's Complaint, it is not properly before the court and thus cannot be considered at this time.
Moreover, in her response, Plaintiff concedes that she "could perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodations" and "did not request an ADA accommodation." (Resp. at 2; see also id. at 10 ["[I]t is clear [Plaintiff] could [perform the essential functions of her job without accommodation . . . ."].)
Finally, even if the court were to consider Plaintiff's argument based on a failure to accommodate theory, the argument fails. "Once the employer's responsibilities within the interactive process are triggered by appropriate notice by the employee, both parties have an obligation to proceed in a reasonably interactive manner . . . ." Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1172 (10th Cir. 1999). Essentially, this interactive process [*10]  includes good-faith communications between the employer and employee. Id.; see also 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. ("The appropriate reasonable accommodation is best determined through a flexible, interactive process that involves both the employer and the [employee].") "If this process fails to lead to a reasonable accommodation of the disabled employee's limitations, responsibility will lie with the party that caused the breakdown." McFarland v. City & Cnty. of Denver, No. 15-CV-01258-KMT, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143020, 2017 WL 3872639, at *6 (D. Colo. Sept. 5, 2017) (citing and quoting cases), aff'd, 744 F. App'x 583 (10th Cir. 2018).
An exhibit attached to Plaintiff's response shows she received a letter on December 7, 2018, asking her to provide information related to any disability for which she may need an accommodation and invited her to attend a meeting to engage in the interactive process. (Resp., Ex. 15 at 1.) Another exhibit attached to Plaintiff's response shows Plaintiff failed to appear at the scheduled meeting to discuss any accommodations. (Id., at 12.) As Plaintiff failed to participate in the interactive process and otherwise denies needing an accommodation, she cannot now place blame on the County for allegedly failing to accommodate her through a lateral transfer to the Legal Technician position.
Plaintiff did not comply with a job requirement of testing [*11]  for the applicable computer skills. As such, she was not qualified for transfer to the Legal Technician position. Thus, Plaintiff has not satisfied the second element of her ADA claim.

B. Discrimination Because of Disability
The third element of Plaintiff's prima facie case requires that she show her lack of promotion occurred "under circumstances which give rise to an inference that the termination was based on her disability." Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997). The employee must present affirmative, admissible evidence that the disability was "a determining factor" in the employer's decision. Id.
The Tenth Circuit recently summarized the types of evidence sufficient to meet an employee's burden under the third element of a prima facie ADA claim. Lincoln, 900 F.3d at 1192. "A plaintiff may establish an inference of discrimination through (1) actions or remarks made by decisionmakers that could be viewed as reflecting a discriminatory animus, (2) preferential treatment given to employees outside the protected class, (3) a pattern of recommending the plaintiff for positions for which she is not qualified [or over-qualified], and (4) a failure to surface plaintiff's name for positions for which she is well-qualified." Id. at 1193.
Plaintiff has produced no [*12]  such evidence. Plaintiff argues that she was meeting productivity in her current position (Resp. at 15); however, this argument is irrelevant to whether her lack of transfer to another position was due to a discriminatory reason. Plaintiff alleges that the County did not follow its own policies and treated other similarly situated employees differently (id. at 13); yet she provides no facts or evidence to support those statements. Plaintiff also argues that other internal employees were allowed to use prior test scores for purposes of transfer (id. at 4, ¶¶ 8 and 10); however, Plaintiff has failed to present evidence that she herself ever tested on the specific computer skills required while employed with the County, and thus, regardless of whether other employees were allowed to use past test scores (which is allowed under the County's policy — see Mot., Ex. B, Human Resources Invite/Testing Email), Plaintiff cannot prove she was similarly situated to those employees. Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate what tests were already on file for those employees and when such tests occurred.
Plaintiff has failed to satisfy her burden to satisfy the third element of her ADA claim. [*13]  And because Plaintiff has failed to satisfy two of the elements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.
