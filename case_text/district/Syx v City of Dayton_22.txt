DECISION AND ENTRY SUSTAINING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF DEFENDANT THE CITY OF DAYTON (DOC. #16); JUDGMENT TO ENTER IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT AND AGAINST PLAINTIFF; TERMINATION ENTRY
Plaintiff, Brian Syx, filed suit against his former employer, the City of Dayton, alleging disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Ohio Revised Code §§ 4112.02 and 4112.99.1 This matter is currently before the Court on Defendant City of Dayton's Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. #16. For the reasons set forth below, the Court sustains that motion.

I. Background and Procedural History
Brian Syx was employed by the City of Dayton from August 8, 2005, until his termination on October 7, 2015. Throughout his employment, he was a Dayton Public Service Union member, subject to the Union's Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA"). Most recently, Syx was employed as a Maintenance Mechanic I at the City's Division of Water Supply and Treatment. He was responsible [*2]  for maintaining the department's building and equipment. His job duties included working on water pumps, repairing vehicles and golf carts, welding, plumbing and basin cleaning.
On January 8, 2013, while fixing a water pump, Syx injured his knee. He reported the injury but continued working. On February 7, 2013, he was diagnosed with a torn meniscus. From that date through April 24, 2013, he worked on restricted duty and used intermittent paid injury leave. During this time, while on restricted duty, he continued to perform most of his regular duties but did not lift things or climb ladders. He reinjured his knee on March 13, 2013, while walking to the pump house. He was completely off work beginning April 24, 2013. He had knee surgery on May 15, 2013, and remained off work until July 8, 2013.
From July 8, 2013, until March 17, 2014, Syx again worked on restricted-duty status. He then worked on unrestricted status until October of 2014, when he provided the City with medical documentation stating that he was incapable of fully performing his job duties and requesting that he again be placed on restricted-duty status. His request was granted and he worked on restricted-duty status until [*3]  December 23, 2014. On that date, the City notified Syx that he could no longer remain on restricted-duty status because he had done so for almost a full year, exceeding the 30-day restricted-duty limitation under the CBA.
Syx did not work again after that date. He used his accrued paid sick leave, then the 90-day sick leave without pay afforded to him under the CBA, then his accrued vacation leave. On April 21, 2015, the City notified him that he would face disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, if he did not return to work by May 7, 2015. The City then permitted him to use accrued vacation leave to extend his leave until June 1, 2015.
However, on May 26, 2015, Syx submitted a Disability Accommodation Request Form with the requisite ADA medical certification, indicating that he was scheduled for a total knee replacement on June 16, 2015, and would need an additional 90-day leave without pay. The City granted his request, extending his leave through August 26, 2015.
Syx subsequently requested additional medical leave through October 1, 2015, followed by restricted duty through the end of that month. The City denied his request on the grounds that he had exhausted all leave [*4]  that was available to him under the CBA.2 At that point, even though Syx had been off work for nine months, he still was not cleared by his doctor to return to work as a Maintenance Mechanic I.
The City also commenced administrative disciplinary proceedings against him. A pre-disciplinary hearing was held on September 28, 2015. The administrative committee found that Syx: (1) was unable to perform his job duties; (2) disobeyed a direct order by failing to report to work with a full-duty medical certification release; and (3) failed to return to work from leave. He was terminated from his job effective October 7, 2015. Although he filed a grievance, it was denied and the union did not arbitrate the denial.3
On January 12, 2018, Syx filed suit against the City of Dayton, alleging disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and Ohio Revised Code §§ 4112.02 and 4112.99. Syx alleges that he was a disabled employee who was "treated differently than comparable non-disabled employees who were unable to return to full time duties." Doc. #1, PageID#2. He further alleges that, despite his requests, "[e]ventually Defendant stopped providing Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations" and told him that, unless he could return to [*5]  full-duty status with no restrictions, it would need to terminate his employment. Id. at PageID#3. This matter is currently before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. #16.

II. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment must be entered "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The moving party always bears the initial responsibility of informing the court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the record that it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 323; see also Boretti v. Wiscomb, 930 F.2d 1150, 1156 (6th Cir. 1991).
"Once the moving party has met its initial burden, the nonmoving party must present evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact making it necessary to resolve the difference at trial." Talley v. Bravo Pitino Rest., Ltd., 61 F.3d 1241, 1245 (6th Cir. 1995); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). Once the burden of production has so shifted, the party opposing summary judgment cannot rest on its pleadings or merely reassert its previous allegations. It is not sufficient to simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). Rule 56 "requires the nonmoving party to go [*6]  beyond the [unverified] pleadings" and present some type of evidentiary material in support of its position. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. "The plaintiff must present more than a scintilla of evidence in support of his position; the evidence must be such that a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Michigan Prot. & Advocacy Serv., Inc. v. Babin, 18 F.3d 337, 341 (6th Cir. 1994).
Summary judgment shall be granted if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "Summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is 'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, a court must assume as true the evidence of the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party. Id. at 255. If the parties present conflicting evidence, a court may not decide which evidence to believe. Credibility determinations must be left to the fact-finder. 10A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil 3d § 2726 (1998).
In determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, a court need only consider the materials cited by the parties. [*7]  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). "A district court is not . . . obligated to wade through and search the entire record for some specific facts that might support the nonmoving party's claim." InterRoyal Corp. v. Sponseller, 889 F.2d 108, 111 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1091 (1990). If it so chooses, however, the court may also consider other materials in the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).

III. Discussion

A. Relevant Law
Plaintiff has asserted disability discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Ohio Revised Code §§ 4112.02 and 4112.99. The ADA bars "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).4
Similarly, Ohio Revised Code § 4112.02(A) prohibits employers from discriminating against an individual because of that individual's disability. Whoever violates Chapter 4112 "is subject to a civil action for damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief." Ohio Revised Code § 4112.99. Ohio Chapter 4112 claims are interpreted in accordance with the ADA. Columbus Civ. Serv. Comm'n v. McGlone, 82 Ohio St. 3d 569, 573, 697 N.E.2d 204, 206-07 (Ohio 1998).

B. Analysis
Although Syx's Complaint is not a model of clarity, he appears to assert claims under two theories of disability discrimination: (1) failure-to-accommodate; and (2) disparate treatment. The Court turns first to the failure-to-accommodate [*8]  claim.

1. Failure to Accommodate
The Complaint alleges that the City of Dayton refused Syx's requests for a reasonable accommodation and terminated his employment based on his disability. As explained below, however, the parties have differing views on the nature of the requested accommodation that is the basis for Syx's claim.
Reasonable accommodations are "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o)(1)(ii). This may include "[j]ob restructuring" or "reassignment to a vacant position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). To determine an appropriate accommodation, it may be necessary for the employer to engage in "an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3).
An employer's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to an otherwise qualified employee with a disability meets the ADA's definition of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Williams v. AT&T Mobility Servs. LLC, 847 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir. 2017).
In order to establish a prima facie case of a failure to accommodate claim [*9]  under the ADA, "a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) her employer knew or had reason to know about her disability; (4) she requested an accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide the necessary accommodation." Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Dist., 443 Fed. Appx. 974, 982-83 (6th Cir. 2011) (citing DiCarlo v. Potter, 358 F.3d 408, 419 (6th Cir. 2004)). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the employer then bears the burden to demonstrate that any particular accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Id. at 983 (citing DiCarlo, 358 F.3d at 419).
Judge v. Landscape Forms, Inc., 592 F. App'x 403, 407 (6th Cir. 2014). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the requested accommodation is objectively reasonable. Arthur v. Am. Showa, Inc., 625 F. App'x 704, 709 (6th Cir. 2015).
It appears to be undisputed that Brian Syx is "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA and that the City of Dayton knew of his disability. It is also undisputed that, in September of 2015, after Syx requested additional leave followed by another period of restricted duty, the City denied his request.
The City of Dayton argues that summary judgment is warranted on the federal and state disability discrimination claims for three reasons. First, the City argues that Syx was not "otherwise qualified" for the position of Maintenance Mechanic I, given [*10]  that he was not cleared by a physician to return to work. Second, the City argues that Syx did not propose any accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the essential functions of that job. It maintains that his request for extended leave was not reasonable because granting the request would require the City to violate its rules, policies and procedures, as well as the CBA. Third, the City argues that Syx's proposed accommodation of extended leave would have imposed an undue burden on the City. See Walsh v. United Parcel Serv., 201 F.3d 718, 727 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that when "an employer has already provided a substantial leave, an additional leave period of a significant duration, with no clear prospects for recovery, is an objectively unreasonable accommodation.").
In his memorandum in opposition, Syx impliedly concedes each of these points. He does not dispute that, because of his knee injury, he can no longer perform the essential functions of his job as a Maintenance Mechanic 1 with or without reasonable accommodation, or that he is not "otherwise qualified" for that position. He also does not dispute the fact that, at the time of his termination, he had exhausted all of the leave to which he was entitled and had not yet been [*11]  medically released to return to work. In addition, he fails to respond to the City's argument that his August 2015, request for additional medical leave, followed by an additional period of restricted duty through October of 2015, was not objectively reasonable and that this would have imposed an undue burden on the City. Accordingly, to the extent that Syx argues that the City discriminated against him by failing to provide an accommodation in the form of additional leave, followed by another period of restricted duty, the City is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
Syx, however, points to a different requested accommodation as the basis for his claim. At his deposition (Doc. #15-1, PageID#54), in an affidavit (Doc. #20, PageID##840-41), and in his responses to interrogatories (Doc. #15-12, PageID##372-73), Syx stated that, following his knee injury, he asked his supervisors Laurie Brown and Lonnie Waitman if he could be placed in the guard shack. Citing Kevin Bogan and Michael Pemberton as specific examples, Syx stated that employees with injuries were often assigned to the guard shack. Doc. #20, PageID#841. Nevertheless, Brown and Waitman allegedly refused to consider his [*12]  request. Id.
Syx argues that, although he could no longer perform the essential functions of his position as a Maintenance Mechanic I, he would have been able to perform the essential functions of a guard in the guard shack, a job that essentially entailed sitting in a chair and checking employees' badges. He further argues that reassignment to the guard shack, as an accommodation, would have allowed him to remain employed by the City. Syx contends that, with respect to this request, the City failed to engage in the requisite interactive process, choosing to terminate his employment instead.
In its reply brief, the City denies that Syx ever proposed any accommodation involving assignment to the guard shack. Doc. #21, PageID#843. The City, however, offers no evidence in the form of deposition testimony or affidavits from Brown, Waitman or anyone else to rebut Syx's sworn testimony. The Court must therefore assume that Syx did, in fact, request reassignment to the guard shack and that Brown and Waitman denied the requested accommodation.
Unfortunately, it is not clear from the record exactly when Syx requested reassignment to the guard shack. In his responses to interrogatories, Syx simply [*13]  states that "Plaintiff was initially placed on light-duty restriction. Then Plaintiff requested that he be placed in the guard shack." Doc. #15-12, PageID#372. His affidavit states "[a]fter Laurie Brown stated that I would be unable to perform my Maintenance Mechanic I work duties, I requested a reasonable accommodation to work in the guard shack." Doc. #20, PageID#840. Moreover, it is not clear from the record whether Syx requested assignment to the guard shack as a temporary accommodation or as a permanent reassignment. Under either scenario, however, he has failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.
Assuming arguendo that Syx requested a temporary assignment to the guard shack until such time as he could return to his regular job with no restrictions, he has failed to show that the City failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Syx was on restricted-duty status from February of 2013 until April of 2013, and again from July of 2013 until March of 2014. Syx testified that, during this time, he kept performing his regular job duties as a Maintenance Mechanic I. "[T]hey knew I was on restricted duty and they told me to do what I can to keep things going, no [*14]  matter what it took." Doc. #15-1, PageID#48.
Syx admitted, however, that, while on restricted duty, he did not climb ladders or do any heavy lifting. Id. at PageID#45. This is largely consistent with the temporary restrictions that were imposed by Syx's physician, Matthew Lawless, M.D., on December 4, 2013. Doc. #15-4, PageID##338-39 ("no ladder climbing" and no lifting 51-100 pounds).5 In other words, the City accommodated his disability by requiring him to perform only those portions of his job that he was able to do without violating the restrictions imposed by his doctor.
Assuming arguendo that Syx requested a different accommodation in the form of a temporary assignment to the guard shack, the City was not necessarily required to grant his request. As the court noted in Jakubowski v. Christ Hospital, Inc., 627 F.3d 195 (6th Cir. 2010), if an employer offers a "reasonable counter accommodation, the employee cannot demand a different accommodation." Id. at 203. See also Hankins v. The Gap, Inc., 84 F.3d 797, 800-01 (6th Cir. 1996) ("an employee cannot make his employer provide a specific accommodation if another reasonable accommodation is instead provided."). ADA regulations provide that "the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations, and may choose [*15]  the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide." 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. at 422 (2018). Syx has failed to present evidence to support a finding that, in refusing to temporarily assign him to the guard shack, the City failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability.
In his response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Syx argues that he "provided a reasonable request to remain employed by Defendant," and that "[t]here was a path to remain employed by the City of Dayton." Doc. #20, PageID##837-38. This sounds like Syx was seeking a permanent reassignment to the guard shack as an alternative to termination. In Burns v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., 222 F.3d 247, 257 (6th Cir. 2000), the Sixth Circuit held that "an employer has a duty under the ADA to consider transferring a disabled employee who can no longer perform his old job even with accommodation to a new position within the Company for which that employee is otherwise qualified." The City does not dispute that Syx was "otherwise qualified" for a position in the guard shack.
Nevertheless, to the extent that Syx requested permanent reassignment to the guard shack, he has failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that this was an objectively [*16]  reasonable request. Under the ADA, a "reasonable accommodation" may include "reassignment to a vacant position." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(8). However, if the position requested is not vacant, reassignment is not required. Employers are not required to create new jobs to accommodate a disabled individual. Burns, 222 F.3d at 257 (citing 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(o)). See also Smith v. Ameritech, 129 F.3d 857, 867 (6th Cir. 1997) ("the ADA does not require an employer to reassign an employee to a position that is not vacant."). A position is deemed to be "vacant" only if a "similarly-situated non-disabled employee" could apply for it. Sanchez v. United States Dep't of Energy, 870 F.3d 1185, 1200 (10th Cir. 2017). The Sixth Circuit has held that an employee's request for reassignment to a position that is not vacant is "objectively unreasonable." Arthur, 625 F. App'x at 710.
Syx has presented no evidence that, at the time he requested reassignment to the guard shack, there was a vacant guard shack position available. Summary judgment is therefore warranted. See Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 869 (6th Cir. 2007) (absent any evidence that the employer was seeking applications for the requested position during the relevant time period, "we cannot conclude that a reasonable jury could find that a vacancy existed.").
The Court notes that it appears from the record that the guard shack position at issue is a temporary, light-duty position filled by employees who, because of [*17]  a work-related injury, are unable to perform their regular jobs for a short period of time. For example, Syx states in his affidavit that he has "witnessed other injured employees, including, but not limited to Mike Pemberton and Kevin Bogan working in the guard shack while they recovered from injuries." Doc. #20, PageID#841.
In a similar case, the Sixth Circuit held that an employee's proposed accommodation—that a temporary light-duty position, reserved for employees recuperating from work injuries, be converted into a permanent position for her—was not a reasonable accommodation request. Kempter v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 534 F. App'x 487, 491-92 (6th Cir. 2013). The Seventh Circuit has recognized that, if employers were required to convert these types of temporary jobs into permanent jobs for employees who become permanently disabled, the effect would be to abolish the temporary disability program, closing such positions to other employees who may require them in the future. Dalton v. Subaru-Isuzu Auto., Inc., 141 F.3d 667, 680 (7th Cir. 1998). See also Watson v. Lithonia Lighting, 304 F.3d 749, 752 (7th Cir. 2002) ("[T]he ADA does not require an employer that sets aside a pool of positions for recovering employees to make those positions available indefinitely to an employee whose recovery has run its course without restoring that worker to her original healthy state.").
Likewise, [*18]  in Hoskins v. Oakland County Sheriff's Department, 227 F.3d 719 (6th Cir. 2000), the court held that an injured deputy's requested permanent reassignment to a position in the control booth at the jail was not objectively reasonable. This was a sedentary, rotating position involving no inmate contact, used to give all deputies a break from their normal assignments. The court held that the plaintiff's request to turn this rotating job into a permanent position was not objectively reasonable, in part because it "would essentially require the creation of a new position rather than reassignment to an otherwise existing vacant one." Id. at 730.
Having reviewed the parties' arguments and the relevant law, the Court concludes that Syx's failure-to-accommodate claim does not survive summary judgment, because he has failed to present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that his requested accommodation of permanent reassignment to the guard shack was objectively reasonable.
Moreover, because he failed to propose a reasonable accommodation, it is irrelevant that the City allegedly failed to engage in the interactive process concerning this request. See Rorrer v. City of Stow, 743 F.3d 1025, 1041 (6th Cir. 2014) ("Although mandatory, failure to engage in the interactive process is only an independent violation of the [*19]  ADA if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie showing that he proposed a reasonable accommodation."); Arthur, 625 F. App'x at 711 (holding that when the plaintiff fails to show that the requested accommodation is objectively reasonable, "the employer's duty to engage in the interactive process is never triggered.").
Finding no genuine issues of material fact, the Court SUSTAINS the City's Motion for Summary Judgment on Syx's failure-to-accommodate claim.

2. Disparate Treatment
Syx also alleges in his Complaint that he "was treated differently than comparable non-disabled employees who were unable to return to full time duties" and that "other non-disabled employees with work restrictions were being assigned to light duty work." Doc. #1, PageID##2-3. More specifically, he alleges that Mike Pemberton and Kevin Bogan were permitted to work in the guard shack when they were injured, but the City did not afford him the same opportunity. It terminated him instead.
Absent direct evidence of discrimination, a disparate treatment claim is subject to the burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Whitfield v. Tenn., 639 F.3d 253, 259 (6th Cir. 2011). The plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by showing that: "(1) he is disabled; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the [*20]  position; (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision; (4) the employer knew or had reason to know of his disability; and (5) . . . similarly situated non-protected employees were treated more favorably." Hopkins v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 196 F.3d 655, 660 (6th Cir. 1999). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision." Id. If the employer does so, "the burden shifts back to the employee to establish that the employer's explanation is a mere pretext for unlawful discrimination." Id.
The City focuses on the fifth element of the prima facie case. Although a plaintiff need not show an "exact correlation" between himself and others, he must show that he is similarly-situated in "all relevant respects." Miles v. S. Cent. Human Resource Agency, Inc., 946 F.3d 883, 893 (6th Cir. 2020). This typically means that "the individuals with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare his/her treatment must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it." Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., 964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 1992).
The City argues that summary judgment is warranted because Kevin Bogan [*21]  and Mike Pemberton were not similarly-situated to Brian Syx. Pemberton, another Maintenance Mechanic I, broke his foot at work, but neither requested nor received an ADA accommodation. Rather, he exercised his rights under the CBA and was permitted to work a restricted duty assignments6 for approximately four months until he fully recovered and then returned to his regular job. Doc. #16-1, PageID##404-05. In contrast, Syx had already been permitted to work on restricted duty for nearly one year, had exhausted all available leave, and was never medically cleared to return to his regular position as Maintenance Mechanic I. Accordingly, Syx and Pemberton were not similarly situated.
Kevin Bogan was employed as a Laborer. He suffered a work-related injury and was permitted to work a restricted duty assignment for approximately five months before returning to full duty.7 Although Bogan requested a job transfer as an ADA accommodation for his injury, the City denied his request as unreasonable. Id. at PageID#405. Bogan is not similarly situated to Syx. Not only medical restrictions. Moreover, to the extent that the City denied Bogan's requested job transfer, Bogan was treated no more favorably [*22]  than Syx.
Based on the evidence presented, no reasonable jury could find that the City treated any similarly-situated non-disabled employee more favorably than Syx. Given that Syx has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on disparate treatment, the Court SUSTAINS the City's Motion for Summary Judgment on this claim also.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the Court SUSTAINS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. #16, and dismisses all claims with prejudice.
Judgment shall be entered in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff.
The captioned case is hereby ordered terminated upon the docket records of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, at Dayton.
