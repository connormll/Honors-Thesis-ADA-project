Opinion



Report & Recommendation
The Plaintiff, through counsel, filed this employment action on March 9, 2015. (Dkt. No. 1.) Now before the court is the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 90.) Pursuant to the provisions of Title 28, United States Code, Section 636(b)(1)(A), and Local Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge. For the reasons stated herein, the undersigned recommends that the Defendants' [*2]  Motion for Summary (Dkt. No. 90) be granted.

Procedural History
The Plaintiff filed her Complaint on March 9, 2015, and filed her Amended Complaint on October 21, 2015. (Dkt. Nos. 1 & 26.) On October 27, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice of the Plaintiff's claims in the First and Third Causes of Action as set forth and alleged in the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 86.) Following the stipulation of dismissal, only the Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action remains, which is brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C.A. § 12101 et seq. (Dkt. No. 26.)
Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment was filed on November 30, 2016. (Dkt. No. 90.) Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment was filed on December 16, 2016. (Dkt. No. 91.) The Defendants replied on December 22, 2016. (Dkt. No. 92.)

Factual Background
The Plaintiff is a licensed pharmacist and began working at CVS as a pharmacist in 1999. (Wigger Depo. pp. 18-21.) The Plaintiff was a staff pharmacist for CVS at Store Number 4395 located at 10599 Dorchester Road in Summerville, South Carolina. (Id. pp. 26-29.) The Plaintiff became the "Pharmacist-in-Charge" ("PIC") at Store Number 4395 [*3]  in May of 2010. (Id. p. 30.) In May of 2011, the Plaintiff conducted a mid-year review in which she self-assessed that she needed improvement in several areas. (Dkt. No. 90-2 at 53-55.) The Plaintiff's supervisor at the time, Jeffrey Holcombe, went over the evaluation with the Plaintiff and rated the Plaintiff as "needs improvement" in several areas as well. (Wigger Depo. pp. 130-133.)
In June of 2012, Darlene Molett replaced Holcombe as the Plaintiff's supervisor. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 3.) After Molett took over as supervisor, the Plaintiff was found to need improvement in several areas. The Plaintiff signed a document along with Molett which stated the Plaintiff needed to improve leading and developing her team, influencing patient care/medication management, and several scores on metrics kept by CVS to evaluate pharmacists. (Wigger Depo. pp. 136-142; Dkt. No. 90-2 at 56.) Molett visited Store Number 4395 regularly. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 6-8.) Molett noted that the Plaintiff regularly failed to make sure that the work station assignment board1 ("WSAB") was filled out, which resulted in a "very disorganized pharmacy." (Id.)
The parties agree that the Plaintiff was "written up" at least once a month for [*4]  deficient performance in September, October, and November of 2012. (Dkt. No. 91 at 8; Dkt. No. 90 at 6-7.) The Plaintiff did not meet several of the metrics required by CVS for these months and her store regularly ranked at or near the bottom of the stores in the region. (Dkt. No. 90-2 at 57-62.)
On December 27, 2012, the Plaintiff saw Dr. Ricardo Fermo, a psychiatrist, for the first time. (Wigger Depo. p. 166.) After meeting with the Plaintiff, Dr. Fermo diagnosed the Plaintiff with depression and placed the Plaintiff on leave from work due to the severity of her depression.2 (Dkt. No. 90-7 at 7-8.) The Defendants maintain that Molett and Kevin Elliott, Molett's supervisor, were never informed why the Plaintiff went on leave except that the Plaintiff had a "serious health condition." (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 16-18.)
On March 7, 2013, Dr. Fermo released the Plaintiff to return to work with "no restrictions." (Dkt. No. 90-7 at 9-10; Wigger Depo. p. 35.) The Plaintiff was offered her prior position at Store Number 4395 and the position of staff pharmacist at Store Number 563 with the same pay.3 (Wigger Depo. pp. 32-33.) The Plaintiff asked to have time to think about her decision. (Id. p. 34.) The following [*5]  day Molett called the Plaintiff and told her she was being assigned to Store Number 563. (Id.)
The Plaintiff testified that on her first day at Store Number 563, Millie Fippen, the PIC, looked as her and said "welcome to hell." (Wigger Depo. p. 193.) Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff began complaining to Molett and Elliott that she was unhappy working at Store Number 563 because of her relationship with Fippen and because of the stressful environment. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 20; 90-6 at 7.) The Plaintiff met with Molett and Elliott regarding Fippen. (Id. p. 67-68.) The Plaintiff testified that she told Molett and Elliot that she had to take the three month leave of absence because of severe anxiety and depression. (Id.) The Plaintiff requested she be assigned to the CVS in St. George. (Id.) Elliott instructed the Plaintiff to put the request in writing and to include four other CVS locations where she would be willing to work. (Id.) The note stated:
3-21-13
After returning from leave due to extreme stress disorder I wanted to be in an environment less stressful. Thus, I did not return to my old store. Starting at 563 the situation did not appear any better. As I wasn't aware there was an opening at St. George I did not [*6]  request it but at this time would really appreciate being put there permanently.
Thank you

(Dkt. Nos. 90-6 at 46 of 46; 93-2 at 2.)4
The Defendants maintain that none of the stores the Plaintiff requested had openings. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 23 of 36.) Elliott testified that the stress at the St. George store would be the same as Store Number 563 and that he "believed" that they had already hired a student to begin working in St. George when she graduated. (Dkt. No. 91-3 at 5-7 of 46.) Molett testified that the St. George store already had a new graduate who lived in the area "slated" to for the open position and still worked at that store at the time of the deposition. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 23-24 of 36.) Neither Molett nor Elliott ever responded to the Plaintiff's note, and the Plaintiff contacted George Cunningham in Human Resources for additional help. (Wigger Depo. p. 113-14.) The Plaintiff argues that there were openings at several stores around the time she was requesting a transfer and that the St. George store vacancy was not filled until July 26, 2013. (Dkt. No. 91- 15.)
CVS's 30(b)(6) designee testified that CVS had a policy in effect in 2013 addressing [*7]  requests for accommodation, and that the policy would apply to employees requesting transfer due to anxiety. (Dkt. No. 91-4.) The policy stated:
The Reasonable Accommodation Process

Although we all want to do the best we can at our jobs, there may be times when a physical or mental impairment prevents us from performing our duties fully.
If you feel you cannot perform all the essential functions of your job, CVS Caremark will work with you to try to provide a reasonable accommodation so that you may continue to perform the essential functions of your position.
...
If you feel that you need a reasonable accommodation, speak to your supervisor immediately — even if you are not sure you will need to make changes in your duties. He or she will complete a reasonable accommodation form in order to assess your situation and help you obtain any documentation that may be required.
(Dkt. Nos. 90-4; 93-3 at 3.) There is no evidence that the Defendants followed their policy by completing a reasonable accommodation form.
Following her request to move stores, the Defendants received complaints about the Plaintiff from customers. In April of 2013, the Defendants received a complaint from a woman named Jasmine [*8]  who stated the Plaintiff was condescending and rude to her. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 32 of 36.) The same month the Defendants received another complaint that the Plaintiff was rude and dismissive of a customer. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 33 of 36.) On May 3, 2013, the Defendants received a 2-page, handwritten letter from customer. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 35-36 of 36.) The letter stated that the customer stopped going to Store Number 4395 because of the Plaintiff. The customer began going to Store Number 563. The customer complained that the Plaintiff was now at the new store. The customer described the Plaintiff as "very very rude rude" and having a bad attitude. (Id. (emphasis in original)).
Molett received complaints about the Plaintiff from Ms. Fippen as well. Between March 21, 2013 and June 12, 2013, Fippen sent three (3) emails to Molett complaining about the Plaintiff. (Dkt. Nos. 91-11; 93-4.) In the emails, Fippen asked Molett to transfer the Plaintiff to another store. Fippen stated that that the Plaintiff was "unfit for service." Fippen stated that the Plaintiff created discord among the techs.5 Molett received complaints from the head technician at Store 563 about the Plaintiff as well. (Dkt. No. [*9]  91-5 at 37-38.)
On May 13, 2013, Molett and Elliott met with the Plaintiff and placed her on an "Individual Development Plan" ("IDP"). (Wigger Depo. pp. 183-185.) The Plaintiff's initial reaction to the plan was that she would be getting help, which would "be great." (Id.) The IDP included seven (7) areas in which the Plaintiff would be checked on for improvement. (Dkt. No. 90-2 at 63-84 of 84.)
The Plaintiff and Molett met once a month to review the Plaintiff's progress on her IDP goals. (Wigger Depo. pp. 194-95, 202.) The Plaintiff did not meet her IDP goals between May and August. In her deposition, the Plaintiff agreed with the statements on the IDP indicating that the goals were not being met. (Wigger Depo. pp. 208-214.) Additionally, the Plaintiff agreed that the issues addressed by her IDP were similar to the issues that were addressed with her previously when she was the PIC at Store Number 4395. (Wigger Depo. p. 214.) The Plaintiff was terminated on August 26, 2013.

Standard of Review
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment "shall" be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). [*10]  "Facts are 'material' when they might affect the outcome of the case, and a 'genuine issue' exists when the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party." The News & Observer Publ'g Co. v. Raleigh-Durham Airport Auth., 597 F.3d 570, 576 (4th Cir. 2010)(citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, "'the nonmoving party's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party's favor.'" Id. (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999)); see also Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr., Inc., 915 F.2d 121, 123-24 (4th Cir. 1990).

Analysis
The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).

1. Unlawful Termination in Violation of the ADA
The McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), burden-shifting framework applies to claims under the ADA. Ennis v. National Ass'n of Business and Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir.1995). Under McDonnell Douglas,
[T]he plaintiff has the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. If the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action. If the defendant meets this burden of production, the presumption created by the prima facie case "drops out of the picture," and the plaintiff [*11]  bears the ultimate burden of proving that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination.
Ennis, 53 F.3d at 58 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).
To survive summary judgment on an ADA employment claim and establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff is required to produce evidence sufficient to demonstrate the following elements:
(1) she was a qualified individual with a disability;
(2) she was discharged;
(3) she was fulfilling her employer's legitimate expectations at the time of discharge; and
(4) the circumstances of her discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.
Reynolds v. Am. Nat. Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Rohan v. Networks Presentations LLC, 375 F.3d 266, 273 n. 9 (4th Cir.2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Evidence of all four of these elements is necessary to survive summary judgment." Id.
The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's ADA claim fails for three reasons. (Dkt. No. 90.) First, the Defendants argues that the Plaintiff has not set forth a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she was not in a protected class, she was not performing her job at a level that met CVS's legitimate performance expectations, and her termination did not occur under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. (Dkt. No. 90.) Second, the Defendants argue that CVS has established [*12]  a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the Plaintiff's discharge. (Id.) Third, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiff cannot show that the reason proffered by CVS is pretextual. (Id.)

a. Prima Facie Case under the ADA
The parties agree that the Plaintiff was terminated on August 26, 2013 fulfilling the second element of a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. The parties disagree as to whether the Plaintiff has established the first, third, and fourth elements of a prima facie case.

i. Qualified Individual with a Disability
A plaintiff is required "to produce evidence that she is ... disabled." Rohan, 375 F.3d at 272. The ADA defines disability as any one of the following: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more ... major life activities ...; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2); see also Rohan, 375 F.3d at 273.
The Plaintiff asserts that she had a mental impairment as a result of her anxiety, depression, and stress. (Dkt. No. 91 at 14.) Depression and anxiety are impairments recognized by the ADA. See, e.g., Baird ex rel. Baird v. Rose, 192 F.3d 462, 467 n. 3 (4th Cir.1999); Rohan v. Networks Presentation LLC, 175 F. Supp. 2d 806, 812 (D.Md.2001); Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 136 F.3d 1047, 1050 (5th Cir.1998); Battle v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 438 F.3d 856, 861-62 (8th Cir.2006). Not every impairment, however, constitutes a disability. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "[A] medical diagnosis of depression is not the 'sin[e] qua [*13]  non' of having an ADA disability." Dean v. Westchester Cty. P.R.C., 309 F. Supp. 2d 587, 594 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (citation omitted). Alleging the existence of an impairment "without showings of substantial limitation to major life activities would not qualify Plaintiff as disabled." Lipscomb v. Techs., Servs. & Info., Inc., No. DKC 09-3344, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16692, 2011 WL 691605, at *12 (D.Md. Feb.18, 2011); see also Dunbar v. Byars, No. 2:11-cv-2243-JFA-BHH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26254, 2013 WL 667930, *3 (D.S.C. January 30, 2013).
Although the ADA does not define "major life activities," the Fourth Circuit interprets them to be "activities that are of central importance to daily life" and "that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty." Rohan, 375 F.3d at 274. The regulations provide a non-exhaustive list of major life activities, including "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i). "Substantially limits" is to be "construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA" and "is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i).
To "be substantially limited in the major life activity of working...one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job [*14]  of choice...[and] if jobs utilizing an individual's skills...are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs." Taylor v. Federal Express Corp., 429 F.3d 461, 464 (4th Cir. 2005); see also Hill v. Southeastern Freight Lines, Inc., 877 F.Supp.2d 375, 389 (M.D.N.C. 2012) ("[I]n order to show that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of working, Plaintiff must show that he was precluded from a substantial class of jobs or a broad range or jobs on account of his eye condition."); Allen v. SouthCrest Hosp., 455 Fed App'x 827, 835 (10th Cir.2011) (finding that the plaintiff, "even after the enactment of the [ADA Amendments Act of 2008] and the modified EEOC regulations" must show that she was "substantially limited in performing a class of jobs or broad range of jobs" in order to establish that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working).
The Plaintiff argues that her substantially limited major life activities included sleeping, eating, concentration, and working. (Dkt. No. 91 at 14.) To support the substantial limitations of these major life activities, the Plaintiff cites Dr. Fermo's deposition from pages 11 through 14 and 16 and 17. (Id.) Portions of these sections of Dr. Fermo's testimony relate to April of 2016, almost three years after the Plaintiff was terminated from CVS. However, other portions appear to address the broader course of Dr. Fermo's treatment. [*15]  Dr. Fermo described the Plaintiff as being in "a continuous depressive episode for three years." (Dkt. No. 91-10 at 3 of 6.) Dr. Fermo testified that the Plaintiff "had been on multiple medications [and] had treatment resistance." (Id.) Dr. Fermo stated that the Plaintiff was "doing augmentation strategies, and she wasn't responding." Dr. Fermo testified that the Plaintiff had "stressors" with a "main theme" of "her job and losing her job and the stress of her position." (Id. at 4 of 6.) The stressors of her job and the stress of her position would intuitively only apply to the time she was working for CVS. Dr. Fermo added that the Plaintiff "struggled with one predominant thing...leaden paralysis where you have psychomotor retardation,...she could barely get out of bed." (Id.) Dr. Fermo testified that her depression caused her to not talk to anyone and be withdrawn. (Id. at 5 of 6.)
The Plaintiff testified concerning how her mental disability affected her life while working at Store Number 563. (Wigger Depo. pp. 222-225.) The Plaintiff stated that she could not recall anything in her life that she was not doing because of her mental conditions other than interacting with people and gardening. (Id. [*16] ) The Plaintiff testified that she could "do the job [of being a pharmacist]" but needed an environment without "hostility every day and... harassment." (Id.) The Plaintiff testified that her stress came from Fippen. (Id.)
The Plaintiff's testimony does not establish this element. In Howell v. Holland, the district judge agreed with Magistrate Judge Bristow Marchant's conclusion that "not being able to work with a particular individual or supervisor does not substantially limit the major life activity of working." Howell v. Holland, No. 4:13-cv-00295-RBH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21124, 2015 WL 751590, at *16 (D.S.C. Feb. 23, 2015) (citing Schneiker v. Fortis Insurance Company, 200 F.3d 1055, 1062 (7th Cir.2000) (personality conflict with supervisor does not establish disability even where supervisor caused employee's depression); Weiler v. Household Finance Corp., 101 F.3d 519, 525 (7th Cir.1996) (employee was not disabled under the ADA where she could not work only with a certain supervisor because "if she can do the same job for another supervisor, she can do the job, and does not qualify under the ADA"); Hatfield v. Quantum Chemical Corp., 920 F.Supp. 108, 110 (S.D.Tx.1996) (not being able to work with supervisor did not substantially limit major life activity); Flynt v. Biogen Idec, Inc., No. 3:11-cv-22-HTW-LRA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141494, 2012 WL 4588570, *4-5 (S.D.Miss. Sept.30, 2012) (the inability to work with a specific person does not establish a disability nor does an employer have a duty under the ADA to accommodate such a restriction));  [*17] Metro v. Lewis Gale Clinic, No. 7:01-cv-00936, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29461, 2002 WL 32833260, at *4 (W.D. Va. Apr. 26, 2002), aff'd, 48 F. App'x 456 (4th Cir. 2002) ("the major life activity of working is not 'substantially limited' if a plaintiff cannot work under a certain supervisor because of anxiety and stress.").
However, this case is somewhat distinguishable from Howell. Mr. Howell's only substantially limited major life activity was working. The Plaintiff in the case at bar also argues she was limited in her concentration, eating, and sleeping. Dr. Fermo stated that she had notable leaden paralysis. The emails from Fippen to Molett assessed that some days the Plaintiff seemed "fairly coherent" and on other days she was "in a totally different world" and that the Plaintiff was unable to help with the "simplest tasks." (Dkt. Nos. 91-11; 93-4.)
"In order to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice." Pollard v. High's of Baltimore, Inc., 281 F.3d 462, 471 (4th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations and citation omitted). "An individual must demonstrate that she is unable to work in a broad range of jobs." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i)); Metro v. Lewis Gale Clinic, No. 7:01-cv-00936, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29461, 2002 WL 32833260, at *4 (W.D. Va. Apr. 26, 2002), aff'd, 48 F. App'x 456 (4th Cir. 2002) (plaintiff was not a qualified individual with a disability where [*18]  she admitted that she was "fully capable" of performing her job). When the Plaintiff returned to work, Dr. Fermo wrote that she had "no restrictions." (Dkt. No. 90-7 at 10 of 10.) During the Plaintiff's deposition, she reviewed the job description of being a staff pharmacist. (Wigger Depo. p. 124.) When asked if there was anything on the job description that she could not do when she returned from leave, the Plaintiff only indicated that there was a form she had never heard of and that she had been told that the store manager would handle scheduling, not her. (Id.) She did not indicate that there was any part of the job description that she could not perform. (Id.) The Plaintiff testified that she could "do the job [of being a pharmacist]" but needed to be in a less stressful location away from Fippen. (Wigger Depo. pp. 222-225.)
The Plaintiff argues that even if she is not disabled, CVS regarded her as disabled and that she was substantially limited in her ability to work. (Dkt. No. 91 at 14-15.) The Plaintiff argues that Molett and Elliott were concerned for her mental stability and asked why she did not apply for disability. (Id.) "One may be 'regarded as'" disabled under the ADA [*19]  if either '(1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that [one] has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.' Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 703 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999)). The Plaintiff's perception that her employer regarded her as disabled is speculative and not relevant. Rahmaan v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 2:08-cv-2909-DCN, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125635, 2010 WL 890057, at *10 (D.S.C. Mar. 8, 2010) (citing Smith v. Flax, 618 F.2d 1062, 1067 (4th Cir.1980)). "[W]hen an employee [contends] that she was regarded as disabled, the analysis focuses on the reactions and perceptions of the ... decisionmakers who worked with the employee." Wilson v. Phoenix Specialty Mfg. Co., 513 F.3d 378, 384-85 (4th Cir.2008). An employer's knowledge of an impairment is insufficient to show that the employer regarded the employee as having a disability. See, e.g., Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 703 (citing Kelly v. Drexel Univ., 94 F.3d 102, 109 (3d Cir.1996)).
While the evidence in the record that the Plaintiff was substantially limited in a major life activity is thin, this court finds that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, there is evidence in the record sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability.6

ii. Fulfillment of Employer's Legitimate Expectations [*20] 
To survive summary judgment on whether she was fulfilling the legitimate expectations of her employer, the Plaintiff must "present...probative evidence that [s]he was, in fact, performing at a level that met [her] employer's legitimate expectations." Hill v. Se. Freight Lines, Inc., 877 F. Supp. 2d 375, 391 (M.D.N.C. 2012), aff'd, 523 F. App'x 213 (4th Cir. 2013). When determining whether an employee is meeting her employer's legitimate expectations, courts do not sit as a "superpersonnel department weighing the prudence of employment decisions." Id. at 385 (quoting Anderson v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 406 F.3d 248, 272 (4th Cir. 2005). "[I]t is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self-assessment of the plaintiff," when determining whether an employee was performing at a level that met the employer's legitimate expectations. Id. at 386.
The Plaintiff's first performance issues arose in 2011, over a year before the Plaintiff went on leave, while she was the PIC at Store Number 4395. Following the Plaintiff's return from leave and after starting a new position as a staff pharmacist, the Plaintiff continued to have performance issues and was placed on an IDP. (Wigger Depo. pp. 183-185.) The Plaintiff was also subject to internal complaints from other employees (Dkt. Nos. 91-11; 93-4) and complaints from the public. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 32-36 of 36.) The lead technician [*21]  at Store Number 563 reached out to Molett concerning the Plaintiff and her interactions with patients and staff as well. (Dkt. No. 91-5 at 37-38 of 61.)
The Plaintiff argues that the disciplinary actions taken were "not legitimate" because she was being held responsible for the store's metrics even when she was not the PIC. (Dkt. No. 91 at 15.) The Plaintiff contends that Elliott and Mollett were not around enough to actually observe her. (Id.) The Plaintiff does not address the complaints from Fippen, the head technician, or from the various members of the public.
The Plaintiff's arguments are not supported by the record. The Plaintiff fails to address her performance issues which arose in 2011 while she was the PIC at Store Number 4395 in which she self-assessed that she needed improvement in several areas (90-2 at 53-55) and her supervisor, Jeffrey Holcombe, rated the Plaintiff as "needs improvement" in several areas. (Wigger Depo. pp. 130-133.) In June of 2012, Darlene Molett replaced Holcombe as the Plaintiff's supervisor. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 3.) After Molett took over as supervisor, the Plaintiff was again found to need improvement in several areas. (Wigger Depo. pp. 136-142; Dkt. [*22]  No. 90-2 at 56.) Molett noted that the Plaintiff regularly failed to make sure that the WSAB was filled out, which resulted in a "very disorganized pharmacy." (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 6-8.) The parties agree that the Plaintiff was "written up" at least once a month for deficient performance in September, October, and November of 2012. (Dkt. No. 91 at 8; Dkt. No. 90 at 6-7.)
On May 13, 2013, Molett and Elliott met with the Plaintiff and placed her on the IDP. (Wigger Depo. pp. 183-185.) The Plaintiff did not meet her IDP goals between May and August. The Plaintiff agreed with the statements on the IDP that the goals were not being met. (Wigger Depo. pp. 208-214.) In her deposition, the Plaintiff agreed that the issues addressed by her IDP were similar to the issues that were addressed with her previously when she was the PIC at Store Number 4395. (Wigger Depo. p. 214.)
Molett testified in her deposition that the IDP included items such as filling out the WSAB and monitoring the "dashboard," which was a queue on the computer that told how much work was coming to different work stations. (Dkt. No. 90-4 at 30 of 36.) These were specific to the Plaintiff, not the store, and were judged on observation. [*23]  (Id. at 31 of 36.) The Plaintiff argues that Molett and Elliott did not observe her enough for the IDP to accurately reflect her performance. However, the relevant inquiry was what the "decisionmaker's perception" was, not the Plaintiff or other employees' perceptions were. Morris v. Sheetz Inc., No. 5:13-cv-00095, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, 2015 WL 1925457, at *11 (W.D. Va. Apr. 28, 2015).
More notably, the Plaintiff had the numerous complaints from Fippen, the lead technician named Charlie, and the public. The Plaintiff does not put forth any argument to refute the complaints. Williams v. Rochling Auto. USA, LLP, No. 7:11-cv-3497-MGL, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132825, 2013 WL 5231731, at *12 (D.S.C. Sept. 16, 2013) (plaintiff did not meet employer's legitimate performance expectations where he received two negative performance reviews and was subject of internal complaints about his performance).
The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's termination in the case at bar mirrors that of Morris v. Sheetz Inc., No. 5:13-cv-00095, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, 2015 WL 1925457, at *1 (W.D. Va. Apr. 28, 2015). (Dkt No. 90-1 at 16-17.) This court finds Morris to be highly instructive in the case at bar. In Morris, the plaintiff was a store manager at Sheetz. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *1. The plaintiff took short-term FMLA leave twice in 2011. The plaintiff was also given a poor performance evaluation in December 2011, and did not improve her performance in response [*24]  afterwards. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *1-2. The plaintiff took another FMLA leave in May 2012. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *1. At the time of her leave, the plaintiff's performance had still not improved, and her employer remained dissatisfied with her work. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *2. When she returned to work after her FMLA leave, the plaintiff was given a disciplinary notice and an action plan, which addressed several of the plaintiff's problem areas. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *2. Despite being coached and counseled, the plaintiff's performance did not improve, and her store received "numerous customer complaints." As a result, she was terminated. Id.
The Morris court noted that the evidence set forth by the employer was "overwhelming" when demonstrating that the plaintiff was not performing her job adequately. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55122, [WL] at *11. Specifically: 1) the plaintiff's performance was deficient; 2) she received a disciplinary notice; 3) she was given an action plan detailing specific areas of improvement; and 4) the store received customer complaints. Id.
The Plaintiff in the case at bar began having performance deficits in 2011, before her period of leave. Those deficiencies continued until she was terminated in August of 2013. The Plaintiff received numerous notices of her deficient performance. The Plaintiff was [*25]  given a plan on how to improve and regularly met with her supervisors. Molett received complaints from the Plaintiff's co-workers and from the public concerning the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has failed to make a showing that she fulfilled her employer's legitimate expectations at the time she was terminated. Therefore, this court concludes that the Plaintiff has not made a prima facie case under the ADA. This court recommends that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment be granted.

iii. Reasonable Inference of Unlawful Discrimination
A plaintiff must show that her "discharge occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Haulbrook, 252 F.3d at 702. "To raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination, [a plaintiff] must provide more than speculative evidence, generalities, or gut feelings." Olliff v. Potter, No. 3:08-cv-049, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84402, 2008 WL 4681986, at *4 (E.D. Va. Oct. 21, 2008) (citing Bryant v. Bell Atl., Inc., 288 F.3d 124, 134-35 (4th Cir.2002) (evidence of subjective beliefs "without more, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to any discriminatory conduct.")).
The Plaintiff argues that her circumstances raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination because she was fired for store metrics and under a theory that Molett purposefully [*26]  made the Plaintiff work with Fippen at Store Number 563 to stress her out so she would not succeed. (Dkt. No. 91 at 15-16.) The Plaintiff's argument regarding store metrics does not give rise to a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.
Elliott repeatedly testified that the pharmacist on duty, not the PIC, was responsible for outcomes and the performance of a store while on duty. (Dkt. No 92-5 at 3-6, 16-19, 21 of 23.) (See also Dkt. No. 92-3 at 3 of 19.) (the staff pharmacist is responsible for ensuring that the right "behaviors are happening"). Elliott testified that if the right behaviors are not being done, that Molett and Elliott would give feedback to the pharmacist who is not complying. (Dkt. No 92-5. at 15 of 23.) Elliott specifically testified Fippen met her individual goals for behaviors but that the Plaintiff was lacking. (Id. at 14-15 of 23.) Molett testified that the IDP was given to "give [the Plaintiff] expectations of things that she needed to meet, behaviors that she needed to implement," and the Plaintiff "expected to implement those behaviors." (Dkt. No. 92-3 at 8 of 19.) In her deposition, the Plaintiff acknowledged she did not meet the goals set in the IDP. (Dkt. No. [*27]  92-1 at 29 of 56.) The Plaintiff does not address the numerous complaints CVS received from customers and co-workers.
The Plaintiff's second argument that a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination exists is speculative and not reasonable. Prior to the Plaintiff's termination, Fippen had requested to move to a part-time floater position. On the same day that the Plaintiff was fired, Molett emailed Fippen to offer the the part-time floater postion. (Dkt. No. 93-4 at 8-9.) The Plaintiff argues that this is evidence that "Ms. Molett was targeting Ms. Wigger because of her stress and anxiety disorder by keeping Ms. Wigger's stressor, Ms. Fippen, at the store even after she requested to be reassigned." (Dkt. No. 91 at 16.) There is no evidence to support the Plaintiff's contention. The Plaintiff asserts that she was held responsive for the store's admittedly lagging metrics while Fippen was not disciplined. By the Plaintiff's reasoning, CVS intentionally let the store perform poorly for months as part of a retribution scheme against the Plaintiff. The record does not support this theory. The timing of an email offering Fippen a part time position that was still not available for two [*28]  to three weeks may not be logically extrapolated to support a retribution scheme pointed at mentally stressing the Plaintiff. The timing of the email does not give rise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. This court finds that that the Plaintiff has failed to present any facts to support the rise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.

b. Remaining Steps under McDonnell Douglas
For the reasons outlined above, this court finds that the Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case. Assuming arguendo, that the Plaintiff had established a prima facie case, the Plaintiff has not overcome the Defendants' legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action. The Defendants have produced substantial evidence of complaints against the Plaintiff by co-workers and by customers. The Defendants have produced a history of performance deficiencies from the Plaintiff starting over two (2) years before her termination. The Plaintiff has not produced evidence to overcome the Defendants' explanation or to show that the Defendants' explanation was pretextual. [*29]  The Plaintiff has not addressed the complaints against the Plaintiff by co-workers and by customers at all. Therefore, the undersigned recommends that the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment be granted as to the Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.

2. Failure to Accommodate
The Plaintiff brings a failure to accommodate claim as well. Violations of the ADA occur when the employer fails to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual with a disability. Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001). "In a failure to accommodate case, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing '(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations.'" Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n. 11 (quoting Mitchell v. Washingtonville Ctr. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir.1999)).
The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim fails for three reasons. (Dkt. No. 90 at 2.) The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA. The Defendants argue that CVS had no notice that the Plaintiff was disabled. Finally, the Defendants argue that [*30]  the Plaintiff's request to be transferred was not reasonable or feasible and that CVS was under no obligation to "bump out another employee" for the Plaintiff.
As discussed supra, the Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she qualifies as being disabled under the ADA. Additionally, this court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her employer had notice of her disability. The Plaintiff testified in her deposition that she told Molett and Elliott about her depression and anxiety when she requested that she be transferred and that Elliott told her to place the request in writing. The written request is part of the record. (Dkt. Nos. 90-6 at 46 of 46; 93-2 at 2.) "The burden to provide notice is not an onerous one: the employee does not need to mention the ADA or use the phrase 'reasonable accommodation,' but need only inform the employer of both the disability and the employee's need for accommodations for that disability." Schneider v. Giant of Maryland, LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 270 (4th Cir. 2010) (E.E.O.C. v. Federal Express Corp., 513 F.3d 360, 369 (4th Cir.2008)). This court finds that there is evidence in the record that the Plaintiff told Molett and Elliott about her depression and anxiety both verbally and in writing. Additionally, [*31]  this court finds that there is evidence in the record that the Plaintiff requested she be transferred because of her disability.
The issue now before the court is whether the Plaintiff has established that she could perform the essential functions of the position with the reasonable accommodation. This court finds that the Plaintiff has not met her burden. The Plaintiff requested to transfer to a different location with less stress, which she testified was caused by Fippen. (Wigger Depo. pp. 222-225.) As discussed above, the Plaintiff has numerous performance deficiencies dating from before she was diagnosed with depression. She had complaints from co-workers and the public.
Additionally, the accommodation requested by the Plaintiff was not reasonable under the ADA. "The ADA does not require that the employer go out of his way to provide an accommodation for a disabled employee, but only requires that accommodations are 'reasonable.'" Schneider v. Giant of Maryland, LLC, 389 F. App'x 263, 271 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dep't of Admin., 44 F.3d 538, 542 (7th Cir.1995) ("To 'accommodate' a disability is to make some change that will enable the disabled person to work ... [and] at the very least, the cost could not be disproportionate to the benefit.")). An employer's obligation under the ADA to make reasonable [*32]  accommodation for an employee suffering from depression does not extend "to providing an aggravation-free environment." Cannice v. Norwest Bank Iowa N.A., 189 F.3d 723, 728 (8th Cir. 1999). As a matter of law, a Plaintiff's request for "an alternate worksite or different supervisory relationships" because of job-related stress is not reasonable. Frantz v. Shinseki, No. 1:10-cv-275, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9883, 2012 WL 259980, at *8 (M.D.N.C. Jan. 27, 2012); see also Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d 379, 384 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that the failure to reassign an employee to a different supervisor did not violate the reasonable accommodation requirement of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act).
In holding that it is "wholly impractical" to require an employer to transfer an employee to another department "whenever he becomes 'stressed out' by a coworker or supervisor," the Third Circuit stated the following:
[B]y asking to be transferred away from individuals who cause him prolonged and inordinate stress, [the plaintiff] is essentially asking this court to establish the conditions of his employment, most notably, with whom he will work. However, nothing in the ADA allows this shift in responsibility. Indeed, nothing in the law leads us to conclude that in enacting the disability acts, Congress intended to interfere with personnel decisions within an organizational hierarchy. Congress intended [*33]  simply that disabled persons have the same opportunities available to them as are available to nondisabled persons.
Gaul v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 581 (3d Cir. 1998)) (internal quotations omitted). (internal quotations and citations omitted).
This court agrees. The Plaintiff has not established she could perform the duties of her job as a staff pharmacist. As a matter of law, the accommodation she requested was not reasonable. Therefore this court concludes that the Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim fails as a matter of law and recommends that the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, this court recommends that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 90) be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
