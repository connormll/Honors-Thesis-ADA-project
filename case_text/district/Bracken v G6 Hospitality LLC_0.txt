Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and Brief in Support [Dkt. 25]. The Court, having considered the Motion, and all other relevant filings, recommends that Defendant's Motion be GRANTED.

BACKGROUND
On October 3, 2014, Plaintiff Corey L. Bracken ("Plaintiff") filed this case against Defendant G6 Hospitality LLC (hereinafter referred to as "Defendant" or "Motel 6") [Dkt. 1]. Plaintiff's complaint arises from various stays or visits by Plaintiff at certain Motel 6 locations. See id. Plaintiff alleges that various Motel 6 locations he visited were not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") [see Dkts. 1; 24]. Specifically, Plaintiff's Original Complaint alleges that he was denied reasonable accommodation by means of "a microwave being rented to non handicap [sic] accessible rooms [*2]  but not to the rooms designed for handicap accessibility, denial of [two] beds in handicap accessible rooms, [and/] or [generally denied] reasonable accommodation ...[, as well as,] denied reasonable accommodation of personal accessibility of enhanced note-taking in conjuncture with attempts to resolve these matters via informal resolution ..." [Dkt. 1 at 1]. On July 15, 2015, this case was referred to the undersigned. On August 10, 2015, the Court ordered Plaintiff to file an Amended Complaint [Dkt. 21]. On August 27, 2015, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint alleging he was also denied reasonable accommodation by/when the elevator malfunctioned in a Denver, Colorado, Motel 6 and he was refused assistance with retrieving his laundry from the third floor; not provided an additional room free of charge for his alleged caretaker/friend on various stays at certain Motel 6 locations; and was retaliated against by being forced to leave a Motel 6 after he contacted Defendant's corporate office [see Dkts. 24; 25 at 8]. On September 17, 2015, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. 25]. On January 7, 2016, the Court ordered Plaintiff to file a Response to Defendant's pending Motion to [*3]  Dismiss no later than January 19, 2016 [Dkt. 34]. On February 5, 2016, Plaintiff filed a document which the Court construes as a Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. 38].

LEGAL STANDARD
Defendant moves to dismiss based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss argues that, irrespective of jurisdiction, the complaint fails to assert facts that give rise to legal liability of Defendant. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that each claim in a complaint include "a short and plain statement... showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The claims must include enough factual allegations "to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Thus, "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).
The Court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts contained in Plaintiff's Complaint and view them in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; Gonzalez v. Kay, 577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). The Supreme Court has further expounded upon the Twombly standard, "explaining that '[t]o survive a motion [*4]  to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Gonzalez, 577 F.3d at 603 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. "It follows, that 'where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged - but it has not 'shown' - 'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Id.
In Iqbal, the Supreme Court established a two-step approach for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. First, the Court identifies conclusory allegations and proceeds to disregard them, for they are "not entitled to the assumption of truth." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681. Second, the Court "consider[s] the factual allegations in [the complaint] to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief." Id. "This standard 'simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of' the necessary claims or elements." Morgan v. Hubert, 335 F. App'x 466, 470 (5th Cir. 2009). This evaluation will "be a context-specific task that requires [*5]  the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.

ANALYSIS
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss contends that each of Plaintiff's ADA claims herein must be dismissed because (1) the relief Plaintiff seeks is unavailable under the ADA, (2) Plaintiff's claims are time-barred, and/or (3) Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to support his claims [Dkt. 25]. Defendant also alleges Plaintiff's remaining claims for violations of 28 C.F.R. §§ 35, 46 should similarly be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Id. Plaintiff, in response, contends that he can provide the Court with a video "that was ascertained in January 2016 of Motel 6 admitting that they do not provide [two] bed handicap accessible rooms" which validates Plaintiff's contention that Defendant does not provide adequate accommodation [Dkt. 38 at 1]. Plaintiff does not further substantively respond to Defendant's arguments, but rather again requests the Court appoint him counsel.1 Id. The Court now addresses Plaintiff's renewed request for counsel and each of Defendant's arguments.

 [*6] I. Plaintiff's Further Request for Appointment of Counsel
Plaintiff, by and through his Response, renews his request that the Court appoint him "pro bono" counsel [Dkt. 38]. As the Court previously explained [see Dkt. 37], a litigant has no general right to a court-appointed attorney in a civil case. See FTC v. Assail, Inc., 410 F.3d 256, 267 (5th Cir. 2005) (explaining that the constitutional right to counsel does not apply to civil pro se litigants). The Court may appoint counsel in cases presenting "exceptional circumstances." Ulmer v. Chancellor, 691 F.2d 209, 212, 213 (5th Cir. 1982). The decision to appoint counsel is based "on many factors, including the type and complexity of the case; the petitioner's ability adequately to present and investigate his case; the presence of evidence which largely consists of conflicting testimony so as to require skill in presentation of evidence and in cross-examination; and the likelihood that appointment will benefit the petitioner, the court, and the defendants by 'shortening the trial and assisting in a just determination."' Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., 929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991) (quoting Ulmer, 691 F.2d at 213).
Plaintiff advances no argument in support of his request for appointment of "pro bono" counsel, other than asserting one is necessary herein due to his educational level [see Dkt. 38]. This assertion alone does not satisfy [*7]  the "exceptional circumstances" requirement set out in Ulmer. 691 F.2d at 212; Taylor v. Slatkin, No. CIV.A. 3:02-CV-2404-R, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83442003 WL 21479076, at *1 (N.D. Tex. May 13, 2003). Accordingly, having considered the relevant factors, the Court finds Plaintiff's second request for the Court to appoint counsel is denied.

II. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss

A. Plaintiff's ADA Claims
The Court construes Plaintiff's Amended Complaint to articulate claims for violations of both Title III and Title IV of the ADA [see Dkt. 24]. Defendant argues Plaintiff's claims under each Title are subject to dismissal [see Dkt. 25].

1. Relief Sought
Defendant first contends that Plaintiff's Title III and Title V claims should be dismissed because the relief Plaintiff seeks is not available under the ADA [Dkt. 25 at 12]. Plaintiff's Original Complaint and Amended Complaint (hereinafter Plaintiff's "Complaints")2 seek the following relief: (1) that adequate and appropriate signage and other means of reasonable accommodation be immediately implemented at all G6 Hospitality maintained properties; (2) the immediate dismissal of Ms. Horsley; (3) Alan Rabinowitz ("Mr. Rabinowitz"), Ms. Stringer's supervisor, to perform "appropriate and adequate research as to why these matters were not adequately [*8]  addressed when brought to the attention of" Ms. McDaniel; (4) $330,000 in damages; (5) Defendant's acting Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") "be ordered to hold a sign in Central Park in New York, New York asking for the forgiveness of the American People [sic] for the abashment and ridicule that has been done to the founders of the entity of which they represent"; (6) a hand written letter of apology written to Plaintiff by the acting Chief Executive Officer; and (7) reimbursement of fees Plaintiff incurred in transcribing his notes from telephone conversation with various Defendant employees [see Dkts. 1 at 1-2; 24 at 1].
As an initial matter, there is no remedy for monetary damages under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12188(a), 12203(c); Todd v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., 222 F.R.D. 118, 120 n.2 (S.D. Tex. 2003) (monetary damages are not available under Title III of the ADA); see also Rothman v. City of Chicago, No. 02C3533, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8376, 2004 WL 2271851, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 6, 2004) ("Where the plaintiff alleges retaliation [under Title V] based on a defendant's position as an owner, lessor, or operator of "a place of public accommodation," then the available remedies are those provided under [Title III,] 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1).") (citing Van Hulle v. Pacific Telesis Corp., 124 F. Supp. 2d 642, 646 (N.D. Cal. 2000)). Accordingly, any claim for monetary relief, including specifically any requests for damages or fees, sought by Plaintiff under the ADA must be dismissed.3
As to the remaining relief sought by Plaintiff, the ADA specifically defines injunctive relief as:
[I]njunctive relief shall include an order to alter facilities [*10]  to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities to the extent required by this subchapter. Where appropriate, injunctive relief shall also include requiring the provision of an auxiliary aid or server, modification of a policy, or provision of alternative methods, to the extent required by this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2); see also Rothman, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8376, 2004 WL 2271851, at *2 (citing Van Hulle, 124 F. Supp. 2d at 646). Plaintiff's remaining requests for relief, save one, do not qualify as injunctive relief available under the ADA. More specifically, Plaintiff's request that Ms. Horsley's employment be terminated, that Mr. Rabinowitz research how this matter was handled by various Motel 6 employees, and that the acting CEO perform specific actions are not forms of relief encompassed within the definition of injunctive relief and are not available under the ADA. Plaintiff does, however, seek to have Defendant implement "adequate and appropriate signage and other means of reasonable accommodation" in all properties it maintains [Dkt. 1]. The Court construes this relief alone as relief appropriately sought under the ADA.

2. Statute of Limitations
Defendant further contends that any of Plaintiff's alleged ADA violations occurring prior to [*11]  October 3, 2012 (two years prior to the date Plaintiff filed his Original Complaint), are time-barred, and thus should also be dismissed [Dkt. 25 at 14-15]. The ADA does not provide a specific limitations period. See Eber v. Harris County Hospital District, 130 F. Supp. 2d 847, 869-70 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (citations omitted). However, "[w]here a federal statute does not contain a limitations period, courts generally look to the most analogous state statute of limitations ... [and] [m]ost civil rights actions are essentially claims to vindicate injuries to personal rights." Id. at 869 (citations omitted). Thus, courts generally apply state personal injury limitation periods to ADA claims. Id. at 869-70 (citations omitted). "In Texas, the general statutory limitation period for personal injury claims is two years, beginning the day after the cause of action accrues." Id. at 870 (citing Grace v. Colorito, 4 S.W.3d 765, 769 (Tex. App. — Austin 1999, pet. denied)); see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.003(a).
Plaintiff alleges that he has stayed at Motel 6 locations "numerous times since 2011" [Dkt. 1 at 1]. Plaintiff fails, however, to specify the dates of the alleged illegal acts occurring at such Motel 6 locations of which he complains in either his Original Complaint or Amended Complaint [see Dkts. 1; 24]. His pleadings are utterly devoid of the dates of his encounters with each Motel [*12]  6 location. Moreover, Plaintiff only generally states the Motel 6 locations he believes to be noncompliant with ADA regulations generally listing those in Denver, Colorado; Yuma, Arizona; Lakewood, Colorado; Klamath Falls, Oregon; San Bernardino, California; Los Angeles, California; and Orem, Utah [Dkt. 24 at 1]. No specific locations are identified.4 To the extent any of Plaintiff's alleged ADA violations occurred before October 3, 2012 (two years prior to the day Plaintiff filed his Original Complaint) such alleged violations are time-barred and should be dismissed.

3. Failure to State a Claim
Turning now to Defendant's contention that Plaintiff fails to state a claim under the ADA, the Court reiterates that under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must dismiss a cause of action when a plaintiff "fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements," [*13]  are insufficient. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Indeed, "factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level [] on the assumption that all allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Notably, the Fifth Circuit has held that Plaintiff's pro se status does not excuse him from complying with the appropriate pleading standards:
Pro se pleadings are held to less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. However, even if a plaintiff is proceeding pro se, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.
Amos v. Palmetto Gov't Benefit Adm'r, 122 F. App'x 105, 109 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Specifically, when a plaintiff has "put forward no concrete allegations whatsoever against [a defendant]," and "pled no facts that could possibly indicate that [a defendant] may be liable... [the plaintiff's] allegations provide no basis for relief." Id. at 112. Under those circumstances, dismissal of the claims is proper. Id.; see also Smith v. Bastrop Medical Clinic, P.A., Inc., No. A-11-CA-330, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96407, 2011 WL 3844223, at *4 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2011) (holding that the pro se plaintiff failed to state a claim under Title III of the ADA because he failed to state which disability [*14]  is the basis of his claim or how the defendants discriminated against him because of that disability).

i. Title III
Defendant specifically argues that Plaintiff's Title III claim must be dismissed for failure to state a claim because "[n]othing in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint identifies any impairment that ... rises to the level of disability as defined by the ADA — indeed, it mentions no impairment at all" [Dkt. 25 at 9-10]. The Court agrees.
Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities by places of public accommodation and services operated by private entities, including hotels. Section 12181 states that as a "general rule ... [n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Therefore, to state a claim under Title III, Plaintiff must allege that: (1) he has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; (3) the plaintiff [*15]  was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of his disability. Griffin v. Public Access Comm. Television, No. A-10-CA-602, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101620, 2010 WL 3815797, at *1 (W.D. Tex. Sept.27, 2010) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a)). The ADA defines "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). "[M]ajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). The ADA defines the term "impairment" as:
(A) An individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.
(B) Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months [*16]  or less
42 U.S.C. § 12102(3).
While Plaintiff alleges he has been discriminated against or denied accommodation on the basis of his impairments, Plaintiff's Complaints wholly fail to state what his alleged impairments are. Indeed, nowhere does Plaintiff say that he is (or has been) disabled [see Dkt. 24]. More specifically, Plaintiff "has not alleged that he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment." Lockridge v. Dallas Cty. Sch., No. 3:10-CV-1175-O, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139012, 2010 WL 5538436, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 8, 2010), adopted by, No. 3:10-CV-1175-O, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1393, 2011 WL 52735 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 6, 2011). Plaintiff's claims for discrimination on the basis of disability cannot survive absent such factual allegations; Plaintiff's failure to allege that he is disabled under that ADA warrants dismissal of his Title III claims. Id.; see also Adamore v. Southwest Airlines Corp., No. H-11-0564, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144758, 2011 WL 6301398, at *7 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 15, 2011) ("Although Plaintiff summarily states that she is disabled, she does not identify her disability and pleads no facts linking her alleged disability to any mistreatment or lack of accommodation .... therefore [plaintiff] fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted under the Americans with Disabilities Act.") (citing [*17]  Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65). In addition, Plaintiff also fails to state or articulate how Defendant discriminated against him because of that disability further necessitating dismissal. See Smith v. Bastrop Medical Clinic, P.A., Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96407, 2011 WL 3844223, at *4. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be granted as to Plaintiff's Title III claim because Plaintiff fails to allege any facts that would make his ADA claim plausible.

ii. Title V
Plaintiff may also intend to assert a claim under Title V of the ADA [see Dkt. 24 at 1]. Defendant argues any Title V claim must likewise be dismissed for failure to state a claim because Plaintiff "fails to allege any facts indicating who forced him to leave the Motel 6 located at Denver, [Colorado], and whether this person had any knowledge of Plaintiff's complaint to the corporate office prior to the alleged retaliatory activity" [Dkt. 25 at 11 (citing Sherrod v. American Airlines, Inc., 132, F.3d 1112, 1122 (5th Cir. 1998)].
Title V of the ADA prohibits retaliation against individuals with disabilities when they oppose an unlawful practice under the ADA. Specifically, Title V provides: "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this [*18]  chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To establish an unlawful retaliation claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) suffered an adverse action; and (3) there is a causal link between the two. Chipman v. Nelson, No. 2:11-CV-2770, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126840, 2014 WL 4635117, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 10, 2014) (citing Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (9th Cir. 2003)); see also generally Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1999) ("To show an unlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of (1) engagement in an activity protected by the ADA, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected act and the adverse action."). Notably, courts have found that a plaintiff need not be disabled to file a retaliation claim under the ADA. See Turner v. The Saloon, Ltd., 595 F.3d 679, 689-90 (7th Cir. 2010) ("The fact that [the plaintiff] is not disabled under the ADA is not fatal to his retaliation claim.") (citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff alleges Defendant retaliated against him by forcing him to leave the Motel 6 in Denver, Colorado [Dkt. 24]. Plaintiff asserts he was kicked out because he contacted the Motel 6 corporate office to complain that the particular location refused to assist Plaintiff [*19]  in retrieving his laundry when the elevator malfunctioned [see Dkt. 24; 24-2 at 2]. At the outset, it is unclear from Plaintiff's Complaints what protected activity he is alleging [see Dkts. 24 at 1; 24-2 at 2]. Courts have found that a request for reasonable accommodation amounts to protected activity. See Floyd v. Lee, 968 F. Supp. 2d. 308, 332-33 (D.D.C. 2013) (analyzing cases from other circuits and finding that a request for reasonable accommodation is protected activity under the ADA). The Court discerns that Plaintiff contacted the Motel 6 corporate office, specifically their customer service department, about (1) the malfunctioning elevator, (2) Motel 6 employees' refusal to retrieve his laundry from the third floor, and (3) the "customer service ongoings [sic] of Motel 6" [see Dkts. 24 at 1; 24-2 at 2]. Poor customer service and/or a temporary malfunction of an elevator do not constitute a violation of the ADA; and a complaint regarding same is not a protected activity. See Foley v. City of Lafayette, Ind., 359 F.3d 925, 930-31 (7th Cir.2004) (the plaintiff alleged that the defendant city violated the ADA by failing to repair a broken elevator or otherwise secure the plaintiff's safe egress from a city train station after a snowstorm and the court found that "[i]solated acts of negligence by a city employee [*20]  do not come within the ambit of discrimination against disabled persons proscribed by the ADA"). Similarly, a complaint for refusal to retrieve laundry — without more — does not fall within or constitute a protected activity. Plaintiff has not stated any facts demonstrating how a complaint regarding a Motel 6 employee's refusal to retrieve his laundry amounts to a protected activity. See Manigaulte v. C.W. Post of Long Island Univ., 659 F. Supp. 2d 367, 380-81 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (explaining that "a non-disabled individual who files a complaint of disability discrimination is engaging in activity protected under the ADA so long as she can establish that she possessed a good faith, reasonable belief that the underlying challenged actions of the employer violated the ADA") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Moreover, even were the Court to assume Plaintiff has met the first two elements of a prima facie retaliation claim, Plaintiff's claim herein still must fail because he has not pled facts sufficient to establish the final element that any causal connection exists between his contact with the corporate office and the adverse behavior [see Dkts. 1; 24; 24-2 at 2]. "To establish a causal link between the protected conduct and the adverse ... action, a plaintiff [*21]  must show that 'the ... [defendant's] decision ... was based in part on knowledge of the ... [plaintiff's] protected activity.'" See Luedecke v. Tenet Healthcare Corp., No 3:14-CV-1582, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 651, 2015 WL 58733, at *7 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 5, 2015) (citing Sherrod, 132 F.3d at 1122). Plaintiff has not stated any facts demonstrating that the particular Motel 6 location in Denver, Colorado, had any knowledge that he had contacted the corporate office to complain about their alleged lack of compliance with the ADA or that his call to Defendant's corporate office resulted in the adverse behavior (i.e. was the reason he was forced to leave) [see Dkts. 24; 24-2]. Indeed, having reviewed the Complaints the sum total of Plaintiff's allegations in this regard are:
I have documentation of Motel 6 in Denver, CO refusing reasonable accommodation when the elevator malfunctioned and I requested assistance with retrieving my laundry off of the 3rd floor while the room that was rented was on the 1st floor. That address is 3050 West 49th Ave, Denver, CO 80221. I did contact the corporate office and the offices of a Tammy Horsley whom oversees the customer services ongoings [sic] of Motel 6, the particular location retaliated against my person by forcing me to leave once the customer service office [*22]  was closed for business, I have enhanced notes also documenting this and there was too [sic] police involved and I am sure that there is a report of that incident as well with that respective police department [Dkt. 24 at 1].
And then there's the slight issues of this, I ... doesn't know if you are aware about Malinda McDaniels [sic] agreement that happened awhile back, with a Denver location when the elevator went down, because I was kicked out because I brought it to the corporate offices [sic] attention [Dkt. 24-2 at 2].
This is not sufficient. Plaintiff has not stated any facts demonstrating that the particular Motel 6 location in Denver, Colorado, had any knowledge that he had contacted the corporate office to complain about their alleged lack of compliance with the ADA or that his call to Defendant's corporate office resulted in the adverse behavior. Plaintiff has failed to include facts that could lead to an inference that the alleged adverse action was linked to any protected activity. See Luedecke, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 651, 2015 WL 58733, at *8 ("With respect to the third element of retaliation — whether the adverse action is causally linked to the protected activity — the Court agrees with Defendants and finds that Plaintiff has [*23]  omitted facts that could lead to such an inference."). Because Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the ADA, his retaliation claim should therefore be dismissed.

B. Plaintiff's Claims under 28 C.F.R. §§ 35, 46
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint also contends that Defendant is in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 35 and 28 C.F.R. § 46. These statutes are inapplicable against Motel 6 and should also be dismissed for failure to state a claim [Dkt. 25 at 15].
28 C.F.R. § 35 "prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities." 28 C.F.R. § 35.101. A public entity is defined as "(1) [a]ny State or local government; (2) [a]ny department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government; and (3) [t]he National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any commuter authority (as defined in section 103(8) of the Rail Passenger Service Act)." 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. Defendant does not meet any of these definitions and is a private, not public, entity. Accordingly, Plaintiff's 28 C.F.R. § 35 claim should be dismissed.
Likewise, Plaintiff's 28 C.F.R. § 46 claim should be dismissed. 28 C.F.R. § 46 "applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported or otherwise subject to regulation by any federal department or agency which takes appropriate administrative [*24]  action to make the policy applicable to such research." 28 C.F.R. § 46.101. Defendant does not conduct human research and thus, 28 C.F.R. § 46 is inapplicable to this case.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Based upon the findings discussed above, the Court recommends that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and Brief in Support [Dkt. 25] be GRANTED, and Plaintiff's claims against Defendant be DISMISSED with prejudice.
Within fourteen (14) days after service of the magistrate judge's report, any party must serve and file specific written objections to the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C). In order to be specific, an objection must identify the specific finding or recommendation to which objection is made, state the basis for the objection, and specify the place in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation where the disputed determination is found. An objection that merely incorporates by reference or refers to the briefing before the magistrate judge is not specific.
Failure to file specific, written objections will bar the party from appealing the unobjected-to factual findings and legal conclusions of the magistrate judge that are accepted by the district court, except [*25]  upon grounds of plain error, provided that the party has been served with notice that such consequences will result from a failure to object. See Douglass v. United Services Automobile Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1417 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc), superseded by statute on other grounds, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) (extending the time to file objections from ten to fourteen days).
SIGNED this 3rd day of June, 2016.
