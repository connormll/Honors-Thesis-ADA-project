ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
Re: Dkt. Nos. 33, 34, 37

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Syed Nazim Ali ("Ali") sues Defendant PayPal, Inc. ("PayPal") based on allegations of discriminatory treatment arising out of Ali's work for PayPal through a staffing agency in February 2018. Ali's original complaint ("Complaint") alleged nine causes of action for age, race, national origin and disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful termination and economic damages. ECF 1. On February 7, 2019, PayPal moved to dismiss the Complaint. ECF 11. On March 26, 2019, the Court granted PayPal's motion and dismissed Ali's Complaint with leave to amend, except for Ali's claim for economic damages. ECF 25.
In response to the Court's order, Ali filed his first amended complaint ("Amended Complaint") on April 10, 2019. ECF 30. The Amended Complaint asserts thirteen causes of action. Id. PayPal moves to dismiss all thirteen claims in the Amended Complaint. ECF 33. Ali opposes PayPal's motion. [*2]  ECF 34.
Based on the pleadings, the Parties' submissions, the arguments presented at the July 9, 2019 hearing and the relevant law, the Court (1) GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART PayPal's request for judicial notice; and (2) GRANTS PayPal's motion to dismiss WITH PREJUDICE.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background
The Court bases the following factual background on the allegations set forth in Ali's Amended Complaint, which the Court takes as true when ruling on PayPal's motion to dismiss. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (citations omitted).
Ali is a Pakistani-American individual with over 20 years of experience in the information technology industry. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 11, 19, 67. He is over 40 years old and holds several professional accreditations and security certifications. Id. at ¶¶ 19, 34. In December 2017, a staffing agency, Robert Half International Inc. ("Robert Half"), contacted Ali about a 24-month placement at PayPal for a security compliance project. Id. at ¶ 13.
Ali began working at PayPal on February 5, 2018, as a "Cybersecurity Team Lead," and his responsibilities included managing a 10-member team. Id. at ¶¶ 14, 29. When Ali started, Ali and his team were forced to relocate every hour or two hours to a new conference [*3]  room because PayPal did not have enough space to accommodate the large number of recently hired employees. Id. at ¶¶ 27, 34. On February 15, 2018, Ali met with Tim O'Brien, Manager Global Legal Inventory. Id. at ¶ 33. At that meeting, Ali disclosed his knee and joint disability and requested a "reasonable accommodation for proper work place seating." Id. In addition to his knees, the frequent moving "put a severe toll on" Ali's other physical and mental health conditions, such as his "uncontrolled high blood pressure, rapid heath [sic] beats, dizziness, fainting, feeling pass out," "excessive stress, anxiety and depression." Id. at ¶ 34. On February 19, 2018, Ali again disclosed these medical conditions to O'Brien and again requested "a dedicated workstation." Id. at ¶ 46.
On February 21, 2018, O'Brien demoted Ali and reassigned his "position, roles and responsibilities" to another PayPal employee. Id. at ¶ 51. On February 28, 2018, Ali escalated his request for accommodation to Senior Vice President Marlys Rodgers, who contacted O'Brien to address Ali's request. Id. at ¶ 55. Ali alleges that O'Brien again refused his request and terminated his employment on February 28, 2019. Id. ¶¶ [*4]  55, 67. However, Ali attaches emails to his Amended Complaint reflecting his February 28, 2018 request for accommodation and O'Brien's response. Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 17-18. O'Brien's response states that PayPal has provided Ali with a "desk for the duration of this contract." Id. at 17.
The Amended Complaint also alleges that PayPal retaliated against Ali based on his then-pending lawsuits against eBay, Inc. ("eBay") and Gilead Sciences, Inc. ("Gilead"). ECF 30 at ¶¶ 67; 184. On February 17, 2018, Ali participated in conference calls with other PayPal IT team members. Id. at ¶ 26. Some of these team members had worked with eBay's IT team and asked Ali which team he worked with during his time at eBay. Id. Two of the team members knew Ali's former team, and on this basis, Ali alleges that PayPal's IT team knew about his employment lawsuit against eBay. Id. Ali further alleges that PayPal's knowledge of this lawsuit and his lawsuit against Gilead were additional motiving factors in the termination of his employment. Id. ¶¶ at 67, 184.
On March 13, 2018, Ali filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") [*5]  alleging that he was "contracted to work" at PayPal beginning February 5, 2018, as a Senior Security Consultant. Ex. C, ECF 30-1 at 23; Ex. 1, ECF 33-1 at 5. The charge further alleges that Ali disclosed his disabilities and "requested to work remotely" as an accommodation. Ex. C, ECF 30-1 at 23. PayPal allegedly denied Ali's request and terminated his employment. Id. Ali contends that such actions constitute unlawful discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Id. On November 6, 2018, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter (id.), and on January 7, 2019, Ali filed this lawsuit. ECF 1.
Ali's Amended Complaint alleges thirteen causes of action: (1) age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"); (2) race discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII") and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (3) national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII; (4) disability discrimination in violation of the ADA; (5) retaliation in violation of the FEHA; (6) failure to accommodate in violation of the FEHA; (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"); [*6]  (8) wrongful termination; (9) failure to engage in an interactive process in violation of the FEHA; (10) failure to prevent retaliation in violation of the FEHA; (11) intentional interference with prospective economic relationships; (12) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of the FEHA; and (13) declaratory relief. ECF 30.
At the July 9, 2019 hearing, Ali stated that the Amended Complaint includes all the relevant facts according to his current knowledge. Ali also stated that he has people whom he pays to "basically write" his complaints and papers. This admission calls into question Ali's pro se status. See Civil Local Rule 3-9(a) ("Any party representing him or herself without an attorney must appear personally and may not delegate that duty to any other person who is not a member of the bar of this Court.")

B. PayPal's Motion to Dismiss
On May 31, 2019, PayPal filed a motion to dismiss all thirteen of Ali's claims in his Amended Complaint. ECF 33. In general, PayPal argues that Ali failed to exhaust administrative remedies for his age, race and national origin discrimination claims. Id. at 7-8. PayPal also contends that each of Ali's thirteen causes of actions fail to state a claim. Id. at 9-22.
All Parties have [*7]  consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge. ECF 3; ECF 14.

III. PAYPAL'S REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
When ruling on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion, a court generally "may not consider material beyond the complaint." Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Grp., Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2007). The two exceptions to this rule are that "a court may consider 'material which is properly submitted as part of the complaint'" and "a court may take judicial notice of 'matters of public record.'" Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court may take judicial notice of facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute because they are either "generally known" or "can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Although the Court may take judicial notice of the existence of court documents, the Court may not take judicial notice of disputed facts within those records. Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90 ("[W]hen a court takes judicial notice of another court's opinion, it may do so 'not for the truth of the facts recited therein, but for the existence of the opinion, which is not subject to reasonable dispute over its authenticity.'") (citation omitted). Further, the Court may deny a request to judicially notice facts which are not relevant to the disposition [*8]  of the issues before the Court. See Ruiz v. City of Santa Maria, 160 F.3d 543, 548 n.13 (9th Cir. 1998).
First, PayPal requests that the Court take judicial notice of Ali's administrative charge and the notice to complainant and respondent from the DFEH. Exs. 1-2, ECF 33-1 at 4-12. The Court may take judicial notice of an administrative charge and right to sue letter as documents which "are public records whose accuracy is not in dispute." Dornell v. City of San Mateo, 19 F. Supp. 3d 900, 904 n.3 (N.D. Cal. 2013). Further, Ali does not dispute their authenticity. The Court thus GRANTS PayPal's request for judicial notice of Exs. 1-2.
Second, PayPal seeks judicial notice of the court dockets for three cases that Ali has filed against other entities, including eBay and Gilead. Exs. 3-5, ECF 33-1 at 13-53. PayPal cites these dockets as evidence that Ali was actively litigating these matters and was not "incapacitated" when he approved his draft administrative charges. ECF 33 at 8, n.1. "[D]ocuments on file in federal or state courts" qualify for judicial notice as "undisputed matters of public record." Harris v. Cty. of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). Because PayPal only seeks judicial notice of the existence of the dockets to show that Ali continued to litigate his cases despite his allegations of incapacity, the Court GRANTS PayPal's request for judicial [*9]  notice of Exs. 3-5, for this limited purpose.
Third, PayPal seeks judicial notice of representations and statements Ali has made on a webpage for one of his businesses. Ex. 6, ECF 33-1 at 54-85. PayPal cites these representations to argue that Ali "holds himself out as a legal specialist" to counter an anticipated argument from Ali that equitable tolling applies to his unexhausted claims. ECF 33 at 8. Ali's opposition to PayPal's motion to dismiss does not raise an equitable tolling argument. See ECF 34. The Court therefore does not need to consider the application of equitable tolling or the evidence PayPayl submits in opposition to it when ruling on PayPal's motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE PayPal's request for judicial notice of Ex. 6 at this point in the litigation. See Ruiz, 160 F.3d at 548 n.13.

IV. PAYPAL'S MOTION TO DISMISS

A. Legal Standard
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must dismiss a complaint if it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). This "facial plausibility" standard requires that the plaintiff allege facts that add up to "more [*10]  than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Although courts do not require "heightened fact pleading of specifics," a plaintiff must provide "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 570. Rather, the plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to "raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id. at 555.
To implement this standard, the Ninth Circuit has recognized a two-step process for evaluating pleadings:
First, to be entitled to the presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint or counterclaim may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively. Second, the factual allegations that are taken as true must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.
Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).
In its review, the Court liberally construes pro se pleadings. Wilhelm v. Rotman, 680 F.3d 1113, 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). Although the Court holds pro se complaints "to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers," Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) [*11]  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), Ali's admission that he pays someone to write his complaints and papers calls into question his pro se status. Further, regardless of a plaintiff's pro se status, the Court need not "accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001).

B. Discussion

1. Administrative Exhaustion
PayPal moves to dismiss Ali's first, second and third claims for age, race and national origin discrimination based on Ali's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. ECF 33 at 7-8

a. Legal Background
Prior to filing suit under Title VII or the ADEA in district court, a plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies through the EEOC. See Sommatino v. United States, 255 F.3d 704, 708 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). A plaintiff must similarly file a claim with the DFEH prior to suing under the FEHA. See Robinson v. Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous., 192 Cal. App. 3d 1414, 1416, 1419, 239 Cal. Rptr. 908 (Cal. Ct. App. 1987); Myers v. Mobil Oil Corp., 172 Cal. App. 3d 1059, 1063, 218 Cal. Rptr. 630 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985). An EEOC charge must contain "a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties, and to describe generally the action or practices complained of." See 29 C.F.R. § 1601.12(b). The scope of the EEOC charge and investigation then dictates "[t]he jurisdictional scope of the plaintiff's court action." Leong v. Potter, 347 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). Indeed, a district court only "has jurisdiction [*12]  over any charges of discrimination that are 'like or reasonably related to' the allegations made before the EEOC, as well as charges that are within the scope of an EEOC investigation that reasonably could be expected to grow out of the allegations." Id. (quoting Sosa v. Hiraoka, 920 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir.1990)).
A plaintiff must show that the discrimination she alleges in her lawsuit reasonably relates to the discrimination described in the administrative charge that grounds the lawsuit. Id. (citation omitted). This exhaustion requirement applies to claims brought under Title VII, the FEHA and ADEA. See Sommatino, 255 F.3d at 707-08 (Title VII); Yurick v. Superior Court, 209 Cal. App. 3d 1116, 1121, 1123, 257 Cal. Rptr. 665 (Cal. Ct. App. 1989) (FEHA); Dempsey v. Pac. Bell Co., 789 F.2d 1451, 1452-53 (9th Cir. 1986) (ADEA).

b. Analysis
The Court previously dismissed Ali's first, second and third claims for age, race and national origin discrimination based on Ali's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, with leave to amend. ECF 25 at 6-8. The Court found that Ali's administrative charge only checks the boxes for retaliation and disability discrimination. Ex. C; ECF 30-1 at 23. The narrative portion of Ali's administrative charge likewise focuses exclusively on Ali's disability discrimination allegations and alleges that Ali was "discriminated and retaliated against for engaging in protected activities in violation of the Americans [*13]  with Disabilities Act." Id. Nowhere does Ali's administrative charge mention age, race or national origin discrimination. Further, the charge contains no facts that suggest an age, race or national origin discrimination claim would naturally grow out of his disability discrimination allegations. See Leong, 347 F.3d at 1122. Without such allegations, the Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Ali's age, race and national origin discrimination claims, and the Court dismissed them for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. ECF 25 at 7.
The Ninth Circuit has recognized that "[i]f the charge itself is deficient in recording [a plaintiff's] theory of the case due to the negligence of an agency representative who completes the charge form, then the plaintiff may present her pre-complaint questionnaire as evidence that her claim for relief was properly exhausted." B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep't, 276 F.3d 1091, 1102 (9th Cir. 2002). Based on this exception, the Court granted Ali limited leave to amend his age, race and national origin discrimination claims to attach a copy of any pre-complaint questionnaire that he submitted to the DFEH or EEOC that contains details regarding his age, race or national origin discrimination claim. ECF 25 at 8.
PayPal argues that Ali [*14]  failed to submit a questionnaire or proof that he exhausted his age, race and national origin discrimination claims under Title VII, the FEHA and ADEA. ECF 33 at 7-8. The Court agrees. Ali's Amended Complaint alleges that he discussed his age, race and national origin discrimination claims with the EEOC investigator, but she failed to include them in his EEOC charge. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 72-74. Ali does not submit any documents reflecting this conversation or any documents reflecting the submission of these claims to the DFEH or EEOC. Instead, Ali only alleges that the EEOC staff "failed to incorporate" his age, race and national origin claims in the formal charge. Id. at ¶ 75. Ali does, however, alleges that an EEOC staff member sent him an email with the drafts of his EEOC charges against Robert Half and PayPal for his approval. Id. at ¶ 71. Ali attaches these drafts and email as Exhibit C to his Amended Complaint. Ex. C, ECF 30-1 at 21-24.
Although neither draft charge mentions Ali's age, race and national origin discrimination claims, Ali alleges that he had "no idea" that the EEOC failed to select the age, race and national origin discrimination boxes when he approved the charges. ECF [*15]  30 at ¶¶ 73, 76-77. This conclusory denial does not cure the deficiencies in Ali's EEOC charge. Further, Ali's efforts to actively litigate three other matters during this same time period (Exs. 3-5, ECF 33-1 at 13-53) belies his unsupported assertion that he was incapacitated and unable to realize the missing information in his administrative charges (ECF 30 at ¶ 73). Ali's status as an experienced pro se plaintiff, who has filed numerous charges, also rebuts his allegations of ignorance. Therefore, in light of Ali's review and approval of the draft charges, Ali's allegations regarding the EEOC's staff's failure to include his additional claims are not sufficient to show that he exhausted his age, race and national origin discrimination claims.
The Court must grant leave to amend unless it is clear that a complaint's deficiencies cannot be cured by amendment. Lucas v. Dep't. of Corr., 66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). Here, limited grounds exist for amendment because the statute of limitations bars Ali from curing the failure to exhaust his age, race and national origin discrimination claims by filing a subsequent administrative charge. Under Title VII, a plaintiff must file discrimination charges with the EEOC within 180 days after the allegedly [*16]  unlawful employment practice "occurred." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1). However, a plaintiff has 300 days if she chooses to file the claim with the DFEH. Id.1 Similar 180-day and 300-day deadlines apply to the ADEA. 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(1). And the FEHA requires a plaintiff to file an administrative charge within one year of the date of the discrimination. Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d). The alleged wrongful conduct in Ali's Amended Complaint occurred roughly one and half years ago in February 2018, thus the time for Ali to file an administrative charge has passed. Ali also does not assert or provide any allegations to support the application of equitable tolling to his claims. Accordingly, based on the allegations before the Court, Ali cannot cure his failure to exhaust administrative remedies for his age, race and national origin discrimination claim by filing a new administrative charge.
Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's first, second and third causes of action WITH PREJUDICE.

2. Failure to State a Claim
The Court next turns to Ali's remaining claims, each of which PayPal contends the Court must dismiss for failure to state a claim. ECF 33 at 9-22. Those claims are Ali's disability discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate, IIED, wrongful termination, [*17]  failure to engage in an interactive process, failure to prevent retaliation, intentional interference with prospective economic relationships, failure to prevent discrimination and declaratory relief.

a. Fourth Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
Ali's fourth cause of action alleges that PayPal discriminated against him based on his disabilities in violation of the ADA. ECF 25 at ¶¶ 123-143. PayPal contends that Ali both fails to plead the elements of disability discrimination under the ADA and fails to plead sufficient facts to support each of those elements. ECF 33 at 11-14.
A prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA requires a plaintiff to prove "(1) that she is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that she is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, that is, able to perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) that the employer terminated her because of her disability." Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace & Co., 104 F.3d 267, 271 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996)). Although a plaintiff is not required to prove a prima facie case of discrimination at the pleading stage, see, e.g., Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002), the elements of a prima facie case are helpful in determining whether a plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible [*18]  claim for relief.

i. The Amended Complaint provides additional allegations regarding Ali's disabilities.
The Court dismissed Ali's original Complaint because he failed to plead sufficient facts regarding his alleged disability. ECF 25 at 9-10. The ADA defines a disability as (1) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual;" (2) "a record of such an impairment;" or (3) "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1037-38 (9th Cir. 2003). While Ali's original Complaint simply listed his disabilities as "anxiety, high blood pressure, depression, chronic back pain and other related health conditions" without further explanation (ECF 1 at ¶ 117), Ali's Amended Complaint provides additional details. Ali alleges that during his employment with PayPal, he suffered several physical disabilities: (1) "uncontrolled high blood pressure," (2) "rapid heath [sic] beats," (3) "dizziness," (4) "fainting," (5) "feeling pass out" and (6) "severe impact on both knees joint, pain, burning, inflammation." ECF 30 at ¶ 34. Ali alleges that these physical disabilities limit the major life activities of "walking, bending down and up, standing, sitting longer, [*19]  and using stairs for up and down." Id. Ali also alleges that he suffered from "phycological health problems:" (1) "excessive stress," (2) "anxiety" and (3) "depression which limits major life activities [of] concentration, thinking, communication, and mental fatigue and exhaustion and tiredness." Id. These allegations approximate those necessary to plead a disability under the ADA; however, Ali's disability discrimination claim still suffers from a fatal lack of detail and several key inconsistencies.

ii. Ali fails to set forth allegations regarding his qualifications.
The Amended Complaint fails to set forth factual allegations addressing the second element in a disability discrimination claim—the plaintiff must be qualified. See Kennedy, 90 F.3d at 1480 ("Only a 'qualified individual with a disability' may state a claim for discrimination.") (citations omitted). The ADA defines a "qualified individual" as an "individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m). Ali's Amended Complaint contains only conclusory allegations that parrot this definition (ECF 30 at ¶¶ 137, 190) and allegations [*20]  regarding his general qualifications and cybersecurity experience (id. at ¶¶ 28-30). Ali fails to identify any of the essential functions of his position or plead any factual allegations regarding his ability to perform them. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint fails to plead the second element of a disability discrimination claim.

iii. Ali fails to allege facts to support his causation allegations.
Ali fails to plead sufficient factual details regarding the causation element of a disability discrimination claim. To plead a case for disability discrimination, plaintiff must "specify which condition was purportedly the basis of a discriminatory adverse employment action." McCarthy v. Brennan, No. 15-CV-03308-JSC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32635, 2016 WL 946099, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 14, 2016). As noted above, Ali lists his alleged physical and mental disabilities and the major life activities that they impair. ECF 30 at ¶ 34. However, Ali fails to identify which of these alleged disabilities provided the basis for PayPal's discriminatory action. Instead, Ali simply alleges that PayPal "wrongfully discriminated and retaliated because of his medical disability," which he disclosed to PayPal "when he requested reasonable accommodation." Id. at ¶¶ 124, 128; 131. Such conclusory [*21]  allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See Sprewell, 266 F.3d at 988 (recognizing that the Court does not need to "accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences").

iv. Ali's failure to accommodate allegations contain irreconcilable inconsistencies.
Documents attached to the Amended Complaint contradict Ali's allegations of a failure to accommodate in two significant respects: (1) the attached EEOC charge contradicts Ali's request for accommodation; and (2) the attached correspondence between Ali and PayPal personnel contradicts Ali's allegations of a failure to accommodate. First, in its previous order, the Court noted troubling inconsistencies between Ali's allegations in the original Complaint and Ali's EEOC charge, such as when and what Ali disclosed to PayPal. ECF 25 at 10. The Court specifically instructed Ali to "clarify" the inconsistencies between his complaint and his EEOC charge. Id. The Court thus assumes that the Amended Complaint reflects Ali's best effort to clarify his allegations relative to the EEOC charge. However, a troubling inconsistency remains. In the Amended Complaint, Ali's allegations that he requested a permanent [*22]  work station as his accommodation are inconsistent with his EEOC charge which states that he "requested to work remotely (reasonable accommodation)." Ex. C, ECF 30-1 at 23.
As a second fault, Ali's Amended Complaint alleges that he met with O'Brien on February 15, 2018, and "requested to have reasonable accommodation for proper work place seating." ECF 30 at ¶ 33. Similarly, Ali alleges that on February 19, 2018, he met with O'Brien again and requested "a dedicated workstation." Id. at ¶ 46. On February 28, 2018, Ali alleges that he "escalated his request for reasonable accommodation to Defendant Senior Management with Marlys Rodgers" and cites an email chain attached to his Amended Complaint. Id. at ¶ 55. In that email, Ali does not disclose any disabilities, but he does request an assigned "desk, phone, [and] two extended monitors, so [he] can work from [the] San Jose office." Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 18. Rodgers alerts O'Brien of this request, who responds to Ali and Rodgers that he showed Ali his desk "in the hotel area" and that Ali has that "hotel desk for the duration of this contract." Id. at 17. This exchange contradicts Ali's allegations that PayPal refused his request for accommodation. [*23]  See Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted) (recognizing that the Court is not "required to accept as true allegations that contradict exhibits attached to the Complaint"). Because Ali bases his claim on a failure to accommodate, the Court finds that Ali fails to state claim for disability discrimination based on the evidence he attaches to his Amended Complaint, showing that PayPal granted his request for accommodation.
In light of the continuing deficiencies reflected in the Amended Complaint, which are particularly stark when contrasted with the evidence Ali presents that shows PayPal granted his request for accommodation, granting leave to amend would be futile. Ali's admission at oral argument that he has included all the relevant facts of which he is currently aware in the Amended Complaint further supports denying leave to amend. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's fourth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

b. Fifth Cause of Action: Retaliation
Ali alleges that PayPal violated the FEHA by retaliating against him for seeking a medical accommodation. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 144-54. A prima facie case for retaliation under either Title VII or the FEHA requires a plaintiff to show that (1) she was engaged in a protected [*24]  activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064 (9th Cir. 2002) (Title VII); Miller v. Dep't of Corr., 36 Cal. 4th 446, 472, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77 (Cal. 2005) (FEHA). PayPal argues that Ali's Amended Complaint fails to plead facts to support his claim that PayPal terminated his employment in retaliation for either his lawsuits against eBay and Gilead or his request for accommodation. ECF 33 at 16-17.
First, the Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for retaliation based on Ali's then-pending lawsuits against eBay and Gilead. Most significantly, Ali fails to allege whether the persons responsible for his termination learned of his litigation against eBay. This absence alone condemns Ali's claim for retaliation. Further, what allegations Ali does make are purely speculative, not factual. Ali alleges that he met two individuals "who had worked with [the] eBay IT Team" and asked Ali which team he had worked on at eBay. ECF 30 at ¶ 26. Ali alleges that because the two individuals "acknowledged that they knew the eBay GRC team," they knew of his lawsuit against eBay. Id. Ali fails to identify the names of the individuals, their roles with PayPal, how or why they would [*25]  know of Ali's lawsuit or their relationship to the decision to terminate Ali's employment. Without such facts, Ali's allegations on this subject are mere supposition and utterly fail to provide a causal link between his termination and his lawsuit against eBay. See Williams v. L.A. Unified Sch. Dist., No. CV 10-01417 ODW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126338, 2010 WL 4794943, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2010) (dismissing a retaliation claim where the plaintiff "provided nothing to assist th[e] Court in determining there was a causal link"). As for his litigation with Gilead, Ali offers neither facts nor speculation as to any causal link between that lawsuit and his termination from PayPal. Accordingly, Ali's allegations regarding retaliation for his suits against eBay and Gilead are purely conclusory and insufficient to support a claim for retaliation.
Second, as noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), Ali's Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for disability discrimination because the evidence he attaches to his Amended Complaint shows that PayPal granted his request for accommodation. Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 17-18. Ali bases his retaliation claim on similar conclusory allegations that PayPal denied his request for accommodation and discriminated against him based on his [*26]  disabilities. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 146-49. As result, Ali's Amended Complaint also fails to state a claim for retaliation.
The Court previously granted Ali the opportunity to plead additional allegations regarding his claims based on disability discrimination and his pending litigations. ECF 25 at 9-11, 14-15. Given Ali's failure to provide such allegations, combined with his Ali's admission at oral argument that he has included all the relevant facts he knows in the Amended Complaint, granting further leave to amend would be futile. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's fifth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

c. Sixth Cause of Action: Failure to Accommodate
Ali alleges that PayPal denied his request for a reasonable accommodation in violation of the FEHA. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 155-66. To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the FEHA, Ali must show that (1) he suffers from a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) PayPal failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). As noted in the Court's analysis of Ali's ADA discrimination claim (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), Ali fails to allege sufficient facts to show that he is a qualified individual. [*27]  Further, the emails Ali attaches to his Amended Complaint show that PayPal granted his request for accommodation. Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 17-18. Accordingly, Ali fails to state a claim for a failure to accommodate.
As the Court noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), granting further leave to amend would be futile. The Court therefore DISMISSES Ali's sixth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

d. Seventh Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Ali's seventh cause of action seeks to hold PayPal liable for IIED. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 167-76. PayPal argues that the Workers' Compensation Act preempts Ali's IIED claim. ECF 33 at 17-18. The Workers' Compensation Act and Workers' Compensation Appeals Board provide "the exclusive remedy" for employees against employer "misconduct" arising from "actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, promotions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances." Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Prot. Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 160, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (1987). This may include emotional distress claims. Id. However, at least two exceptions exist to this preemption rule, which allow an employee to bring a claim outside of the workers' compensation system when the employer's conduct: [*28]  (1) "contravenes fundamental public policy" or (2) "exceeds the risks inherent in the employment relationship." Miklosy v. Regents of Univ. of California, 44 Cal. 4th 876, 902, 80 Cal. Rptr. 3d 690, 188 P.3d 629 (2008) (quoting Livitsanos v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 4th 744, 754, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 808, 828 P.2d 1195 (1992)); see also Estrada v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 16-CV-04091-LB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140089, 2016 WL 5846977, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 2016). Based on the second exception, courts have also recognized that discrimination or discriminatory acts may not fall within the scope of a normal employment relationship. See Fretland v. Cty. of Humboldt, 69 Cal. App. 4th 1478, 1492, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 359 (1999). Here, Ali fails to plead a discrimination claim, and thus, he fails to establish the applicability of an exception to the preemption rule.
PayPal also argues that Ali fails to plead sufficient facts to state an IIED claim, and in particular, that Ali fails to plead that PayPal engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct. ECF 33 at 18. Under California law, an IIED claim has three elements: "(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct." Tekle v. United States, 511 F.3d 839, 855 (9th Cir. 2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Ali bases his IIED claim on PayPal's alleged failure to accommodate [*29]  and to start an interactive process. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 170-71. As noted in the Court's analysis of Ali's ADA discrimination claim (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), the emails Ali attaches to his Amended Complaint show that PayPal granted his request for accommodation. Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 17-18. PayPal's granting of Ali's request of accommodation likewise precludes Ali from stating a claim for IIED based on a failure to accommodate and to start an interactive process. See Section IV(B)(2)(c), supra; Section IV(B)(2)(f), infra.
As the Court noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), granting further leave to amend would be futile. The Court thus DISMISSES Ali's seventh cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

e. Eighth Cause of Action: Wrongful Termination
Ali's eighth cause of action alleges that PayPal wrongfully terminated his employment because of (1) Ali's disabilities, which he disclosed in his request for accommodation, and (2) Ali's lawsuits against eBay and Gilead. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 177-86.
"[E]mployment relationships in California are ordinarily 'at will,' meaning that an employer can discharge an employee for any reason." Freund v. Nycomed Amersham, 347 F.3d 752, 758 (9th Cir. 2003). This rule is subject to an exception, carved out by the California Supreme Court [*30]  in Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980), which "recgoniz[es] a tort cause of action for wrongful terminations that violate public policy." Freund, 347 F.3d at 758. A prima facie case for wrongful termination requires that a plaintiff show (1) an employer-employee relationship; (2) that the termination of her employment violated public policy; (3) the termination of her employment was a legal cause of her damages; and (4) the nature and the extent of her damages. Ryan v. Sandia Corp., No. C 15-4102 CRB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56862, 2016 WL 1697946, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 28, 2016) (citing Holmes v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1427, n.8, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (1993)); But see Saba v. Unisys Corp., 114 F. Supp. 3d 974, 986 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (stating that a prima facie case requires showing "that (i) [the plaintiff] engaged in a protected activity; (ii) the employer subjected him to an adverse employment action; and (iii) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action") aff'd, 669 F. App'x 372 (9th Cir. 2016).
At a more general level, a wrongful termination claim requires a plaintiff to "establish the existence of a public policy and a nexus between the public policy and an employee's termination." Hollie v. Concentra Health Servs., No. C 10-5197 PJH, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40203, 2012 WL 993522, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2012) (citing Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal. 4th 1238, 1258-59, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994)). Therefore, to support a claim, a plaintiff must identify a public policy that is "(1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) 'public' in [*31]  the sense that it 'inures to the benefit of the public' rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental." City of Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1159, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Ali's Amended Complaint alleges that PayPal wrongfully terminated his employment in response to (1) his disability and request for accommodation and (2) his litigation against eBay and Gilead. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 179-84. Although "disability discrimination can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim," Moorpark, 18 Cal. 4th at 1161, Ali fails to plead sufficient facts to establish a plausible claim of disability discrimination (see Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra). Ali similarly fails to plead sufficient facts regarding his pending litigation theory. For example, he fails to identify the individual who disclosed his pending litigation against eBay and Gilead to PayPal or identify the PayPal management members that he believes learned of his litigation. ECF 30 at ¶ 26. He also does not allege whether these same individuals were involved in the decision to terminate his employment. This absence of facts renders Ali's allegations purely conclusory and insufficient [*32]  to support a plausible inference that a nexus exists between his litigation with eBay and Gilead and the termination of his employment at PayPal. Accordingly, Ali fails to state a claim for wrongful termination.
As the Court outlined above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), (b), supra), granting Ali further leave to amend would be futile. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's eighth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

f. Ninth Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
The Amended Complaint alleges that PayPal failed to engage in an interactive process after receiving his request for accommodation. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 187-193. The FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). Ali bases his claim on PayPal's failure to grant his request for accommodation. As discussed above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), the evidence Ali attaches to his Amended Complaint shows that PayPal granted his request for accommodation. [*33]  Ex. B, ECF 30-1 at 17-18. As result, Ali's Amended Complaint also fails to state a claim for failure to engage in an interactive process.
The Court noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), (c) supra) that granting further leave to amend his disability discrimination and failure to accommodate claims would be futile. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's ninth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

g. Tenth Cause of Action: Failure to Prevent Retaliation
Ali bases his tenth cause of action on PayPal's alleged failure to stop retaliation. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 195-205. PayPal argues that Ali fails to identify any law that supports a claim a for a failure to stop retaliation. ECF 33 at 20. Indeed, the statute Ali cites, California Government Code § 12946, refers to the retention of records by housing accommodations owners.
Given Ali's pro se status, questionable though it may be, the Court interprets his claim as one for failure to prevent retaliation under California Government Code § 12940(k). See United States ex rel. Cady v. EMD Serono, Inc., No. CV 07-08382 ABC (PLAx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153110, 2010 WL 11579018, at *4-5 (C.D. Cal. May 28, 2010) (holding that allegations regarding a failure to prevent retaliation may state a claim for failure to prevent discrimination under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k)). Nevertheless, the Court determined above (Section IV(B)(2)(b), supra) that Ali fails to state [*34]  a claim for retaliation. Accordingly, Ali's claim for failure to prevent retaliation necessarily fails as well.
As the Court noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(b), supra), granting Ali further leave to amend his retaliation claim would be futile. The Court thus DISMISSES Ali's tenth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

h. Eleventh Cause of Action: Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Relationships
For his eleventh cause of action, Ali brings an intentional interference with prospective economic relationships claim. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 206-21. A claim for intentional interference with prospective economic relationships requires a plaintiff to plead (1) the existence of a specific economic relationship between herself and third parties that may economically benefit her; (2) the defendant's knowledge of that relationship; (3) the defendant's intentional acts designed to disrupt the relationship; (4) actual disruption; and (5) damages. Rickards v. Canine Eye Registration Found., Inc., 704 F.2d 1449, 1456 (9th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted).
PayPal contends that Ali's directs his allegations at Robert Half—not PayPal. ECF 33 at 20-21. A review of the Amended Complaint confirms this. Ali alleges that "Robert Half intentionally, knowingly and willfully misrepresented" the duration [*35]  and other details regarding his contract with PayPal. ECF 30 at ¶ 209. Ali further alleges that "he turned down [other employment] offers in reliance on what Robert Half stated." Id. at ¶ 212. The Amended Complaint does not name Robert Half as a defendant, and to the extent that Ali bases his claim for intentional interference with prospective economic relationships on Robert Half's actions, Ali fails to state claim against PayPal.2
Further, Ali did not oppose PayPal's motion to dismiss this claim in his opposition brief. See ECF 34. Similarly, at oral argument, Ali offered no argument or additional facts to support granting leave to amend this claim. This absence of opposition further supports PayPal's argument that this claim was intended solely for Robert Half. See Homsy v. Bank of Am., N.A., No. C 13-01608 LB, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80130, 2013 WL 2422781, at *5 (N.D. Cal. June 3, 2013) ("In instances where a plaintiff simply fails to address a particular claim in its opposition to a motion to dismiss that claim, courts generally dismiss it with prejudice.").
Finally, nowhere in the Amended Complaint does Ali allege a single fact to which he arguably could point as supportive of a claim against PayPal for intentional interference with prospective economic relationships. [*36]  This is Ali's second complaint, and it is devoid of even one of the following facts: (1) a specific economic relationship between Ali and third parties that would benefit Ali; (2) PayPal's knowledge of such a relationship; (3) intentional acts by PayPal to disrupt such a relationship (to the contrary, the evidence Ali has put before the Court is of PayPal's uncontroverted efforts to accommodate his request for a permanent place to work at PayPal); (4) actual disruption of such a relationship; or (5) damages arising from such disruption.
Ali does not oppose PayPal's attack on his eleventh cause of action, and the Amended Complaint lacks any facts that could be read as supporting this claim against PayPal. As a result, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic relationships. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's eleventh cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

i. Twelfth Claim: Failure to Prevent Discrimination
Ali's twelfth cause of action alleges that PayPal failed to prevent discrimination against him based on his disability and lawsuits against eBay and Gilead. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 222-33. The FEHA makes it an unlawful "[f]or an employer . [*37]  . . to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). As noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra), Ali's Amended Complaint fails to state claim for disability discrimination or retaliation. The Amended Complaint therefore also fails to state a claim for failure to prevent discrimination.
The Court noted above (Section IV(B)(2)(a), supra) that granting further leave to amend would be futile. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES Ali's twelfth cause of action WITH PREJUDICE.

j. Thirteen Claim: Declaratory Relief
Ali's thirteenth cause of action sets forth a request for declaratory relief. ECF 30 at ¶¶ 234-37. A claim for declaratory relief does not provide a standalone cause of action and it "will not create a cause of action that does not exist." City of Cotati v. Cashman, 29 Cal. 4th 69, 80, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 519, 52 P.3d 695 (2002). Accordingly, to the extent that Ali pleads these allegations as a separate cause of action, the Court DISMISSES that claim WITH PREJUDICE.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court GRANTS PayPal's motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint WITH PREJUDICE.
On PayPal's other motions, the Court ORDERS as follows:
• The Court GRANTS PayPal's request for judicial notice of Exs. 1-5 (ECF [*38]  33-1).
• The Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE PayPal's request for judicial notice of Ex. 6 (id.).
SO ORDERED.
