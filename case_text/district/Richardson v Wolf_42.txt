Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
John G. Richardson ("Plaintiff") raises claims of discrimination, hostile work environment, retaliation, violation of due process, failure to consider efficiency of service, and failure to reemploy under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act ("Rehabilitation Act"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a) of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 7513(b)(1), and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act ("USERRA") against employer, Chad Wolf, the former Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("Defendant"). United States District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan referred this matter to a magistrate judge for full case management, including the preparation of a Report and Recommendation on dispositive motions pursuant to Local Civil Rule 72.3. See Minute Order, Oct. 13, 2020. Defendant moves for summary judgment on all counts. See ECF No. 41 ("Def.'s MSJ"). The undersigned recommends that the Court GRANT Defendant's [*2]  Motion for Summary Judgment under Rule 56(a) for each claim.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Factual Background
Plaintiff began his career with the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") as a Senior Operations Analysis Specialist ("SOAS") within Customs and Border Patrol ("CBP"), Office of Internal Affairs ("IA"), Integrity Programs Division ("IPD"), in September 2008. See ECF No. 47-4 ("Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts") ¶ 1. In 2010, Plaintiff was deployed to Africa with the United States Navy, where he sustained injuries that manifested in chronic lower back pain with associated weakness and numbness in his leg, and pain radiating to his right lower extremity. See ECF No. 47-31 ("PEX Z"). Plaintiff's injuries limited him from prolonged sitting or standing and reduced his ability to concentrate. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 3.
On September 18, 2012, Plaintiff returned to DHS in the same position he held prior to deployment. See ECF No. 26 ("Pl.'s Am. Compl.") ¶ 10. Plaintiff's first-line supervisor was Mr. Ryan Lid, his second-line supervisor was Ms. Susan Keverline, and his third-line supervisor was Mr. Jeffery Matta. See ECF No. 41-7 ("DEX B") ¶ 3.
1. Reasonable Accommodation Request
On August 3, 2012, [*3]  Plaintiff emailed Mr. Matta, estimating his return date and advising that "I am now an 80 percent disabled veteran. Also, I have some accommodations that I will be requesting necessary to support my long-term health." ECF No. 47-6 ("PEX A") at 1. Mr. Matta requested that Plaintiff forward "whatever special accommodations [Plaintiff] may require so that [management could] ensure they are addressed timely." Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 11. Plaintiff subsequently stated that he had problems with prolonged sitting and standing, that he needed to be hyper-vigilant about his physical fitness, and that he did not want to return to IPD. See ECF No. 41-9 ("DEX D").
Mr. Matta directed Plaintiff to "identify the component and specific job [Plaintiff was] interested in and [Mr. Matta would] do everything [he could] to facilitate a reassignment." ECF No. 47-12 ("PEX G") at 1. Plaintiff then updated his return date and provided his resume "in case it provides helpful in placing [Plaintiff] within CBP." See ECF No. 41-10 ("DEX D-1").
On his first day back, Plaintiff was met with a celebration for his service and return. See ECF No. 47-16 ("PEX K") at 409-10. During the celebration, Plaintiff alleges [*4]  that Assistant Commissioner (AC) Mr. Tomsheck said that IPD was the best place for Plaintiff. See id. at 411:7-16. Later that day, Plaintiff met with Mr. Matta, Mr. Lid, and Ms. Keverline. See id. at 410-12. Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Matta stated "John, you're staying in IPD . . . You can go out there and tell anybody you want to tell about it, I don't care. That's your business." Id. at 411. The next day, Plaintiff reiterated his need for reassignment to Mr. Lid, who responded, "why don't you just retire[,] retire?" Id. at 414. Mr. Lid testified that he was differentiating general retirement from military retirement, which they also discussed during that conversation. See ECF No. 47-17 ("PEX L") at 271:2-15.
Shortly thereafter, IA put Plaintiff in contact with an Employment Relations ("ER") Specialist to address his accommodation request. See ECF No. 41-28 ("DEX I-3") at 2. On October 2, Plaintiff advised Mr. Christopher Smoot of the Office of Diversity and Civil Rights ("DCR") of his accommodation denial and concern about being "subjected to additional hostile treatment, harassment, and/or prohibited personnel practices." See ECF No. 47-22 ("PEX Q") at 6. Mr. Smoot met with Plaintiff [*5]  the next day to discuss his complaints. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 18.
Mr. Smoot believed that Plaintiff did not wish to enter the DCR reasonable accommodation or EEO complaint process, because Plaintiff instead was focused on filing an external complaint. See ECF No. 47-11 ("PEX F") at 118:17-22. Plaintiff agrees that he declined to enter the EEO process, but disputes that he refused to move forward with his accommodation request. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶¶ 18-19.
In late October, Plaintiff informed DCR of his intent to file an EEO complaint, directing subsequent communication be made to his attorney. See ECF No. 47-30 ("PEX Y"). Two days later, Mr. Matta requested medical documentation from Plaintiff's physician to determine Plaintiff's entitlement for accommodation. See ECF No. 41-14 ("DEX G-1").
Plaintiff's physician, Dr. MariaPaz Babcock, recommended the following: (1) reassignment to a position that was not predominantly sedentary; (2) use of leave for continued rehabilitation; and (3) access to gym facilities, with reassignment to the Reagan building as one solution to provide facility access. See PEX Z at 2-3. Dr. Babcock opined that "with reasonable accommodations, [*6]  [Plaintiff] can work for the Agency in a productive capacity, but that without accommodations, [Plaintiff's] health will quickly decline." PEX Z at 2.
Mr. Smoot then contacted the Job Accommodation Network ("JAN") to obtain technical advice and guidance on accommodating Plaintiff.1 See ECF No. 41-17 ("DEX-G-4"). JAN made recommendations for a hypothetical "Contract Specialist" with Plaintiff's medical conditions. See id. JAN suggested: a reduction or elimination of physical exertion and workplace stress; scheduling periodic rest breaks away from the workstation; allowing a flexible work schedule and flexible use of leave time; allowing work from home; implementing an ergonomic workstation design; providing a scooter or other mobility aid if walking cannot be reduced; providing a height adjustable desk and ergonomic chair; moving workstation close to common use office equipment; providing low task chair and rolling safety ladder; and providing a cart to move files, mail, and supplies. See DEX G-4.
In November 2012, Mr. Smoot submitted an accommodation request relaying Plaintiff's request for reassignment to a non-sedentary position outside of IA. See DEX G-5 at 2. Mr. Matta denied this [*7]  request, stating that reassignment "is the accommodation of last resort and is implemented only when no other accommodation has proved effective." See ECF No. 41-19 ("DEX G-6") at 3. Instead, Mr. Matta offered: (1) the ability to take frequent breaks within the building of up to 15 minutes without supervisory approval; (2) the ability to access any team meeting room or empty office space during breaks if Plaintiff needed to stretch or rest in private; (3) the ability to take longer breaks or breaks outside the building, as long as Plaintiff advised management of the break in advance and of his approximate return time; (4) the ability to adjust Plaintiff's arrival or departure schedule in order to use the gym facilities at the Agency's offices in the Reagan Building so long as he worked his eight-hour shift during IPD's core business hours of 7:00 am to 5:00 pm; (5) the ability to have Plaintiff's work station evaluated by a specialist in ergonomic workplaces; and (6) guaranteed approval of leave for all prescribed rehabilitation appointments for the next six months. See id. at 3-4. The letter invited Plaintiff to seek reconsideration of his request and to modify these accommodations [*8]  if they proved ineffective. See id.
While Plaintiff had already taken stretch-breaks during the workday, he did not try any of the other accommodations Defendant offered. See ECF No. 41-6 ("DEX A") at 43:8-44:19. Plaintiff requested reconsideration and asked to telework or be transferred internally while IA processed his request. See ECF No. 41-20 ("DEX G-7") at 3. Plaintiff acknowledged that reassignment could require him to reduce his pay grade and expressed his willingness to do so. See id.
Dr. Babcock provided a supplemental letter reiterating Plaintiff's request for reassignment to a position where the primary duties were active. See ECF No. 41-21 ("DEX G-8"). However, Dr. Babcock was unaware of Defendant's offered accommodations at the time she wrote this letter. See ECF No. 41-25 ("DEX H") at 32:9-12. In later testimony, Dr. Babcock opined that each of the accommodations offered by Defendant would have been beneficial to Plaintiff in continuing to perform in his sedentary position. See id. at 32-34:9. Dr. Babcock stated that she would have "been very pleased with those accommodations if [she] had known about them." Id. at 34:8-9.
December 5, 2012 was Plaintiff's last day in the [*9]  office. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 88. That month, Mr. Matta became aware of an available position in the Security Management Department ("SMD") in the Reagan Building. See ECF No. 47-41 ("PEX JJ"). Mr. Matta examined the duties of the position and determined that they were primarily sedentary. See ECF No. 47-7 ("PEX B") at 104:13-105:15, 213:7-20. As such, Defendant did not offer this position to Plaintiff. See id. In January 2013, Defendant granted Plaintiff's reconsideration request and initiated a search for non-sedentary vacancies. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 34.
Defendant conducted the first search in March 2013. See ECF No. 41-12 ("DEX E-1") at ¶ 17. The search for positions equivalent to Plaintiff's grade or one level lower did not yield any non-sedentary vacancies for which Plaintiff was qualified. See PEX J at 3. Defendant identified two positions in Baltimore but did not offer them because Baltimore was outside the local commuting area. See ECF No. 47-43 ("PEX LL") at 3.
Defendant then performed a DHS-wide job search for local, vacant, funded, non-sedentary positions. See DEX E-1 ¶ 17. This search also did not yield any qualifying positions. See id. On [*10]  May 28, 2013, Defendant advised Plaintiff by letter, that no vacant, local, funded, non-sedentary positions were available. See ECF No. 41-24 ("DEX G-11") at 3. The letter instructed Plaintiff to contact Defendant if he wished to have the job search expanded outside the D.C. commuting area, reemphasized Defendant's willingness to implement the six November accommodations, and noted that failure to respond would constitute an end to the accommodation process. See id. Plaintiff did not respond to this letter. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 41; see ECF No. 47 ("Pl.'s Opp'n") at 24.
2. Adverse Encounters & Financial Harassment
Plaintiff was instructed at various points throughout his time in office to use his supervisory chain of command for work-related questions. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶¶ 75-76. On September 24, 2012, Plaintiff was erroneously notified that he owed $1,800.42 for unpaid health benefits. See ECF No. 41-33 ("DEX K-1") at 2. Plaintiff then began receiving erroneous bills on a weekly basis. In early October, Defendant informed Plaintiff that it resolved this error. See DEX K-1 at 6. Plaintiff also informed Defendant of 40 hours missing from his paycheck [*11]  and requested an audit of his pay and leave in October and December. See ECF No. 41-35 ("DEX L") at 13. Defendant conducted two audits for various pay periods and forwarded the results to Plaintiff. See id. at 8. Defendant ultimately paid Plaintiff for this missing time. See DEX L at 11; DEX K-1 at 8.
In late October 2012, Plaintiff's supervisors emailed him to ask about his whereabouts after seeing Plaintiff leave work early. See ECF No. 47-27 ("PEX V") at 2-3. Plaintiff responded that he had previously notified his supervisors and stated that his pain was unbearable. See id.
3. EAP Referral & Do Not Admit Notice
In November 2012, Mr. Matta advised an ER Specialist of Mr. Matta and Ms. Keverline's concerns about Plaintiff. See ECF No. 41-37 ("DEX N") at 2. These observations noted that Plaintiff appeared increasingly frustrated about his perceived mistreatment at the hands of management, that Plaintiff was becoming more withdrawn, and that Plaintiff had created tension in the office. See id. at 4-6. The specialist recommended referring Plaintiff to the Employee Assistance Program ("EAP"). See id. at 2. When Mr. Matta informed Plaintiff of the EAP referral, Plaintiff refused to engage [*12]  and left the room. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 79.
In January 2013, Plaintiff forwarded an email to Mr. Lid expressing frustration about the effects of his leave without pay ("LWOP") status on his family and career. Plaintiff stated that he belonged to two high-risk categories for suicide—service member and member of law enforcement—and noted that he was not operating under optimal conditions. See ECF No. 41-38 ("DEX O") at 7-8. Defendant contacted Plaintiff about the alarming implications of these statements regarding suicide. See id. at 4. Plaintiff responded that he was not a suicide risk, but that he was raising the issue for those who would follow in his footsteps at the Agency. See id.
Between December 2012 and June 2013, Defendant placed Plaintiff on "Do Not Admit" ("DNA") status and issued a notice featuring Plaintiff's picture to security personnel. See ECF No. 41-36 ("DEX M").2
4. Plaintiff's Termination
On November 1, 2012, Plaintiff invoked his Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") rights, which allowed him to take LWOP for up to twelve administrative work weeks during a twelve-month period. See ECF No. 41-39 ("DEX P") at 2-3. Plaintiff was on approved FMLA leave from December [*13]  6, 2012 to April 11, 2013. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 91. Plaintiff did not return to the office after taking FMLA leave. See DEX A 46:6-8. On September 16, 2013, the Agency proposed Plaintiff's removal for excessive absenteeism. See ECF No. 41-40 ("DEX P-1"). At that time, Plaintiff had used "69.5 hours of annual leave, 165 hours of sick leave, and 1016 hours of [LWOP] . . . outside of the hours . . . invoked under [FMLA]." Id. at 2. On March 8, 2014, Mr. Joseph Guadiano, the deciding official, issued Plaintiff's removal. See ECF No. 41-42 ("DEX P-3").
On April 7, 2014, Plaintiff filed an appeal with the United States Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"), challenging his removal. See ECF No. 41-43 ("DEX Q") at 2. Plaintiff alleged disability discrimination, retaliation for his EEO activity, violation of his due process rights, denial of reemployment under USERRA, and discrimination based on his military service. See id. at 2-3. On September 22, 2017, the MSPB Administrative Judge ("AJ") affirmed the removal action and denied corrective action under USERRA claims. See id. at 3. On August 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed the current proceeding.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
To succeed on a [*14]  motion for summary judgment, the moving party must "show [] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is material if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law," and a dispute is genuine only if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d 689, 692, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)).
The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must identify "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).
In evaluating motions for summary judgment, the Court must review all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in the nonmoving party's favor. See Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 655-56, 134 S. Ct. 1861, 188 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2014) (per curiam). In doing so, the Court must not assess credibility or weigh the evidence. Barnett v. PA Consulting Grp., Inc., 715 F.3d 354, 358, 404 U.S. App. D.C. 439 (D.C. Cir. 2013). However, the nonmoving party must provide more than mere unsupported allegations, and a genuine issue for trial must be supported by affidavits, declarations, or other competent evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). If the nonmoving party's evidence is "merely colorable" [*15]  or "not significantly probative," summary judgment may be granted. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249-50. Summary judgment is most likely when the nonmoving party's claim is supported solely by self-serving, conclusory statements. Lindsey v. Rice, 524 F. Supp. 2d 55, 60 (D.D.C. 2007).

III. ANALYSIS
A. Failure to Accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
To prevail on a failure to accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (i) he has a qualified disability under the Act; (ii) his employer had notice of his disability; and (iii) he was denied a request for a reasonable accommodation. See Ward v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 24, 31, 412 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Only the third element is disputed. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 11; Def.'s MSJ at 8.
Reasonable accommodations are not required when doing so would impose an "undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).3 Moreover, "an employer is not required to provide an employee that accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Aka v. Washington Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1305, 332 U.S. App. D.C. 256 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (cleaned up). However, "[i]f accommodation cannot be made in the employee's current position, the federal employer must consider the feasibility of reassigning the disabled employee to a vacant position." Norden v. Samper, 503 F. Supp. 2d 130, 145-46 (D.D.C. 2007).
To establish that an employer denied a reasonable accommodation request, [*16]  a plaintiff must show "either that the [employer] in fact ended the interactive process or that it participated in the process in bad faith." Robinson v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., No. 18-cv-2383, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21324, 2020 WL 601896, at *3 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2020) (quoting Minter v. D.C., 809 F.3d 66, 69, 420 U.S. App. D.C. 411 (D.C. Cir. 2015)). The accommodation process is "a flexible give-and-take" between employer and employee "so that together they can determine what accommodation would enable the employee to continue working." Ward, 762 F.3d at 32 (quoting EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 417 F.3d 789, 805) (7th Cir. 2005)). Courts consider whether the employer "obstructs or delays the interactive process" or "fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response," and should "isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility." Id. (quoting Sears, 417 F.3d at 805). Employers can demonstrate good faith through myriad ways, such as "meeting with the employee, . . . requesting information about the condition and limitations the employee has, asking the employee what he or she specifically wants, showing some sign of having considered the employee's request . . . and discussing available alternatives when the request is too burdensome." Woodruff v. LaHood, 777 F. Supp. 2d 33, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2011) (cleaned up).
1. Whether Plaintiff was Denied Reasonable Accommodations
"[An] employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective." Appendix E. Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation [*17]  and Undue Hardship Under The Americans With Disabilities Act, 2 Disability Discrimination Workplace Appendix E. Thus, an employer will not liable for rejecting a plaintiff's requested accommodation where it provides reasonable alternative accommodations. See Aka, 156 F.3d at 1305.
The six accommodations proposed by Defendant were reasonable and tailored to enable Plaintiff to perform his essential duties. These accommodations were consistent with the concerns raised by Plaintiff's physician, JAN, and Plaintiff himself. See Def.'s MSJ at 10; DEX G-6. First, Defendant addressed Dr. Babcock's recommendation of reassignment to a non-sedentary position by proposing an ergonomic evaluation that could result in a standing workstation in addition to Plaintiff's seated station. See Def.'s MSJ at 10; DEX G-6. Next, Defendant addressed Dr. Babcock's recommendations regarding use of leave for rehabilitation and gym access by providing six months of leave and a flexible schedule to enable gym access. See Def.'s MSJ at 11. Defendant further integrated JAN's recommendations by providing permission to take breaks of varying lengths, use of empty rooms to rest or stretch, a flexible work schedule, and an ergonomic evaluation. [*18]  See id.
By offering an ergonomic evaluation, Defendant addressed Plaintiff's concerns that prolonged sitting and staring at a computer aggravated his injury. See DEX G-2; DEX G-6. In response to Plaintiff's need for movement and stretching to manage his pain, Defendant permitted breaks and use of empty rooms to engage in such activities. See Def.'s MSJ at 11; DEX G-6. Defendant also provided Plaintiff a flexible schedule to enable his requested access to the Reagan fitness center. See DEX G-6.
Defendant's proposed accommodations were reasonable because they "[responded] to the specific concerns raised by [Plaintiff's] doctor." Senatore v. Lynch, 225 F. Supp. 3d 24, 35 (D.D.C. 2016) (granting summary judgment where the employer provided permission to record meetings, rather than hiring a note-taker as requested, which would enable the plaintiff to pay attention in meetings without the stress of missing important points, a concern noted by her physician). Because the employer's accommodation addressed the underlying concerns, it is irrelevant that it was not what Plaintiff and his physician "request[ed] or prefer[ed]." Aka, 156 F.3d at 1305; see also id.
As with here, Lynch argued that the employer's alternative accommodation may not have been effective. See Lynch, 225 F. Supp. 3d at 35. [*19]  However, the court there emphasized that the plaintiff had wrongly foreclosed any such finding by flatly rejecting the employer's accommodation. See id. Plaintiff made the same mistake here. See DEX A at 43:8-44:19. This is fatal to Plaintiff's claim. See id; see also Porter v. Jackson, 668 F. Supp. 2d 222, 235 (D.D.C. 2009) (employer met its obligation when it provided a reasonable accommodation that the employee rejected); see also Gile v. United Airlines, Inc., 95 F.3d 492, 499 (7th Cir. 1996) ("[W]hen an employee requests a transfer as reasonable accommodation and the employer offers alternative reasonable accommodation, which the employee then refuses, the employer cannot be liable for failing to reasonably accommodate the employee by not transferring him to another position.").
Undoubtedly, summary judgment is inappropriate where the employer provided an ersatz plan that failed to address the employee's medical needs. See Norden, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 156 (finding that the employer failed to reasonably accommodate when the accommodations increased the plaintiff's exposure to a chemical that exacerbated her disability and ran contrary to her physician's concerns). Plaintiff contends that the six proposed accommodations fall into this camp because Dr. Babcock characterized reassignment as "medically necessary," and Plaintiff perceived [*20]  the offered accommodations as burdensome. See ECF No. 47-34 ("PEX CC"). Yet Plaintiff's argument is toothless given Dr. Babcock's lack of knowledge of the proposed accommodations at the time of her recommendation and by her later testimony that she would have "been very pleased with those accommodations." DEX H at 33:24-34:9. Plaintiff could not demonstrate that Dr. Babcock would have testified differently about the proposed accommodations when they were made. See Porter, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 234 (granting summary judgment when the plaintiff failed to produce evidence that the offered accommodation would not enable her to perform her job).
Defendant genuinely integrated Plaintiff's and Dr. Babcock's medical concerns into the proposed accommodations, unlike in Norden and LaHood. See DEX G-6; Norden, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 156; LaHood, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 44. In fact, like in Lynch, Defendant offered to make modifications and reevaluate if the accommodations did not prove effective. See 225 F. Supp. 3d at 35; DEX G-6. Although Defendant "did not ultimately implement every accommodation requested by [Plaintiff], it did make reasonable accommodations, which is all the law requires it to do." Doak v. Johnson, 19 F. Supp. 3d 259, 275 (D.D.C. 2014).
2. Whether Plaintiff was Entitled to Reassignment or Teleworking
"[S]imply because an accommodation[, such as reassignment [*21]  or teleworking,] preferred by an employee is available, an employer need not offer that particular accommodation so long as a reasonable alternative is provided." Pantazes v. Jackson, 366 F. Supp. 2d 57, 69 (D.D.C 2005). A reasonable accommodation need only allow "the disabled employee [to] perform the essential functions of her position." Porter v. Jackson, 410 F. App'x 348, 349 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (upholding summary judgment in favor of employer). Yet Plaintiff incorrectly argues that the "central question is not the appropriateness of an accommodation [provided by the defendant], but rather the reasonableness of the requested accommodation." Pl.'s Opp'n at 7 (citing Lenkiewicz v. Castro, No. 13-cv-261, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204672, 2015 WL 13660482, at *3 (D.D.C. Jan. 20, 2015)). Plaintiff's reliance on Lenkiewicz and Langon v. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. for this proposition is misplaced. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 7, 13-14.4
Lenkiewicz considered the admissibility of evidence during a motion in limine. In fact, the court later found that a genuine issue as to the reasonableness of the defendant's proposed accommodations precluded summary judgment. Lenkiewicz v. Castro, 146 F. Supp. 3d 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2015). No such factual question exists here.
Plaintiff then overreads Langon in asserting that employers must grant telework requests unless the employer shows that the essential duties of the position must be performed in the office.  [*22] See Pl.'s Opp'n at 14 (citing 959 F.2d 1053, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 49 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). Like Porter, see infra, Langon held that "the agency did not have to provide every accommodation the handicapped employee proposed," rather only what was "necessary to enable [the employee] to perform his essential functions." 959 F.2d 1053, 1057, 295 U.S. App. D.C. 49 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (quotation omitted). Summary judgment was inappropriate in Langon because Langon's performance floundered and eventually ceased altogether even after Langon took advantage of the employer's accommodations. See id. at 1059. The necessity of teleworking was also bolstered by Langon's physician's statements. See id. Here, Plaintiff failed to attempt Defendant's accommodations, which his doctor subsequently supported.
3. Whether Defendant was Responsible for the Breakdown in the Interactive Accommodation Process
Even if an employee was not "reasonably accommodated, [an employer] will be liable only if it bears responsibility for the breakdown of the interactive process." Alston, 571 F. Supp. 2d at 86 (quoting Sears, 417 F.3d at 797). "[C]ourts should look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary." Ward, 762 F.3d at 32 (quoting Sears, 417 F.3d at 805). An employee's rejection of an employer's [*23]  proposed reasonable accommodation is one example of bad-faith termination of the interactive process. See Lynch, 225 F. Supp. 3d at 35. On the other hand, "a delay in providing an accommodation" may demonstrate that an employer has not acted in good faith. Elzeneiny v. D.C., 125 F. Supp. 3d 18, 38 (D.D.C. 2015). Ultimately, the "failure to provide [Plaintiff] with exactly the accommodation [he] requested is not, in and of itself, evidence that the [defendant] did not engage in good faith in the interactive process." Morris v. Jackson, 994 F. Supp. 2d 38, 49 (D.D.C. 2013).
Defendant exhibited good faith through its: correspondence with Plaintiff to discern his limitations; consultation with an outside consulting firm to issue recommendations; and incorporation of Plaintiff's medical limitations into its proposed accommodations. See Morris, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 49. Moreover, Defendant granted Plaintiff's request for reconsideration despite his refusal to attempt the six accommodations offered. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 34. "Any purported breakdown in the interactive process may have been caused by [Plaintiff's] insistence on telecommuting [or reassignment], but no evidence shows it was caused by any misfeasance or lack of good faith on behalf of [Defendant]." Morris, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 49. In fact, Defendant instituted two searches for vacant non-sedentary positions, [*24]  and invited Plaintiff to request an expanded scope. See DEX G-11. Plaintiff "flatly declined" this offer. Lynch, 225 F. Supp. 3d at 35; Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 41; Pl.'s Opp'n at 24. "By taking this course of action, [Plaintiff] caused a breakdown in the process of finding an agreed-upon set of reasonable accommodations."5 Lynch, 225 F. Supp. 3d at 35.
The parties engaged in consistent, although stilted at times, communication with respect to Plaintiff's needs. See ECF No. 51 ("Def.'s Reply") at 4-8 (identifying exhibits that demonstrate the parties' back and forth communication). Plaintiff's complaint that "between August 3, 2012 and November 23, 2012, the Agency did not take a single proactive measure to ensure that Plaintiff's request was properly processed, much less even considered," Pl.'s Opp'n at 27, is belied by the record, which shows that Defendant engaged internally and with Plaintiff in an effort to identify appropriate accommodations. See Def.'s Reply at 4-8 (identifying relevant exhibits).6 Moreover, even if Plaintiff was correct, a 112-day delay hardly amounts to a "breakdown of the interactive process." Ward, 762 F.3d at 34. Indeed, a breakdown based on delay occurs mainly when an employer "ignore[s] . . . completely" [*25]  all accommodation communications from an employee for a substantial period of time. See Lenkiewicz, 146 F. Supp. 3d at 55 (denying summary judgment where the defendant completely ignored plaintiff's accommodation emails for "several months").
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to facilitate reassignment from April 2013 until Plaintiff's termination in March 2014. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 31. But Plaintiff overextends the scope of Defendant's burden. While the duty to accommodate is "not exhausted by one effort," Norden, 503 F. Supp. 2d at 145, a defendant is not obligated to continue reaching out when the plaintiff has withdrawn himself from the process. See Scarborough v. Natsios, 190 F. Supp. 2d 5, 26-27 (D.D.C. 2002). Plaintiff's failure to respond to Defendant's invitation for an expanded search makes "clear that [P]laintiff, not [D]efendant, failed to engage in the interactive process that he now invokes." Id.
B. Hostile Work Environment Claim under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act
To prevail on a hostile work environment claim under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, "a plaintiff must show that his employer subjected him to discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions [*26]  of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1201, 384 U.S. App. D.C. 85 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). To determine if an employee was subjected to "severe and pervasive" conduct, "the court looks to the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee's work performance." Id. The conduct must be objectively offensive to "a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position," not merely subjectively offensive to the plaintiff. Casey v. Mabus, 878 F. Supp. 2d 175, 188 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998)). Moreover, that discrimination must be based on the plaintiff's membership in a protected class. See Mason v. Geithner, 811 F. Supp. 2d 128, 179-80 (D.D.C. 2011).
Plaintiff alleges that his supervisors engaged in the following seven actions which created a hostile environment7 because of his disability: (1) misrepresented that reassignment was infeasible; (2) attempted to intimidate Plaintiff into retirement; (3) misrepresented that Plaintiff did not want to engage in the interactive process; (4) concocted false allegations that Plaintiff caused employees to fear for their safety; (5) asked Plaintiff to account for his whereabouts after approving his leave request; (6) issued a Do Not Admit ("DNA") notice for Plaintiff; [*27]  and (7) financially harassed Plaintiff. See Pl.'s Opp'n 35-40.8
1. Whether Defendant's Conduct was Severe or Pervasive
The incidents alleged by Plaintiff, taken individually or collectively, fall far short of the severity or pervasiveness required to support a hostile work environment claim.9 See Badibanga v. Howard Univ. Hosp., 679 F. Supp. 2d 99, 104 (D.D.C. 2010) (dismissing claim where the plaintiff was placed on administrative leave due to a false accusation, his accent was criticized, his supervisor told him he would not hire other Africans, and he was told he could be easily replaced with an American); see also Leavitt, 407 F.3d at 416-17 (statements by employees over six-month period that the plaintiff should "go back where she came from," separate acts of yelling, and hostility did not rise to level of severity necessary to find hostile work environment). "The Supreme Court has been clear that Title VII does not establish a 'general civility code for the American workplace.'" Id. at 416 (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80).
The conduct in question amounts to "ordinary tribulations of the workplace" insufficient to create a hostile work environment. Buie v. Berrien, 85 F. Supp. 3d 161, 180 (D.D.C. 2015). Although Mr. Lid's comment about retirement, Defendant's questioning of Plaintiff's whereabouts, and misunderstandings throughout the accommodation [*28]  process may have frustrated Plaintiff, "mild slights in no way approach the bar set for [hostile work environment claims]; if they did, few workplaces would be entirely immune." Adams v. D.C., 50 F. Supp. 3d 47, 53 (D.D.C. 2014). Plaintiff's allegations arising out of rumors related to office safety are also "undercut by the legitimate reasons," documented in the record, for Defendant's concern. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d at 1201; see DEX N; see DEX O. In sum, Plaintiff failed to demonstrate conduct that was so "extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment." George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405, 416, 366 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998)).
2. Whether Defendant's Conduct was Causally Related to Plaintiff's Disability
Plaintiff further failed to respond to Defendant's argument that the alleged actions were unrelated to Plaintiff's disability. See Def.'s Reply at 12. Where "a party files an opposition to a motion and therein addresses only some of the movant's arguments, the court may treat the unaddressed arguments as conceded." Brennan, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 59 (quoting Wannall v. Honeywell, Inc., 775 F.3d 425, 428, 413 U.S. App. D.C. 384 (D.C. Cir. 2014)). Even outside of this pleading failure, there is insufficient evidence to support a claim for causality. See Tobey v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 480 F. Supp. 3d 155, 173-74 (D.D.C. 2020) (finding no hostile work environment when the plaintiff provided only conclusory statements in response to the defendant's "non-disability related justifications" for [*29]  every action).
C. Retaliation Claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
To prevail on a retaliation claim under Title VII, Plaintiff must show that: (i) he engaged in a protected activity; (ii) his employer took a materially adverse action against him; and (iii) the adverse action was causally connected to Plaintiff's engagement in the protected activity. Taylor v. Solis, 571 F.3d 1313, 1320, 387 U.S. App. D.C. 230 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Any action that "could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination" is materially adverse for a retaliation claim. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)). The action must "affect[] the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or future employment opportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm." Tyes-Williams v. Whitaker, 361 F. Supp. 3d 1, 13 (D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 902, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).
The causal component of Plaintiff's prima facie case "may be established by showing that the employer had knowledge of the employee's protected activity, and that the adverse personnel action took place shortly after that activity." Guillen-Perez v. D.C., 415 F. Supp. 3d 50, 64 (D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Mitchell v. Baldrige, 759 F.2d 80, 86, 245 U.S. App. D.C. 60 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).
When there is no direct evidence of retaliation, this claim is governed by the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If a plaintiff makes a prima facie case, "the burden [then] shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nonretaliatory [*30]  reason for its action." Durant v. D.C. Gov't, 875 F.3d 685, 697, 433 U.S. App. D.C. 143 (D.C. Cir. 2017). If the employer articulates a legitimate reason for the alleged conduct, the question becomes "whether the employee has produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the asserted non-retaliatory or non-discriminatory justification for the action is a pretext for retaliation." Gordon v. Duke, 279 F. Supp. 3d 46, 55 (D.D.C. 2017).
"[W]here an employee has suffered an adverse employment action and an employer has asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision, the district court need not—and should not—decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a prima facie case." Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494, 380 U.S. App. D.C. 283 (D.C. Cir. 2008). However, the Brady rule does not apply in every case. "When an employer challenges whether an action taken against a Plaintiff was an adverse employment action—which is an element of the prima facie case—courts should first determine whether the action was legally adverse." Webster v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 267 F. Supp. 3d 246, 258 (D.D.C. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff alleges that the following constitute materially adverse actions: (a) failing to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability; (b) placement on DNA status; and (c) termination. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 41-45.10 Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to allege materially adverse actions outside [*31]  of termination and to establish a causal connection to protected activity. See Def.'s MSJ at 22. Because Defendant challenges whether Plaintiff has made out his prima facie case, it is appropriate to determine material adversity pursuant to Webster before moving onto the non-retaliatory reasons offered. See 267 F. Supp. 3d at 258.
1. Failure to Accommodate
Because Defendant provided reasonable accommodations in an "attempt[] to facilitate" Plaintiff's successful performance in his position, no materially adverse action arose. Morris, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 50. As discussed above, Defendant offered six accommodations tailored to address Plaintiff's medical needs and to enable him to perform as an SOAS. Defendant further engaged with Plaintiff in good faith, offered reconsideration, searched for vacancies, and invited Plaintiff to continue the interactive process. "[T]he Court's conclusion that [P]laintiff's Rehabilitation Act claim fails . . . defeats [his] retaliation claim based on the same alleged denial of reasonable accommodation." Lester v. Natsios, 290 F. Supp. 2d 11, 34 (D.D.C. 2003).
Plaintiff further failed to respond to Defendant's argument that the following events were not materially adverse: (1) Plaintiff's supervisor asking about retirement; (2) Management asking for Plaintiff's [*32]  DD-214 form; (3) Plaintiff being told to use his chain of command; (4) Defendant providing requested audits to Plaintiff; and (5) Plaintiff's referral to EAP and subsequent contact. See Def.'s Reply at 20.
These instances illustrate "the kind of petty slights or minor annoyances that cannot form the basis of a retaliation claim." Bonnette v. Shinseki, 907 F. Supp. 2d 54, 71 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). These actions by Defendant entailed "no abusive language, but rather job-related constructive criticism" or concern. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d at 1199. Moreover, while Plaintiff's interactions with his supervisors may have been "unpleasant, frustrating, and inconvenient," the Court will not engage in "judicial micromanagement of business practices by second-guessing employers' decisions." Bonnette, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (quoting Kempthorne, 550 F.3d at 1197). Plaintiff has not shown that the above actions resulted in "more tangible" harm that "could affect his position, grade level, salary, or promotion opportunities." Kempthorne, 550 F.3d at 1199.
Given the subjective nature of these interactions and Plaintiff's failure to respond to Defendant's arguments, Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine dispute based on these events. See Brennan, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 59.
2. DNA Status
"The antiretaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation [*33]  that produces an injury or harm." Payne v. Salazar, 899 F. Supp. 2d 42, 55 (D.D.C. 2012). Placement on DNA status is not inherently adverse, as it may not produce an injury in some circumstances. Such could be the case here if, as Defendant argues, Plaintiff was unaware of the notice while on leave, and did not attempt to enter the premises without regard to the notice. See Def.'s MSJ at 20, 22-23. Plaintiff further failed to produce evidence of objective injury in his pleadings. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 45. However, the record demonstrates that Plaintiff alleged in the MSPB proceedings that he did not attempt to return to duty because the DNA notice was in place. See DEX Q at 37. Accordingly, a genuine dispute of fact exists as to whether Plaintiff suffered harm because of the DNA notice.
Pursuant to Brady, because there is a question as to material adversity of the DNA notice, the Court must next evaluate Defendant's proffered non-retaliatory reason for the notice to determine if it was pretextual. See 520 F.3d at 494. Defendant's legitimate rationale is presumed genuine, and Plaintiff must bring forth positive evidence that provides a basis for a reasonable jury to find retaliatory animus. See Woodruff v. Peters, 482 F.3d 521, 529-30, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 429 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The law requires more than showing "that a reason given for [*34]  a job action is not just, fair, or sensible. [Plaintiff] must show that the explanation given is a phony reason." Bonnette, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 74 (quoting Sewell v. Chao, 532 F. Supp. 2d 126, 138 (D.D.C. 2008)).
Defendant's proffered reason for the DNA placement—that Plaintiff's supervisors believed that he posed a risk to other employees—is supported by recorded concerns dating back to October 2012. See Def.'s Reply at 17. At that time, Ms. Keverline expressed concern "about the stress level in the office. [She was] told that [Plaintiff] has approached several employees about his situation and perceived mistreatment and they have refused to engage him about it. As a result, [Plaintiff] has further withdrawn and employees are avoiding him." DEX N at 4.
Plaintiff's supervisors had also emailed an Employee Relations ("ER") Specialist, detailing these concerns. See id. at 2. Mr. Matta informed the ER Specialist that Plaintiff's "email responses and actions are escalating in a way that is creating anxiety and a climate of distrust in the workplace. . . I believe [Plaintiff] is demonstrating warning signs that are consistent with other workplace violence episodes. . . I believe [Plaintiff] could act out in a way that could place the staff at risk." Id. at 5-6. The ER Specialist [*35]  recommended Plaintiff's referral to EAP. See id. Plaintiff refused the offered assistance. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 79.
Additionally, Plaintiff expressed to his supervisors that he was part of "two groups at a high risk for suicide." DEX O at 7. Regardless of what Plaintiff said afterwards, he could not un-ring this bell. Defendant provided a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and non-retaliatory reason[] for [DNA placement.]" Bonnette, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 77. Even an employee "who engages in protected activity does not have free reign to violate norms of workplace behavior." Steele v. Carter, 192 F. Supp. 3d 151, 180 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80).
Plaintiff argues that his supervisors were not actually afraid of Plaintiff. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 38-39. However, while Plaintiff correctly notes that his supervisors testified that they did not feel physically threatened by Plaintiff, this paints an incomplete story. For example, Ms. Keverline testified consistently with her previously recorded concerns when stating that people expressed unease with Plaintiff, although no one had expressed fear of workplace violence specifically. See PEX C at 81:3-13. Mr. Lid also testified that he knew of several people's discomfort with Plaintiff, and Mr. Smoot noted Plaintiff's "agitat[ion] [*36]  with the people in his chain of command." See PEX L at 307-08:1-16; PEX F at 189:19-20. Ultimately, "where 'the employer's stated belief about the underlying facts is reasonable in light of the evidence . . . there ordinarily is no basis for permitting a jury to conclude that the employer is lying about the underlying facts,' and summary judgment is appropriate."11 Nurriddin v. Bolden, 40 F. Supp. 3d 104, 122 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting Brady, 520 F.3d at 495).
In finding that Plaintiff failed to prove that Defendant's proffered reason for the DNA notice was pretextual, the Court does not find that Plaintiff was in fact a danger to the workplace. The Court looks not to "the correctness or desirability of the reasons offered but whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers." Peters, 482 F. 3d at 531 (quoting Fischbach v. D.C. Dep't of Corrections, 86 F.3d 1180, 1183, 318 U.S. App. D.C. 186 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). The record supports that Defendant honestly believed that Plaintiff's behavior created fear, particularly of possible "workplace violence episodes." DEX N at 6.
3. Plaintiff's Termination
Defendant concedes that Plaintiff's termination was materially adverse but contests its causal connection to Plaintiff's protected complaints and further provides a non-retaliatory reason for the action. See Def.'s MSJ at 23. Pursuant to Brady, because termination constitutes [*37]  a materially adverse act, the Court must evaluate Defendant's proffered non-retaliatory rationale. See 520 F.3d at 494.12 At this stage, Plaintiff's prima facie case falls away and the question becomes whether Plaintiff can show by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant's given rationale was pretextual. Peters, 482 F. 3d at 529-30. This avenue is unavailing for Plaintiff.
Defendant reportedly terminated Plaintiff for excessive absenteeism. See DEX P-2. At the time removal was proposed, Plaintiff had used "69.5 hours of annual leave, 165 hours of sick leave, and 1016 hours of [LWOP] . . . outside of the hours [Plaintiff had] invoked under the [FMLA]." See DEX P-1 at 2. Plaintiff accumulated another six months of absences after this accounting, before Defendant terminated Plaintiff. See id. Plaintiff concedes this accounting is correct. See Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 90. "Given Plaintiff's concession [of the underlying absences], a reasonable jury could not find that the stated reason for his termination was not the actual reason" for the action. Durant v. D.C. Gov't, 875 F. 3d 685, 699, 433 U.S. App. D.C. 143 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted). In fact, absenteeism is a classic non-retaliatory reason for termination. See Doak, 798 F.3d at 1108.
D. Due Process Claim under 5 U.S.C. §7513(b)(1) & Failure to Evaluate [*38]  Efficiency of Service
"The burden of establishing reversible error in an administrative decision . . . rests upon the petitioner." Fernandez v. Dep't of Army, 234 F.3d 553, 555 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Plaintiff charges a violation of his due process rights pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §7513(b)(1), alleging that the deciding official improperly considered factors outside of the proposal to remove Plaintiff.13 See Pl.'s Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 84-85. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to evaluate the efficiency of service factor in promulgating Plaintiff's termination. See Pl.'s Am. Compl. at ¶ 94. Plaintiff thus believes that the MSPB decision affirming Plaintiff's removal was arbitrary and capricious. See id. at ¶ 66.
"To show that the MSPB's decision is not arbitrary and capricious, [D]efendant needs only to show that the decision has a rational basis in the law." Brown, 923 F. Supp. 2d at 124 (quoting Hanna v. Herman, 121 F. Supp. 2d 113, 121 (D.D.C. 2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The AJ did not act arbitrarily and capriciously, as she applied the correct legal standard, reviewed relevant evidence, and formed a substantive rationale based on such evidence to support the finding that reversal of termination was not warranted. See DEX Q at 38-42. With respect to Plaintiff's efficiency of service claim, the AJ again considered testimonial evidence, [*39]  cited to case law, and determined that Defendant did not improperly consider Plaintiff's use of FMLA and that Plaintiff's absence did adversely affect the efficiency of service. See DEX Q at 26-28. In sum, the MSPB decisions were "in accordance with applicable law and regulations." Brown, 923 F. Supp. 2d at 128. Plaintiff further failed to respond to Defendant's argument on these claims, and accordingly does not create a genuine dispute. See Def.'s Reply at 22, 25; see Brennan, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 59.
E. USERRA Violations
Plaintiff charges USERRA violations of 38 U.S.C. § 4311, alleging discrimination based on military service, and § 4312, which obligates an employer to reemploy returning veterans, make reasonable accommodations, and provide retraining if necessary. See Pl.'s Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 89-90. A § 4312 claim does not require a finding of discriminatory intent. Jbari v. D.C., 304 F. Supp. 3d 201, 205 (D.D.C. 2018). USERRA protections "must be broadly construed in favor of its military beneficiaries." Id. at 207 (citing Vahey v. Gen. Motors Co., 985 F. Supp. 2d 51, 59 (D.D.C. 2013)).
1. Discrimination Under 38 U.S.C. § 4311
To recover under § 4311, an employee must show that his membership in the uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. See 38 U.S.C § 4311(c). When a plaintiff relies on only circumstantial evidence, a court can infer discriminatory motivation from myriad considerations, [*40]  including proximity between military service and the adverse action, inconsistency in the proffered reason for the action, expressed hostility toward other service members with knowledge of their service, or disparate treatment. Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs., Inc., 411 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir. 2005). If this showing is made, "the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating that it would have taken the same action anyway for a valid reason, without regard to the employee's military service." Potts v. Howard Univ. Hosp., 843 F. Supp. 2d 101, 104 (D.D.C. 2012). At the summary judgment stage, the plaintiff must bring forth sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer discriminatory intent. Id. at 105-6.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant terminated Plaintiff because of his past military service and used Plaintiff's service to paint him as a violent person as a basis for this removal. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 34-35. Plaintiff points only to an October 2012 email in which Mr. Tomsheck stated that "[s]ome have expressed concern for their safety and fear that [Plaintiff] has a potential for workplace violence." PEX U. This email is too thin a reed to support an inference of discrimination. It was sent roughly a year before Defendant proposed Plaintiff's removal and did not imply that military service was connected to the risk [*41]  of violence. See id. Moreover, Plaintiff presented no evidence that Mr. Tomsheck was "present at the [adverse decision] meeting," or that the he "influenced" the deciding official in making the termination decision. Tridico v. D.C., 130 F. Supp. 3d 17, 26 (D.D.C. 2015) (granting summary judgment for these reasons even though the supervisor expressed animus toward an employee based on military service).
Thus, Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. As discussed above, the record also supports Defendant's non-discriminatory reason for termination—excessive absenteeism—illustrating that the employer would have taken the adverse action regardless of Plaintiff's service.
2. Failure to Reemploy Under 32 U.S.C. §§ 4312-13
USERRA requires employers to promptly reemploy a service member in the position that they would have attained with reasonable certainty if not for the absence due to uniformed service, or a position of like seniority, status and pay. See 20 C.F.R. § 1002.191; 38 U.S.C. §§ 4312-13. This position is known as the escalator position. See id. If the employee is not qualified to perform the escalator position, the employer is required to provide reasonable accommodations to enable the employee to attempt to so qualify. See 38 U.S.C. § 4313(a)(2)(B). Only if the employee is still not qualified [*42]  after reasonable accommodations are made, must the employer reemploy the employee in the position the employee held on the date service commenced. See id.
A service member who becomes disabled during service, and who remains unqualified for their reemployment position even "after reasonable [accommodation] efforts by the employer," is entitled to "any other [equivalent] position . . . which the person is qualified to perform . . . or would become qualified." 38 U.S.C. § 4313(a)(3)(A).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated § 4313(a)(3)(A) by failing to make reasonable efforts to help him become qualified to perform the duties of vacant positions. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 32-34. Plaintiff specifically contends that Defendant's reassignment search should have included positions for which Plaintiff could have qualified with training. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 34.
But the employer's duty to search for such positions is conditional on Plaintiff remaining unqualified for his current position even after reasonable accommodations are made. See 20 C.F.R. §1002.225. By providing reasonable accommodations to reemploy Plaintiff in the position for which he was qualified—the very position that Plaintiff held prior to deployment—Defendant acted consistently with its [*43]  USERRA obligations.
As discussed above, Defendant provided six reasonable accommodations tailored to Plaintiff's needs. See DEX G-6. It is unknown whether Plaintiff would have remained unqualified with the six accommodations in place due to Plaintiff's refusal to attempt the offered accommodations. See DEX A at 43:8-44:19; Pl.'s Statement of Counterfacts ¶ 29. Plaintiff cannot allege that he remained unqualified even after reasonable accommodations were made by refusing to attempt the accommodations in question, thereby foreclosing a finding on their effectiveness.
Because Defendant satisfied its duty, Defendant's lack of knowledge regarding the different obligations between USERRA and the ADA is immaterial. See Pl.'s Opp'n at 34. When employing a veteran with a disability, USERRA goes further than the ADA in: (a) defining 'disability' more broadly; (b) requiring that accommodation be made to a specific position; and (c) when the veteran remains unqualified to perform with accommodations, requiring the employer to make reasonable efforts to help them qualify for an equivalent set of positions. See ¶ 137 Veterans With Service-Connected Disabilities, 2017 WL 10992551. These differences [*44]  do not affect this case because: (a) Plaintiff's disability is uncontested; (b) the proposed accommodations were made to the proper position; and (c) Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he remained unqualified for his position even with the accommodations offered.
