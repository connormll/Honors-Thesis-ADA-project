Opinion



PROCEEDINGS: TELEPHONIC HEARING ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [51]; and DEFENDANT STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56] [54]
Court and counsel confer. The Tentative circulated and attached hereto, is adopted as the Court's Final Ruling. The Court DENIES both motions.
A status conference is set for February 25, 2021 at 8:30 a.m. The parties are to file a joint status report by noon on February 23, 2021.

I. Background
Darren Gales ("Plaintiff") filed suit against the State of California — California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation — Ventura Youth Correctional Facility ("Defendant") on June 10, 2019, asserting three claims for relief. He has amended his allegations twice since that time, such that the operative complaint in the case is now the Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") filed June 24, 2020. See Docket No. 40. The SAC still contains three claims for relief: 1) race discrimination in [*2]  violation of Title VII; 2) harassment based on race in violation of Title VII; and 3) retaliation based on race in violation of Title VII.
The parties have now filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment, only as to liability (not damages) on his second claim for relief. See Docket No. 51. Meanwhile, at least as is identified in its Notice of Motion, see Docket No. 54, Defendant moves for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's entire case, each of his claims, and also identifies twelve alternative "issues" for partial summary judgment (each of which, in truth, simply involve arguments for why one or more of Plaintiff's three claims should not survive the motion).1 As demonstrated further below, upon a full assessment of the motions, it is apparent that the action, in its entirety, is appropriate for trial, not summary judgment.

II. Analysis
A. Summary Judgment Standards
Summary judgment is proper when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Miranda v. City of Cornelius, 429 F.3d 858, 860 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005). To satisfy its burden at summary judgment, a moving party without the burden of persuasion [*3]  "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added); see also Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) ("When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out 'that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.'") (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986), and citing Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, 212 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 2000)); Fairbank, 212 F.3d at 532 (holding that the Celotex "showing" can be made by "pointing out through argument...the absence of evidence to support plaintiff's claim").
If the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party may not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment[, but instead] must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir.1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
The opposing party must "cit[e] to particular parts of materials [*4]  in the record" or show that the materials the moving party cited do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record."); Phillips & Stevenson, RUTTER GROUP PRAC. GUIDE, FEDERAL CIV. PRO. BEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2020) ("Phillips & Stevenson"), ¶¶ 14:101.10-101.12, 14:102. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). When parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court must consider the evidence submitted in support of both motions before ruling on either motion. See Fair Housing Council of Riverside Cty., Inc. v. Riverside Two, 249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001).
In addition, under this Court's Local Rules, where the moving party on a motion for summary judgment has "claimed and adequately supported" material facts, those facts "are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are (a) included in the 'Statement of Genuine Disputes' [described in Local Rule 56-2] and (b) controverted by declaration or other written evidence filed in opposition to the motion." [*5]  See C.D. Cal. L.R. 56-3; see also Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 575 F.3d 1040, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009) ("The 'party opposing summary judgment must direct [the court's] attention to specific, triable facts,' and the reviewing court is 'not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.'") (quoting S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2003) and Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001)); Carmen, 237 F.3d at 1029 ("[W]hatever establishes a genuine issue of fact must both be in the district court file and set forth in the response."). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See National Steel Corp v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 496, 502 (9th Cir. 1997); Thornhill Publ'g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir.1979); see also Phillips & Stevenson ¶ 14:171. Factual assertions made in legal memoranda, but not supported by the evidence submitted, are insufficient. See S.A. Empresa De Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense v. Walter Kidde & Co., 690 F.2d 1235, 1238 (9th Cir. 1980). Similarly, one's own allegations in the pleadings are generally not suitable to create a genuine dispute. See Phillips & Stevenson, ¶¶ 14:185-187. Generally-speaking, in judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence, and views all evidence and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630-31 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)); Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072, 1075 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc); Miranda, 429 F.3d at 860 n.1.
With all of these considerations in mind, the court must then determine [*6]  whether "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient." Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995).

C. Relevant Factual Background — Defendant's Motion2
1. Plaintiff, His Employment, and His Chain of Command
Plaintiff is a 58-year-old Black/African-American male. See Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes in Opposition to Defendant State of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to Local Rule 56-2 ("DR"), Docket No. 72-1, ¶ 1. He began his employment with the Ventura Youth Correctional Facility ("VYCF") in or around June 2006 and in or around 2007, he was promoted to the Property Controller I position at VYCF. See id. ¶¶ 2-3. He remained in this position until his eventual disability retirement in February 2020. See id. ¶ 4.
As Property Controller I, Plaintiff was responsible for approximately 4,500 pieces of equipment which he would maintain on a ledger, and to keep a log [*8]  of where that equipment was located in a given facility, and how the equipment was being used. See id. ¶ 7. He maintained tangible objects that were purchased for $500 or more, including calculator machines, computers, keyboards, cell phones, desks, chairs, and bookshelves. See id. Over the years, the physical aspects of Plaintiff's position changed, such that he ceased doing physical labor aspects of the job. See id. ¶ 9. As part of his job duties, Plaintiff was also responsible for the safety of the youth inmate population and the facility. See id. ¶ 8. In addition to his job duties and responsibilities, Plaintiff also served in the roles of an EEO Counselor and facility EEO Trainer at VYCF since 2009, and was familiar with VYCF's EEO policies and CDCR's EEO policies. See id. ¶¶ 12-13.
Robert Facundus ("Facundus") was Plaintiff's direct supervisor from approximately 2017 through 2018. See id. ¶¶ 10, 14. During this time, Facundus reported directly to John Branch ("Branch"). See id. ¶ 15. Maria Harper ("Harper") was the acting Superintendent for VYCF from July 2016 to February 2017, and Superintendent of VYCF from February 2017 until her retirement in September 2018. See id. ¶ 5. In [*9]  her capacity as the Superintendent, Harper also served as the Hiring Authority for VYCF, with duties and responsibilities that included, inter alia, referring appropriate matters to the Office of Internal Affairs ("OIA") for investigation. See id. ¶ 6. As acting Superintendent or Superintendent, Harper reported directly to Heather Bowlds ("Bowlds"), then-Deputy Director of the Division of Juvenile Justice with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and the overall hiring authority for the Division of Juvenile Justice. See id. ¶ 5.
2. The February 27, 2017 Incident and the Disciplinary Aftermath
At some unspecified point in time, Kenneth Fewer ("Fewer"), then a Captain, reported to Harper an allegation of misconduct against Plaintiff regarding an incident that occurred on February 27, 2017, involving a youth ward. See id. ¶ 104. In response to this report, Kendall Markle ("Markle"), Administrative Assistant and Associate Governmental Program Analyst, prepared a Confidential Request for Internal Affairs Investigation and Notification of Direct Adverse Action, CDC Form 989, with supporting documentation ("989 Package"), for review and signature by Harper as the Superintendent/Hiring [*10]  Authority. See id. ¶ 105.
On May 15, 2017, Harper submitted this 989 Package via the Central Intake Unit ("CIU") for the OIA's investigation consideration. See id. ¶ 106. The OIA accepted the referral for investigation. See id. ¶ 107. On September 30, 2017, Facundus drafted a work improvement discussion ("WID") for Plaintiff's conduct in the February 27 incident with the youth ward. See id. ¶¶ 109, 112. A WID is not a disciplinary or adverse action, but is a "low level counseling form" that is corrective in nature. See id. ¶¶ 110-111. Because Plaintiff was — as discussed further below — out on a leave of absence from work at the time Facundus drafted the WID, the WID could not be issued to him until his return to work. See id. ¶¶ 109, 113. Branch issued the WID to Plaintiff on January 19, 2018, because Facundus was out of the office at that time due to an illness. See id. ¶ 114.
Plaintiff refused to sign an acknowledgment of receipt of the WID. See id. ¶ 115. Instead, he responded to the WID with a written rebuttal dated February 16, 2018. See id. ¶ 116. Plaintiff indicated therein that he believed the issuance of the WID was untimely because it was issued outside the 30-day mandate [*11]  under SEIU's Local 1000 collective bargaining agreement with the State of California. See id. ¶ 117.
3. The May 27, 2017 Noose Incident and Reports
On May 27, 2017, a few VYCF employees, including Plaintiff and Scott Boucher ("Boucher"), were scheduled to work overtime hours for work relating to a conversion of the Soapbox Vision Warehouse for a Prison Industry Authority program. See id. ¶ 16. Boucher, a Maintenance Mechanic in Plant Operations, was Plaintiff's co-worker. See id. As Maintenance Mechanic, Boucher reported directly to Michael Harrison ("Harrison"), Chief Engineer of Plant Operations. See id. ¶ 17.
On this day, Boucher was tasked with loading large pallets and bulky items from the Soap Vision Warehouse onto a large truck, borrowed from CalFIRE. See id. ¶ 18. Plaintiff, meanwhile, was tasked with overseeing and making sure that the items were "up and ready to go" to be loaded onto the truck. See id. ¶ 19.
Boucher looked in the Cal-FIRE truck for something to tie down a load, because one of his loads appeared to be heavy and likely unstable to transport from the Soap Vision Warehouse. See id. ¶ 20. He discovered a storage box, and found a pile of rope which he grabbed with [*12]  both of his hands, dropping the rope on the floor. See id. ¶ 21.
Once he had dropped the rope onto the floor, Boucher discovered that there were actually two ropes — one piece in the shape of a noose and the other not in the shape of a noose. See id. ¶ 22. Boucher grabbed the noose-shaped rope and walked into the Soap Vision Warehouse through the rolldown doors on one end of the warehouse (which is larger than a high school gymnasium). See id. ¶¶ 23-24.
When Boucher walked into the warehouse, Plaintiff had his back towards Boucher and was "concentrated and fixated" on his task. See id. ¶ 25. Still, out of his peripheral vision on his left side, Plaintiff observed Boucher fumbling around with something, and saw something — a rope — go over a light fixture. See id. He also heard Boucher say "Hey, look what I found in the truck," and then say "Somebody or something needs to be hanging today" (on May 31, 2017, Boucher told Facundus that, after throwing the rope over the light, he had told Plaintiff to "grab a chair, someone is going to die today") Id. ¶¶ 25, 33.
Plaintiff walked out through the doors of the warehouse opposite the rolldown doors, without saying a word to Boucher. See id. ¶ [*13]  26. Though he did not report the incident to Facundus that day because he "wanted the integrity of what happened to remain intact," Plaintiff did attempt to call Cynthia Brown ("Brown"), the EEO Coordinator for the YVCF, and did report the incident to Joseph Turner ("Turner"), another EEO Coordinator for the YVCF on May 27, 2017. See id. ¶ 27.
Later that day, Boucher apologized to Plaintiff for his conduct in displaying the noose in the warehouse. See id. ¶ 28. Although he had emotions about the incident that he did not want to convey at that time, Plaintiff responded "it's cool." See id. ¶ 29.
Plaintiff reported the incident to Facundus on the morning of May 30, 2017. See id. ¶ 31. Shortly after receiving Plaintiff's report, Facundus walked Plaintiff directly to see Brown. See id. ¶ 35. Plaintiff met with Brown to report the May 27 incident, and completed an EEO Complaint Questionnaire. See id. ¶ 36. Plaintiff subsequently completed a Discrimination Complaint on CDCR Form 693 and submitted it, along with a written statement, to Brown on May 30, 2017. See id. ¶ 38. While Plaintiff was meeting with Brown, Facundus informed Branch of Plaintiff's report about the May 27 incident. See id. [*14]  ¶ 37.
After completing the necessary paperwork, Brown went to Harper's office that same day, and briefed Harper on the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct Plaintiff had lodged against Boucher. See id. ¶ 40. Brown also went to see Markle, Harper's Administrative Assistant, to provide her with the necessary information to prepare the 989 Package for a referral to the OIA for investigation. See id. Markle began working on the 989 Package on or about May 30, 2017. See id. ¶ 46.
4. Defendant's Short-Term Actions re Boucher
The next day — May 31, 2017 — Facundus and Harrison both spoke to Boucher about his conduct on May 27. See id. ¶¶ 33-34. On June 7, 2017, Brown issued a cease and desist letter to Boucher. See id. ¶ 41.
5. Plaintiff's Absences/Leave/Doctor Visits
Plaintiff was absent from work on June 5, 2017. See id. ¶ 56. Without having permission from Facundus — though he did tell Facundus on June 8 that he was "stressed out . . . about how he is treated" — Plaintiff also left work early on June 8, 2017. See id. ¶ 52. On June 9, 2017, Plaintiff filed a worker's compensation claim for injuries sustained to his neck, back, and lower extremities after he fell into a gopher hole on [*15]  June 15, 2016. See id. ¶ 53. Plaintiff again left work early without permission on June 15, 2017, and was again absent from work on June 16, 2017. See id. ¶¶ 52, 56. Plaintiff saw Dr. Scheinberg — his orthopedist for his June 9 worker's compensation claim — that same day, and requested a doctor's note excusing Plaintiff from work starting the day prior, June 15, due to stress and other emotions/impacts he was experiencing as a result of the May 27 incident. See id. ¶ 59. Dr. Scheinberg informed Plaintiff that he could not provide the requested doctor's note. See id. ¶ 60.
Also that day (June 16, 2017), Facundus sent Plaintiff an e-mail, telling Plaintiff that "[d]ue to your pattern of unexcused absences management is forced to take appropriate and immediate action. You are now required to provide medical substantiation for any absence from work with the exception of any approved FMLA or any approved worker's compensation case." See id. ¶¶ 55, 57. Plaintiff was again absent from work on June 19 and June 20, 2017, making three consecutive days of absences. See id. ¶¶ 56, 65.
Plaintiff believed that if an employee did not produce a doctor's note after three days, the employee could and [*16]  would be considered AWOL. See id. ¶ 68. Plaintiff saw Dr. Ford for a follow-up examination on June 19, 2017. See id. ¶ 61. Plaintiff informed Dr. Ford that he had seen Dr. Scheinberg for another worker's compensation injury on June 16 and "was not given time off [because] apparently [Dr. Scheinberg] is not a psychologist [and Plaintiff] wants [the time off work] to be backtracked to last Thursday [i.e., June 15, 2017] because he could not be there any more." Id. ¶ 62. Dr. Ford gave Plaintiff a doctor's note providing for his leave of absence effective June 15, 2017 through the following Monday. See id. ¶ 67. Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note to VYCF on or about the same day he saw Dr. Ford. See id. ¶ 69.
6. EEOC Complaint & Further Developments re Internal Complaint
On June 14, 2017, Plaintiff went to a local field office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") to lodge an administrative complaint of discrimination against VYCF in connection with the May 27 noose incident. See id. ¶ 54.
On July 5, 2017, Plaintiff's union representative informed Plaintiff of the union representative's discussion with Brown regarding her referral of Plaintiff's EEO complaint to the OIA [*17]  for investigation. See id. ¶ 71.
Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination dated July 10, 2017, which EEOC Intake received on July 13, 2017. See id. ¶ 72. On July 12, 2017, Harper signed and submitted the 989 Package to refer Plaintiff's internal complaint to OIA for investigation, and Brown closed her case file for Plaintiff's EEO Complaint that same day. See id. ¶¶ 43, 46. VYCF received notification from the EEOC of Plaintiff's perfected EEOC Charge of Discrimination on July 24, 2017. See id. ¶ 73. On August 2, 2017, the OIA accepted the 989 Package dated July 12, 2017 that Harper had sent. See id. ¶ 47.
Plaintiff testified in his deposition, and believed based on his knowledge of EEO laws, that Brown properly performed her duties and responsibilities as an EEO coordinator in appropriately following the complaint matrix in connection with the handling of Plaintiff's May 30, 2017 EEO complaint against Boucher. See id. ¶¶ 44, 48. He also believed that Facundus — who Plaintiff believed always had been and "always will be a consummate professional" — did as much as he possibly could "to try to implement as much applying [sic] rules and regulations, policies and procedures" on Boucher [*18]  being held accountable, and that Facundus "remained as much unbiased and professional as he could." Id. ¶¶ 49-50.
7. Investigation Timeline Policies/Practices
Under California's Public Safety Officer's Procedural Bill of Rights, the time limitations for the OIA to conduct and complete an administrative investigation of allegations of misconduct against a peace officer is 12 months, versus three years for non-peace officers. See id. ¶ 45. Typically, for referral to the OIA for an administrative investigation of peace officer-related allegations of misconduct, Harper's office would prepare 989 Packages within 30 days in order to allow as much time as possible within the 12-month time limitations for the OIA to accept the referral for investigation, conduct and complete the investigation, and issue its findings and recommendation, and for the Hiring Authority to conduct and complete "402/403 conferences" with the Office of Legal Affairs ("OLA") and Office of Inspector General ("OIG"). See id. For non-peace officers, Harper's office attempted to complete and submit 989 Packages within 30 days to not unnecessarily delay the OIA referral process. See id.
8. Stationary Engineer Openings; Boucher's Promotion [*19] 
The "stationary engineer" classification at VYCF is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of boiler, air conditioning, ventilating, lighting, power, water, water treatment, and other mechanical systems that are typical in a youth correctional facility setting. See id. ¶ 76. VYCF's main boilers require an attendant 16 hours a day, seven days a week and cannot be left unattended for more than a short, specified period of time. See id. VYCF had three vacancies for the stationary engineer classification which remained unfilled for approximately two years, despite the facility having the budget for six stationary engineers. See id. ¶ 74.
Of the nine candidates on the certification/eligibility list effective May 20, 2017, only two were qualified to interview for the classification of stationary engineer. See id. ¶ 75. This included Boucher, who interviewed for the position on August 11, 2017. See id. At the time Boucher interviewed for the position, the three vacancies had been temporarily filled by other employees — including Boucher — with overtime hours. See id. ¶ 77.
Of the two candidates who interviewed for the stationary engineer position, Boucher did well during his [*20]  interview and was the most-qualified for the position, and he ultimately received a promotion to the position. See id. ¶ 78. Though she questioned after-the-fact whether the promotion should be rescinded until after completion of the OIA investigation into the noose incident, Harper signed off on Boucher's promotion because she believed that she did not have the authority to stop the process. See id. ¶ 81.
9. Additional Disciplinary Developments re Boucher
In November 2017, the OIA issued its findings and recommendation following its completion of its investigation into the noose incident. See id. ¶ 82. A 402/403 conference was subsequently held by the Hiring Authority, the OIG, and the OLA to determine whether OIA's investigative findings substantiated the allegations of misconduct against Boucher (402 conference) and the corresponding sanction/penalty to be imposed against him (403 conference). See id. ¶ 83. Because the entities involved in the 403 conference could not agree on the justification of penalty and the use of mitigating and aggravating factors, the matter was subsequently elevated to Bowlds for further determination. See id. ¶ 84.
A Notice of Adverse Action was eventually [*21]  issued to Boucher on February 15, 2018, effective March 1, 2018. See id. ¶ 85. Boucher appealed to the State Personnel Board, which ultimately resulted in a settlement that allowed Boucher to keep his job classification of Stationary Engineer, but at a 15% reduction in pay for two years. See id. ¶ 86.
10. Plaintiff's Further Leave and Return to Work in January 2018
From October 27, 2017 to January 1, 2018, Plaintiff was on a leave of absence under the care of Dr. James Cole, Ph.D., a licensed Clinical Psychologist. See id. ¶ 87. On December 15, 2017, Dr. Cole released Plaintiff with a return to work date of January 2, 2018, and recommended one work restriction — that Plaintiff should have no contact with Boucher. See id. ¶ 88. Dr. Cole also recommended that any disagreements between Plaintiff and Boucher be immediately mediated by the Facilities Administrator. See id. ¶ 89.
Plaintiff's physical location at the workplace was in the Administration building, while Boucher was located in plant operations, which was "down around the corner and outside the facility." See id. ¶ 90. VYCF advised Plaintiff in an email that it could not guarantee that Plaintiff would "completely avoid any incidental [*22]  contact with . . . Boucher, such as hallways or interior roads, while both [were] on VYCF grounds in the performance of your [respective] duties." Id. ¶ 92. VYCF invited Plaintiff to engage in an interactive process to discuss options for his return to work to minimize contact with Boucher. See id. ¶ 93. Plaintiff did not complete and return the CDCR 855 Request for Accommodation Form in connection with his January 2, 2018, return to work. See id. ¶¶ 94, 96.
However, to appear "amenable," and to demonstrate that he "could be worked with," Plaintiff responded to VYCF on December 29, 2017, stating "In an effort to prevent further problems, conflicts and issues, I'm trusting that a dialogue of some sort has occurred with [Boucher] prior to my return to work. Thank you." Id. ¶ 95. Plaintiff never communicated to VYCF that he expected VYCF to terminate Boucher or transfer Boucher to another institution upon Plaintiff's return to work on January 2, 2018, and neither Institutional Personnel Officer Leslie Zuniga ("Zuniga") nor Harper understood Plaintiff's December 29, 2017 communication to mean this. See id. ¶¶ 69, 97-99, 121.
Plaintiff returned to work on January 2, 2018, reporting to his [*23]  workstation located at the facility's Administrative building. See id. ¶ 100. After Plaintiff's return to work, Boucher saw Plaintiff once in the hallway of the Administration building, coming within one or two feet of each other, and Plaintiff eventually saw Boucher again when Plaintiff and his wife voluntarily went to the State Personnel Board hearing for Boucher's appeal of the adverse action VYCF had issued against him. See id. ¶¶ 101-102.
11. Plaintiff Takes Further Leave; Files Another EEOC Charge; Retires
In February 2018, Plaintiff took another leave of absence. See id. ¶ 120. Plaintiff filed a second Charge of Discrimination against VYCF, dated May 18, 2018. See id. ¶ 123. Plaintiff filed for disability retirement with CalPERS in February 2020, and CalPERS accepted it on July 15, 2020, with an effective retirement date of February 15, 2020. See id. ¶ 125. Plaintiff never returned to work, and never reported back for duty, between the leave period he began in February 2018 and the February 15, 2020, effective date of his disability retirement. See id. ¶ 127.
D. Relevant Factual Background — Plaintiff's Motion
1. Plaintiff's Employment and Background
Plaintiff is an African-American [*24]  male who began his employment with the VYCF in June 2006. See Plaintiff's Response to CDCR's Statement of Genuine Disputes ("PR"), Docket No. 70-1, ¶¶ 1-2.
2. The February 27, 2017 Incident and Inmates/Wards Use of "N Word"
On February 27, 2017, Plaintiff complained to Facundus that a Caucasian inmate said to him "You heard me Nigga," "What's up dirty ass Nigga," and "I'm gonna kick your ass Nigga." Id. ¶ 4. A co-worker also reported that the inmate said "what are you going to do you nigger come on then." Id.
Fewer, the Assistant Superintendent of YVCF, testified that he was aware that an inmate had "used the N-word" against Plaintiff on "at least one occasion, possibly more than that," and acknowledged that they were having "a lot of racial issues with some of the youth," including calling different staff names, including racial epithets. Id. ¶ 5. Plaintiff's supervisors did nothing to remedy Plaintiff's complaint that inmates were referring to him as a "nigger." See id. ¶ 6. Plaintiff found the conduct of inmates at CDCR referring to him as a "nigger" as unwelcome, and he wanted it to stop. See id. ¶ 3.
3. Boucher and the Noose Incident
On Saturday, May 27, 2017, CDCR employed Boucher [*25]  — Plaintiff's coworker — as a Maintenance Mechanic. See id. ¶ 7. Boucher later told an OIA investigator that his assignment that day was to assist with moving items from the property control storage area to another storage area, located outside of the correctional facility's secured perimeter. See id. ¶ 9. He drove a borrowed Cal-Fire truck to the property control storage area to load the items to be moved, exited the truck and began loading the truck. See id.
Boucher told an OIA investigator that he was aware that Plaintiff and other coworkers were in the area. See id. ¶ 10. He told the OIA investigator that he proceeded to the storage box located on the side of the truck in order to obtain a rope to tie down the items he was moving, that he opened the storage box, and that one of the things he pulled out of the box, he discovered, was a piece of rope configured as a noose. See id. ¶¶ 11-12. Boucher told the OIA investigator that the noose-rope was 15 to 20 feet long, that it was a typical hangman's noose that he recognized as a noose immediately, that the loop of the noose was approximately 8 to 10 inches in diameter, and that the knot on the rope had approximately 6 to 8 wraps.  [*26] See id. ¶¶ 13-15.
Boucher testified that he could not think of any job at VYCF that would require a noose. See id. ¶ 16. His mind blank, but wanting to show "the rest of the crew what was on the truck" for "no reason," and making a joke for "[e]verybody that was there that day," including Plaintiff, Boucher told the OIA investigator that he carried the noose into the property control warehouse, and threw it over a low-hanging light or light fixture. See id. ¶¶ 17, 27; see also id. ¶ 21. As he did so, Boucher said "Hey, look what I found in the truck" or "Look I found this in the truck," and then "Someone/Somebody or something needs to be hanging/hanged today" (though, on May 31, 2017, Boucher told Facundus, the supervisor on-site that day, that after throwing the rope/noose over the light, he told Plaintiff to "grab a chair, someone is going to die today") Id. ¶¶ 21-23, 25.
Boucher later admitted to OIA that, after making the statement, he laughed it off, removed the rope/noose from the light fixture, and placed it on the ground near the truck after about 10 or 15 seconds. See id. ¶ 26. He also testified that when he pulled down the rope, he placed it back in the storage box on the truck [*27]  immediately after Plaintiff saw it and before anybody else could see it. See id. ¶ 33. Boucher testified that he did not show the rope to anyone else or tell anyone else about the noose that he had found, nor did he ever report finding the noose. See id. ¶ 34. Facundus, who was also present the day of the noose incident (but who did not observe it), testified that he could not recall any employee ever making a joke about killing themselves while working at CDCR, and that he would not think such a joke was funny. See id. ¶ 31.
Boucher told the OIA investigator that Plaintiff was the only Black staff member assigned to the property control area that day, and testified that he could not recall joking around with Plaintiff in the past. See id. ¶¶ 19, 28. Although Boucher did not know that Plaintiff was in the Soap Vision Warehouse at the time Boucher walked in with the noose, he told the OIA investigator that only he and Plaintiff were in the area where he hung the noose and made his comments. See id. ¶ 18. He testified that he assumed the other workers on duty that day were all in the back part of the warehouse, at least 50 to 60 feet away, with no corner separating the distance. See id. [*28]  ¶ 20.
Boucher apologized to Plaintiff later in the day on May 27 because "maybe [Plaintiff] had seen somebody hang themselves" and because Boucher "didn't know had I offended . . . . I wanted to apologize if I hurt his feeling or him as another person, another human being." Id. ¶ 35. Plaintiff responded "it's cool," but in a written statement included with his May 30, 2017 internal EEO Complaint indicated that he limited his response in that fashion so as to not show Boucher how angry and upset he was and to not say something he could not take back. See id. The incident affects Plaintiff deeply because his grandparents had grown up on a plantation and had told him stories of African-Americans being lynched. See id. ¶ 41. Plaintiff also testified that he felt as though his life was threatened. See id. ¶ 42.
Though Plaintiff was scheduled to work until 2:00 p.m. that day, he left at 1:00 p.m. because he was so distraught by the incident with Boucher, though he only told Facundus that "he had to go," and did not tell Facundus — at least that day — about the incident. See id. ¶ 36.
4. Plaintiff Reports the Noose Incident; Defendant's First Reactions
Tuesday, May 30, 2017, was Plaintiff's first [*29]  day back to work after Memorial Day weekend. See id. ¶ 37. Plaintiff reported the noose incident and related "hanging" comment to Facundus and to Brown (the Facility EEO Coordinator) that day, along with filing a CDCR Form 693 ("Internal EEO Complaint") and an incident report. See id. Facundus testified that Plaintiff was in tears or "to the point of tears" when he reported the incident to him, and that though he had seen Plaintiff "pretty upset" a few times, he did not believe that he had ever seen Plaintiff "this upset." Id. ¶ 40.
Brown testified that she gave Plaintiff a 693 Form, asked him to fill it out, and told him "as soon as I could get that information, I was going to send it out." Id. ¶ 45. The same day she met with Plaintiff, Brown also met with Harper (the Superintendent and "Hiring Authority") and "discussed a 989 needed to prepare it appears [sic] that serious misconduct is involved — likely to result in adverse action." Id. ¶ 46.
In his Internal EEO Complaint, Plaintiff specifically reported the following:
At the time . . . I was focusing on my assignment and had seen [Boucher] with something in his hands. It was a rope . . . . I then saw [Boucher], out of the corner of [*30]  my eye, throw the rope over a light fixture near the roll-up door. When I turned to see him completely I saw one end of a rope in [Boucher's] hand and the other end of the rope over the light fixture. The rope that was over the light fixture I saw as a "Noose" one configured in a way as if someone were to hand a person with one used in the lynching of blacks in the slavery period. [Boucher] then said, to me, "Look I found this in the truck"! "Someone or something needs to be hanged today."
Id. ¶ 38. Plaintiff concluded his Internal EEO Complaint by writing: "[Boucher] acted with malice and intent to cause harm . . . . I feel [Boucher's] actions were deliberate because I am a Black Man . . . . I fear 'Retaliation may follow me as a result of filing this EEO complaint. I feel I am in a complete 'Hostile Work Environment.'" Id. ¶ 39.
On May 31, 2017, Plaintiff called in sick to avoid encountering Boucher and otherwise be exposed to what he believed to be a hostile work environment. See id. ¶ 78. Given the nature of the noose incident, Plaintiff felt that any work environment where he would encounter Boucher would be inherently hostile. See id. ¶ 44.
Plaintiff later testified that he wanted [*31]  Boucher removed from the institution, either by termination or by transfer. See id. ¶ 49. Harper testified that she never discussed the remedy Plaintiff was seeking with Plaintiff himself, and that she did not "recall seeing" Plaintiff's Internal EEO Complaint and was unaware that Plaintiff was complaining about a Hostile Work Environment. See id. ¶¶ 47-48. Bowlds (the Deputy Director of Juvenile Justice) testified that she was aware that Plaintiff was alleging that Boucher's intent was to threaten Plaintiff and threaten Plaintiff's life. See id. ¶¶ 43, 81.
On June 7, 2017, Brown issued a "cease and desist" letter to Boucher. See id. ¶ 79. Prior to commencement of discovery in this action, no one ever informed Plaintiff that Boucher had been given the cease and desist letter. See PR ¶ 86.
Brown's letter stated "If you are engaging in inappropriate behavior that violates the Department's EEO policy, you are hereby directed to immediately cease from engaging in such behavior." Id. ¶ 80; see also Docket No. 51-16. Bowlds testified that "no other [immediate] action could be taken as against" Boucher aside from the "cease and desist" letter. PR ¶ 70. Bowlds testified that the recipient of [*32]  a cease and desist letter should be able to figure out whether behavior violated CDCR's EEO policy based upon their training. See id. ¶ 81. However, she also testified that it was her understanding that Boucher denied that the May 27, 2017 incident violated CDCR's EEO policy. See id. ¶ 82. When later asked whether he knew on May 27, 2017, that he couldn't harass or discriminate against anybody based upon their color, Boucher testified that he did not think or know that his actions that day were discriminating, harassing or violated policies. See id. ¶ 82. He further admitted to the OIA investigator that he had not read CDCR's EEO policy, though he signed it. See id. ¶ 84.
Branch testified that, on June 7, 2017, he told Boucher — who Branch would see at a square dance once a month for about 10 to 15 minutes — that he would support Boucher during the EEO investigation. See id. ¶¶ 88, 90. Plaintiff overheard the statement. See id. ¶ 88. That same day, Branch sent an email which stated that "The [SCIF] investigator wants to speak with the individual who [Plaintiff] states caused his complaint which is being assessed as an EEO complaint. I don't think this is legal but I'm looking into it." [*33]  Id. ¶ 91; see also Docket No. 51-17.
5. Early Disciplinary Options Available to Defendant
CDCR training calls for "Immediate and Appropriate Action," and notes that "Immediate and Appropriate action is not corrective or disciplinary action." PR ¶ 65. CDCR policy allows CDCR to take such action — including "Temporary separation of the Complainant and Respondent," temporary or permanent reassignment, or a temporary or permanent job change/transfer — "[i]n order to restore a work environment free from discrimination and retaliation during the EEO complaint process, and to protect the Complainant from further harm." Id. ¶¶ 66-67. CDCR did not fill out an Immediate and Appropriate Action Memorandum in connection with Plaintiff's complaints (and thus actions that would have been taken, pursuant to CDCR policy, subsequent to such a memorandum, were not taken). See id. ¶¶ 68-69.
CDCR Policy allows the Hiring Authority to take direct adverse action without an investigation. See id. ¶ 50. However, Harper did not purse this option because she "wanted to make sure that there was a thorough investigation so that it was fair to both — both parties." Id. ¶ 51. Although there is a limited exception to [*34]  the Central Intake requirements for urgent matters involving potential employee misconduct requiring immediate investigative action from OIA (and which, in at least in certain circumstances, allows the Hiring Authority to take independent action), Harper and CDCR did not pursue this option because she was unaware of it. See id. ¶¶ 52-55. However, Harper would not have pursued it even if she had been aware of it, because there were "two people having different versions" and she wanted to make sure Boucher had due process. Id. ¶ 53.
CDCR's Policy for "REMOVING EMPLOYEE FROM THE JOB WHILE INVESTIGATION IS PENDING" states that "If the employee's misconduct is so serious that the employee's continued presence at the work site could cause problems, the employee may be placed on paid administrative leave." Id. ¶ 58. CDCR policy also permits an employee under investigation to be temporarily reassigned pending the investigation, but Boucher was not temporarily reassigned. See id. ¶¶ 63-64.
CDCR Policy also states that an employee can be placed on "Notice of Leave of Absence Pending Investigation (ATO)" — which is paid leave — if "He/she has committed any serious infraction of the CCR." Id. ¶ [*35]  56. The Policy further states that "Use of ATO should be considered when the employee's continued presence at the work site will adversely affect the security or management of the facility." Id. ¶ 57. The policy permits extension of ATO indefinitely, with appropriate approvals. See id. ¶ 59. Harper testified that she did not consider placing Boucher on ATO because she believed that he was "told to stay away from" Plaintiff." Id. ¶ 61.
Harper testified that she did not consider that Boucher's mere presence could contribute to Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim because she did not know about Plaintiff's concern about a hostile work environment. See id. ¶ 98. Harper testified that, despite never speaking to Plaintiff about his desired remedy, never reading Plaintiff's Internal EEO Complaint, and being unaware that Plaintiff was complaining about a Hostile Work Environment, she believed that CDCR fulfilled its duty to take "prompt and effective remedial action" "because [the two men] worked in separate areas of the building and I was under the impression that his supervisors spoke to Boucher about keeping his distance . . . ." Id. ¶ 71.
6. Plaintiff Expresses Concern to Facundus [*36]  and Starts EEOC Process
Plaintiff reported to Facundus on June 8, 2017 that he was feeling "stressed out," and he was feeling this way because he felt that Defendant had done nothing to address his principal complaint about Boucher's continued presence at the institution, and his knowledge that he would encounter him again, and that this was causing a hostile work environment. See id. ¶ 97. Because he believed that Defendant had taken no action to remedy his hostile work environment complaint, Plaintiff filled out an EEOC intake questionnaire that was stamped June 12, 2017 (though Defendant asserts Plaintiff's initial intake at the EEOC office was on June 14, 2017). See id. ¶ 99. On June 14, 2017, Defendant was served with Plaintiff's unperfected charge of discrimination. See id. ¶ 100.
7. Plaintiff Takes Leave; Defendant's Reaction
Because of his belief that CDCR had not taken any action to remedy his hostile work environment complaint, because he believed he could no longer work in an environment that he believed was inherently hostile (because he would encounter Boucher), and because of the continued emotional distress he was suffering as a result of the May 27, 2017 incident, Plaintiff [*37]  took unpaid leave beginning June 15, 2017, with it ultimately extending — at the recommendation of doctors as a result of a series of visits — until January 2, 2018. See id. ¶¶ 101-104. His unpaid leave caused him to lose his benefits on July 1, 2017. See id. ¶ 101.
On or around June 16, 2017, Branch directed Facundus to send Plaintiff an email requiring Plaintiff to provide medical substantiation for all absences due to "excessive absences." See id. ¶ 107. Both Branch and Facundus testified that not all employees are required to provide medical substantiation for all absences. See id. ¶ 109. Branch testified that "If they have a medical substantiation . . . it's no longer considered unexcused." Id. ¶ 114.
When asked how CDCR determines whether absences are excessive, Branch testified that "it's very subjective." See id. ¶ 108. When asked who made this determination in Plaintiff's case, Branch testified "Well, me, for one." Id.
On June 20, 2017, Branch and Facundus drafted a Counselling Chrono to address Plaintiff's unpaid absences. See id. ¶ 111. This Counselling Chrono is a form of corrective action. See id. ¶ 112. It listed June 15, 16 and 19 as unexcused absences, despite Plaintiff's [*38]  doctor's note excusing him for those days. See id. ¶ 113.
8. Delays and Uncertainty Lead Plaintiff to Pursue EEOC Route
Pursuant to CDCR policy, less serious EEO complaints that can be resolved through the Local Intervention Process ("LIP") "shall be completed" within 20 days because "[t]imely processing is crucial to the success of the LIP," because "[t] imely and appropriate action creates trust in the LIP for Complainants," and because "[d]elays in this process may prohibit the Department's ability to take 'immediate and appropriate action,' as required by State and federal laws." Id. ¶ 261.
Pursuant to CDCR policy under the Hiring Authority responsibilities, the Hiring Authority "shall be responsible for the following: Ensuring each allegation of employee misconduct . . . receives prompt attention, and is addressed appropriately." Id. ¶ 120. Pursuant to CDCR policy under Requests for Internal Affairs Investigation, "[t]he CDC Form 989 and the corresponding Documents and Materials checklist shall be promptly completed and forwarded to the OIA CIU, by the Hiring Authority for processing as soon as is reasonably practical." Id. ¶ 121. Harper testified that she did nothing to try to speed [*39]  up the referral. See id. ¶ 122.
In addition, when harassment has occurred, CDCR policy requires managers and supervisors to "[c]ommunicate to the Complainant the corrective actions taken and explain what the Complainant should do if the problem reoccurs." Id. ¶ 75. Plaintiff's managers and supervisors never communicated the corrective action taken or explained what Plaintiff should do if the problem reoccurs. See id. ¶ 76.
On July 5, 2017, Juan Martinez (Plaintiff's union representative) emailed Brown to inform her that Plaintiff had not received an update on his Internal EEO Complaint. See id. ¶ 116. Brown replied that Plaintiff had "filed an EEO Complaint, however it was a Direct file to the Office of Civil Rights-OIA Southern Region." Id.
On July 10, 2017, Plaintiff signed an EEOC Charge of Discrimination, which was then received by the EEOC Intake office on July 13, 2017 and sent to CDCR as notification of Plaintiff's perfected EEOC Charge. See id. ¶ 117. Two days after Plaintiff signed his EEOC Charge, on July 12, 2017 Harper signed the CDC Form 989 initiating the investigation of Plaintiff's EEO complaint. See id. ¶ 118.
On August 2, 2017, OIA Special Agent Jeffrey Phillips emailed [*40]  Brown, telling her that Plaintiff had called him, informed him that he had filed an EEO complaint with Brown on May 30, 2017, and had not heard anything. See id. ¶ 135. Phillips also said that Plaintiff had said that Plaintiff had contacted Brown that same day — i.e., August 2 — and that Brown had advised Plaintiff that the complaint had been forwarded to OIA, but Phillips had not learned of any record of any complaint by Plaintiff. See id. Brown responded that she had given Plaintiff the form 693 to complete and the mailing address, and that Plaintiff was an EEO counselor and knew the process. See id. ¶ 136.
9. Boucher's Prior Disciplinary Record
Boucher had a prior EEO complaint filed against him by another employee as a result of an incident on July 26, 2016. See id. ¶ 124. This other CDCR employee's allegations included: that Boucher yelled profanities at him, including "Why the fuck are you throwing [me] under the bus in front of management!!"; "aggressively got in my face"; was "acting in a hostile manner towards me"; "[t]he thing [Boucher] said to me makes me feel that he might retaliate against me"; and "I feel that he created a hostile work environment." Id. ¶ 126. The employee [*41]  who filed this earlier EEO complaint against Boucher sought termination as a remedy. See id. ¶ 128.
Harrison spoke to Boucher on August 3, 2016. See id. ¶ 129. Boucher admitted using foul language, but considered the case "squashed" because he had apologized for his actions. See id. Boucher received an Employee Counseling Record from Harrison asking him to familiarize himself with CDCR's Code of Conduct found in DOM 33030.3.1 and warning Boucher that "Your conduct on this occasion was unacceptable and will not be tolerated by this department. If you engage in similar conduct in the future, the department will take adverse action against you based on the incident cited in this memorandum, as well as any future incidents." Id. ¶ 130. The CDCR Form 989 Harper signed on July 12, 2017 in connection with the noose incident did not include any information regarding this prior EEO complaint against Boucher. See id. ¶ 123.
10. Boucher Interviews For, and Secures, Promotion; Reactions
On August 11, 2017, Boucher interviewed for a promotion to become a Stationary Engineer before a three-person panel that included Zuniga and Harrison, along with Roy Calzada ("Calzada") (Boucher's second-level supervisor). [*42]  See id. ¶ 142. Harrison testified that he was aware of Plaintiff's complaint, but that it never came up during the interview, though the panel knew Boucher was still under investigation. See id. ¶ 150. In fact, the same day as Boucher's interview, Harrison completed his statement to OIA wherein he stated that Boucher had admitted to him on May 31, 2017, that "one of the ropes which was already on the Cal Fire stake side utility truck fell to the ground and he noticed it was tied in the form of a noose" and that "he took the noose inside the property control warehouse and threw it up over a drop down style light fixture." Id. ¶ 149.
On Boucher's Employment Reference Check, which Harrison needed to fill out as Boucher's supervisor, Harrison rated Boucher's "interpersonal skills" as a 6, his "[r]elationship with peers" as a 7, and his "written and verbal communication skills" as an 8, despite knowing of Plaintiff's complaint. See id. ¶ 152. Harrison did not factor Plaintiff's complaint into these ratings, and made no reference to the outstanding EEO Complaint in the Employment Reference Check despite multiple questions presenting opportunities to address it. See id. ¶¶ 153-154.
The Employment [*43]  Reference Check also asked if Harrison had ever done anything corrective to Boucher, and Harrison wrote that there was "nothing leading to paperwork. [Boucher] will always self-correct his issues!" Id. ¶ 155. But on July 26, 2016, Harrison had written an Employee Counseling Record addressed to Boucher regarding the prior EEO complaint leveled against him, and on August 4, 2016 Harrison wrote a memorandum addressed to Boucher regarding Boucher's prior EEO complaint. See id. ¶¶ 130, 156.
At least one other individual also interviewed for the Stationary Engineer position. See id. ¶ 143. In a memo to Calzada, Harrison wrote that the other interviewee for the position, while touring the facility, remarked "if this is where the lazy black guy worked referring to Robert Harper . . . . At that time I mentioned to him that he better watch his P's and Q's because [redacted] was in fact on shift that morning and also let him know that he is married to the Superintendent, Mrs. Harper." Id. ¶ 146. Harrison closed the memo by saying "Never before had someone crossed so many lines that we train and live by here at VYCF regarding professionalism and proper work etiquette." Id. Harrison testified that [*44]  he would not have recommended the other applicant for hire because he had called another employee a "lazy black guy," and because the comment violated CDCR's EEO policy. See id. ¶ 147.
On August 15, 2017, Boucher received notice that his OIA interview would occur on August 24, 2017. See id. ¶ 160. Though he was still under investigation for Plaintiff's EEO Complaint, Boucher received the promotion, and Branch approved it. See id. ¶ 144. On August 21, 2017, Boucher was officially promoted from Maintenance Mechanic to Stationary Engineer, which included a salary increase from $5,354 to $6,249 per month. See id. ¶ 161. This salary increase was in effect for Boucher until March 1, 2018, when it was decreased for — ultimately — a 2-year period as a result of disciplinary action against him as a consequence of the noose incident. See id. ¶ 163.
Harper testified that she recommended Boucher for promotion because "we were paying overtime, overtime, overtime like crazy," though VYCF had three vacancies for the stationary engineer position unfilled for approximately two years, and Boucher himself had been one of the employees filling the vacancy via overtime hours and — Harrison testified — was [*45]  already performing most of the stationary engineer duties. See id. ¶¶ 158, 162. Branch testified that he recommended Boucher for promotion because the current stationary engineers "were very close to getting burnt out." Id. ¶ 157. However, Harrison — who was the direct supervisor of all stationary engineers — testified that the current stationary engineers "[n]ever complained at all" about working overtime or burnout, and "[t]he guys were very content with their positions." Id. ¶ 159. Harrison testified that it "[n]ever crossed [his] mind" not to promote Boucher while the investigation was ongoing. Id. ¶ 151.
On August 23, 2017, Harper sent an email to Bowlds asking "Should we retract the placement of Boucher into stationary engineer position until after the [OIA] investigation?" Id. ¶ 172. Harper wrote "although not illegal to promote . . . Boucher, it doesn't look good for the facility. The perception is that we do not consider [Plaintiff's] complaint as serious." Id. ¶ 173. In a follow-up email, Harper later wrote "[Boucher's] mediation between he and the complainant is scheduled for September 21st [2017]. I had suggested that we rescind the appointment until after the mediation [*46]  . . . ." Id. ¶ 174. Bowlds testified that she also considered that Boucher's promotion would send a message to Plaintiff, Boucher and the staff at Ventura that Boucher's behavior was acceptable. See id. ¶ 175. Yet, CDCR did not retract Boucher's promotion. See id. ¶ 176.
When Plaintiff found out about Boucher's promotion shortly after it occurred, it reinforced his belief that CDCR was ratifying Boucher's May 27, 2017 behavior. See id. ¶¶ 164, 167. Plaintiff interpreted the promotion as a sign that CDCR was not taking his complaint seriously and as a sign that CDCR was siding with Boucher even before the investigation had been completed. See id. ¶ 167. Harper testified that she knew that Boucher's promotion "would probably anger [Plaintiff]. I mean, I can . . . I can guess that it might anger him, upset him." Id. ¶ 165.
11. Investigation Into the Noose Incident Continues
Boucher sat for his interview with OIA regarding Plaintiff's EEO complaint on August 24, 2017. See id. ¶ 177. During his OIA interview, Boucher's advocate interjected to make the OIA investigator aware that Boucher had been promoted and that the promotion was "supported all the way up to the top of business manager." [*47]  Id. ¶ 178. Boucher clarified that the support referred to Branch and Harper, Boucher's advocate stated "Yeah, are in full support of that," and Boucher testified that "[Harper] had to sign off on the promotion." Id.
Though Plaintiff had submitted a written statement with his Internal EEO Complaint on May 30, 2017, OIA submitted its confidential report to Harper on September 19, 2017 without attempting to interview Plaintiff as part of the investigation. See id. ¶ 180. No one with Defendant ever followed up to gather more information from Plaintiff after his May 30, 2017 complaint, and no one with Defendant attempted to interview any witness other than Boucher as part of its investigation into Plaintiff's EEO complaint. See id.
On October 6, 2017, Harper emailed Markle to ask if Boucher's OIA interview had been completed. Id. ¶ 189. The interview had been completed 44 days earlier, and the OIA had delivered its completed report to Harper 18 days earlier. See id.
On November 29, 2017, CDCR held a conference to determine if the investigation had sustained Plaintiff's allegations and, if so, to determine the appropriate punishment for Boucher. See id. ¶ 190. At this meeting, Harper, the OIA [*48]  investigator and the vertical advocate could not reach agreement (so an executive review was later conducted in February 2018). See id. ¶ 191. Harper advocated for a lesser punishment than the other members. See id. ¶ 192. Bowlds testified that Harper "felt the mitigating factor of . . . Boucher [sic] and that she did not feel his intent was to target [Plaintiff] and that he was remorseful, that that should lead to a lesser punishment." Id. ¶ 193.
12. WID Issued to Plaintiff
On September 30, 2017, Facundus authored a WID related to conduct Plaintiff allegedly engaged in on February 27, 2017. See id. ¶ 187. Pursuant to CDCR policy, corrective actions, including WIDs, "must generally be issued within thirty (30) calendar days of discovering inappropriate behavior or poor performance." Id. ¶ 188. Though he testified consistent with that policy that, if a WID is given, it typically has to be issued within 30 days, it was not until January 19, 2018 that Branch gave Plaintiff the WID that Facundus authored. See id. ¶¶ 219-220. Fewer also indicated that WIDs must be issued within 30 days of an incident. See id. ¶ 222.
13. Preparing for Plaintiff's Return to Work
By December 15, 2017, Dr. Cole [*49]  — Plaintiff's psychiatrist — had diagnosed Plaintiff with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder based solely on Plaintiff's "direct exposure to a threatened death or serious injury," referring to the May 27, 2017 incident with Boucher. See id. ¶¶ 194, 196. On December 15, 2017, Dr. Cole sent a note to Zuniga stating "I am now recommending that [Plaintiff] return to work starting January 2, 2018. The only work restriction that I am recommending is that during the performance of his duties [Plaintiff] should have no contact with [Boucher]," and further recommending that any disagreements between Plaintiff and Boucher "be immediately mediated by the Facilities Administrator." Id. ¶ 194. Dr. Cole testified that his reason for recommending no-contact with Boucher was because he "thought the intensity of [Plaintiff's] condition was such that I felt that any contact with . . . Boucher would just exacerbate his condition . . . ." Id. ¶ 196.
Dr. Cole also wrote "If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call." Id. ¶ 194. CDCR did not reach out to Dr. Cole to seek additional information. See id. ¶ 195. Plaintiff wound up returning to work on January 2, 2018. See id. ¶ 211. He did not want to return [*50]  to work, but felt compelled to do so because his benefits had ended effective July 1, 2017, and he had received medical bills for tens of thousands of dollars that he was personally responsible for, and felt his return was the only way to get his benefits reinstated. See id. ¶ 212.
On December 27, 2017, Zuniga emailed Plaintiff in connection with Dr. Cole's request. See id. ¶ 197. She wrote:
Please consider that VYCF is a small correction institution and due to our small size, we are not able to guarantee that you will completely avoid any incidental contact with . . . Boucher, such as in hallways or interior roads, while you are both on VYCF grounds in the performance of your [duties] and his duties. However, subject to the interactive process, we can discuss options to minimize your interaction with . . . Boucher.
Id. ¶ 197; Docket No. 51-36. Branch testified along the same lines as Zuniga's email, stating that due to the "nature of the facility, as small as it is, and . . . Boucher's position and [Plaintiff's] position, they are going to cross paths. They get keys from the same place, they come in the same door, they leave the same door, controlled entries, they are going to cross [*51]  paths." PR ¶ 199. In fact, during his OIA interview, Boucher estimated that he had working contact with Plaintiff five times a month. See id. ¶ 200.
On December 29, 2017, Branch emailed Calzada, Harrison and Facundus regarding Plaintiff's return, stating:
Roy, Please meet with Mike and [Boucher] to discuss the return of [Plaintiff] on Tuesday. He is to be reminded that regardless of this on-going case there is not [to] be any form of any retaliation. If he happens to come across [Plaintiff] at any time he must be 100% professional, polite and courteous. We will be giving [Plaintiff] the same expectations.
Id. ¶ 201; Docket No. 51-37. Branch testified that this "had nothing to do" with Plaintiff's complaints, but that "it would just reduce the stress on both parties to avoid one another," and it was "out of concern for" Plaintiff and Boucher. PR ¶ 202. Harper testified that this was not a workable long-term solution to Plaintiff's complaint, but that she had "not given long-term solution[s] thought at that point." Id. ¶ 203. On January 2, 2028, Branch emailed an individual named Seth Hawkins stating "This is all we can do on this matter. This facility is too small to provide a guarantee [*52]  of the two not coming into contact with one another." Id. ¶ 204.
Shortly after he returned to work, Facundus informed Plaintiff that he needed to tell him whenever he left his desk, unless it was to go to the restroom. See id. ¶ 213. Facundus also testified that Branch had told him to tell Plaintiff that he was to stay away from Boucher. See id. ¶ 215. Shortly after Plaintiff returned to work, Facundus believes he had a discussion with Plaintiff "to try to avoid" Boucher. Id. ¶ 216. He testified that because the facility is so small, "it would be easy for them to cross in the hallway." Id. ¶ 217. Facundus testified that his own desk is only a few feet away from Plaintiff's desk, that he could see Boucher "one time or 100 times" in a week, and that he had come into contact with Boucher twice in the week prior to his testimony even though he only worked three days a week. See id. ¶ 218.
Harrison, Boucher's supervisor, testified that Boucher went to the area where Plaintiff worked on a daily basis, and would walk down the hallway where the bathrooms are located. See id. ¶ 210. He also testified that he was unaware that Plaintiff had requested no contact with Boucher upon his return to work [*53]  in January, and he consequently never discussed the no-contact issue with Boucher. See id. ¶¶ 205-206. Boucher testified that he was not instructed to stay away from Plaintiff, but instead only that if he had business in the admin area or where Plaintiff's office was, he should have somebody else with him. See id. ¶ 207. Harrison testified that he was unaware of Boucher asking him or any other employee to accompany him to the administrative building (where Plaintiff worked) after Plaintiff returned to work in January 2018. See id. ¶ 208. Boucher testified that he did in fact pass one or two feet away from Plaintiff in the admin area hallway one time after Plaintiff returned to work in January 2018. See id. ¶ 209.
14. Executive Review of 402/403 Meeting Regarding the Noose Incident
On or about February 2, 2018, an executive review of the November 2017 402/403 meeting was held. See id. ¶ 224. At the meeting, Harper continued to advocate for a salary reduction for Boucher instead of the more serious demotion penalty. See id. ¶ 227.
Bowlds testified that she did not recall a discussion regarding remedying Plaintiff's EEO complaint at this conference. See id. ¶ 225. She testified that she [*54]  was aware that Plaintiff was alleging that Boucher's intent was to threaten him and threaten his life. See id. ¶ 228. Though the question of whether there was a threat was an important factor for determining how severe any discipline would be, Bowlds testified, the "totality of evidence" was not able to reveal factual information regarding Boucher's intent. See id. ¶¶ 229-230. Nevertheless, she also testified that the executive review committee concluded that Boucher engaged in inappropriate behavior that he should not have done, but that it was not intended to be directed at Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 231. She further testified that Boucher's mere presence at the facility where Plaintiff worked could be a contributing factor to the hostility Plaintiff was complaining about, but that it was not a factor in the determination of any adverse action for Boucher. See id. ¶ 226.
Pursuant to CDCR policy, the "Hiring Authority" is responsible for "[d]etermining and justifying appropriate penalty level for employee misconduct by utilizing the Employee Disciplinary Matrix and completing the CDCR Form 403," up to and including termination. Id. ¶ 234. Under that policy,
[t]he Employee Disciplinary Matrix [*55]  is based on the assumption [1] that there is a single misdeed at issue and [2] that the misdeed is the employee's first adverse action. The Matrix provides a base penalty within a penalty range. The base penalty . . . shall represent the staring point for an action. The Hiring Authority shall impose the base penalty unless aggravating or mitigating factors are found.
Id. ¶ 235; see also id. ¶ 241. The policy also provides that aggravating circumstances may increase a penalty to dismissal, even for misconduct where dismissal is not included in the penalty range. See id. ¶ 242.
According to the 403 Form for Boucher, CDCR considered Matrix categories D10, D13, and D16. See id. ¶ 236. It did not consider "Significant unreasonable use of force likely to cause serious injury," which has a base penalty of 6-9, or "Employee's failure to report his/her own unreasonable use of force," which has a base penalty of 4-9. See id. ¶ 238. It did not consider "Misuse of state property," which CDCR Policy states "[i]ncludes . . . Grossly abusing or mishandling State property." See id. ¶ 239. Harper testified that Boucher did not misuse state property in the form of the noose because he "put it back in [*56]  the truck after he was done playing around with whatever he was doing." Id. ¶ 240.
As a mitigating factor for Boucher, CDCR found that he "accepts responsibility for his . . . actions," he "is remorseful," and he "reported . . . and/or independently initiated steps to mitigate the harm caused in a timely manner." Id. ¶ 243. However, Boucher had told OIA that he believed Plaintiff was "working the system" and was "attempting to make him or the state pay." Id. ¶¶ 179, 244. Boucher also testified that he had not reported the incident because he had "apologized to [Plaintiff], and I thought it was over." Id. ¶ 246.
According to the 403 Form for Boucher and CDCR policy regarding "aggravating factors," CDCR did not consider the following aggravating factors: "[1] The employee had a primary and/or leadership role in the misconduct; [2] Serious consequences occurred or may have occurred from the misconduct; [3] The misconduct was committed with malicious intent or for personal gain; [4] The misconduct resulted in serious injury; [5] The employee has sustained other related adverse action(s)." Id. ¶ 248. Boucher had admitted to the OIA investigator that he had played the only role in the misconduct. [*57]  See id. ¶ 249. Bowlds admitted that someone from CDCR would have needed to talk to Plaintiff about the consequences of Boucher's action to determine if they were "serious consequences," but that they had no information before them on this factor at the executive review conference. Id. ¶ 251.
In addition, Boucher had three prior complaints for which he was disciplined: (1) a counseling for an incident on July 26, 2016 where another CDCR employee alleged, inter alia, Color and Race Discrimination, Hostile Work Environment and mentioned a fear of retaliation; (2) on April 4, 2016, Boucher received a WID "as a result of misuse of dangerous, negligent driving, inexcusable neglect of duty, [and] misuse of state property" because he was "spinning donuts in the grass field behind the gym at a high rate of vehicle speed"; and (3) he received a WID for "falsifying documents and leaving the work site early without asking . . . permission from the supervisor" during annual "block training" to go over policies and procedures, including EEO policies. See id. ¶ 252. CDCR did not consider any of these prior complaints when determining the appropriate punishment for Boucher because "it was not a part [*58]  of the pack in front of [us] to review." Id. ¶ 254. But multiple memoranda regarding the prior EEO complaint and the EEO complaint itself were sent to Harper, who was at both the 402/403 conference and the executive review conference. See id. ¶ 253.
15. Disciplinary Action for Boucher
On February 15, 2018, CDCR issued its Notice of Adverse Action to Boucher stemming from Plaintiff's EEO complaint, with an effective date of March 1, 2018. See id. ¶ 256; see also id. ¶ 260. The Notice informed Boucher that he had been demoted from his position of Stationary Engineer (Correction Facility) to Maintenance Mechanic — reducing his salary from $6,249.00 to $5,354.00 per month — effective March 1, 2018 through March 1, 2021. See id. ¶ 263.
The Notice of Adverse Action issued to Boucher concluded that Boucher's actions had violated Sections 31010.1 and 31040.3.4 of the Department Operations Manual ("DOM"). See id. ¶¶ 257-258. The Notice reflected that the former section represented the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, while the latter concerned Workplace Violence Prevention. See id. It quoted the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy as stating that "[a]ll employees are prohibited from . . . harassing anyone on the basis [*59]  of their protected status. The bases for filing a complaint are: . . . Color . . . Race . . . [and] Verbal and physical conduct that a reasonable person would find threatening, intimidating, or humiliating." Id. ¶ 257. The Notice informed Boucher that he had violated the policy concerning Workplace Violence Prevention because his conduct involved "Harassment — Unwelcome verbal or physical conduct which creates a hostile or intimidating work environment." Id. ¶ 258. It went on to state that "4) Your actions violated the following sections of Department of Juvenile Justice, Workplace Violence Prevention Program . . . maintaining a work environment that is free from acts of violence, threats, harassment, intimidation and other disruptive behaviors." Id. Under "Acts of Misconduct," the Notice concluded:
On approximately May 27, 2017 . . . [y]ou took the rope inside the Property Control Warehouse and threw one end of it over a hanging light fixture. You held the other end of the rope, which had been fashioned into a noose, in your hand. [Plaintiff], who is you[r] black co-worker, was also inside the warehouse. As you held the noose in your hand, you told [Plaintiff] someone or something [*60]  is going to die today, or words to that effect. . . . During your [OIA] interview, you admitted you hung a noose . . . admitted [Plaintiff] saw the hanging noose and that you spoke to [Plaintiff] about the noose . . . [and] admitted [Plaintiff] did not laugh at your comment, and that you realized you had offended [Plaintiff] by hanging the noose . . . .
Id. ¶ 259; Docket No. 52-3, at CDCR-01422.
Bowlds testified that she did not consider the effect on Plaintiff of the nine month delay between Plaintiff's internal complaint and the adverse action against Boucher. See PR ¶ 262. Harper testified that she understood that Boucher's Adverse Action "might not have remedied, you know, [Plaintiff's] complaint." Id. ¶ 265.
Pursuant to CDCR policies, "the Department has the right to use corrective and/or adverse action, such as . . . ineligibility for raises or promotions . . . transfers, suspensions . . . or termination of employment." Id. ¶ 266. "Mandatory transfer" is a permitted form of disciplinary action. See id. ¶ 267. None of these measures were taken to prevent Plaintiff and Boucher from coming into contact with one another. See id. ¶ 268.
16. Boucher Appeals — Settlement of the Appeal
Boucher [*61]  appealed his Adverse Action to the State Personnel Board because he thought it was "harsh" and "a little excessive." Id. ¶¶ 269-270. Plaintiff attended Boucher's appeal, and testified that when he saw Boucher there for 10 or 15 seconds, Plaintiff felt "[a] numbing feeling overcame" him, "emotionally, mentally, physically." Id. ¶ 289.
On June 7, 2018, Defendant agreed to reduce the demotion to a salary reduction and reinstated Boucher to his former position as a Stationary Engineer effective at the beginning of business on March 1, 2018. See id. ¶ 270. Bowlds testified that she approved this settlement agreement, and did so without discussing it with Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 272. She also testified that, after this settlement agreement, Boucher had a better title than he did on May 27, 2017. See id. ¶ 273. Harrison testified that Boucher retained his "Stationary Engineer" title despite the adverse action, and never stopped doing the duties of a stationary engineer after his promotion. See id. ¶ 264. CDCR also agreed to remove the Notice of Adverse Action and all supporting documentation from Boucher's official personnel file on or after March 1, 2020. See id. ¶ 274.
On March 1, 2020, Boucher [*62]  regained his prior Stationary Engineer position, his pay in that position, and was eligible to have the "adverse action" he had received removed from his personnel file. See id. ¶ 300.
17. Second EEOC Charge
On May 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC where he alleged what he believed were instances of hostility and retaliation as a result of his prior complaints of a hostile work environment. See id. ¶ 276. Specifically, Plaintiff complained about being subjected to different terms and conditions of employment by Branch, including being accused of being away without leave; that his medical accommodation request had been denied with no interactive process; that his supervisor was reporting his movement throughout the facility; and that he was given a negative counseling/WID for an incident that occurred in or around February 2017 in retaliation for his complaints of discrimination. See id.
18. Plaintiff Retires
On February 15, 2020, Plaintiff felt compelled to file for retirement. See id. ¶ 297. Plaintiff testified that he would still be working for Defendant if it were not for the May 27, 2017 incident and Defendant's failure to remedy his complaint. [*63]  See id. ¶ 299.
E. Defendant's Motion
As noted, in its motion, Defendant challenges each of Plaintiff's three causes of action.
1. Race Discrimination
Plaintiff's first claim for relief is for race discrimination in violation of Title VII. Title VII protects against discrimination based upon race and color, among other characteristics. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) ("It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer — (1) . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his . . . terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race [or] color . . . .").
So as not to bury the lede, the Court will start here by stating the conclusion — there are several reasons why it believes Defendant has not demonstrated a basis to prevail on summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's first claim for relief. As a general observation influencing at least some of these reasons, a moving party in a motion for summary judgment cannot prevail on summary judgment based on an argument not raised in its opening brief. Beyond that initial note, the Court briefly discusses the reasons why it does not believe summary judgment is possible here.
First, citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993), Defendant actually begins its [*64]  argument on this claim by stating that "[u]nder Title VII, discrimination can consist of a negative employment action or arise when an employer harbors a hostile work environment." Docket No. 55, at 18:9-12; see Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 ("The phrase 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.") (omitting internal quotation marks) (quoting Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986)); see also Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 752, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998) (indicating that harassing conduct that is "severe or pervasive" can produce a "constructive alteration[] in the terms or conditions of employment"). While Defendant then proceeds to a discussion of reasons why it feels Plaintiff cannot take the "negative employment action" route — lack of an adverse employment action (with particular attention to why the WID issued to Plaintiff does not qualify) and reasons for the actions in question — the Court believes that the hostile work environment option is the most-direct route to resolving the challenge to this claim on this motion.
On this topic, Defendant emphasizes that conduct must be sufficiently [*65]  severe or pervasive, that all circumstances must be considered in assessing that question, and that a single incident is typically insufficient. None of this is controversial. See Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 923 (9th Cir. 2000). Defendant then acknowledges that display of a noose in the workplace, when aimed at a particular employee, may give rise to a Title VII claim. However, Defendant compares Plaintiff's case — unfavorably — to Henry v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 37 F.Supp.3d 1067 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff'd, 644 Fed. Appx. 787 (9th Cir. 2016), where the district court granted summary judgment in the defendant's favor after it determined that the record was devoid of any evidence that a noose was directed at the plaintiff personally or that it served as a threat of violence to him specifically (while commenting that had there been such evidence, it may have agreed that the severity supported a hostile work environment claim).3
Specifically, in Henry the plaintiff had first alleged that another employee had discovered a noose in a locked maintenance room, but the plaintiff did not allege that he personally had seen this noose. See id. at 1073. He then alleged that a specific supervisor had hung another noose in the workplace and that the plaintiff had seen that noose that same day. See id. at 1073, 1085. Prior to citing two district court decisions that had [*66]  found "a single display of a noose sufficient to defeat summary judgment," the Henry court commented that "if plaintiff had provided evidence that the noose was directed at him personally (either by being placed in his personal work area such as his locker, or containing a note or a picture indicating that he was the target of the display), then the court would agree that the noose could serve as a threat of violence," but that the plaintiff had offered no evidence "that the noose served as a threat of violence to him specifically." Id. at 1086 (citing, in contrast, Wilson v. N.Y. City DOT, No. 01 Civ. 7398(RJH), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21620, 2005 WL 2385866, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2005) and Smith v. Town of Hempstead Dep't of Sanitation Sanitary Dist. No. 2, 798 F.Supp.2d 443, 453 (E.D.N.Y.2011)); see also Ferguson v. Walmart, No. CV 12-04434 RSWL, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 608, 2014 WL 24139, *9 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 2, 2014) (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment as to hostile work environment theory where, among other things, noose had been placed on forklift);
In attempting to draw significance for its own motion from Henry, what Defendant appears to overlook is that the Court must view the evidence, and draw inferences from it, in favor of the non-moving party at summary judgment. On summary judgment, this Court cannot reach the conclusion that the district court in Henry did. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff (the non-moving party), Plaintiff was the only individual [*67]  in the warehouse (or at least in sight) when Boucher entered with the noose, swung it over a light fixture, and — calling attention to himself by saying "Hey, look what I found in the truck" — he then said "Somebody or something needs to be hanging today," "grab a chair, someone is going to die today," or some near-equivalent. See PR ¶¶ 18-21, 23, 25; DR ¶¶ 25, 33. Defendant in fact acknowledges in its Reply that "[t]he evidence is . . . undisputed that, when Mr. Boucher noticed Plaintiff's presence in the warehouse, that was when Mr. Boucher made the comment[] 'Someone or something is getting hanging today.'" Docket No. 72, at 21:21-22:1. Boucher then took the noose down before any other coworker could see it.
Certainly a fact-finder could conclude that this conduct was "directed at" Plaintiff in this situation. Because of the historic significance — particularly to African-Americans — of nooses (actual or depictions thereof), the Court comfortably concludes that a reasonable fact-finder could find just this single instance sufficiently severe/pervasive so as to create a hostile work environment (though it would not be required to do so, as addressed further infra in connection with [*68]  Plaintiff's motion).4 That Boucher later attempted to apologize or apologized to Plaintiff does not conclusively negate that behavior, see, e.g., Harris, 510 U.S. at 19, though a factfinder of course might conceivably place some weight on that fact in assessing whether Plaintiff has identified sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct under the totality of the circumstances.
Defendant argues in its Reply that the noose incident did not change the terms and conditions of Plaintiff's employment, even if it was by itself sufficiently severe or pervasive. Instead, it argues that any change in this regard was a product of Plaintiff's own doing (presumably referring to Plaintiff's decision to take leave). But this is clearly a one-sided view of the evidence, and also not fairly-reflective of the hostile work environment-based theory recognized in Harris. See Harris, 510 U.S. at 22 ("A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees' psychological wellbeing, can and often will detract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the [*69]  discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broad rule of workplace equality."); see also Chin, Cathcart, Callahan & Lowe, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION (The Rutter Group 2019) ("Chin & Cathcart"), ¶ 10-112, at 10-28 ("Unlike quid pro quo claims, there is no requirement that plaintiff suffer loss of tangible job benefits or actual injury in order to state a hostile environment harassment claim.").
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant is liable by way of a ratification theory due to its failure to take appropriate and reasonable responsive action, due to Branch's signal of his intent to support Boucher, and indeed by Defendant promoting Boucher. See Freitag v. Ayers, 468 F.3d 528, 538 (9th Cir. 2006) ("In the Ninth Circuit, employers are liable for harassing conduct . . . 'where the employer either ratifies or acquiesces in the harassment by not taking immediate and/or corrective actions when it knew or should have known of the conduct.'") (quoting Folkerson v. Circus Circus Enters., Inc., 107 F.3d 754, 756 (9th Cir. 1997)). Here too the Court believes that there is evidence to support this theory such that a reasonable factfinder could find in Plaintiff's favor. [*70] 
Defendant asserts in its Reply that it cannot be liable for the conduct of Boucher, a non-supervisory employee,5 where it can establish that it took prompt remedial action. Here, Defendant emphasizes Facundus immediately taking Plaintiff to see Brown after Plaintiff reported the incident to Facundus; Brown's issuance of the cease-and-desist letter to Boucher on June 7, 2017; Facundus and Harrison both speaking to Boucher on May 31, 2017; Harper — after she received materials compiled by Markle — signing the request for an OIA investigation and submitting the OIA request package to CIU on July 12, 2017; OIA's acceptance of the request for investigation, assignment of a Special Agent, and reference of the matter back to Harper for implementation of adverse action; and the discipline it ultimately issued to Boucher (which, it acknowledges, Boucher succeeded in reducing after he appealed and the parties settled).
Yet, even if all this is true, and even if the Court were to conclude that waiting until June 7, 2017 to issue the cease and desist letter and waiting until July 12, 2017 for Harper to forward the 989 Package for investigation referral (perhaps [*71]  especially in light of Harper's admission that she never even read Plaintiff's Internal EEO Complaint and did not even know that Boucher's OIA interview had been completed 44 days after it had been) were consistent with, and reflective of, exercising reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior, the Court still believes there is room for a reasonable factfinder — for reasons addressed, infra — to conclude that Defendant did not take prompt, effective, remedial action.
Because Defendant admits that a hostile work environment-based theory is one avenue of sustaining a claim of racial discrimination, and because there is a triable issue as to whether Defendant took prompt and effective remedial action, the Court could stop here in its explanation of why it believes Defendant's motion must be denied as to Plaintiff's first claim. But there are other reasons as well.
In his Opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has only attempted to address the noose incident involving Boucher, not Plaintiff's assertion that he was called a "nigger" on "a daily basis" by inmates, or the conduct he indicates he suffered at the hands of supervisors — at least certain aspects [*72]  of which are omitted from the factual recitations above in order to limit that discussion to only the facts most-necessary to the outcome here — after he made his complaint about Boucher's conduct. Defendant responds that Plaintiff cannot base any hostile work environment theory or claim on any conduct by the inmates/wards because it was not included in either of his EEOC Charges.6See United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1977) ("A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge . . . may constitute relevant background evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current practice is at issue, but separately considered, it is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences."). This assertion in Defendant's Reply spawned a motion to strike Plaintiff filed on December 11, 2020. See Docket No. 75; see also Docket No. 76.
While it is effectively the same issue Defendant raises in connection with its Opposition to Plaintiff's motion, as to Defendant's motion Plaintiff is correct. If Defendant sought to ground any pursuit of summary judgment on that argument, it should have raised it in its opening brief.7 To the extent that Defendant's response to that observation [*73]  is that it did not foresee Plaintiff raising these acts in support of his claims in his Opposition, that is an oversight that should have been corrected via discovery. See also Footnote 10, infra. As such, the Court will not consider the exhaustion argument Defendant raises in its Reply in support of its own motion. As a result, even if Plaintiff had no hope of relying on the noose incident with Boucher as a "single incident" basis for a hostile work environment-based race discrimination claim, Defendant still could not prevail on this motion with respect to this claim because it did not properly fully cover and rule-out all of the conduct Plaintiff attempts to rely upon in support of the claim.
Beyond all of that, the Court is not necessarily even convinced that, if Plaintiff were not able to go down the hostile work environment-based path recognized in Harris, the WID issued to Plaintiff could not be considered an adverse employment action. There may be other difficulties Plaintiff would have to face and might not be able to overcome with a claim based upon that theory/evidence, but an argument that it conclusively is not an adverse employment action is not overwhelmingly-persuasive. [*74] 
For each of the foregoing reasons, the Court does not believe that Defendant has sufficiently presented a case for ruling in its favor on its motion with respect to Plaintiff's first claim for relief.
2. Race Harassment/Hostile Work Environment
Plaintiff's second claim is for harassment based on race in violation of Title VII. "To succeed on a hostile work environment claim based on race, the plaintiff must demonstrate: '(1) that he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct of a racial . . . nature; (2) that the conduct was unwelcome; and (3) that the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create an abusive work environment.'" Reynaga v. Roseburg Forest Prods., 847 F.3d 678, 686-87 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Vasquez v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir. 2003)); see also Campbell v. Haw. Dep't of Educ., 892 F.3d 1005, 1016 (9th Cir. 2018); Chin & Cathcart, ¶¶ 10:265-270, at 10-60 - 10-62. "The working environment must both subjectively and objectively be perceived as abusive." Fuller v. City of Oakland, 47 F.3d 1522, 1527 (9th Cir. 1995); see also Brooks, 229 F.3d at 923. "As to the objective inquiry, we assess whether the workplace was hostile from the perspective of a reasonable person belonging to the plaintiff's racial or ethnic group." Reynaga, 847 F.3d at 687. As noted above in connection with the first claim, "[i]n determining whether an actionable hostile work environment claim exists, we look to 'all the circumstances,' [*75]  including 'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" AMTRAK v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 116, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23). Plaintiff must also be able to show that Defendant itself is liable for any conduct prohibited by a hostile work environment claim. See Campbell, 892 F.3d at 1017.
The Court's thinking behind denial of Defendant's motion insofar as Plaintiff's second claim for relief is concerned is aided, of course, by its discussion of the first claim (to the extent that claim is likewise reliant on a hostile work environment theory). Again, it regards the noose incident — when the facts are viewed in favor of Plaintiff, as the nonmoving party — as potentially being a significant-enough single-incident to give rise to a claim that a reasonable fact-finder could resolve in Plaintiff's favor.8 The Court therefore has no need, at least at this point in time, to consider what the evidence of the use of the "n" word towards Plaintiff and the conduct of Plaintiff's supervisors towards Plaintiff after he submitted his Internal EEO Complaint would add to his hostile work environment claim.
Beyond that foundational severe-and-pervasive conduct issue, Defendant's argument here is — similar to its argument on Plaintiff's first claim — focused on an employer's ability to avoid liability for a co-worker's harassment by taking prompt, effective action.9
Once an employer knows or should know of harassment, a remedial obligation kicks in. That obligation will not be discharged until action—prompt, effective action—has been taken. Effectiveness will be measured by the twin purposes of ending the current harassment and deterring future harassment—by the same offender or others. If 1) no remedy is undertaken, or 2) the remedy attempted is ineffectual, liability will attach.
Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1528-29 (internal citations omitted); see also Swenson v. Potter, 271 F.3d 1184, 1192 (9th Cir. 2001) ("If the employer fails to take corrective action after learning of an employee's . . . harassing conduct, or takes inadequate action that emboldens the harasser to continue his misconduct, the employer can be deemed to have 'adopt[ed] the offending conduct and its results, quite as if they had been authorized affirmatively as the employer's policy.'") (quoting Faragher, 524 U.S. at 789); id. ("Notice of the sexually harassing conduct triggers an employer's duty to take prompt [*77]  corrective action that is 'reasonably calculated to end the harassment.'") (quoting Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 256 F.3d 864, 875 (9th Cir. 2001)).
Defendant specifically acknowledges that in evaluating the effectiveness of a remedy, a court may take into account the remedy's ability to "persuade individual harassers to discontinue unlawful conduct" and "persuade potential harassers to refrain from unlawful conduct." Ellison, 924 F.2d at 882. Defendant argues that it may not be liable, given this standard, because this is the only incident that occurred between Plaintiff and Boucher, it "did not have a history of misconduct for Mr. Boucher (WIDs for tardiness, cell phone usage, swearing, and relating to his driving) to put CDCR on notice of his May 27 conduct with the noose," and it "promptly responded and took immediate corrective action." Docket No. 55, at 26:26-27:3.
However, the Court believes that there is room for a factfinder to disagree that Defendant took prompt, effective action. There are several facts that would support such a conclusion. At a minimum, there were time-gaps in the action Defendant did take, most-notably a gap before Brown issued the cease and desist letter to Boucher, and a gap before Harper referred the 989 Package to the OIA for investigation. [*78]  While the former was not a significant gap, and it may be difficult for Plaintiff to argue that it was not prompt enough, the Court has not seen a particularly-convincing explanation for the latter gap (other than it apparently took a while for Markle to gather relevant documentation).
Even ignoring the promptness issue, there is perhaps even more of an issue with the effectiveness question. On the one hand, Plaintiff may have a difficult time with that issue because he was largely absent from the workplace after the noose incident, so his interactions with Boucher were extremely limited after that point in time. However, looking at the contents of the actions Defendant took towards Boucher, there are still potential problems for Defendant here.
Brown's cease and desist letter left Boucher a lot of room to believe that his conduct was not all that problematic, a conclusion the evidence reveals that he actually reached. Moreover, just a couple months after the noose incident, he was promoted, despite the fact that the only other qualified candidate for the position in question was effectively disqualified because of comments he made. See PR ¶¶ 143, 146-147. When Plaintiff returned to [*79]  work in January 2018, there is evidence that Boucher was not told to stay away from Boucher, but was instead only told to have someone accompany him any time he might come in contact with Plaintiff. When Boucher ultimately was disciplined, a factfinder could conclude that it was insufficient in that — given his promotion in the interim — it effectively returned him to the title and pay he was already enjoying at the time of the noose incident. Even if, as a result, he was performing the work of a Stationary Engineer at that previous title and pay, he was already performing that work at his previous pay (albeit via overtime) prior to the noose incident. And, ultimately, following his appeal and settlement of that appeal, he was returned to the Stationary Engineer title. In short, there is enough here for a factfinder to question the effectiveness of Defendant's action.
On the issue of whether it took prompt and adequate remedial action, Defendant points out that an employer is not required to dispense with fair procedures for those accused, but just needs to take actions that were reasonably calculated to stop/prevent the offending conduct of which it was aware from reoccurring. See [*80]  Campbell, 892 F.3d at 1018. While that may be true, it is still seemingly a jury question here as to whether Defendant actually took steps that were reasonably likely to prevent the conduct from reoccurring. If Defendant's cease and desist practices leave room for uncertainty as to whether hanging a noose in the workplace — with an African-American employee as the sole "audience" — is improper or in violation of workplace policies, as appears to have been Boucher's interpretation here, it is safe to say that a factfinder might itself have questions about Defendant's own conduct.
Defendant's motion is denied with respect to Plaintiff's second cause of action.
3. Retaliation
Finally, the Court reaches the same conclusion as above with respect to Defendant's motion insofar as Plaintiff's third claim is concerned — the motion must be denied.
Plaintiff's third claim is for retaliation based on race in violation of Title VII. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee because the employee "has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing [*81]  under this subchapter." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). "To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, Plaintiff has to be able to demonstrate that '(1) []he engaged in a protected activity, (2) []he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between h[is] activity and the employment decision.'" Stegall v. Citadel Broad. Co., 350 F.3d 1061, 1065-66 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Raad v. Fairbanks North Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1196-97 (9th Cir.2003)). If he is able to make out a prima facie retaliation claim, the "burden shifting" scheme articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies. See id. In most cases, this winds up requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate that reasons an employer gave for a decision were actually pretext for a discriminatory motive. See Stegall, 350 F.3d at 1066.
Beyond setting forth general legal principles governing a Title VII retaliation claim, and a court's assessment thereof, Defendant's entire presentation in relation to Plaintiff's retaliation claim consists of arguing that the WID, and Branch's issuance of it, cannot support a retaliation claim because of the timing of its issuance and because it cannot constitute an adverse employment action. It asserts that, on May 15, 2017, Harper submitted a request for an OIA investigation into Plaintiff's February 27, 2017 conduct, and the WID was issued on September 30, 2017 while Plaintiff [*82]  was out on leave. Defendant also argues — without citation to authority — that a "WID is not considered an adverse action, but instead instructive, corrective, and preventive by nature." Docket No. 55, 28:20-21.
In his Opposition brief, however, Plaintiff identifies a series of other acts he believes were retaliatory (and harassing). See Docket No. 64, at 2:13-23. Defendant's failure to address almost all of them in its opening brief10 necessarily means that it cannot prevail as to this claim at summary judgment. Defendant's attempt to address them in its Reply brief comes too late for purposes of this motion.11
Even if the Court were to limit Plaintiff — for no obvious good reason — to the issue of the WID, he argues (citing Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 173, 131 S. Ct. 863, 178 L. Ed. 2d 694 (2011)) that a far-broader range of employer conduct constitutes an adverse employment action for purposes of retaliation than for purposes of discrimination:
[In Burlington], we held that "the antiretaliation provision [in Title VII], unlike the substantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment." Rather, Title VII's antiretaliation provision prohibits any employer action that "well might have dissuaded a reasonable [*83]  worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination."
Thompson, 562 U.S. at 174 (omitting internal citations) (quoting Burlington, 548 U.S. at 64, 68); see also Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 506 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that effect on performance review (including undeserved performance ratings), decrease in job responsibilities, exclusion from meetings, prevention of receipt of necessary information, and downgrade in promotability status are all actions sufficient to establish retaliation) (citing, among other cases, Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987)); cf. Flores v. City of Westminster, 873 F.3d 739, 749 (9th Cir. 2017) (noting in case brought under California Fair Employment and Housing Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1981, that "[a]t the very least, the jury could infer that Officer Flores's removal from the FTO list, written reprimand, and negative Log entries would have been reviewed as part of any decision whether or not to award him special assignments or promote him, and would have harmed his prospects."). Beyond whether or not a WID can constitute an "employer action that 'well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination,'" Plaintiff has also presented evidence that the WID dealt with an incident that occurred in February 2017, that the expectation is that WIDs are issued within 30 days of an incident, and that here the WID was not even drafted [*84]  until September 2017 (and ultimately given to Plaintiff, after he returned to the workplace, in January 2018). Why the WID would be issued in that manner, and with that timing — especially in light of the other evidence submitted in connection with this motion demonstrating that Branch was not happy with Plaintiff and was taking actions favoring Boucher — are questions that a reasonable factfinder could rely upon to make a pretext finding and to ultimately support a pro-Plaintiff outcome on the claim. See Stegall, 350 F.3d at 1066 (recognizing that pretext may be shown via a demonstration that the employer's stated reason for an action is "unworthy of credence") (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)); see also Flores, 873 F.3d at 750 (noting that "three to eight months [between protected activity and employment action] is easily within a time range that can support an inference of retaliation").
Both because Defendant limited its initial consideration of this claim to the WID and because the question of whether or not a WID can constitute a sufficient adverse employment action (at least for purposes of a retaliation claim) is not as cut-and-dried as Defendant asserts it is, Plaintiff's retaliation claim survives this proceeding. The motion is denied as to this [*85]  claim. As such, because Defendant's motion is denied with respect to each of the claims challenged by the motion, the Court denies Defendant's motion in its entirety.
F. Plaintiff's Motion
Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment only with respect to his second claim for relief, for harassment based on race in violation of Title VII. The Court set out the contours of what Plaintiff would need to prove to prevail upon this claim in connection with its discussion of Defendant's motion, supra.
Although he believes the noose incident with Boucher on May 27, 2017 is sufficient in and of itself to create a hostile working environment, Plaintiff also points to being called "nigger" by inmates, and to evidence that Branch considered him unethical, which Plaintiff believes led to a series of other consequences that Plaintiff considers to have been retaliatory and harmful/adverse to himself or to his interests. Plaintiff also focuses on the contention that it took nine months to issue an adverse action against Boucher after Boucher admitted his May 27, 2017 conduct to Facundus on May 31, 2017, and, in the interim — approximately 11 weeks after the May 27, 2017 incident — Defendant promoted [*86]  Boucher. Plaintiff considers Boucher's promotion to constitute Defendant's ratification of Boucher's conduct. Plaintiff further notes that Harper never read his EEO complaint (in which he complained about a hostile work environment) and Defendant never removed Boucher from Plaintiff's workplace. Meanwhile, when Defendant eventually issued the adverse action against Boucher, it consisted of — in light of Boucher's promotion in the interim — a demotion/salary reduction to the same position Boucher had occupied at the time of the May 27, 2017 incident (which was then changed to allow Boucher to keep the promoted title and to limit the salary reduction to a period of two years).
A factfinder might conclude that Plaintiff has a strong case in connection with this claim. On the other hand, as addressed further below, it might not. In setting forth the standard applicable to summary judgment motions in his motion, Plaintiff overlooks the fact that, on his motion, he faces the high-hurdles imposed by Southern California Gas and Shakur. There are enough potential weaknesses in Plaintiff's case that he cannot clear this high bar at summary judgment.
In addition to the difficulty for Plaintiff [*87]  posed by Southern California Gas and Shakur, Plaintiff admits that — as the Court has pointed out several times above — courts are to consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. See, e.g., Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270-71, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001). It certainly may be said that, when all circumstances are considered, there are several aspects relevant to Plaintiff's situation that do not favor a conclusion that he suffered severe and pervasive conduct sufficient to support a hostile work environment.
A factfinder could conclude that the noose incident involving Boucher was not sufficiently severe or pervasive, by itself, to constitute a hostile work environment. In so doing, a reasonable factfinder could emphasize that it was the sole incident of arguably race-based conflict between Boucher and Plaintiff, resulted from Boucher having found (as opposed to having fashioned himself) a rope in the form of a noose, and Boucher attempted to apologize for his actions later that same day.12 A factfinder could reasonably reach the conclusion that Boucher's action on May 27, 2017 was simply an instance of an incredibly poor-taste attempt to [*88]  make a joke. These same conclusions — if a factfinder reaches them — would support a rejection of Plaintiff's theory that Boucher's "mere presence" in the workplace would constitute a hostile working environment.
Although Plaintiff argues that Defendant ratified Boucher's conduct by virtue of evidence that Branch supported Boucher in the process, that Defendant promoted Boucher before the investigation into his conduct had been completed, and that Defendant issued what Plaintiff views as insufficient disciplinary action, again, a factfinder could take a different view of the evidence. There is evidence — which must be viewed in Defendant's favor on Plaintiff's motion — that those in charge of the process did not believe they could question Boucher about the noose incident during the interview process for the Stationary Engineer position. There is also evidence that those in charge did not believe they could stop the process of Boucher's promotion while the investigation into the noose incident was ongoing. There is also evidence that could support Defendant's conclusion that the disciplinary action it issued was appropriate to the circumstances, if it reached the conclusion [*89]  — as a factfinder might conclude was reasonable — that Boucher's conduct, while unquestionably wrong/inappropriate, was a single-incident, and that there was nothing that could be done (given that conclusion and given the nature/size of the workplace) to ensure that Boucher and Plaintiff would never come in contact again. A factfinder might also conclude that the talks Facundus and Harrison had with Boucher, and Brown's cease and desist letter, was sufficient precautionary action in the interim, and that once Plaintiff soon thereafter took a leave of absence, there was little reason to take further interim or immediate action along the lines of separating Plaintiff and Boucher.
Sharing at least some similarities with his ratification-based theory, Plaintiff also argues that Defendant is liable for Boucher's conduct in connection with the noose incident because Defendant did not take prompt and effective remedial action (a theory of liability outlined above in connection with Defendant's motion). See generally Folkerson, 107 F.3d at 756 ("We have . . . held that employers may be liable for failing to prevent or remedy . . . harassment among co-workers of which management-level employees knew or in the exercise [*90]  of reasonable care should have known."). He argues in detail that neither the June 7, 2017 cease-and-desist letter, nor the investigation into Plaintiff's complaint, nor the adverse action issued against Boucher were prompt or effective. A large part of his argument concerns Defendant's failure to remove Boucher from the workplace (which led Plaintiff to take an extended unpaid leave of absence from work), while he also take issues with both the timing of the cease and desist letter, investigation and adverse action against Boucher, and the fact that the cease and desist letter made Boucher the judge of whether he had engaged in behavior that violated policy. See Mockler v. Multnomah Cty., 140 F.3d 808, 813 (9th Cir. 1998) ("We have held that an effective remedy is one that is 'reasonably calculated to end the harassment' and such remedy should be 'assessed proportionately to the seriousness of the offense.' The reasonableness and adequacy of the remedy depends upon its ability to stop the individual harasser from continuing to engage in such conduct and to discourage other potential harassers from engaging in similar unlawful conduct.") (quoting Ellison, 924 F.2d at 882); Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1528-29 ("If 1) no remedy is undertaken, or 2) the remedy attempted is ineffectual, liability will [*91]  attach."); id. at 1529 ("[A]n investigation is principally a way to determine whether any remedy is needed and cannot substitute for the remedy itself."); Ellison, 924 F.2d at 883 n.19 ("If harassers are not removed from the workplace when their mere presence creates a hostile environment, employers have not fully remedied the harassment. When employers cannot schedule harassers to work at another location or during different hours, employers may have to dismiss employees whose mere presence creates a hostile environment.").
With respect to the investigation, Plaintiff faults it for only being initiated after Plaintiff's EEOC charge of discrimination, for failing to include an interview of Plaintiff himself (and therefore not fully appreciating/understanding Plaintiff's concerns/complaints), and for giving Boucher nine days' notice before his own OIA interview. See McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1121 (9th Cir. 2004) (reversing employer-favorable summary judgment ruling and remanding for further proceedings because, among other things, waiting to initiate remedial action until after plaintiff had filed complaint with EEOC was, on facts of that case, not compliant with Title VII's requirement of prompt remedial action); Mockler, 140 F.3d at 813 ("The failure to interview witnesses is evidence of inadequate [*92]  remedial action."). With respect to the adverse action against Boucher, not only does Plaintiff believe there was far too long of a delay for the action, but he also argues that it was not really all that "adverse" — in that it ultimately left Boucher better off than he had been on May 27, 2017 — and should have resulted in Boucher's removal from the workplace, via either transfer or termination.
The Court agrees that there are potentially problems for Defendant with respect to certain aspects of the timing, content and nature of Defendant's response to the noose incident. Specifically, a reasonable factfinder could emphasize the amount of time it took to issue the cease and desist letter to Boucher, the content of that letter (seemingly leaving it to Boucher to identify improper conduct), the amount of time it took Harper to refer the 989 Package for the noose incident to the OIA for investigation, the failure to interview Plaintiff or otherwise learn of the nature and extent of his concerns, and the ultimate disciplinary outcome for Boucher. On the other hand, a reasonable factfinder might emphasize the fact that Facundus and Harrison spoke to Boucher immediately upon learning of [*93]  the noose incident, that Facundus immediately brought Plaintiff to Brown upon learning of the incident, that Boucher expressed contrition the day of the incident, that the situational landscape changed once Plaintiff went out on leave, that Defendant ultimately found that Boucher had violated various policies, that the nature/size of the workplace did not realistically permit separation of Plaintiff and Boucher (especially if the conclusion that the noose incident was a single incident was reasonable), and that Defendant issued disciplinary action against him that impacted him for two years (even if there are reasonable grounds for arguing that the action was not adverse enough).13 Again, this makes it clear enough that this theory for Defendant's liability is not so cut-and-dried that Plaintiff can prevail under Southern California Gas and Shakur. See Mockler, 140 F.3d at 813 (indicating that burden is on plaintiff to show that employer knew or should have known of harassment and that it took no effectual action to correct the situation).14
With respect to Plaintiff being called a "nigger" by inmates,15 a factfinder could conclude that this did not occur on a "daily [*94]  basis," as Plaintiff asserts, given that there appears to be only a single documented instance of it occurring (especially with the facts viewed in Defendant's favor). Cases Plaintiff characterizes as concluding that repeated exposure to racist remarks is sufficient to create a race-based hostile work environment would, in that light, not necessarily make Plaintiff's case for him. Beyond that, a factfinder could place some weight on the fact that this is a correctional setting, not to excuse the behavior, but to assess what an employee working in that particular type of setting might actually expect to confront from non-employees with whom they interact.
Though Plaintiff cites Freitag, 468 F.3d at 539-40, as supporting the view that it does not matter that the remarks came from an inmate instead of an employee, at least where the employer does nothing to address the issue, Freitag was an appeal from a jury verdict, involved evidence of repeated sexually harassing conduct, and recognized the defendant's citation of "several cases in which federal courts have treated prisons differently in the context of civil rights claims," including hostile work environment claims (while also not precluding [*95]  the possibility of a successful claim in that context). See id. at 538-39. Given the correctional setting, that only a single instance was documented and what a factfinder might determine about an employee working in such a setting might expect to encounter, even if it is true, as Plaintiff argues, that Defendant has presented "zero record evidence" in support of its position that it took action in response to the youth ward calling Plaintiff "nigger" and that the Court should therefore disregard Defendant's argument in this respect, see Docket No. 70, at 7:7-12, this Court still cannot conclude that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to rule in favor of Plaintiff on this claim. A factfinder might very well conclude that the conduct was not sufficiently severe/pervasive.
Beyond the noose incident, Plaintiff's theory of Defendant's "ratification" of that incident, and the evidence of Plaintiff being called a "nigger" by a youth ward (or wards), Plaintiff has evidence of various actions taken by his supervisors which he believes were inappropriate. But there is no evidence the Court is aware of that indicates that any of those actions were race/color-based. Even if the Court is wrong in that [*96]  conclusion or has overlooked an argument in that regard, it is certainly true that any evidence of that is not overwhelming or convincing enough to allow Plaintiff to prevail at summary judgment under Southern California Gas/Shakur. That this conduct was carried out by his supervisors, therefore, is not all that meaningful, at least for purposes of this motion. For the same reason, this is also true with respect to any failure to take prompt or effective remedial action in relation to this particular conduct.
In sum, for the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Plaintiff's motion.

III. Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, the Court denies both motions.
