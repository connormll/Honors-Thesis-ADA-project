Opinion



ORDER
This cause comes before the Court on Defendant Walt Disney Park and Resorts U.S., Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Susan J. Grill's Complaint. (Doc. 18). Plaintiff responded in opposition (Doc. 20), and the Motion is now ripe for review. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will DENY in part and GRANT in part Defendant's Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff brings this lawsuit against Defendant for violations of Title III and Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182 and 12203, ("ADA"), seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and costs.1 (Doc. 1 at 1.) The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. (Id. ¶ 1.)
Plaintiff is a disabled individual as defined by the ADA. (Id. ¶ 16.) Plaintiff suffers from epilepsy, migraines, and mobility issues. (Id. ¶ 3.) She has a written doctor's certificate stating that she suffers from recurrent chronic [*2]  medical conditions that are complex and requires the use of a service animal to accompany her at all times and in all places. (Id.) Plaintiff has a service dog. (Id. ¶ 16.) Her service dog is individually trained to perform tasks for Plaintiff, including (1) alerting Plaintiff to her seizures and migraines so that she can timely take medication; (2) providing Plaintiff with mobility assistance in the form of counterbalancing when she walks; (3) pulling her wheelchair when needed; and (4) retrieving items dropped by Plaintiff, whose dizziness makes it difficult for her to bend over. (Id.) Her dog qualifies as a service animal pursuant to the ADA. (Id.) Plaintiff is also a service dog trainer. (Id. ¶ 5.) Occasionally, Plaintiff will use two service dogs for herself, and frequently she will have multiple dogs in addition to the one or two she may use while training. (Id.)
Defendant is a corporation doing business in Florida. (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant owns and operates Disney Springs, an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. (Id.) Plaintiff uses Defendant's parks on a regular basis, including Disney Springs, because her service [*3]  animals are exposed to interactions with people in a variety of circumstances that both enhance her service animal training and provide personal enjoyment of what Defendant's parks have to offer. (Id. ¶ 6.)
On or about February 11, 2017, Plaintiff was walking three "service dogs"2 at Disney Springs. (Id. ¶ 7.) One of the dogs was her own service dog, another belonged to her friend who needed her dog for assistance in walking, and the third dog was in training to become a service dog. (Id.) The dogs were well-behaved and were wearing clearly labeled gear identifying them as "service dogs." (Id.) Plaintiff was on her way to the Service Animal Relief Area when she was approached by two of Defendant's security guards who stopped her and asked if she was training. (Id. ¶ 8.) She stated that she was. (Id.) The security guards told her that she could not train at Disney Springs. (Id.) Plaintiff advised the security guards that she was not violating any law and that Florida law permitted trainers to bring service dogs in training anywhere that service dogs were permitted, which included Disney Springs. (Id.)
Plaintiff and the security guards were joined by a uniformed Orange County Deputy [*4]  Sheriff who upon Plaintiff's information and belief, worked for or acted as agent of Defendant. (Id. ¶ 9.) The Deputy Sheriff repeatedly demanded to see the dogs' "certification papers." (Id.) Although the Deputy Sheriff was told that these requests were improper, he continued to insist on seeing the dogs' "certification papers." (Id.) The Deputy Sheriff asserted that he could tell that the dogs were "fake" because of their gear. (Id.) After Plaintiff explained to the security guards and the Deputy Sheriff that she suffered from a disability and one of the service dogs was hers, Defendant's employees demanded to know what her personal service dog was trained for, what her dog did for her, and asked questions designed to inquire about her disability. (Id. ¶ 10.)
More of Defendant's personnel arrived on the scene, including Defendant's Duty Manager, Mr. Kelley. (Id. ¶ 11.) During this time, Plaintiff continued to be questioned about her legitimacy as a service dog trainer and certifications for such training. (Id.) When Plaintiff demanded to leave, she was told by Defendant's security personnel that she could not leave until the incident was closed out to their satisfaction. (Id. ¶ 12.) [*5]  Faced with uniformed police officers, Plaintiff wanted to leave but felt that she could not leave and became increasingly intimidated. (Id.) Mr. Kelley told Plaintiff that she could stay this time since she was already there but that training was not allowed on Defendant's property and she would not be permitted back with her dogs. (Id. ¶ 13.) When Plaintiff told Mr. Kelley that he was mistaken, he told her that he changed his mind and Plaintiff was told to leave. (Id.)
On May 5, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant with the Florida Commission on Human Rights ("FCHR") for the February 11, 2017 incident. (Id. ¶ 14.) Since she filed the FCHR complaint, Plaintiff continues to patronize the Defendant's parks for her personal use and to train dogs. (Id.) She plans to continue to train in Defendant's parks in the future with the hope that the discrimination she faced will cease. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges that it is has not. (Id.) On or about May 27, 2017, twenty-two days after she filed her FCHR complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was subject to further discrimination at one of Defendant's parks in what she believes was retaliation for her FCHR complaint. (Id.) On this date, [*6]  Defendant's head of security told Plaintiff that if she did not want people to grab her service dog and scream curse words at her, then she should not bring her service dog to Defendant's parks. (Id.) This incident, as well as other incidents of Defendant's security personnel following Plaintiff in an overtly hostile manner when she visits Defendant's parks has prompted fear and anxiety in Plaintiff that Defendant is looking for reasons to expel her from Defendant's parks. (Id.)
On July 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed her two-count Complaint for public accommodation discrimination (Count I) and retaliation (Count II). (Doc. 1.) On September 14, 2018, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 18.) On September 25, 2018, Plaintiff responded in opposition. (Doc. 20.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
For purposes of deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court accepts as true the factual allegations in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Randall v. Scott, 610 F.3d 701, 705 (11th Cir. 2010). "Generally, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need only contain 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'"  [*7] Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). However, the plaintiff's complaint must provide "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). Thus, the Court is not required to accept as true a legal conclusion merely because it is labeled a "factual allegation" in the complaint; it must also meet the threshold inquiry of facial plausibility. Id.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Count I: Public Accommodation Discrimination
Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination against an individual "on the basis of disability in . . . any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases . . ., or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). "A plaintiff alleging Title III ADA discrimination must initially prove that (1) he is a disabled individual; (2) the defendant[ ] own[s], lease[s], or operate[s] a place of public accommodation; and (3) the defendant[ ] discriminated against the plaintiff within the meaning of the ADA." Norkunas v. Seahorse NB, LLC, 444 F. App'x 412, 416 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a)).3 In this case, Defendant moves to dismiss based on the third element. [*8]  Defendant argues that this claim should be dismissed because the ADA does not protect service dog training and Plaintiff was denied access to a public accommodation for reasons other than her disability. (Doc. 18 at 2-5.) While these arguments are well-founded, the Court finds that Plaintiff stated a valid Title III claim because Defendant's agent repeatedly asked Plaintiff to provide certification papers for the dogs that accompanied her to Disney Springs.
Congress explicitly authorized the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") to promulgate regulations under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a). Therefore, these regulations "must [be given] legislative and hence controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or plainly contrary to the statute." United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 834, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984). The DOJ has promulgated ADA regulations that specifically address service animals in places of public accommodation. 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c). In the ADA context, a service animal is a "dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability." 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. Under the ADA regulations, "[i]ndividuals with disabilities shall be permitted to be accompanied by their service animals in all areas of a place of public accommodation where [*9]  members of the public, program participants, clients, customers, patrons, or invitees, as relevant, are allowed to go." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c)(7). A place of public accommodation is permitted to ask two questions to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal: (1) "if the animal is required because of a disability and" (2) "what work or task the animal has been trained to perform." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c)(6). However, "a public accommodation shall not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c)(6).4
In this case, Defendant clearly violated the ADA regulation when its agent, an Orange County Deputy Sheriff, repeatedly demanded that Plaintiff provide certification papers for the dogs. See, e.g., Sheely v. MRI Radiology Network, P.A., 505 F.3d 1173, 1208 n.11 (11th Cir. 2007) ("[T]he ADA prohibits public accommodations from requiring proof that an animal is a service animal. . . .") (citation omitted); De Leon v. Vornado Montehiedra Acquisition L.P., 166 F. Supp. 3d 171, 176 (D.P.R. 2016) ("In this case, Defendants exceeded the permissible scope of inquiry regarding Lincoln's status as a service dog by demanding his registration papers though he was properly identified with appropriate vest and tags.") (citation omitted); Hurley v. Loma Linda Univ. Med. Ctr., No. CV12-5688 DSF OPX, 2014 WL 580202, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 12, 2014) (finding that defendant violated the ADA when defendant's security officer repeatedly [*10]  asked plaintiff for documentation proving that her dog was a service animal); Abbott v. Tacconelli's Pizzeria, LLC, No. CIV. 10-1901 JBS/AMD, 2010 WL 3359533, at *4 (D.N.J. Aug. 24, 2010) ("Under ADA guidance, a private entity may not insist on proof of state credentials before permitting entry of a service animal to a place of public accommodation.") (citation omitted); Dilorenzo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 515 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1193 (W.D. Wash. 2007) (noting that defendant's emphasis on plaintiff's dog's lack of qualifications as a service dog did not automatically defeat plaintiff's ADA claim because the manner in which defendant conducted his inquiry could have violated the ADA). Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendant discriminated against her within the meaning of the ADA and this claim may go forward.5
To guide the course of this litigation, the Court will address Plaintiff's other allegations pertaining to this Count. Plaintiff takes issue with Defendant not allowing her to train the dogs at Disney Springs and asks this Court to grant injunctive relief requiring Defendant to allow Plaintiff to train service animals on Defendant's property.6 This case presents a unique set of facts as it involves three different dogs: one is Plaintiff's actual service dog, another belonged to one of Plaintiff's friends, and the third was in training. [*11]  (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 7, 10.) As a threshold matter, the ADA regulations state "[i]ndividuals with disabilities shall be permitted to be accompanied by their service animals in all areas of a place of public accommodation where members of the public, program participants, clients, customers, patrons, or invitees, as relevant, are allowed to go." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c)(7) (emphasis added). Under the allegations in the Complaint, only one of the dogs actually belonged to Plaintiff. (Doc. 1 ¶ 7) ("Plaintiff was walking three service dogs at Defendant's Disney Springs location, including her own, one for a friend . . ., and one in training.") (emphasis added); (Id. ¶ 10) ("Plaintiff explained to the Disney security personnel and the Deputy that . . . one of the service dogs was hers. . . .') (emphasis added). The ADA regulations do not permit Plaintiff to bring any and all service animals to places of public accommodation, but only those that belong to her. "Service animals provide to thousands of Americans a critical means of access to the world. Federal policy as reflected in the ADA is designed to support this access. This policy, however, is not unlimited." Pool v. Riverside Health Servs., Inc., No. 94-1430-PFK, 1995 WL 519129, at *5 (D. Kan. Aug. 25, 1995). "The federal regulations limit protected entry to trained [*12]  service animals that help ameliorate their owner's qualifying disability." Davis v. Ma, 848 F. Supp. 2d 1105, 1116 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing 28 C.F.R. § 36.104), aff'd, 568 F. App'x 488 (9th Cir. 2014). Therefore, under the ADA, Defendant was not required to permit the two dogs that did not belong to Plaintiff at Disney Springs for training or any other purpose.
Moreover, while Plaintiff is correct that Florida law expressly allows service animal trainers to train animals in places of public accommodation, the ADA does not.7 If Congress or the DOJ intended for the ADA to allow service animal trainers to train animals in places of public accommodation, they could have drafted a provision stating so as Florida has done. It is not the Court's job to re-write federal statutes and administrative regulations. In fact, the language of the ADA regulations excludes dogs in training from protection under the ADA. As discussed supra, the ADA allows disabled individuals to bring their service animals into places of public accommodation. The ADA regulations define service animal as a "dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability." 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. Notably, the ADA regulation uses the past tense and does not state a dog that is "in training" [*13]  or use other similar language. Both the DOJ and courts have interpreted this definition to mean that a service animal is an animal that has already been trained and not one in the process of being trained. In 2015, the DOJ published answers to frequently asked questions about service animals. With regard to whether "service-animals-in-training" can be considered service animals under the ADA, the DOJ answered, "No. Under the ADA, the dog must already be trained before it can be taken into public places." (U.S. Dep't of Justice, Civil Rights Div., Frequently Asked Questions about Service Animals and the ADA, ADA (July 20, 2015), https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html (emphasis added) (addressing question six); see Lewis v. Burger King, 398 F. App'x 323, 325 (10th Cir. 2010) (noting that plaintiff's dog was in training and not yet a service animal under the ADA); Davis, 848 F. Supp. 2d at 1116 (holding that plaintiff could not establish an ADA claim based on the defendant's refusal to allow the plaintiff's puppy in a restaurant because the plaintiff was still attempting to train the puppy to assist him at the time of the incident and did not show that his puppy was a trained service animal); Proffer v. Columbia Tower, No. 98-CV-1404-K (AJB), 1999 WL 33798637, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 1999) (finding that the ADA did not require landlords to allow a tenant to [*14]  keep dogs that she was training for disabled individuals in her apartment); Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp., 15 Cal. App. 5th 214, 223-24, 223 Cal. Rptr. 3d 133, 139-40 (Ct. App. 2017) ("[T]he language of the ADA regulation indicates that a dog that is in the process of being trained as a service animal, but whose training has not yet been completed, cannot yet be considered a service animal."). From the allegations in the Complaint, it appears that Plaintiff was training at least one dog for an unknown person (Doc. 1 ¶ 7.)8 Therefore, this dog being in training would preclude it from meeting the ADA regulation's definition of a service animal and Defendant was not required to permit it into Disney Springs under the ADA. Moreover, under the ADA, Plaintiff's status as a service animal trainer did not permit her to train at Disney Springs. See Proffer,1999 WL 33798637, at *5 ("This court holds that a plaintiff does not state a cause of action under the ADA . . . when the allegedly discriminatory actions do not harm or discriminate against plaintiff, but instead limit plaintiff's ability to train animals for other disabled individuals.").
Plaintiff also alleges that she was excluded from participation in and denied the benefits of services and activities at Disney [*15]  Springs when Defendant refused to permit her to use her own personal service dog. (Doc. 1 ¶ 18.) Plaintiff's dog appears to qualify as a service animal because it belongs to her and she alleges that it "is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for Plaintiff, including providing Plaintiff with alerts to her seizures." (Doc. 1 ¶ 16.) Clearly, the ADA permits Plaintiff to bring her own personal service dog into Disney Springs. However, the issue is more complex. The real issue is whether Defendants were required to allow Plaintiff to bring in her personal service dog along with two other dogs that were not required to be admitted under the ADA. According to the DOJ, disabled individuals are generally allowed to bring more than one service animal into a public place as disabled individuals may need more than one service animal to perform different tasks. U.S. Dep't of Justice, supra Q13 (emphasis added). This does not help Plaintiff because she does not allege the two other dogs help her with her disabilities or performed tasks for her. Cf. Ascencio v. ADRU Corp., No. C 12-04884 WHA, 2014 WL 204212 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 6, 2014) (recommending the granting of default judgment in favor of an ADA plaintiff based on her allegations that she brought her two services dogs that aided her with her disability [*16]  into a Burger King and was denied service). Moreover, as discussed supra, the dog she was training for an unidentified person is not a service animal under the ADA. Pursuant to ADA regulations, "[g]enerally, a public accommodation shall modify policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c)(1). Such modifications must be reasonable. 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(a). Under the allegations of the Complaint, Defendant had a practice of not allowing individuals to train potential service animals on its property, which is permissible under the ADA. After learning that Plaintiff had a disability and one of the three dogs was her personal service dog, Defendant provided her with the reasonable accommodation of allowing all three dogs to remain at Disney Springs, instead of requiring her to have the other two dogs removed. The ADA only allows Plaintiff to bring her trained service dog that helps ameliorate her disability into places of public accommodation. See 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. The ADA and its corresponding regulations are specific in what is permitted. "The ADA does not create unlimited license for disabled customers. . . ." Davis, 848 F. Supp. 2d at 1116. Plaintiff exceeded the bounds of the ADA by bringing [*17]  in two dogs that did not belong to her, including one that did not qualify as a service animal under the ADA, and service dog training at Disney Springs. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff does not state a claim based on her allegations that she was not permitted to use her personal service dog at Disney Springs when she brought two other dogs that were not permitted under the ADA.9 To clarify, the Court finds that Plaintiff has only stated a claim under Count I based on her allegation that Defendant's agent asked her for certification papers for the dogs she brought to Disney Springs.

B. Count II: Retaliation10
Plaintiff also brings a retaliation claim. To support this claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's employees have continued to discriminate against her in retaliation for her May 5, 2017 FRCH complaint. (Doc. 1 ¶ 14.) Specifically, on or about May 27, 2017, when Plaintiff complained to Defendant's security personnel about unwanted and offensive touching of her service animal and verbal abuse, Defendant's head of security told Plaintiff that if she did not want people to grab her service dog and scream curse words at her then she should not bring her dog to Defendant's [*18]  parks. (Doc. 1 ¶ 24; Doc. 20 at 10.) Plaintiff also alleges that there have been other incidents at Defendant's parks, including Defendant's security following Plaintiff in an overtly hostile manner. (Doc. 1 ¶ 24.) Defendant also moves to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim. In its Motion, Defendant only focuses on the incident with Defendant's head of security. (Doc. 18.)
In addition to its anti-discrimination provisions, the ADA contains an anti-retaliation provision: "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). "To establish a prima facie case of non-employment related retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) she suffered an adverse action; and (3) the adverse action was causally related to the protected expression." Morgan v. Christensen, 582 F. App'x 806, 810 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1219 (11th Cir.2004)). In this case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not met the last two prongs. Regarding the May 27, 2017 incident, the Court disagrees. [*19] 
For the second prong, the Eleventh Circuit has explained that not "every unkind act" constitutes an adverse action. Shotz v. City of Plantation, 344 F.3d 1161, 1181 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2001), overruled on other grounds as recognized by Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961 (11th Cir. 2008)). "[T]he ADA is not a code of civility. . . ." Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1219 (11th Cir. 2004). The Court must "analyze that sufficiency 'on a case-by-case basis, using both a subjective and objective standard.'" Shotz, 344 F.3d at 1181 (citation omitted). Generally, "[a]n ADA plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view the . . . action in question as adverse." Id. (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "[W]hile conduct must be material to be adverse in this context, it need not be traumatic." Id. at 1182-83 (citation omitted).
In this case, Defendant argues that the incident involving Defendant's head of security does not raise to the level of an adverse action and there is clearly no tangible effect on Plaintiff because she continues to patronize Defendant's parks and states that she will continue to do so in the future. The Court disagrees. Essentially, Plaintiff approached Defendant's security for help because it appears that people at the park attempted to touch her service animal and screamed curse words her at her. (Doc. [*20]  1 ¶ 24.) Defendant's head of security's reply was that if Plaintiff did not want this to happen then she should not bring her service dog to Defendant's parks. (Id.) Defendant attempts to minimize this as a run-of-the-mill instance of an employee being rude to a customer. (Doc. 18 at 6) (citing Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1219). However, Defendant ignores the head of security's position. The head of security is not a regular employee; the position requires the head of security to protect those on Defendant's property. Defendant's head of security's comment indicates that security would not protect Plaintiff or intervene when Plaintiff and her service animal were being accosted by others at Defendant's park. The head of security's comment is more than a "petty slight[ ], minor annoyance[ ], [or] [a] simple lack of good manners." Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (citation omitted); see Reeves v. DSI Sec. Servs., Inc., 395 F. App'x 544, 547 (11th Cir. 2010) ("[P]etty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners generally do not rise to the level of materially adverse actions.") (alteration in original) (quoting Burlington, 548 U.S. at 68.). A reasonable person in Plaintiff's position with her disability and lack of ability to defend herself would view the comment as adverse action. The Court also rejects Defendant's argument that [*21]  Plaintiff has suffered no tangible effect. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's head of security's comment and other incidents at Defendant's parks have caused Plaintiff fear and anxiety that Defendant is looking for excuses to remove her from Defendant's parks. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant's head of security's comment on May 27, 2017, constituted an adverse action.
The Court notes that the parties did not address Plaintiff's vague allegations of other incidents of Defendant's employees retaliating against Plaintiff, such as following her around in an overtly hostile manner. (Id. ¶ 24.) Given the limited facts provided by Plaintiff, the Court cannot find that this conduct raises to the level of an adverse action. Assuming arguendo that it does, as discussed infra, the Court still finds that it does not satisfy the third prong.
For the causation prong, the causal link element is construed broadly so that "a plaintiff merely has to prove that the protected activity and the . . . [adverse] action are not completely unrelated." Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "To demonstrate causation, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected [*22]  conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated." Bowers v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 509 F. App'x 906, 911 (11th Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As this case involves a corporate defendant, "the plaintiff must show that the corporate agent who took the adverse action was aware of the plaintiff's protected expression and acted within the scope of his or her agency when taking the action." Raney v. Vinson Guard Serv., Inc., 120 F.3d 1192, 1197 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).
In this case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish the causation prong because she does not allege that Defendant's head of security that she spoke to on May 27, 2017 had any knowledge of her complaint to the FCHR. (Doc. 18 at 7.) Defendant also points out that the February 11th incident involving the three dogs and the May 27th incident involved different locations and different employees. (Id.) Defendant's arguments are well-founded. However, "[c]ausation may be inferred by a close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action." Bowers, 509 F. App'x at 911 (citation omitted). "[M]ere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has held that "[a] three-month temporal gap, without [*23]  more, does not establish the needed inference of causation." Id. (citing Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007)); see, e.g., Henderson v. FedEx Express, 442 F. App'x. 502, 506 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding in the FMLA retaliation context that "[i]f there is a delay of more than three months between the two events, then the temporal proximity is not close enough, and the plaintiff must offer some other evidence tending to show causation."). In this case, Plaintiff made her FCHR complaint on May 5, 2017. (Doc. 1 ¶ 14.) Plaintiff's incident with the head of the security occurred on or about May 27, 2017. This mere twenty-two day difference is sufficient to infer causation. See Shotz, 344 F.3d at 1186 n.30 ("A period as much as one month between the protected activity and the adverse action is not too protracted.") (citation omitted). Compare Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1221 (holding that a three month difference between the protected activity and adverse action was insufficient to establish causation), and Corder v. City of Bessemer, No. 2:14-CV-02133-RDP, 2015 WL 1778411, at *5 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 20, 2015) (holding that an eighteen month gap was insufficient to establish causation), with Vira v. Crowley Liner Servs., Inc., 723 F. App'x 888, 893 (11th Cir. 2018) ("Whether 8 or 13 days, the timing between the two events suggests a causal relationship sufficient to establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation.") (emphasis in original), and Heberle v. Edsall Groves, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45336, *7 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 20, 2018) (finding that a month and half gap was sufficient to satisfy the causation prong). [*24] 
For the limited purposes of this Order, the Court will infer causation based on the twenty-two day gap. Plaintiff should be allowed to conduct discovery and determine if the head of security was actually aware of her FCHR complaint at the time of their interaction. Although the February 11th and May 27th incidents occurred at different locations and involved different employees, the Court is aware that employees within a company communicate with each other and the head of security may have been notified about Plaintiff due to the nature of his position. However, the Court cannot apply this inference to Plaintiff's other alleged incidents of retaliation by Defendant's employees because Plaintiff does not provide dates for these incidents to allow the Court to determine the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's FCHR complaint and these incidents. Plaintiff also does not specify the number of incidents to allow the Court to determine if there was a pattern. Plaintiff should provide the Court with more detail on these incidents in Plaintiff's amended complaint. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff states a valid retaliation claim based on the May 27th incident.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based [*25]  on the foregoing, it is ordered as follows:
1. Defendant Walt Disney Parks and Resort U.S., Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 18), filed on September 14, 2018, is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. For Count I, Defendant's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's allegation that Defendant's agent asked Plaintiff for certification papers for the dogs and GRANTED as to the remaining allegations. For Count II, Defendant's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's allegation concerning the May 27, 2017 incident with Defendant's head of security and GRANTED as to the remaining allegations.
2. In accordance with the terms of this Order, Plaintiff is GRANTED leave to file an amended complaint within fourteen days. The amended complaint shall not serve as an opportunity to add new claims. Rather, this represents a chance for Plaintiff to remedy the pleading deficiencies identified herein. Failure to file an amended complaint within fourteen days may result in the dismissal of this case without further notice.
DONE and ORDERED in Chambers, in Orlando, Florida on October 29, 2018.
