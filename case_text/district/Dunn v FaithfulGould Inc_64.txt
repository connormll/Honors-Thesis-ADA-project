Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court on Defendants' motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 45.] Plaintiff alleges claims for discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. Pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge for consideration.
Plaintiff commenced this action on October 28, 2015 [Doc. 1], and filed an Amended Complaint on January 15, 2016 [Doc. 5]. On August 31, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 45.] Plaintiff filed a response in opposition on September 28, 2017. [Doc. 48.] Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is ripe for [*2]  review.

BACKGROUND

Plaintiff's Employment
Plaintiff began working full time for Defendant Faithful+Gould, Inc. ("FG") as a chief scheduler in 2011. [Docs. 5 ¶ 9; 45-2 at 8; 48-2 at 2 ¶ 2.] FG and Defendant Atkins North America, Inc. ("Atkins") are wholly owned subsidiaries of Atkins Global. [Doc. 45-3 at 8.] During his time as a chief scheduler for FG, Plaintiff's job description did not change. [Doc. 48-2 at 3 ¶ 4.] In 2011, Plaintiff's supervisor was Steve Plane ("Plane") out of the Atlanta office. [Doc. 48-2 at 3 ¶ 5.] Plaintiff worked remotely for FG from his house for the first eighteen months of his employment because no local office had been established. [Doc. 5 ¶ 10.] While working for FG, Plaintiff worked on multiple projects, but all of them were for Michelin, N.A. ("Michelin"). [Doc. 5 ¶ 9.]
In April, 2013, Plaintiff began reporting to Jeanette Van Akelijen ("Van Akelijen"). [Docs. 45-2 at 9-10; 45-3 at 12-13; 45-6 at 1 ¶ 2; 48-2 at 3-4 ¶ 6.] By the time Van Akelijen became Plaintiff's supervisor, FG had established a project management office ("PMO") in Greenville at one of Michelin's facilities. [Docs. 5 ¶ 11; 45-6 at 1-2 ¶ 2.] Once the office in Greenville was established, [*3]  Van Akelijen did not allow employees to work remotely. [Docs. 45-6 at 1-2 ¶ 2; 45-7 ¶ 9.] After Van Akelijen became his supervisor, Plaintiff asked on multiple occasions if he could work from home, but Van Akelijen informed him that his work required him to be present at the PMO or job site. [Doc. 45-6 at 2 ¶ 3.]

Plaintiff's Seizure and Requested Accommodations
On July 24, 2014, Plaintiff had a grand mal seizure while at work ("first seizure"). [Docs. 5 ¶ 13; 45-2 at 16; 48-2 at 4 ¶ 9.] Plaintiff was transported to the hospital in an ambulance as a result of the seizure. [Docs. 5 ¶ 13; 48-2 at 4 ¶ 9.] Plaintiff had experienced two prior seizures in his lifetime, but believed both to be related to the cold medicine Sudafed. [Doc. 48-2 at 4-5 ¶ 9.] The seizure that occurred at FG was believed to be a result of interrupted sleep patterns, as Plaintiff had just returned from a business trip to France. [Docs. 45-2 at 17; 48-2 at 5 ¶ 10.]
Around two weeks after his first seizure, Plaintiff contacted Defendants indicating that he wanted to return to work. [Doc. 48-2 at 5 ¶ 13.] Before his first seizure, Plaintiff had exhausted his paid vacation and some of his leave under the Family Medical [*4]  Leave Act ("FMLA") while caring for his father, who had Alzheimer's Disease.1 [Docs. 45-2 at 13-14; 45-5 at 2.] Tracy Nursey ("Nursey"), from human resources, told Plaintiff that FG would need a form from Plaintiff's doctor clearing him to return to work and identifying any limitations Plaintiff may have. [Doc. 45-2 at 21-22.] Plaintiff sent in the requested return-to-work documentation on August 18, 2014. [Doc. 45-5 at 3-4.] That documentation indicated that Plaintiff had no limitations or restrictions, but noted that South Carolina law required that Plaintiff not drive for six months. [Id.; Doc. 45-2 at 18.] In an email, Plaintiff indicated that he could not catch a ride "like [Van Akelijen] wants me to do for 2+ hours a day," referring to an earlier conversation with Van Akelijen about getting to work. [Doc. 45-5 at 3.] Following the receipt of this email, Nursey called Plaintiff and indicated that Defendants were willing to try a four-week limited work schedule, working three days a week, with one day from home, one day at the job site, and one day at the PMO, to give Plaintiff time to work out a long-term transportation solution. [Docs. 45-3 at 29; 45-5 at 7-8.]
On August 25, 2014, [*5]  Plaintiff emailed Nursey, indicating that he had exhausted all affordable avenues of getting to work, and that a limited schedule for four weeks was not a solution for him. [Doc. 45-5 at 8.] Plaintiff also rejected any idea of changing his employment status, indicating that he was "fully capable of working remotely." [Id.] Plaintiff again requested that he be allowed to work from home until his driving privileges were reinstated, which would be six months from the date of his last seizure. [Id.] Nursey emailed Plaintiff back, informing him that FG could not accommodate his request to work from home. [Doc. 45-5 at 7-8.] Instead, Nursey reiterated the offered accommodation of a limited work schedule for four weeks. [Id.] Nursey reminded Plaintiff that the limited work schedule was already requiring that some of his job duties be reassigned. [Doc. 45-5 at 8.] Additionally, if travel was required during the day between the PMO and the job site, FG would make arrangements for Plaintiff to ride with a coworker. [Doc. 45-6 at 7.] Plaintiff responded to the email, "[t]his is really pathetic." [Doc. 45-5 at 3 ¶ 7.]
The next week, even though a long-term solution had not been worked out, Plaintiff [*6]  began working from home. [Doc. 45-2 at 28.] On August 28, 2014, while working from home, Plaintiff suffered another grand mal seizure ("second seizure"), which resulted in a dislocated shoulder and bruising from where he fell. [Docs. 45-5 at 15, 17; 48-2 at 7 ¶ 20.] After the second seizure, Plane, Nursey, and Van Akelijen discussed Plaintiff's continued employment with FG. [Doc. 45-3 at 36-37.] Plane inquired about allowing Plaintiff to be on indefinite leave, but Nursey responded that an indefinite leave of absence was not an option per FG policy. [Id.; Doc. 45-5 at 20.] As a result of Plaintiff's inability to return to work and the exhaustion of his leave time, Plane, Nursey, and Van Akelijen decided to terminate Plaintiff. [Docs 45-3 at 36-37; 45-5 at 20; 45-7 ¶ 15.] In a letter dated September 17, 2014, FG notified Plaintiff that his employment had been terminated because he had exhausted all available paid/unpaid and FMLA leave and because he had been absent from work and was not returning to work. [Doc. 48-7 at 2.]

APPLICABLE LAW

Summary Judgment Standard
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states, as to a party who has moved for summary judgment:
The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there [*7]  is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect disposition of the case under applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257. When determining whether a genuine issue has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and ambiguities against the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).
The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant has made this threshold demonstration, the non-moving party, to survive the motion for summary judgment, may not rest on the allegations averred in her pleadings. Id. at 324. Rather, the non-moving party must demonstrate specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine issue. Id. Under this standard, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-movant's position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory allegations or denials, without [*8]  more, are insufficient to preclude granting the summary judgment motion. Id. at 248. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Further, Rule 56 provides in pertinent part:
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Accordingly, when Rule 56(c) has shifted the burden of proof to the non-movant, she must produce existence of a factual dispute on every element essential to her action that she bears the burden of adducing at a trial on the merits.

DISCUSSION

Discrimination — Failure to Accommodate Claim
To establish his failure to accommodate [*9]  claim, Plaintiff must show (1) he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) his employer knew of the disability; (3) with reasonable accommodations, he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job; and (4) his employer refused to make such reasonable accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). Here, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not established the first, third, and fourth prongs of his failure to accommodate claim. [Doc. 45-1 at 16-29.] Assuming without deciding that Plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the statute,2 the Court agrees that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff has failed to establish the third and fourth prongs of his failure to accommodate claim.
To establish the third prong of a failure to accommodate claim, the Plaintiff must show that he was a qualified individual with a disability, meaning that "with or without [a] reasonable accommodation, [he] can perform the essential functions of the employment position." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing Chandler v. City of Dallas, 2 F.3d 1385, 1393-94 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that in resolving whether a person is a "qualified individual," the Court must consider whether that person is able to perform the essential functions [*10]  of the job in question, and if not, whether the person could do the job with reasonable accommodation). Defendants argue that one of the essential functions of Plaintiff's position was onsite attendance and that, if Plaintiff were not able to work at the PMO/job site, he would be unable to perform an essential function of his position. [Doc. 45-1 at 23-25.] Plaintiff disputes Defendants' contention that on site attendance was an essential part of his job, asserting that he could fully perform his job remotely. [Doc. 48 at 15-17. But see Doc. 45-2 at 68 (correspondence from Plaintiff noting that he could not fully perform his job until February 27, 2015, because of his seizure and the requirement under South Carolina law that he not drive until he has been seizure free for six months).]
A job function is essential when '"the reason the position exists is to perform that function,' when there [are not] enough employees available to perform the function, or when the function is so specialized that someone is hired specifically because of his or her expertise in performing that function." Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 579 (4th Cir. 2015) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)). "[I]f an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing [*11]  applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Other relevant evidence includes the employer's judgment as to the essential functions of the job, the amount of time spent performing the function, and the consequences of not requiring the function of the employee. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3).
In the instant matter, the Court finds that Defendants have established that on site attendance was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. As noted by Plaintiff, his job description did not include a notation with respect to on site attendance. [Doc. 48 at 13-15.] However, Nursey testified that the job descriptions were general for different project sites. [Doc. 45-3 at 13-14.] Plaintiff also argues that on site attendance was not required because he worked from home for eighteen months when he was first hired as a chief scheduler with FG. [Doc. 48 at 13-14.] Plaintiff's argument fails to acknowledge, however, the fact that no PMO for Michelin had been established when he was working remotely. His supervisor at the time, Plane, avers that Plaintiff's work was limited during that time because Plaintiff's access to Michelin's network was limited. [Doc. 45-7 [*12]  ¶¶ 4, 8-10.] Furthermore, Van Akelijen, avers that no employee reporting to her at the Michelin PMO was allowed to work remotely, and that Plaintiff had requested—prior to the first seizure—to work from home multiple times and she denied those requests, explaining to him that he was required to be at the PMO or the job site. [Doc. 45-5 at 42; see Docs. 45-2 at 25-26 (testimony by Plaintiff that Van Akelijen required employees to be in the office); 45-6 at 1-2 ¶¶ 2-3 (Van Akelijen averring that all employees working on the Michelin PMO were required to work on the project site or in the PMO, that Plaintiff's position required face to face interaction with Michelin, and that she had previously denied a work from home request from Plaintiff prior to his first seizure).] Additionally, the record includes testimony that Van Akelijen, Plane, and Nursey considered on site attendance an essential function of Plaintiff's position as chief scheduler because he was required to be present for face-to-face meetings with the client and his co-workers. [Docs. 45-3 at 28-29; 45-6 at 1-3 ¶¶ 2-3, 6-7; 45-7 ¶ 4.] Plaintiff's own correspondence with his neurologist describes his job as including traveling [*13]  to job sites, and indicates that he is the only individual working on certain projects. [See Doc. 45-2 at 68 (recognizing that "[m]y job consists of traveling to job sites located in Greenville, Columbia, Spartanburg and Anderson[,] . . . I am the sole consultant for these projects and no one else would be traveling to those job sites[, and] [m]y job entails accessing construction work on a job site, accessing project schedules, and inputting data into scheduling programs on the computer").] As such, the undersigned finds no genuine issue of material fact that on site attendance was an essential part of Plaintiff's job.
In light of the above, the Court will address whether, with a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff could perform the essential function of on site attendance. The two part analysis includes (1) evaluating if Plaintiff's requested accommodation was reasonable and (2) evaluating if, with the accommodation, Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of his position. Wilson, 717 F.3d at 345; Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 213 (noting that except in unusual cases, "an employee 'who does not come to work cannot perform any of his job functions, essential or otherwise'" (emphasis in original)). A reasonable accommodation [*14]  may include:
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). "[A]n employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he or she requests or prefers; the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Crawford v. Union Carbide Corp., 202 F.3d 257, at *4 (4th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision) (quoting Baert v. Euclid Beverage, Ltd, 149 F.3d 626, 633 (7th Cir. 1998)). Plaintiff's requested accommodation was working full time from home until his license was reinstated under South Carolina law. [Doc. 45-5 at 8.] As the record evidence establishes, however, Plaintiff's requested accommodation would require increasing the workload of the junior schedulers who worked under Plaintiff. [Docs. 45-2 at 68; 45-5 at 8]; see Crabill v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 423 F. App'x 314, 323 (4th Cir. 2011) (finding accommodations that require other employees to work harder to be unreasonable). Even "reasonable" accommodations requests by an employee can [*15]  be rejected if they would not enable the employee to perform all essential functions of his/her position. Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 581. Plaintiff has failed to show that he could fulfill the essential functions of his job with or without an accommodation, because he could not fulfill the essential job function of onsite attendance. Consequently, Plaintiff has failed to establish the third prong of his failure to accommodate claim and, thus, is not a qualified individual under the ADA.
With respect to the fourth prong of Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, the Court must determine whether Defendants have established that they fully participated in the interactive process in an attempt to identify an accommodation that would work for Plaintiff. The ADA regulations provide:
To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). Thus, the ADA imposes upon employers a good-faith duty "to [*16]  engage [with their employees] in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Id. This duty is triggered when an employee communicates his disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation. Id. An employer will not be liable for failure to engage in the interactive process if the employee ultimately fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of the position. Id. at 347; see also Deily v. Waste Mgmt. of Allentown, 55 F. App'x 605, 607 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Shapiro v. Twp. of Lakewood, 292 F.3d 356, 360 (3d Cir. 2002)).
Here, Plaintiff's doctor completed a form indicating that Plaintiff could return to work with no restrictions, but noting that South Carolina law required that Plaintiff's license be suspended for six months from the date of his last seizure. [Doc. 45-2 at 62.] Due to the driving limitation, Plaintiff requested that he be allowed to work from home for six months until his license was reinstated. [Doc. 45-5 at 8.] In response, Defendants indicated that they could not accommodate his request because his position required him to be on site full time. [Doc. 45-5 at 7-8.] That same communication, however, reminded Plaintiff that they could accommodate [*17]  a four-week modified work schedule. [Id.] The modified schedule would allow allowed Plaintiff to work only three days per week—one day at home, one day at the PMO, and one day at the job site. [Id.] The modified work schedule was also designed to give Plaintiff time to work out a long-term alternative arrangement to get to work. [Id.] Additionally, Defendants made arrangements so that Plaintiff could ride with a co-worker if any travel from the PMO or job site was required during the day. [Doc. 45-6 at 3 ¶ 7.] Defendants informed Plaintiff that the modified schedule would not be a long-term solution, as the modification required placing more work on other individuals on the team. [Doc. 45-5 at 8.] Plaintiff unequivocally rejected their proposed accommodation suggestion, responding, "[t]his is really pathetic." [Doc. 45-5 at 7-8.]3 In spite of this response from Plaintiff, the record reveals that additional conversations took place between Plaintiff and Defendants and that on the day of his second seizure Plaintiff was working from home as part of the modified work schedule. [See Doc. 45-2 at 27-28 (Plaintiff's testimony that Plaintiff and Defendants "were in the middle of trying to [*18]  work -- honestly trying to work something out for me to come back to work").]
Based on the foregoing, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish prong four of his failure to accommodate claim. Defendants have proven that they engaged in the interactive process with Plaintiff to identify a reasonable accommodation. Even after Plaintiff completely rejected Defendants' proposed accommodation, the record shows that Defendants continued to explore additional options and accommodations, even though Plaintiff's return-to-work documentation indicated that he had no limitations or disabilities beyond the South Carolina law that required Plaintiff not drive for six months after his seizure. [Doc. 45-2 at 27-28, 62]; see E.E.O.C. v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 766 (6th Cir. 2015) (finding the employer acted in good faith in initiating and maintaining interactive process with plaintiff, especially since employer continued the process after employee rejected its accommodation suggestion, by offering an additional accommodation suggestion); see also Minnihan v. Mediacom Commc'ns Corp, 779 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. 2015) (finding that employer reasonably engaged in the interactive process with employee—whose license was suspended because of a seizure—when it offered to transfer employee to a position that [*19]  did not require driving, even though employee rejected the proposed transfer because he would have trouble getting a ride to the new office, which was farther away than the office where he initially worked). As conceded by Plaintiff, Defendants acted in good faith to work out an accommodation in light of Plaintiff's driving restriction. [See Doc. 45-2 at 27-28.] Due to this concession and the record evidence, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendants failed to offer Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. See Crawford, 202 F.3d at *4. Thus, Defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

Retaliation Claim
The ADA's retaliation provision provides, in relevant part, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual . . . made a charge . . . under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Absent direct or circumstantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an impermissible factor motivated an employer's adverse employment action, a plaintiff may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework to establish a claim of employment retaliation.4 Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004)); see Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding that "the [*20]  McDonnell Douglas scheme of proof applies to appropriate claims under the ADA").
Under this framework, an employee must first prove a prima facie case of retaliation.5 McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. By providing such an explanation, the employer rebuts the presumption of retaliation created by the prima facie case, and "[t]he presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the [employer] to come forward with some response, simply drops out of the picture." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). If the employer articulates a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the articulated reason was actually a pretext for retaliation. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.
Here, even assuming without deciding Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disability retaliation,6 Defendants have articulated a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. Specifically, Defendants maintain that they terminated Plaintiff, per company policy, because he had exhausted all available leave, and there was no temporary assignment employee ("TAE") [*21]  work to which FG could assign Plaintiff. [Doc 45-1 at 35-36.] Because Defendants have articulated a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, the Court will consider whether Plaintiff has met his burden of demonstrating that Defendants' proffered reason is merely a pretext for retaliation, which would indicate whether Plaintiff could meet his ultimate burden of persuasion and demonstrate retaliation. See Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294.
Generally, to prove that an employer's articulated reason is a pretext for retaliation, a plaintiff "must prove 'both that the reason was false, and that [retaliation] was the real reason' for the challenged conduct." Jiminez v. Mary Wash. Coll., 57 F.3d 369, 378 (4th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original) (quoting St Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 515). However, "a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully [retaliated]." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). Ultimately, to survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must demonstrate "a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make [the employer's] proferred justification a triable issue." Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Invs., LLC, 828 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir. 2016).
Plaintiff argues that he was terminated in retaliation for requesting an accommodation and that Defendants' reason for terminating him was pretext because Plaintiff contends he had not exhausted all of his FMLA and/or personal unpaid [*23]  leave as of the date of his termination and additional leave is a possible accommodation that can be made under the ADA.7 [Doc. 48 at 23-24.] As evidence to support his pretext argument, Plaintiff refers to a chain of emails between Defendants' employees, discussing Plaintiff's accommodation request and his rejection of the proposed accommodation. [Doc. 45-5 at 5-8.] A review of these emails, however, does not support Plaintiff's assertion. Defendants expressed disappointment in Plaintiff's disrespectful response to their accommodation suggestion, and Nursey asks what the next step would be provided that Plaintiff did not return to work at the end of his leave. [Id. at 6-7.] Further, the record includes evidence that Defendants extended Plaintiff's leave time at least twice in an attempt to allow him the opportunity to return to work. [See Docs. 45-3 at 32-33 (testimony by Nursey that she requested multiple times that Plaintiff's leave be pushed out so that Plaintiff had time to get everything worked out); and 45-5 at 12-13.] Additionally, the evidence before the Court reveals that Defendants, before deciding to terminate Plaintiff, discussed whether there was part-time work Plaintiff could perform [*24]  from home so that he would be able to remain an employee.8 [See Docs. 45-3 at 31 (testimony from Nursey that Defendants looked into the possibility of transferring Plaintiff to another job that could be handled remotely, but that there was no such work available), 45-3 at 38 (testifying that Plaintiff and Nursey talked following his second seizure about the next steps and completing the short-term disability paperwork); 45-4 at 13-14 (setting out Defendants' leave policy and noting that personal leave cannot be used or tacked on leave that is due to an illness); 45-5 at 6 (questioning if any further accommodation was possible for Plaintiff and noting that if Plaintiff could not return to work once his leave ended that his status could be changed to PTT/PTR (part time regular) or his termination could be processed), 45-5 at 27 (noting that third party FMLA vendor certified that an inability to drive to work would not be covered FMLA time); 45-7 ¶¶ 14-15 (testifying that after Plaintiff's seizure, before deciding to terminate Plaintiff, Defendants discussed possible accommodations and inquired into TAE work that may be available, but when those avenues were unsuccessful, the decision [*25]  was made to terminate Plaintiff per FG policy).]
Plaintiff also argues that a question of material fact remains as to pretext because Plaintiff alleges that his FMLA leave was tabulated incorrectly.9 [Doc. 48 at 23.] The Court disagrees. Plaintiff did not report his FMLA time to FMLA source despite Defendants' multiple requests [Doc. 45-5 at 2, 5], and to Defendants' knowledge, FMLA Source correctly tabulated Plaintiff's remaining FMLA time; thus, no question of fact remains that as far as Defendants were aware, Plaintiff had exhausted his available FMLA time—and had no remaining paid or unpaid time. [Docs. 45-4 at 18 (noting that as of June 24, 2014, Plaintiff had exhausted his paid leave and was requesting to intermittently use his remaining 22 days of unpaid leave time); 45-5 at 27 (noting that Defendants confirmed with FMLA Source that Plaintiff's inability to drive was not covered under FMLA)]; see Merritt, 601 F.3d at 300 (finding that the decision maker's intent is crucial in evaluating an alleged discriminatory/retaliatory employment decision). Further, as detailed, Defendants requested that Plaintiff report his FMLA time to FMLA Source to ensure the accuracy of their tabulations, but he failed [*26]  to do so. [Doc. 45-5 at 2, 5.] As such, even assuming Plaintiff were correct with respect to the improper tabulation of his FMLA time, Defendants were reasonable in relying upon FMLA Source's tabulation of Plaintiff's leave in deciding to terminate Plaintiff.
Tellingly, and perhaps most harmful to Plaintiff's argument, the course of events following Plaintiff's seizures would have remained the same even if his request for an accommodation is removed from the time line. Because Plaintiff had no available protected, paid, or unpaid leave remaining, and could not return to work, he would have been terminated. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to show that but for his request for an accommodation he would not have been terminated. See Howell v. Holland, No. 4:13-cv-00295-RBH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21124, 2015 WL 751590, at *21 (D.S.C. Feb. 23, 2015) (citing Moore v. Reese, 817 F. Supp. 1290, 1299 (D. Md. 1993)) (noting that causation in a retaliation case requires but for causation, and the "but for" standard "is a rigorous standard of proof"); Bray v. Tenax Corp., 905 F. Supp. 324, 328 (E.D.N.C. 1995) (rejecting Plaintiff's retaliation claim under Title VII because "[c]ausation requires the employer's action be the consequence of the protected activit[y] and of nothing else" (alteration added)).
Thus, nothing in the record supports a finding that the decision to terminate Plaintiff [*27]  was made for any reason other than that he had exhausted all available leave and was unable to return to work. It is outside the Court's province to decide "whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination." Hawkins v. Pepsico, 203 F.3d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating "a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make [the employer's] proferred justification a triable issue," see Guessous, 828 F.3d at 217, because the record does not support a finding that Defendants' proferred reason for terminating Plaintiff is false. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.10

RECOMMENDATION
Wherefore, based upon the foregoing, the Court [*28]  recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 45] be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
