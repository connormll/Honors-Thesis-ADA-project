Opinion



RECOMMENDATION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

I. Introduction
Plaintiff John Oirya filed this action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") alleging that his former employer, Defendant Mando America Corporation ("Mando"), failed to grant him a reasonable accommodation and engaged in retaliation. (Doc. 1 at pp. 13, 15). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636, the action has been referred to the Magistrate Judge "for all pretrial proceedings and entry of any orders or recommendations as may be appropriate." (Doc. 47).
Now pending for resolution are competing motions for summary judgment. (Doc. 51; Doc. 66). For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned recommends that Mando's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 51) be granted and that Oirya's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 66) be denied.

II. Jurisdiction and Venue
Subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The parties do not contest personal jurisdiction or venue, and there are adequate allegations to support [*2]  both. See 28 U.S.C. § 1391; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A).

III. Factual Background
Mando operates a "just-in-time" automotive parts manufacturing facility in Opelika, Alabama. (Doc. 53-5 at p. 2, ¶ 4). Mando distributes a Salary Employee Handbook to all salaried employees upon the commencement of their employment. (Doc. 53-1 at p. 37; Doc. 53-5 at p. 2, ¶ 6). The handbook prohibits discrimination or retaliation based on disability and includes an ADA policy stating that Mando is committed "to ensur[ing] that qualified individuals with a disability are provided a reasonable accommodation, unless the accommodation would cause an undue hardship," and directing employees to "notify Human Resources" to "request an accommodation for a disability." (Doc. 53-5 at p. 21). The handbook also includes a conduct policy that sets out "examples of misconduct, which may result in immediate termination," including "[s]leeping on the job." (Id. at pp. 25-26.).
On November 4, 2015, Oirya began working for Mando as a temporary employee through A-1 Employment, Inc., a staffing agency. (Doc. 57 at p. 7; Doc. 58-1 at p. 2, ¶ 2). Mando later hired Oirya on a permanent basis in March of 2016. (Doc. 53-1 at p. 36; Doc. 53-6 at p. 2, ¶ 4a.; Doc. 58-1 at p. [*3]  2, ¶ 3). During that period, Oirya worked in the Suspension Department and reported to supervisor Steven Crabb. (Doc. 53-1 at p. 36). Oirya occasionally missed work because he was suffering from depression for which he was receiving treatment at Columbus Psychological Associates. (Id. at pp. 34-35). Oirya testified in deposition that Crabb was aware of his condition: "[E]very time I would be late, I would call in to my supervisor Mr. Steven Crabb and tell him ... I would be late and he would usually find a substitute." (Id. at p. 38). Oirya further stated that he sometimes "couldn't stay awake" and would tell C.J. Murphy, his night supervisor, he needed to go home. (Id. at pp. 38, 63). And Oirya allegedly discussed his conditions and treatment with both Murphy and his team lead, Brad Jones. (Id. at pp. 37-38).
In September of 2016, Mando moved Oirya to the position of Training Coordinator. (Id. at p. 38). As Training Coordinator, Oirya reported to April Regier as the Corporate Training Supervisor. (Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶ 7). In late 2017/early 2018, it was reported to Human Resources Manager Darlene Schumacher that Oirya had been observed sleeping at work. (Doc. 53-6 at pp. 2-3, ¶¶ 2, [*4]  6.a.-b.). Schumacher subsequently notified Regier of the reports. (Id. at ¶ 6.c.). As a result, Regier issued a "Last Chance Agreement" to Oirya on February 2, 2018 wherein Oirya was notified that he had been deemed in violation of Mando's conduct policy "by sleeping on the job and abusing [his] designation [sic] lunch period." (Doc. 53-4 at p. 9). The Last Chance Agreement further stated that, "[i]n lieu of termination," Mando would place Oirya under the agreement for a period of two years—during which time any failure to adhere to the conduct policy would result in an immediate termination of his employment. (Id.).
On February 9, 2018, Oirya submitted a response entitled "Explanation for Last Chance Agreement" to explain the underlying reasons for his refusal to sign the Last Chance Agreement. (Doc. 53-4 at pp. 11-13). For example, Oirya stated that he believed there was a "lack of sufficient and meaningful Due Process that preceded the issuance of the memo." (Id. at pp. 11-12). Oirya also stated that "[t]he alleged incident" was protected under the ADA because: he "was suffering [from] the effects of food poisoning with stomach flu symptoms, due to having eaten sandwiches that were [*5]  'on sale'"; that during his lunch hour he "went to the break room to relax, while [his] stomach pains subsided"; that "the food poisoning did not require [him] to ask for [a] costly accommodation, since the company-provided breaks [were] already provided for in th[e] policy"; and that he "found it reasonable to sit relax [sic] in the breakroom while [his] pains subsided." (Id. at p. 12). Oirya further complained that "[m]ultiple witnesses and credible avenues that would have verified and corroborated the allegations ... were never consulted" and that "the words of the informants were taken at their face value devoid of any serious inquiry, investigations or verifications." (Id. at p. 13). Oirya attached to his written explanation a photograph of the over-the-counter medications he used for symptom relief. (Id. at p. 15).
Oirya contends that he discussed his health conditions at length with Regier during their February 2, 2018 verbal conversation. According to Oirya's sworn Declaration,1 he told Regier that he "had been diagnosed with or suffered from various medical disabilities that included major depression and acute PTSD, and frequent bouts of food poisoning, stomach flu, and severe [*6]  stomach pains." (Doc. 58-1 at ¶ 9). Oirya asserts that Regier "asked [him] to extensively explain to her the details regarding [his] medical disabilities, including their medical treatments that [he] had received, the expert doctors that had treated [him], the medications that [he] was taking to manage these disabilities, and any accommodations that [he] had utilized to manage these disabilities while performing [his] job functions and responsibilities at Mando." (Id.). More specifically, Oirya claims he informed Regier that he "had been treated for major depression and acute PTSD by Columbus Psychological Associates, L.L.P. in Columbus, Georgia" and "had been treated for [his] frequent bouts of food poisoning, stomach flu, and severe stomach pains by medical experts at Auburn Urgent Care Inc., in Auburn, Alabama." (Id. at ¶ 10).
Oriya likewise contends that he explained to Regier how he addressed his symptoms by utilizing breaks, lying down, and taking medications that sometimes induced drowsiness:
At my February 2, 2018 verbal meeting with Ms. Regier, I explained to her that I took frequent breaks whenever my medical disabilities were active, during which I took drowsy-causing stomach [*7]  flu capsules and antacid medications to manage my bouts of food poisoning, stomach flu, and severe stomach pains, and laid on my back during those breaks, until my severe stomach pains subsided. I explained to Ms. Regier that these accommodations enabled me to resume the essential functions and responsibilities of my job at Mando and should be continued to reasonably accommodate my medical disabilities, and enable me to perform my job at Mando. I also told Ms. Regier that during my previous Operator 2 position at Mando, my regular day shift supervisor Steven Crabb, day shift team lead Brad Jones, and night shift supervisor C.J. Murphy had readily granted me the reasonable accommodations of breaks, which had proven effective in enabling me to manage my medical disabilities, while working at Mando.
(Id. at ¶ 11); and
At my February 2, 2018 verbal meeting with Ms. Regier, I explained to her that I took frequent medical breaks whenever my medical disabilities were active, during which I took drowsy-causing stomach flu capsules to manage my bouts of stomach flu symptoms. I explained to her that I also took breaks as a safety precaution to not work around Mando's many fast-moving equipment [*8]  and operating machinery, while under the influence of drowsy-causing medication. Additionally, I told Ms. Regier that the stomach flu capsules that I was taking had a label with explicitly written warning instructions of "marked drowsiness" that required me to "be careful when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery."
(Id. at ¶ 12). Oriya expressly denies that he has ever been guilty of sleeping on the job and claims that he suggested to Regier how any such future complaints should be discussed with him prior to the imposition of disciplinary measures:
At my February 2, 2018 verbal meeting with Ms. Regier, I also asked Ms. Regier and Mando to grant me an interactive process prior to taking any disciplinary action against me, while explaining to her that this process would prevent Mando from unlawfully punishing me in the future, for conduct that would result from my medical disabilities, that included major depression, acute PTSD, frequent bouts of food poisoning, stomach flu, and severe stomach pains.
(Id. at ¶ 14).
Approximately ten months later in November of 2018, then-HR Administrative Assistant Beth Yates and HR Generalist Shinae Pak reported to HR Manager Audie Swegman that [*9]  Oirya again had been observed sleeping on the job and that Pak had taken a photograph of Oirya asleep at 3:00 p.m.—well past his lunch break. (Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶¶ 9-10; Doc. 53-7 at p. 2, ¶¶ 2, 6-7; Doc. 53-8 at p. 2, ¶¶ 2, 7-8). At the request of Swegman, Pak and Yates provided formal statements to Regier. (Doc. 53-4 at p. 4, ¶ 13.a.; Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶ 9). Based on those statements and the corroborating photograph, Swegman and Regier concluded that Oirya had violated both the conduct policy and the Last Chance Agreement. (Doc. 53-4 at p. 4, ¶ 13.c.-d.; Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶¶ 10-12) . As a result, Swegman and Regier recommended that Oirya's employment be terminated. (Doc. 53-4 at p. 4, ¶ 13.e.; Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶ 12a.). Senior HR Manager James Kendrick approved the recommendation, and Swegman notified Oirya on December 3, 2018 that his employment had been terminated for sleeping on the job in violation of the conduct policy and the Last Chance Agreement. (Doc. 34-4; Doc. 53-5 at p. 3, ¶ 12b.-c.).

II. Legal Standard
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter [*10]  of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment therefore "bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the [record, including pleadings, discovery materials and affidavits], which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine [dispute] of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (alterations added); see also Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc., 64 F.3d 590, 593 (11th Cir. 1995) (holding that the moving party has the initial burden of showing there is no genuine dispute of material fact). The movant may meet its burden by presenting evidence that negates the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact or by asserting that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some element of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-24. If the movant does not satisfy its initial burden, summary judgment must be denied. See Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, 694 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir. 2012), cert. den., 569 U.S. 919, 133 S. Ct. 1810, 185 L. Ed. 2d 812 (2013).
If the movant adequately supports its motion, however, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish—"by producing affidavits or other relevant and admissible evidence beyond the pleadings"—a genuine dispute of material fact. Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., 662 F.3d 1292, 1315 (11th Cir. 2011); Dietz v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 598 F.3d 812, 815 (11th Cir. 2010); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A fact is "material" if it is "a legal element of the claim under the applicable [*11]  substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case." Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997). A dispute is "genuine" if the nonmoving party produces sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to return a verdict in its favor. Waddell v. Valley Forge Dental Assocs., Inc., 276 F.3d 1275, 1279 (11th Cir. 2001).
In evaluating whether summary judgment is appropriate, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. See, e.g., Miller's Ale House, Inc. v. Boynton Carolina Ale House, LLC, 702 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir. 2012). Nonetheless, "[i]f no reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and summary judgment will be granted." Morton v. Kirkwood, 707 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2

III. Procedural History
Oirya presented two claims in his Complaint. First, he asserted that Mando failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. (Doc. 1 at pp. 13-15). Second, he asserted that Mando retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity. (Id. at pp. 15-17).
Oirya subsequently attempted to assert two additional claims by amendment. (Doc. 20). The proposed amendment would have asserted a Count III for disparate treatment and a Count IV for wrongful termination. (Doc. 20 at p. 1). However, Oriya's request to amend was denied. (Doc. 32 at pp. 1-3). A later [*12]  request to assert claims for sex discrimination likewise was denied. (Doc. 34; Doc. 48). The undersigned thus will address only the pending claims for failure to accommodate and retaliation.

IV. Discussion

A. Failure to Accommodate
It is unlawful under the ADA for a covered entity not to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To make a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff has the burden of establishing that: "(1) [he] is disabled; (2) [he] was a 'qualified individual' at the relevant time, meaning [he] could perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) the employer failed to provide a reasonable accommodation." Danielle-DiSerafino v. Dist. Sch. Bd. of Collier Cnty., Fla., 756 F. App'x 940, 942 (11th Cir. 2018); see also Hall v. Wal-Mart Assocs., Inc., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1267, 1270-71 (M.D. Ala. 2005) (citing Pritchard v. S. Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1134 (11th Cir. 1996)).
"'The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions.'" Garrison v. City of Tallahassee, 664 F. App'x 823, 826 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001)). Not only is the burden upon the plaintiff [*13]  to show the existence of a reasonable accommodation, an employer's "'duty to provide a reasonable accommodation [under the ADA] is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.'" Barneman v. Int'l Longshoreman Ass'n Loc., 1423, 840 F. App'x 468, 478 (11th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). When opposing a motion for summary judgment, conclusory allegations of requesting reasonable accommodations have no probative value in the absence of specific supporting facts. Salem v. City of Port St. Lucie, 788 F. App'x 692, 695 (11th Cir. 2019); see also Sugg v. City of Sunrise, No. 19-CV-62866, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186282, 2020 WL 6193514, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 6, 2020) (rejecting plaintiff's self-serving declaration and deposition testimony where the record was devoid of any evidence establishing that the plaintiff made a specific demand for accommodation at any point during his employment).
Oirya did not make a specific demand for accommodation in the written explanation he submitted in response to the Last Chance Agreement. Oirya stated therein that he had used his lunch break to rest and allow his stomach pains to subside. Nowhere in the written explanation did Oirya request any type of further accommodation for his alleged symptoms. To the contrary, Oirya expressly stated that "the food poisoning did not require [him] to ask for [a] costly accommodation, since the company-provided breaks [we]re already provided for in th[e] policy." [*14]  (Doc. 53-4 at p. 10) (emphasis added). Nor does Oirya's deposition testimony or Declaration reflect that he ever notified the HR Department of any need for additional breaks or other specific accommodations. And the sworn Declarations submitted by Mando reflect that no such requests were made. (Doc. 53-4, at ¶ 10d.; Doc. 53-6, at ¶¶ 7a.-c.).
In short, this case does not present a scenario where Oirya was denied a requested reasonable accommodation. Construed most favorably to Oirya, the record reflects that he at all times was utilizing available break periods to alleviate the symptoms of his medical conditions. (Doc. 67-1 at pp. 3-4, ¶¶ 11-12). Those breaks, by Oirya's own admission, were available to all salaried employees of Mando. (Doc. 57 at pp. 30-33). The evidence does not suggest that Oirya was denied those breaks or that he was terminated because he took them; rather, it was Oriya's alleged conduct of sleeping during the breaks that resulted in his termination. Even though Oriya denies ever being guilty of sleeping on the job and has stated under oath that he informed Regier in February 2018 that the perceived sleeping was merely an attempt to alleviate his symptoms by lying [*15]  down, it is clear that the dispute here is not one for failure to accommodate.3
Oirya further argues that he sought a reasonable accommodation by requesting "meaningful Due Process," i.e., the right to notice of the allegations made against him, the right to question his accusers, the right to present evidence in his favor, and the right to a decision by a neutral party. (Doc. 58-1 at p. 4, ¶¶ 13-14). Oirya contends that such a request was sufficient to initiate an "interactive process" with Mando. (Doc. 57 at p. 28); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) ("To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation."). Requesting what amounts to an administrative hearing, however, is not the "interactive process" envisioned by the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit indeed has recognized that an employer is not required by the ADA to conduct a full pretermination investigation before terminating an employee. Moses v. Am. Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 448 (11th Cir. 1996). Further, the Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged that an employer's failure to engage in an interactive process does not automatically violate the ADA. Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997).

B. Retaliation
 [*16] The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To establish a claim of retaliation under the ADA, a claimant must show: (1) that he engaged in a protected expression; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that the protected conduct and the adverse employment action were causally related. See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260). According to Oirya, Mando retaliated against him because he took breaks, refused to sign the Last Chance Agreement, and sought "meaningful Due Process."
Oirya's refusal to sign the Last Chance Agreement and his request for "meaningful Due Process" both relate to the February 2, 2018 verbal discussion with Regier and the written explanation he submitted to Regier a week later. Yet it is undisputed that the decision to terminate Oirya's employment was not made until December 2018 after Mando HR personnel received another report that Oirya had been sleeping on the job. As previously addressed, Oriya contends that he was not sleeping but was merely lying down during a permissible break as a means to alleviate symptoms associated with his medical conditions—a practice he says was discussed with Regier in February 2018. However, Oirya has not presented sufficient evidence [*17]  that anything said or done in February 2018 was the "but-for cause" of his December 2018 termination so as to create a genuine dispute of material fact on his claim for retaliation. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (explaining that "[t]he third element [for retaliation] requires a showing of but-for causation") (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)).
The temporal separation between Oirya's February 2018 conduct, even if it were assumed to constitute protected expression, and his December 2018 termination is simply too great to infer a causal connection:
The burden of causation can be met by showing close temporal proximity between the statutorily protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798-99 (11th Cir.2000). But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be "very close." Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (internal citations omitted). A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough. See id. (citing Richmond v. ONEOK, 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir.1997) (3 month period insufficient) and Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir.1992) (4 month period insufficient)). Thus, in the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, if there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action, the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law. See Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2004) (citing Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir.2001)).
Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added). [*18]  The ten-month period here falls well outside what has been deemed "very close," and the record does not reflect the requisite degree of "more" to overcome such a gap and satisfy Oriya's burden to establish a prima face case.4 See also Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) ("We are not persuaded that three months ... is sufficiently proximate to show causation.") (citing Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir. 2001)); Ambus v. AutoZoners, LLC, 71 F. Supp. 3d 1280, 1304 (M.D. Ala. 2014) (granting summary judgment because eight-month delay was not sufficiently close for purposes of causation).
To the extent Oirya attempts to predicate his retaliation claim on the use of periodic breaks, the analysis is the same. There is no evidence that Oriya was denied breaks afforded to other employees, that he requested specific further accommodation, or that he expressed any complaints of discriminatory practices between his alleged conversation with Regier in February 2018 and his eventual termination in December 2018.

V. Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, the undersigned Magistrate Judge hereby RECOMMENDS that the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 51) filed by Mando be GRANTED and that the Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 66) filed by Oirya be DENIED.
It is ORDERED that any objections to this Recommendation must be filed no later than [*19]  March 15, 2023. An objecting party must identify the specific portion of the factual findings or legal conclusions to which the objection is made and must describe in detail the basis for the objection. Frivolous, conclusive, or general objections will not be considered.
Failure to file a written objection to this Recommendation shall bar a party from a de novo determination by the District Court of any factual findings or legal conclusions contained herein and shall waive the right of the party to challenge on appeal any subsequent order that is based on factual findings and legal conclusions accepted or adopted by the District Court, except upon grounds of plain error or manifest injustice. 11th Cir. R. 3-1; see Resolution Trust Co. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir. 1993); Henley v. Johnson, 885 F.2d 790, 794 (11th Cir. 1989).
