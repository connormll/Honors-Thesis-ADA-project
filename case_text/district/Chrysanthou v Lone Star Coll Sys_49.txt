Opinion



 [*1068]  ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 16).

I.

A.
Lone Star College System ("Defendant") is a community college that operates a system of community colleges in and around Montgomery and Harris County, Texas. (Instrument No. 1 at 2). On October 1, 2012, Defendant hired Nicholas Chrysanthou ("Plaintiff') as a Specialist for the Student Outreach and Recruitment Division of Defendant's North Harris Campus. [*1069]  (Instrument No. 16 at 7). Defendant's specialist positions are classified as non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act and are within the lower tiered group of non-faculty support staff. (Instrument No. 16-7 at 30). Plaintiff's job duties consisted of coordinating on-campus and off-campus recruitment events, representing Defendant at those events, and assisting both current and future students with special needs. (Instrument No. 16-4 at 2). Additionally, Plaintiff was [**2]  responsible for promoting Defendant's academic programs to prospective students, assisting and tracking student follow-up appointments via the student database, disseminating information through telephone calls, information tables and public speaking, and pursuing new outlets for recruitment. (Instrument No. 16-4 at 2).

1.
Plaintiff suffers from Crohn's disease, a disease of the digestive system that causes Plaintiff to frequently experience substantial pain in the stomach and digestive areas. (Instrument No. 21 at 3). Additionally, Plaintiff experiences diarrhea, causing him to use the restroom sporadically at uncontrolled times. Id. Plaintiff's routine interaction with the public and campus tours hindered him from using the restroom in an urgent manner and thus he began to experience a flare up in his symptoms. Id. at 4. As a result, Plaintiff could only attend work sporadically from June 2013 to September 2013. (Instrument No. 16-6 at 5-6).
In October 2013, Plaintiff took an extended leave of absence, providing a doctor's note, stating that he would be "off work indefinitely" due to "deteriorating Crohn's disease." (Instrument No. 16-6 at 47-48). On August 13, 2014, Plaintiff's doctor requested [**3]  three work accommodations upon Plaintiff's return to work. (Instrument No. 16 at 8). First, that Plaintiff be transferred to a position that does not require as much travel. Id. Second, that Plaintiff be able to receive leave for medical appointments, hospitalization or surgery or to stabilize medication levels. Id. Third, that he be allowed a flexible schedule, as needed or a work location near the restroom during the flare-ups. Id. at 8-9. Defendant granted Plaintiff a flexible work schedule to include restroom breaks, doctor's appointments or treatment and flexible use of paid and unpaid leave, and a workstation closer to the restroom. Id. at 9. Additionally, Defendant eliminated the requirement that Plaintiff travel off-campus to recruitment events and agreed to transfer Plaintiff to a comparable job with less demand of travel, once a position was available. Id. The accommodation request that Plaintiff be allowed to work from home was the only one Defendant denied. (Instrument No. 21-8 at 4).
While on extended leave, Plaintiff applied for 16 available positions with Defendant. Plaintiff never heard anything back from Defendant's Human Resources department and returned to work on September 29, 2014. [**4]  (Instrument No. 21 at 12). Although Defendant informed Plaintiff that it would only continue to assist him in locating another position at his current level of Specialist II, it also stated that Plaintiff was free to apply for any open position that he qualified for. (Instrument No. 21-8 at 4). However, Defendant noted in its email to Plaintiff that the manager of each position he applied to was not required to hire him based on his disability. Id. Subsequently, Defendant offered to transfer Plaintiff to two available positions that it contends were lateral transfers. (Instrument No. 16 at 8-9). Plaintiff chose to decline both offers and contends that they were not comparable positions. (Instrument No. 21 at 11).
 [*1070]  On February 2, 2015, Plaintiff started another medical leave of absence. (Instrument No. 21 at 12-13). While still on leave, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff informing him that his one year of continuous leave would terminate on January 29, 2016, and that he had exhausted all forms of leave. Defendant advised that if Plaintiff needed more time off because of his medical condition, he and his health care provider needed to complete and submit the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") request forms as medical documentation so that Defendant could determine whether he qualified for an ADA accommodation and could obtain additional leave. (Instrument No. 16-6 at 29). Under Defendant's leave policy, if an employee is unable to return to work after one year of leave, Defendant will evaluate the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the position.  [**5] Id at 70-71. If the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his position with a reasonable accommodation, the employee will be terminated. Id. On January 27, 2016, Plaintiff informed Defendant that he would not be able to return to work by the January 29, 2016, deadline and requested additional time to provide medical documentation. (Instrument No. 16 at 11). Defendant granted the request and set the extended deadline to February 22, 2016. Id. On February 19, 2016, Plaintiff provided another ADA Reasonable Accommodation form that he filled out and an unsigned doctor's note from two years prior, dated August 13, 2014. Id. Plaintiff failed to provide any medical authorization, or a return-to-work date. Id. On February 23, 2016, Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment. Id.

B.
Plaintiff filed [**6]  his Original Complaint against Defendant on May 2, 2017. (Instrument No. 1). Plaintiff brings causes of action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") alleging disability discrimination and failure to accommodate. Id. Defendant filed an Answer to the Original Complaint on July 10, 2017, (Instrument No. 4), and filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on July 2, 2018. (Instrument No. 16). Plaintiff filed its Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on August 15, 2018. (Instrument No. 21). On August 20, 2018, Defendant filed its Reply in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 24).

II.
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Warfield v. Byron, 436 F.3d 551, 557 (5th Cir. 2006).
The "movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Triple Tee Golf Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25). "A fact is 'material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing [**7]  law." Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir. 2009). An issue is "genuine" if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party, the movant may satisfy [*1071]  its initial burden by "showing — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. While the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). "If the moving party fails to meet [its] initial burden, the motion [for summary judgment] must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response." United States v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, 537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).
After the moving party has met its burden, in order to "avoid a summary judgment, the nonmoving party must adduce admissible evidence which creates a fact issue concerning the existence of every essential component of that party's case." Thomas v. Price, 975 F.2d 231, 235 (5th Cir. 1992). The party opposing summary judgment cannot merely rely on the contentions contained in the pleadings. Little, 37 F.3d at 1075. Rather, the "party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate [**8]  the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim," Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998); Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir. 2007). Although the court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Connors v. Graves, 538 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir. 2008), the nonmovant's "burden will not be satisfied by some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence." Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075). Similarly, "unsupported allegations or affidavit or deposition testimony setting forth ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Clark v. Am.'s Favorite Chicken, 110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir. 1997).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the district court does not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence. E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 612 n.3 (5th Cir. 2009). Nor does the court "sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary judgment." Jackson v. Cal-Western Packaging Corp., 602 F.3d 374, 379-80 (5th Cir. 2010); Malacara v. Garber, 353 F.3d 393, 405 (5th Cir. 2003); Ragas, 136 F.3d at 458; Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, 845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir. 1988) (it is not necessary "that the entire record in the case ... be searched and found bereft of a genuine issue of material fact before summary judgment may be properly entered"). Therefore, "[w]hen evidence exists in the summary judgment record but the nonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary judgment, that evidence is not properly [**9]  before the district court." Malacara, 353 F.3d at 405.

III.

A.
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). (Instrument No. 16). Defendant contends that (1) Defendant reasonably accommodated Plaintiff and his request for indefinite leave was unreasonable; (2) Plaintiff is not considered to be a qualified individual for his position as a Specialist for the Student Outreach and Recruitment  [*1072]  Division because of his inability to work even with reasonable accommodations; (3) Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff was legitimate, non-discriminatory and without pretext. Id.
In Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff asserts that he qualifies as an individual with a disability under the ADA because it is undisputed that he suffers from Crohn's Disease. (Instrument No. 21 at 14). Plaintiff further contends Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate him in August of 2014 when they were legally required to do so. Id. at 14-15. Plaintiff contends that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process, with good faith, to help determine what accommodations were necessary. Id. at 15 [**10] . Plaintiff also asserts that there is a genuine issue of fact regarding Defendant's reasoning behind the termination of Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that Defendant was aware of his medical condition and that additional extended medical leave would not have been necessary if Defendant would have fully accommodated him originally. Id. at 16-17.

1.
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that she has a disability; (2) that she was qualified for the job; and (3) that she was subject to an adverse employment decision on account of her disability. E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. 2014). If an employee meets her burden in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. Id. at 701. Once the employer meets its burden, the burden shifts back to the employee to offer evidence that the employer's proffered reason is not true, but a pretext for the employer's conduct. Id. at 702.
The Court assumes without deciding that Plaintiff has established a [**11]  prima facie case of discrimination, however, Defendant has provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his termination. Sjöstrand v.Ohio State University, 750 F.3d 596, 599 (6th Cir. 2014). In Vazquez v. Laredo Transit Management, Inc., the defendant employer fired the plaintiff because he did not return to work after his one-year leave had expired, he failed to provide an expected return date, and did not provide sufficient medical information supporting his inability to return to work. No. L-06-cv-94, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60216, 2007 WL 2363152, at *11-12 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 16, 2007) (Alvarez, J.). The court held that these facts were enough to show that the defendant's decision to terminate the plaintiff was legitimate and not discriminatory towards his disability. Id.
Here, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff was terminated pursuant to a non-discriminatory policy that provides that after one year of leave, an employee will be terminated if he is unable to perform the essential functions of his position. (Instrument No. 16-6 at 70-71; Instrument No. 16 at 18-19). Defendant informed Plaintiff that his one year of continuous leave would expire on January 29, 2016. Id. at 11. It is undisputed that Defendant requested medical certification to determine how it could accommodate Plaintiff in accordance with Defendant's policy. Id. Plaintiff [**12]  informed Defendant that he would not be able to return to work by the January 29, 2016, deadline and asked for an extension to submit the requested documents. Id. Defendant granted the extension request, but Plaintiff provided only a doctor's note that was two years old and failed to submit  [*1073]  medical authorization and a return-to-work date. Id. Plaintiff had exhausted his leave, and without any medical documentation, Defendant was under no obligation to reinstate Plaintiff. Id. Plaintiff does not dispute that he failed to provide updated medical documentation to support an extended leave of absence. (Instrument No. 16-2 at 51-52).
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has met its burden of production in showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination.
With Defendant having met its burden of production, Plaintiff must then demonstrate that Defendant's alleged non-discriminatory reason for termination was a mere pretext, and that the underlying reason for termination emanated from his disability. Rodriguez v. Eli Lilly & Co., 820 F.3d 759, 765 (5th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff may prove pretext by "either showing that a discriminatory reason motivated the defendant or by a showing that the proffered reason is unworthy of credence." [**13]  Moore v. Eli Lilly & Co., 990 F.2d 812, 815 (5th Cir. 1993). To meet this burden, Plaintiff must provide substantial evidence of pretext. Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., 249 F.3d 400, 402-03 (5th Cir. 2001).
Plaintiff has no evidence demonstrating a discriminatory reason for the termination of his employment. Plaintiff merely asserts that Defendant was aware of his medical condition and the limitations that it caused. (Instrument No. 21 at 17). Outside of this, Plaintiff points to no specific evidentiary material, either direct or circumstantial, that proves Defendant treated him differently than other similarly situated employees. Plaintiff's broad speculation and subjective belief that he was terminated because of his disability are insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. See Douglass v. United Services Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1430 (5th Cir. 1996) ("It is more than well-settled that an employee's subjective belief that he suffered an adverse employment action as a result of discrimination, without more, is not enough to survive a summary judgment motion, in the fact of proof showing an adequate nondiscriminatory reason."). Furthermore, Plaintiff fails to offer any evidence that Defendant's proffered reason for his termination is unworthy of credence. Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp., Inc., 482 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir. 2007). An employer's explanation is "unworthy of credence if it is not the real reason for the employment action." Id. [**14]  Further, the "[e]vidence that the proffered reason is unworthy of credence must be enough to support a reasonable inference that the proffered reason is false; a mere shadow of doubt is insufficient." Auguster, 249 F.3d at 403. Plaintiff's broad allegation does not support an inference that Defendant's reason for terminating his employment was false and Plaintiff fails to provide evidence of pretext.
While the parties dispute whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" to perform his job in the first place, the Court need not consider this issue because Plaintiff has failed to identify any evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disability when it terminated his employment.

2.
Plaintiff further brings a failure to accommodate claim. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability because he did not receive a transfer to any of his preferred vacant positions, was still required to give on campus tours, and was not allowed to work from home, as he had requested. (See Instruments  [*1074]  No. 21 at 14-15; No. 16 at 14-15). Defendant contends that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual under the ADA. (Instrument [**15]  No. 16 at 7). Defendant also contends that Plaintiff was provided reasonable accommodations, including a flexible work schedule with reasonable leave as needed, a work station near the restroom, and offered comparable positions as transfers. Id.
Under the ADA, discrimination includes a failure to make "'reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.'" Feist v. La., Dep't of Justice, Office of the Atty. Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the plaintiff is a "qualified individual with a disability;" (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were "known" by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make "reasonable accommodations" for such known limitations. Id. When a qualified individual with a disability requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer and employee should engage in a flexible interactive process to determine the appropriate accommodation. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). However, the "ADA does not require an employer to relieve an employee of any essential functions of his or her job, modify those [**16]  duties, reassign existing employees to perform those jobs, or hire new employees to do so." Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 621 (5th Cir. 1999) ("Since one of the essential duties of any firefighter is to fight fires, if [plaintiff] cannot perform that duty, then he cannot be reasonably accommodated as a matter of law.").
Here, there is no dispute that Defendant knew about Plaintiffs disability. Although the parties dispute whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual, the Court need not address this issue. The evidence leaves no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant accommodated Plaintiff. Under the ADA, a reasonable accommodation may include:
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (1990). The appendix to the ADA explains that employers are given broad discretion in determining effective [**17]  accommodations and does not require an employer to create a new position to accommodate a disabled employee. Toronka v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 411 F. App'x 719, 725 (5th Cir. 2011); 29 C.F.R. § 1630 App.
In Toronka, the plaintiff asserted that he should be assigned to permanent logbook duties. 411 F. App'x at 725. However, the defendant did not have a permanent logbook position. Id. at 726. The court held that forcing the defendant to create a position is not a reasonable accommodation. Id. (stating "it is not an employer's responsibility to fashion a new job, as Toronka asserts"). Here, Plaintiff's job description was listed as Specialist II and nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act. (Instrument No.16-4 at 2). Defendant stated that it does not have work from home assignments available for nonexempt status [*1075]  positions and cited to Foreman v. Babcock Co., stating that the accommodation cannot show favor to a disabled individual over a non-disabled individual. (Instrument No. 16-6 at 17; Foreman v. Babcock Co., 117 F.3d 800 (5th Cir. 1997)). Accordingly, Defendant is not required to create a new job type for Plaintiff's disability and the request to work from home is unreasonable.
Instead, Defendant accommodated Plaintiff by granting his request to remove the off-campus travel requirements, allowing a reduced work schedule, and offering him two clerical [**18]  positions as transfers. (Instrument No. 16 at 14). In turn, Plaintiff declined the job offers because he viewed the clerical positions as an effective demotion. (Instrument No. 21 at 11; Instrument No. 21-1 at 3) (stating that "Lone Star offered a staff clerical position, which was outside of the job duties that I had been handling. In addition, I was concerned since the position was not comparable and was effectively a demotion from the position that I was performing at the time."). However, the ADA only affords a right to a reasonable accommodation, rather than a preferred accommodation. E.E.O.C. v Argo Distrib., LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009).
In Allen v. Rapides Parish School Board, the plaintiff held a position as a media center coordinator for a school board. 204 F.3d 619, 620 (5th Cir. 2000). After the plaintiff's tinnitus condition worsened, the plaintiff requested a transfer to the position of a principal or vice principal because he believed these positions would allow him to have sufficient background noise to mitigate his symptoms. Id. Instead, the defendant offered to transfer him to a position as a high school librarian that paid approximately $10,000 less than his previous salary. Id. at 620-21. The court held that the plaintiff's complaint that he should have obtained [**19]  a position as a principal or vice principal was insufficient to establish a claim under the ADA. Id. at 622-23. The court articulated that the ADA allows employees to bring claims for discriminatory action but not unfair treatment. Id. at 623. Without evidence to demonstrate that the defendant had discriminated against the plaintiff by denying his transfer requests on the basis of his disability, the plaintiff had failed to satisfy his burden to overcome summary judgment. Id.
Similarly, Plaintiff here contends that he was not reasonably accommodated because he did not receive the transfer to his preferred position and viewed the clerical positions offered by Defendant as a demotion. However, as shown in Allen, Plaintiff is not entitled to choose the position to which he will be assigned. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was offered a position similar to the outreach department he worked in, with no travel, and thus accommodations given by defendant were indeed reasonable. (Instrument No. 16-2 at 37).
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADA is GRANTED. (Instrument No. 16).
