Order
[41,43]
The Court has considered the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, partial summary judgment filed by Defendants HNTP Corporation ["HNTP"], Amy Turner, and Lisa Ely [collectively, "the Employer Defendants"], together with the moving and opposing papers.
In 2012, Plaintiff Jill Ashley Fisher began working for HNTB as a temporary receptionist and administrative assistant. In 2014, HTNB gave Fisher a permanent position as a senior administrative assistant. Turner and Ely are employed by HNTB as a senior benefits analyst and a human resources coordinator, respectively.
In 2016, Fisher started experiencing symptoms that were ultimately determined to be caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ["ALS"]. On August 2, 2017, Fisher underwent [*2]  spinal surgery for issues related to ALS. Following her surgery, Fisher coordinated with Turner and Ely to take medical leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. ["FMLA"], and the California Family Rights Act, Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2, et seq. ["CFRA"]. HNTB hired Connie Hagerman as Fisher's temporary replacement while she was on leave.
Fisher's FMLA and CFRA leave was initially scheduled from July 31, 2017, to October 24, 2017. Fisher was, also, placed on short-term disability leave by her physician, Dr. Richard Kim, to run concurrently with her FMLA and CFRA leave. According to Fisher, Dr. Kim approved her short-term disability for several months, but the Employer Defendants approved her leave for only a few weeks at a time, and required regular updates on her condition. According to Fisher, the Employer Defendants' numerous inquiries for updates on her condition overwhelmed her and made it difficult for her to recover from surgery. Fisher contends that the Employer Defendants' inquiries were so frequent that Dr. Kim's office had to contact the Employer Defendants to warn them of the detrimental effects of their inquiries on Fisher's health. The Employer Defendants disputed those contentions.
Although it [*3]  is undisputed that Dr. Kim extended Fisher's short-term disability several times, the parties disagree as to when Fisher's short-term disability was set to expire. Fisher contends it was set to expire on January 30, 2018, while the Employer Defendants contend it was set to expire on January 2, 2018.
On December 20, 2017, Ely sent Fisher a letter stating that her employment would be terminated if her short-term disability leave was not extended or if she failed to request reasonable accommodations to permit her return to work by January 30, 2018. In response, Fisher informed Ely that, inter alia, she would like to discuss accommodations. It is undisputed that Fisher, Turner, and Ely discussed the possibility of accommodations in a general manner. Specific accommodations were not discussed. Fisher contends that this was due to Turner and Ely ignoring her attempts to have such a discussion.
On December 27, 2017, Dr. Kim's office e-mailed progress notes from Fisher's latest appointment to Turner and Ely. According to Fisher, a release to work form was attached to that e-mail. The Employer Defendants, however, dispute that there was an attachment to that e-mail.
The Employer Defendants assert [*4]  that on December 29, 2017, Fisher applied for long-term disability benefits. Fisher asserted that she did not initiate the change to long-term disability.
On January 3, 2018, Ely told HNTB's Human Resources Director, Hillary Aue, that Fisher's return date was still unknown. On January 8, 2018, HNTB began searching for Fisher's replacement, to start on January 29, 2018. On January 9, 2018, HNTB gave Fisher's position permanently to Hagerman.
The following events occurred on January 24, 2018. Fisher e-mailed Turner, informing her that Dr. Kim would be sending Turner a release for Fisher to return to work. Turner did not respond to the e-mail. Fisher contends that Dr. Kim released her to return to work on January 29, 2018, with certain conditions, but the Employer Defendants contend that they never received the release. Aue e-mailed Fisher to tell her that her employment would be terminated on January 30, 2018, because she had exhausted her FMLA leave and her return to work date remained unknown. In a subsequent phone call, Aue told Fisher that her position had been filled. Fisher asserted, but the Employer Defendants dispute, that Aue, also, told Fisher that her position had been eliminated. [*5]  Fisher asserted, but the Employer Defendants dispute, that she asked about an open receptionist position and Aue told her that position was, also, filled. Fisher did not apply for any other positions with HNTB, and Aue did not inform Fisher of any available positions. Fisher argued that this conversation with Aue constituted her termination. However, the Employer Defendants argued that Fisher was not terminated until February 2, 2018.
Fisher, currently, receives long-term disability benefits and has been deemed permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration.
On February 21, 2018, Fisher filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which, subsequently, issued a right to sue letter. On August 20, 2018, Fisher initiated this action in the Orange County Superior Court, alleging: (1) HNTB, Turner, and Ely violated the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov. Code § 12900, et seq. ["FEHA"]; (2) HNTB violated the CFRA; (3) HNTB breached an express oral contract and an implied oral contract to not terminate Fisher's employment without good cause; (4) HNTB wrongfully terminated Fisher in violation of public policy; (5) HNTB negligently hired, supervised, and retained [*6]  Turner and Ely; and (6) Turner and Ely are liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Notably, Fisher did not allege a claim under the FMLA. On September 20, 2018, the Employer Defendants removed.
The Employer Defendants, now, move for summary judgment or, in the alternative, partial summary judgment.

Summary Judgment Standard
When considering a motion for summary judgment, where the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, as Fisher has here, summary judgment should be granted when the nonmoving party fails to produce evidence to establish a prima facie case. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The Employer Defendants, as the moving parties, however, have the initial burden to show that Fisher does not have enough evidence to establish a prima facie case for her claims. See Williams v. Gerber Prods. Co., 552 F. 3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2008). The Employer Defendants have met their initial burden. Thus, the burden shifts to Fisher to establish, with admissible evidence, a prima facie case for her claims. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. At this juncture, the Court cannot weigh evidence or make credibility determinations and must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Fisher. See Marable v. Nitchman, 511 F.3d 924, 929 (9th Cir. 2007).

FEHA Claims Against HNTB
Fisher alleged that HNTB violated FEHA by discriminating against her, retaliating [*7]  against her, failing to engage in the interactive process, and failing to provide reasonable accommodation.
Discrimination and retaliation claims under FEHA are similar to each other. To establish a prima facie case for discrimination under FEHA, Fisher must establish that: (1) She belongs to a protected class; (2) She was otherwise qualified to perform her job; (3) She suffered an adverse employment action, such as, inter alia, a termination; and (4) There are circumstances suggesting discriminatory motive. See Dinslage v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 5 Cal. App. 5th 368, 378, 209 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2016). To establish a prima facie case for retaliation under FEHA, Fisher must establish that: (1) She engaged in a protected activity, such as, inter alia, requesting an accommodation or taking medical leave; (2) That she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) The adverse employment action was caused by Fisher's engagement in the protected activity. See Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 244, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016).
It is undisputed that Fisher is a member of a protected class, that she was otherwise qualified to perform her job, and that she suffered an adverse employment action after engaging in a protected activity. Accordingly, whether Fisher can establish her FEHA claims for discrimination and retaliation turns on whether her termination [*8]  was motivated or caused by her taking medical leave.
At this juncture, the Court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to Fisher, cannot weigh the evidence, or make credibility determinations. See Marable, 511 F.3d at 924. HNTB filled Fisher's position while she was attempting to communicate with Turner and Ely about returning to work with reasonable accommodations. Further, despite the Employer Defendants' contentions that Fisher's leave was set to expire on January 8, 2019, Ely's December 20, 2017, letter indicated that Fisher had until January 30, 2017, to return to work. Although the parties dispute that Fisher's termination was motivated or caused by her taking medical leave, the Court must infer that the leave was, at least, part of the consideration. See Flair v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 479 (1992). Accordingly, Fisher has established a prima facie case for her FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims against HNTB.
Fisher's claims for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodation claims under FEHA are, also, similar to each other. Employees with disabilities are entitled to reasonable workplace accommodations that enable them to perform the essential functions of their jobs. Dep't of Fair Employment & Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743 (9th Cir. 2011). An employer [*9]  must engage, in good faith, with its employee in an interactive process to determine and provide reasonable accommodations. Dep't of Fair Employment & Housing, 642 F.3d 728 at 742. Both sides are obligated to communicate and neither side is allowed to obstruct or delay the process. Stephenson v. United Airlines, Inc., 9 F. App'x 760, 766 (9th Cir. 2001).
Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Fisher, she sufficiently established that she attempted to contact Turner and Ely to discuss accommodations but was repeatedly ignored. Further, Fisher established that she did not receive reasonable accommodations. Accordingly, Fisher has established a prima facie case for her FEHA failure to engage in an interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodations claims against HNTB.

FEHA Claims Against Turner and Ely
Fisher alleged that Turner and Ely violated FEHA by harassing her while she was on medical leave. FEHA allows for individual liability for harassment. Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 645, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998).
To establish a prima facie case for harassment under FEHA, Fisher must establish that she was subject to conduct or comments that were: (1) Based on her disability; and (2) Were "sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of [her] employment." See Doe v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 43 Cal. App. 5th 721, 736, 255 Cal. Rptr. 3d 910 (Ct. App. 2019). The Court may consider factors, such as, "the frequency of the conduct, its [*10]  severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance." See Doe, 43 Cal. App. 5th 721 at 736, 255 Cal. Rptr. 3d 910.
Fisher took her medical leave pursuant to the FMLA and the CFLA. The FMLA allows employers to request recertification of an employee's condition every thirty days. See Williams v. Boeing Co., 166 F.3d 1219, 1219 (9th Cir. 1999). Additionally, where circumstances changed significantly since the prior certification, the FMLA allows for more frequent requests for recertification. See 29 C.F.R. 825.308.
Fisher failed to establish a prima facie case that Turner's and Ely's bi-weekly recertification requests were sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to have altered the conditions of Fisher's employment or created a hostile work environment. Moreover, Fisher did not establish a prima facie case that the contacts were physically threatening or humiliating, and that they interfered with Fisher's work performance

CFRA Claim Against HNTB
To establish a prima facie case for a violation of the CFRA, Fisher must establish that she suffered an adverse employment action because she took CFRA-protected leave. See Rodgers v. City of Los Angeles, 198 Cal. App. 4th 480, 491, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011). For the reasons discussed above, Fisher has established a prima facie claim for this case.
HNTB argued that, pursuant [*11]  to Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal. App. 4th 509, 518, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006), an employer may terminate an employee who is unable to return to work after the CFRAs protected twelve-week leave period expires. HNTB's argument is misplaced. Fisher's claim is that her CFRA leave was a negative factor in HNTB's decision to terminate her, not that she was terminated within the twelve-week CFRA-protected period.

Breach of Contract and Wrongful Termination Claims Against HNTB
In California, an employer may terminate an at-will employee for almost any reason, except for reasons that violate a law or public policy. See Phillips v. St. Mary Reg'l Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 226, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 770 (2002). It is undisputed that Fisher was an at-will employee.
Because Fisher is an at-will employee, she cannot establish a prima facie case for breach of contract. See Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2003).
However, an employer may not terminate an at-will employee in violation of public policy. See Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1138. For example, an employer cannot terminate an employee in violation of FEHA. See Phillips, 96 Cal. App. 4th at 226. Here, Fisher's wrongful termination claim is predicated on, inter alia, her FEHA claims. Because Fisher has established a prima facie case for her FEHA claim against HNTB, she has established a prima facie case for her wrongful termination claim.

Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Claim Against HNTB
To establish [*12]  a prima facie case for negligent hiring, supervision, or retention, Fisher must establish, inter alia, that HNTB knew or should have known that Turner and Ely created a particular risk or hazard, and that particular harm materialized. See Alexander v. Cmty. Hosp. of Long Beach, 6 Cal. App. 5th 238, 259 Cal. Rptr. 3d 340 (Cal. Ct. App. 2020). Accordingly, Fisher must establish a prima facie case that HNTB had prior knowledge of Turners and Elys propensity to do a bad act. See Alexander, 6 Cal. App. 5th 238, 259 Cal. Rptr. 3d 340, 2020 WL 1149695 at 16.
Fisher failed to set forth evidence that HNTB knew, or should have known, that Turner and Ely would engage in a bad act against Fisher. See Celotex Corp. Accordingly, Fisher failed to establish a prima facie case for her for negligent hiring, supervision, or retention claim.

Intentional Infliction of Emotion Distress Claim Against the Employer Defendants
To establish a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Fisher must establish that: (1) The Employer Defendants engaged in outrageous conduct; (2) The conduct was intended to cause emotional distress, or recklessly caused emotional distress; (3) Fisher actually suffered from extreme emotional distress; and (4) The extreme emotional distress was caused by the conduct. See Yau v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc., 229 Cal. App. 4th 144, 160 (2014). Conduct is outrageous [*13]  if it is so extreme as to "exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in civilized society" and must be specifically alleged. Yau, 229 Cal. App. 4th 144 at 160-61, 176 Cal. Rptr. 3d 824.
Fisher argued that the Employer Defendants' alleged FEHA violations constituted outrageous conduct. As discussed above, Fisher failed to establish a prima facie case that Turner and Ely violated FEHA.
Even if Fisher had established a prima facie case that the Employer Defendants violated FEHA, and if those FEHA violations rose to the level of outrageous conduct, Fisher, nevertheless, failed to provide evidence that she suffered extreme emotional distress. See Hawkins v. SimplexGrinnell, L.P., 640 F. Appx. 640, * 644 (9th Cir. 2016). Thus, Fisher failed to establish a prima facie case for her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.
Accordingly,
It is Ordered that Defendants' motion for summary judgment be, and hereby is, Granted as to Fisher's breach of contract, negligent hiring, supervision and retention claim against HNTB; Fisher's FEHA claim against Turner and Ely; and Fisher's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against HNTB, Turner and Ely.
It is further Ordered that the motion for summary judgment be, and hereby is Denied as to the remaining claims.
