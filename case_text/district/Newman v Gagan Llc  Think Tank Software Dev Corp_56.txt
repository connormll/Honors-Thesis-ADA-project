Opinion



ORDER
This matter is before the Court on Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs Gagan LLC and Think Tank Software Development Corp.'s ("Defendants") Motion to Reconsider (DE 193). For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED.
The Court entered an Order on September 22, 2016, denying the parties' cross-motions [*2]  for summary judgment, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained that would preclude summary judgment. (DE 166.) Defendants filed their Motion to Reconsider on December 6, 2017, following what they state is a significant change in the law in a ruling issued by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. A trial is set in this case beginning on January 17, 2018.
Motions to reconsider a summary judgment ruling are brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which permits revision of non-final orders. Galvan v. Norberg, 678 F.3d 581, 587 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). The Seventh Circuit has summarized the role of motions to reconsider as follows:
A motion for reconsideration performs a valuable function where the Court has patently misunderstood a party, or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties, or has made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension. A further basis for a motion to reconsider would be a controlling or significant change in the law or facts since the submission of the issue to the Court.
Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc., 906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). A motion to reconsider "is not an appropriate forum for rehashing previously rejected arguments or arguing matters that could have been heard during the pendency of the previous motion." Caisse Nationale, 90 F.3d at 1269-70.
Defendants [*3]  state that there has been a material change in the law by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Severson v. Heartland Woodcraft, Inc., 872 F.3d 476 (7th Cir. 2017), that warrants summary judgment in their favor. Defendants claim that the Court in Severson ruled that a multi-month absence is beyond the scope of a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and this would have been dispositive of their argument in their summary judgment briefing. They claim that at the time of the briefing, the law only provided that whether leave under the ADA was a reasonable accommodation depended on whether the leave sought would be of indefinite duration. See Nowak v. St. Rita High Sch., 142 F.3d 999 (7th Cir. 1998).
However, this argument is disingenuous. The court in Severson, in stating a multi-month leave of absence is not covered by the ADA, directly quoted a 2003 case, Byrne v. Avon Prods., Inc., 328 F.3d 379, 381 (7th Cir. 2003). This case law was available to the parties at the time of the original briefing, and therefore is not grounds for reconsideration of the Court's Order denying summary judgment. Likewise, Defendants' argument that Severson stands for the premise that failing to engage in the process to discuss a reasonable accommodation is not an automatic violation of the ADA is not new law; it is drawn from a 2014 case, Spurling v. C & M Fine Pack, Inc., 739 F.3d 1055, 1059 n.1 (7th Cir. 2014). Revision [*4]  of the Court's Order denying summary judgment is not appropriate.
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Reconsider (DE 193) is DENIED.
SO ORDERED on January 5, 2018.
