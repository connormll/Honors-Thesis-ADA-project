Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
The above-entitled civil action is before the court on the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant. (Doc. 11). This matter is before the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b), Local Rule 72.1 and the General Order of Reference regarding such matters in the Northern District of Alabama. The parties have submitted briefs and evidence in support of and in opposition to the motion, and the matter is ready for disposition.
Plaintiff, Gloria Jones, filed a complaint alleging that she was subjected to discrimination on account of her race and disability during her employment at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, in the Defense Commissary Association (DeCA). She also claims she was retaliated against for testifying as a witness for another  [*2] employee in her EEOC proceedings. Plaintiff asserts causes of action pursuant to Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., for race discrimination (Count I) and retaliation (Count II), and pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for disability discrimination (Count III).
Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that she began her employment in DeCA as a Customer Service Clerk in March 2001. During her employment, plaintiff acted as a witness for Wannetta Robinson in Robinson's EEOC case. Plaintiff alleges that, thereafter, she was moved around to make her quit her job; however, employees who had not acted as witnesses in EEOC proceedings were not so treated. Plaintiff has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (diagnosed in 1999) and Type II diabetes. She states that she cannot do repetitive hand work. Plaintiff avers her shoulder was injured while she was on the job and that this is a permanent injury. Plaintiff's supervisors, both white, were James Burchfield (store administrator) and Lee Wainwright (store director). Plaintiff alleges Burchfield and Wainwright were overheard making remarks indicating racial animus and disdain for "lazy" light duty employees, such as plaintiff. On November  [*3] 5, 2002, plaintiff was terminated during a reduction in force (RIF); however, a white employee in plaintiff's same position was reassigned to Sales Store Checker rather than being terminated. Plaintiff claims she was not offered the option to transfer to another position, but white and non-disabled workers were afforded that option.

Summary Judgment Standard
This matter is considered by the court pursuant to the provisions of Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P. Summary judgment shall be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2509-10, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Thus, summary judgment is appropriate where the non-movant "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 332, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The substantive law governing the action determines whether an element is essential. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.  [*4] A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, identifying those portions of the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; see Brown v. Crawford, 906 F.2d 667, 669 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 933, 111 S. Ct. 2056, 114 L. Ed. 2d 461 (1991).
This circuit clearly holds that summary judgment should be entered when the moving party has sustained its burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact when all the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Sweat v. Miller Brewing Co., 708 F.2d 655 (11th Cir. 1983); see also, Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512. The evidence of  [*5] the non-movant is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in her favor. Id. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2514, citing Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608-09, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). It is, therefore, under this standard that the court must determine whether the movant can meet its burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence as to each material element of her claim sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find in her favor.

Facts
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party, the court finds the following facts.
Plaintiff, an African-American female, became employed with the Defense Commissary Agency, Redstone Arsenal (DeCA or Agency), as a part-time sales store checker, GS-2091-3, on December 28, 1992. (Def. Ex 1, Jones Depo., at 13). A sales store checker operates a cash register. The duties include operating a cash register scanning system to record unit prices in proper accounts, totaling purchases, collecting payment and making correct change. A checker may be required to stand for prolonged periods of time and lift up to 25 pounds. Twisting, bending, and manual dexterity using hands and  [*6] upper body are required. (Def. Ex. 2, Sales Store Checker Position Description, at 0388-392).
Alicia Washington (African-American) was the Supervisory Sales Store Checker at the Redstone Arsenal Commissary, and thus supervisor over the customer service department, and plaintiff's first-line (immediate) supervisor. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 19; Def. Ex. 3, Decl. of Alica Washington (Washington Decl.), at 0193). James Burchfield (white), Ms. Washington's second-level supervisor, was officially employed as the Store Administrator but temporarily became the Acting Store Director in February 2002. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 23; Def. Ex. 4, Decl. of James Burchfield (Burchfield Decl.), at 0176; Def. Ex. 5, Redstone Commissary Organizational Chart, at 0217). Herman Lee Wainwright (white) was the Store Director or Manager, and Mr. Burchfield's immediate supervisor and plaintiff's third-level supervisor, until he left Redstone in 2002. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 23-24; Def. Ex. 5, Redstone Commissary Organizational Chart, at 0271; Def. Ex. 6, Decl. of Lee Wainwright (Wainwright Decl.), at 0185).
In May 1999, plaintiff was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. (Def. Ex. 7, Jones  [*7] Aff., at 0159; Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 15-16, 133). According to plaintiff, the carpal tunnel syndrome prevented her from performing her official duties as a sales store checker. (Def. Ex. 7, Jones Aff., at 0160; Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 47). Jones informed the Agency that she had carpal tunnel syndrome. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 17, 32-33; Def. Ex. 22, Letter from Jones' physician to Alicia Washington dated June 22, 1999).
On March 20, 2000, defendant offered plaintiff a light duty position as a customer service clerk, to accommodate her medical condition. (Def. Ex. 8, Light Duty Job Offer, at 0364). Plaintiff accepted the light duty position. (Id. at 0367; Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo, at 28, 32-33). Plaintiff was accommodated by being allowed to work light duty jobs in the customer service department. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 30, 34-38).
Plaintiff was placed in three different jobs, only one of which was not in the customer service department (i.e., warehouse department), as an accommodation to her injury. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo. at 41-42). Jones testified in her deposition that Wainwright and Burchfield made the decisions regarding moving personnel to different jobs, not  [*8] Alicia Washington. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 91). After April 2001, Burchfield moved Jones from the Commissary administrative office to the Commissary warehouse on a temporary light duty assignment where she performed salvage work, e.g., marking down damaged goods. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 33-35).
Plaintiff testified that marking down salvage was a wage grade (WG) position, not a GS position such as Jones' (GS-3). (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 35, 42). Jones worked in the warehouse marking down salvage for one to two weeks. (Id. at 36). Plaintiff testified that after her salvage job, the Agency moved Jones back to her customer service position, then again moved her to the position of security monitor on the night shift. (Id. at 37-38). The security monitor position was created for light duty employees (id. at 36, 41), and the four light duty employees 1 rotated in and out of that position. (Id. at 38, 39). Plaintiff testified that she worked in the position of night shift security monitor for two to three months, which was not a customer service position. (Id. at 37, 41). Plaintiff testified that the Agency changed her position again and put her back in the Commissary administrative  [*9] office. (Id. at 38).
In 2001, the Defense Commissary Agency's Strategic Plan was implemented. (Def. Ex. 40, Aff. of Kristen D. Ogden). A corporate decision was made to reduce the number of workers at most stores. This decision was made by the Director, Chief Executive Officer and Regional Directors. (Id.).
The Regional Directors of each Region made the decisions concerning the number of positions to be eliminated. The Redstone commissary was originally in the Eastern Region but was later transferred, along with 25 other commissaries, to the Midwest Region on October 1, 2001. (Def. Ex. 9 at 0075, 0077, 0080, 0082 and 0084).
Redstone Commissary had to reduce its authorized personnel. (Def. Ex. 4, Burchfield Decl., at 0178). Attempts were made to satisfy this reduction by offering early retirement and separation incentives. However, this was not sufficient. (Def. Ex. 36 at 309; Def. Ex. 40). A reduction-in-force (RIF) became necessary. (Def. Ex. 40).
Human resource specialists determine employees' placement in the RIF, based  [*10] on their qualification and retention standing, i.e., length of service and performance appraisals. (Def. Ex. 40, Aff. of Kristen D. Ogden). Commissary store personnel do not select the specific individuals for RIF. (Id.). However, local management can determine which positions would be abolished to achieve required reductions. (Id.). Employees subject to RIF had "bump" or "retreat" rights. (Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl. at 0196).
According to plaintiff's immediate supervisor, "6 months to 1 year prior to the reduction in force, EEO representatives were on site to discuss a possible RIF with all employees and I do believe that Ms. Bonilla and Ms. Jones had an opportunity to speak with Ms. Rose Dibley and another gentleman from EEO." (Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0195). However, because plaintiff was home on leave from rotator cuff surgery during this time period, she apparently did not speak with an EEO representative. (See Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 64-65, 67-68, 91-92, 116).
On February 2, 2001, plaintiff was instructed to submit to a medical examination to determine her physical ability to return to performing her official duties as a sales store checker. (Def. Ex. 37 at 0551).  [*11] The result of the examination was that plaintiff was unable to perform her official duties as a sales store checker. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 28; Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0196).
On August 12, 2001, plaintiff was reassigned from sales store checker to customer service clerk. (Def. Ex. 38 at 0402). Plaintiff alleges that she met with an EEO counselor concerning another employee's (Wannetta Robinson) allegations of discrimination against light duty employees. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 29). In or about April 2001, Jones testified in an EEO investigation on behalf of her co-worker, Wannetta Robinson. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 29-30, 33). Wannetta Robinson was terminated from the Commissary in 2002. (Id. at 30).
On February 28, 2002, plaintiff fell while on duty and injured her right shoulder, arm and neck. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 61; Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0194). Plaintiff filed a claim with the Office of Worker's Compensation (OWCP) and her claim was accepted as an on-the-job injury in April 2002. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 89, 90; Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0194). Plaintiff was on leave due to her injury from May 2002 to November 2002. (Def. Ex.  [*12] 1, Jones Depo., at 61-62, 65).
On March 28, 2002, the decision was made to abolish the customer service clerk GS-03 positions at Redstone Arsenal Commissary. (Def. Ex. 10). On April 28, 2002, the Midwest Region authorized Redstone a total of 65 full time equivalents or FTEs. (Def. Ex. 39 at 0094). On May 24, 2002, a personnel management specialist notified the local union president by mail of the abolishment of the customer service clerk positions, effective no earlier than September 30, 2002, to achieve unit cost reductions and increase efficiencies. (Def. Ex. 11 at 0096).
Plaintiff testified that while she was recovering from her shoulder surgery, the Agency informed her that she was going to be terminated due to a RIF, which news devastated Jones. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 61-62). When Jones returned to work in November 2002, she worked in the Commissary administrative office until the RIF became effective. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 66).
On August 12, 2002, plaintiff received notice of Voluntary Separation Incentive Pay for Optional Retirement and Resignations in order to achieve unit cost reductions and achieve efficiencies. (Def. Ex. 12 at 0312). On October 15, 2002, a RIF  [*13] status report, generated by the Midwest Region, showed Redstone commissary with the highest number of over-executing FTEs in the Region.2 (Def. Ex. 13 at 0100).
Five female employees in the Customer Service Department were accommodated with light-duty requests, two of which were black: plaintiff and Ms. Robinson. (Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0194; Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo. at 27, 38).
Plaintiff received a Notice-of-Separation on November 1, 2002, advising her that the customer service clerk position was being abolished effective January 25, 2003. (Def. Ex. 14 at 0305). The effective date of the RIF for Redstone was January 26, 2003. (Def. Ex. 15 at 0110).
The three employees permanently assigned to the customer service clerk position prior to the position's abolishment were Gloria Jones, age 54, black female; Haydee Bonilla, age 35, Hispanic female; and Isle Mello, age 66, white female. (Def. Ex. 16 at 293-303; Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0196). All three customer service  [*14] clerk positions were abolished. (Def. Ex. 16 at 0293). As a result of the RIF, Jones, Ilse Mello, and Haydee Bonilla were terminated. (Def. Ex. 16).
Ms. Mello was "bumped into Sales Store Checker, accepted, took [a] physical and was cleared to do the Sales Store Checker job." (Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0196). Ms. Mello had seniority and therefore was able to "bump" a less senior employee from a Sales Store Checker position. Sales Store Checker Marilyn Truesdale was terminated after Ms. Mello "bumped" her. (Id.). Ms. Mello had more seniority than any other customer service clerk. Ms. Bonilla's service computation date was November 9, 1999; plaintiff's service computation date was September 8, 1987; and Ms. Mello's service computation date was March 13, 1981. (Def. Ex. 16 at 0294-303).
On November 12, 2002, plaintiff contacted an EEO counselor alleging discrimination on the bases of race, disability, and reprisal. (Def. Ex. 17 at 0140-0142). The protected activity plaintiff asserted was her testifying for a coworker. (Def. Ex. 17 at 0140).
Plaintiff continued in the position of customer service clerk until January 25, 2003, the effective date of plaintiff's separation. (Def. Ex.  [*15] 14 at 0305-0306). She had been notified in November 2002 that she would be terminated effective January 25, 2003. (Def. Ex. 14 at 0305). Mr. Wainwright was no longer at Redstone at the time of plaintiff's termination. He was at Kirkland Air Force Base Commissary. (Def. Ex. 6, Wainwright Decl., at 0184).
On November 12, 2003, plaintiff filed her EEO complaint with the DeCA Midwest Region EEO Manager. (Def. Ex. 18 at 0132-0133). On February 28, 2005, the Agency issued its Final Agency Decision finding no discrimination. (Def. Ex. 19 at 0114-0119). Plaintiff testified that since her termination from the Commissary, she has applied for and been approved for Social Security disability on the basis of, inter alia, her carpal tunnel syndrome and rotator cuff shoulder condition. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 22).
Plaintiff testified that due to her disabilities, particularly her carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder, she has difficulty with everyday household chores such as ironing, mopping and vacuuming. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 75). Plaintiff testified that she also has difficulty caring for her lawn and flowers because she can neither lift items nor dig. (Id. at 77). Plaintiff testified  [*16] that she no longer goes to the mall, mostly because she has limited income, and she has had to give up many of her ministerial duties at her church. (Id. at 75-79). Plaintiff testified that she also has great difficulty driving for more than 20 or 30 minutes. (Id. at 138-39). However, plaintiff is still able to drive for shorter distances and can drive longer distances as long as she stops to walk, sit and rest before continuing. (Id. at 73, 74, 126). Plaintiff tries to exercise and can do so more easily in the water. (Id. at 128). Plaintiff has a five-pound lifting limitation for her right arm and a ten-pound lifting limitation for her left arm. (Id. at 137-38).

Discussion

Race Discrimination
Title VII provides in relevant part:
(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—
(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (1981). Likewise, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a) states:

§ 2000e-16. Nondiscrimination in Federal Government  [*17] employment
(a) Discrimination prohibited. All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment (except with regard to aliens employed outside the limits of the United States) in military departments as defined in section 102 of title 5, United States Code, in executive agencies as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code (including employees and applicants for employment who are paid from nonappropriated funds), in the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission, in those units of the Government of the District of Columbia having positions in the competitive service, and in those units of the judicial branch of the Federal Government having positions in the competitive service, in the Smithsonian Institution, and in the Government Printing Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Library of Congress shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a).
The guidelines for deciding a case such as this are set out in McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981):
First,  [*18] the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant "to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.
Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S. Ct. at 1093. A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination when she establishes that (1) she is a member of a racial minority, (2) she suffered an adverse personnel action, and (3) she was treated differently from similarly-situated non-minority members. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824; Morrison v. Booth, 763 F.2d 1366 (11th Cir. 1985). Plaintiff must show that there were employees, not within her protected class, who were similarly situated in all relevant respects, but who were treated more favorably. See Walker v. Mortham, 158 F.3d 1177, 1193 (11th Cir. 1998),  [*19] cert. denied, 528 U.S. 809, 120 S. Ct. 39, 145 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1999); Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561 (11th Cir. 1997). In determining whether employees were similarly situated and more favorably treated, this court must consider whether the employees were treated in the same way as plaintiff. The adequacy of the comparators is crucial. Marshall v. Western Grain Co., 838 F.2d 1165, 1168 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 852, 109 S. Ct. 137, 102 L. Ed. 2d 110 (1988). "To make a comparison of the plaintiff's treatment to that of non-minority employees, the plaintiff must show that he and the employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1561.
Assuming without deciding that plaintiff has established a prima facie case of race discrimination, defendant has, nonetheless, provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, the RIF ordered by DeCA. It is not the role of federal courts to second-guess the hiring decisions of business entities. See Nix, 738 F.2d at 1187. The reason offered by an employer for an action "'does not have to be a reason that the judge or jurors would act on or approve.'" Id. (quoting Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1012 n.6 (1st Cir. 1979)).  [*20] Instead, all that matters is that the employer advance an explanation for its action that is not discriminatory in nature. Id.
Once a defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action, the initial inference of discrimination "drops" from the case. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the proffered reason was pretext for intentional discrimination and that the defendant intentionally discriminated against her. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. A plaintiff may not establish that an employer's proffered reason is pretextual merely by questioning the wisdom of the employer's reason, provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer. Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1541-43 (11th Cir. 1997). Federal courts "do not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions. No matter how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers," the courts do not interfere. "Rather, our inquiry is  [*21] limited to whether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior." Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (quoting Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted)). An employer may make a decision regarding an employee "for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason." Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Communications, 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984). A plaintiff may show pretext and survive summary judgment by "presenting evidence sufficient to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the truth or falsity of the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons." Evans v. McClain of Georgia, Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 965 (11th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted); Schoenfeld v. Babbitt, 168 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir. 1999).
Plaintiff claims that defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her race when she was terminated while other non-black employees were not. She relies on a claim that in March or April 2000, James Burchfield made a comment about living in Louisiana and getting a noose around your neck  [*22] if you did not run fast enough. (See Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 24-25). She also relies on the fact that Isle Mello was reassigned from a customer service clerk position to a sales store checker position, after the customer service clerk positions were abolished (see id. at 48), and the fact that Brenda Eubanks (white) and Janice Elliott (black) were allowed to remain as sales store checkers (see id. at 68-69).
The only non-black employee who was a customer service clerk identified by plaintiff during her deposition as being treated more favorably than her was Isle Mello. However, it is not disputed that Mello had seniority over plaintiff and also that she "bumped" a less senior employee to take a sales checker position, after she had been cleared by her physician to perform the duties of a sales store checker. It is also undisputed that plaintiff was not physically capable of performing the duties of a sales store checker. (Id. at 47, 50). While Mello subsequently resumed a light duty position in salvage at some time after plaintiff left (id. at 50), Mello was physically capable of performing the sales store checker duties when the RIF took effect. Therefore, the fact that Mello later  [*23] took a light duty position is not relevant.
Plaintiff asserted in her deposition that Janice Elliott (black) and Brenda Eubanks (white) replaced her when she was terminated. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 68, 69, 117, 118). However, while Elliott formerly was a sales store checker at the time of the RIF, according to plaintiff, she now is a permanent clerk in the administrative office (id. at 69), and Eubanks is a cashier (id. at 68-69). The Administrative Office of the Commissary Officer (OCO) is separate from the Customer Service Department where plaintiff was permanently assigned. (Def. Ex. 20, Decl. of LaTongia Griffin, at 0208). Plaintiff was allowed to work in the OCO on a temporary basis as a light-duty accommodation. (Id. at 0209). While plaintiff claims she was told by the lead commissary clerk she would be assigned permanently to the OCO (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 55), the OCO employee who had been out with an injury returned to work. Therefore, plaintiff was sent to the salvage warehouse, another light-duty accommodation, where she worked a week or two. (Id. at 35, 56-57).
Neither Ms. Elliott nor Ms. Eubanks replaced plaintiff when she was terminated. Plaintiff's position  [*24] of customer service clerk was abolished in the RIF. Ms. Elliott and Ms. Eubanks were sales store checkers, a position plaintiff was physically unable to perform, and Ms. Elliott became a permanent OCO employee. Further, Ms. Elliott is also black. That plaintiff was accommodated by being given a temporary light-duty assignment to the OCO did not entitle her to a permanent position in the OCO. See Terrell v. U.S. Air, 132 F.3d 621, 627 n.6 (11th Cir. 1998) ("An employer that 'bends over backwards to accommodate a disabled worker . . . must not be punished for its generosity by being deemed to have conceded the reasonableness of so far-reaching an accommodation.'" (citations omitted)).
The isolated comment by Burchfield in March or April of 2000 also does not support plaintiff's claim of race discrimination. Plaintiff and three other office workers, also African-American, were present when Burchfield made the comment. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 25, 132, 133). The other employees laughed at the comment; however, plaintiff was offended by it. (Id. at 26, 132). While plaintiff claimed in her deposition that Burchfield was "always saying stuff like that," she could not recall any other specific  [*25] instances or comments. (Id. at 134-35).
While Burchfield's comment may constitute direct evidence of a discriminatory animus,3 that alone does not help plaintiff survive summary judgment. Even if it is assumed that plaintiff can make out a prima facie case, defendant has produced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for plaintiff's termination–the RIF which caused the abolition of customer service clerk positions. Further, other non-white customer service clerks were affected by the RIF, and plaintiff's supervisors did not have the authority to determine which of the customer service clerks would remain employed in another position. The Office of Personnel Management made that decision. (Def. Ex. 40, Aff. of Kristen Ogden). As explained above, Isle Mello remained employed in another position (sales store checker) because she had seniority and because plaintiff was unable to perform the duties of sales store checker. Brenda Eubanks also remained as a sales store checker, not a customer service clerk.
Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether defendant's proferred reason for laying off plaintiff in the RIF was a pretext for race discrimination. Therefore, defendant's motion  [*27] for summary judgment is due to be granted as to Count I of the complaint.

Retaliation
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, plaintiff must prove (1) she participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the adverse employment decision. Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir. 1998). Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation, "the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of retaliation by producing legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action." If the defendant proffers legitimate reasons, the presumption of retaliation is rebutted and drops from the case. At the summary judgment stage, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to raise a genuine factual issue as to whether the defendant's proffered reason is a pretextual ruse to mask a retaliatory action. Raney v. Vinson Guard Service, 120 F.3d 1192, 1196 (11th Cir. 1997).
"Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and  [*28] rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000). Plaintiff must demonstrate "such weaknesses, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them worthy of credence." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997).
The definition of an adverse employment action was set out in the Supreme Court's decision in Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), in which the Court announced a new rule which redefines the standard for retaliation claims under Title VII. The Burlington holding was discussed by the Eleventh Circuit in Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961 (11th Cir. 2008):
Under the holding of Burlington, the type of employer conduct considered actionable has been broadened from that which adversely affects the plaintiff's conditions of employment or employment status to that which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related. FN13 See Burlington, 126 S.Ct. at 2415.  [*29] Thus, the Burlington Court effectively rejected the standards applied by this court in both Stavropoulos and Gupta that required an employee to show either an ultimate employment decision or substantial employment action to establish an adverse employment action for the purpose of a Title VII retaliation claim. See Burlington, 126 S.Ct. at 2415; Stavropoulos, 361 F.3d at 616-17; Gupta, 212 F.3d at 587. Additionally, the Court explained that in the context of a Title VII retaliation claim, a materially adverse action "means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington, 126 S.Ct. at 2415.
FN13. Burlington also strongly suggests that it is for a jury to decide whether anything more than the most petty and trivial actions against an employee should be considered "materially adverse" to him and thus constitute adverse employment actions. See Burlington, 126 S.Ct. at 2417.
This more liberal view of what constitutes an adverse employment action accords an employee protection from a wider range of retaliatory conduct than would be available under the standard applied in Stavropoulos and Gupta. See Phelan, 463 F.3d at 781, n.3  [*30] (stating that in Burlington the Court concluded "the Title VII retaliation provision protects an employee from a wider range of conduct than the discrimination provision does."). We therefore are persuaded that the adverse employment action standard previously applied in this circuit to Title VII retaliation claims is more stringent than the "materially adverse" standard announced in Burlington. In the instant case, we have no doubt but that Crawford suffered a materially adverse action in the form of the unfavorable performance review she received (that affected her eligibility for a merit pay increase) after she complained of racial discrimination. Such conduct by an employer clearly might deter a reasonable employee from pursuing a pending charge of discrimination or making a new one. Burlington, 126 S.Ct. at 2415.
529 F.3d at 973-74 (footnotes omitted).
In order to establish the requisite "causal link" required as part of a prima facie case, a plaintiff need only establish that "the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated." See EEOC v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 988 F.2d 1564, 1571-72 (11th Cir. 1993); Bigge v. Albertsons, Inc., 894 F.2d 1497, 1501 (11th Cir. 1990);  [*31] Simmons v. Camden County Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 981, 106 S. Ct. 385, 88 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1985). A short period of time between the service of an EEOC charge and the adverse employment action is circumstantial evidence of causation. Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, 141 F.3d 1453 (11th Cir. 1998). However, when the causal link is merely premised upon the employer's knowledge of a complaint of harassment and the adverse job action, the temporal proximity must be "very close." Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (citing affirmatively several courts of appeals decisions for the proposition that a three- or four-month gap is insufficient to establish the causal relation prong in a retaliation case). See also Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1370 (11th Cir. 1999) (15-month gap too long). The Eleventh Circuit has stated that a "three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough." Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007); Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that  [*32] three months between a protected activity and an adverse employment action standing alone was insufficient to establish a causal connection of retaliatory discharge); Webb-Edwards v. Orange County Sheriff's Office, 525 F.3d 1013, 1029 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that an almost six-month gap between a complaint and a failure to transfer was insufficient to establish a causal connection). However, the Eleventh Circuit has held that a seven-week gap is sufficiently close to establish a causal connection. Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (ADA case).
In order to satisfy the "causal link" prong of a prima facie retaliation case, a plaintiff must also, at a minimum, generally establish that the defendant was actually aware of the protected expression at the time the defendant took the adverse employment action. Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993). Since corporate defendants act only through authorized agents, in a case involving a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must show that the corporate agent who took the adverse action was aware of the plaintiff's protected expression and acted within the scope of his or her agency  [*33] when taking the action. See id. at 1162 (general agency principles govern the circumstances in which a principal will be held liable for the acts of its agents under Title VII).
In this case, it is not disputed that plaintiff participated in a protected activity by giving a statement on behalf of Ms. Robinson. The "adverse employment action" alleged by plaintiff is transfer from the Commissary administrative office to the salvage warehouse, then back to customer service clerk, then to night shift security monitor, then back to the Commissary administrative office. (Doc. 15, Plaintiff's Brief, at 15). The temporal proximity between plaintiff's statement for Ms. Robinson in April 2001 and her transfer to the salvage warehouse, then to security monitor within approximately the same month, as well as the transfer to the Commissary administrative office in about July 2001, is close enough for that element of a prima facie case.4 However, later transfers are too remote in time. Further, while plaintiff has not identified her termination as an adverse employment action at issue in her brief, if her termination is cited as an adverse employment action for part of her prima facie case, it also  [*34] is too remote in time (April 2001 to January 2003) to support a prima facie case.
Mr. Burchfield testified that he was not aware plaintiff had given a statement on behalf of Ms. Robinson. (Def. Ex. 4, Burchfield Decl., at 0175). Ms. Washington also testified she was not aware of plaintiff's statement for Ms. Robinson. (Def. Ex. 3, Washington Decl., at 0194). However, plaintiff asserts that it is unlikely they were unaware because EEO investigations are detailed and include solicitations for statements from the entire supervisory chain, which would have included Washington as Ms. Robinson's first-line supervisor and Burchfield as Ms. Robinson's second-line supervisor. However, plaintiff's speculation about their knowledge is just that–speculation. Plaintiff also testified that she is unsure if she told anyone she gave a statement for Ms. Robinson. (Def. Ex. 1, Jones Depo., at 52-53).
Further, even if Washington and Burchfield were aware that  [*35] plaintiff gave a statement on behalf of Ms. Robinson, plaintiff did not suffer any adverse employment action after that. She was moved to different light duty assignments to accommodate her physical condition. Plaintiff was reassigned from the light duty position in the administrative office to the salvage warehouse when the employee who held the office position permanently returned to work. Her stint at the salvage warehouse was brief, only one or two weeks. She first was assigned to a customer service clerk position on a temporary basis, then to the security monitor position for another two to three months. Her second temporary assignment to the administrative office lasted approximately one month, then plaintiff was officially reassigned from sales service checker to customer service clerk on August 12, 2001. She was on medical leave from May 2002 until November 2002, then worked a temporary assignment in the Commissary administrative office again until the customer service clerk positions were abolished in January 2003. It is evident that defendant was giving plaintiff these light duty assignments so that she could remain employed, not so that she would cease employment.
Even if  [*36] it is assumed that plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of retaliation, defendant has produced a legitimate reason for plaintiff's transfers. Plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that defendant transferred plaintiff to various light duty positions to retaliate against her for giving a statement on behalf of Ms. Robinson. Instead, the transfers were designed to accommodate plaintiff's physical limitations. Therefore, defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Count II is due to be granted.

Americans With Disabilities Act Claim
The proper vehicle for a claim of disability discrimination in federal employment is the Rehabilitation Act. Since plaintiff was a federal employee, her disability discrimination claim falls under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 791, et seq., which states that the standards to be applied are the same as those under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 29 U.S.C. § 791(g). She cannot maintain a claim under the ADA because the United States and its agencies are not considered "employers" under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(B)(i);5 Jordan v. Evans, 404 F.Supp.2d 28 (D.D.C. 2005) (federal employee has no remedy for employment discrimination  [*37] under the ADA); Whaley v. United States, 82 F.Supp.2d 1060 (D.Neb. 2000) (suit against federal agency or against officer of federal agency in his or her official capacity constitutes suit against United States, and is not permitted under ADA, since the United States is not included within the definition of "employer" under the ADA).
Plaintiff asks, in her brief in opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment, to be allowed to amend her complaint to substitute a claim under the Rehabilitation Act for her ADA claim so that her complaint conforms to the evidence. Defendant has analyzed plaintiff's claim using ADA standards and has not objected to plaintiff's request to amend her complaint to conform to the evidence. Therefore, the court will treat plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination as if made pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act rather than the ADA.
The ADA mandates that employers shall not discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in  [*38] regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The familiar burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination actions is equally applicable to ADA claims. See Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). Thus, Ms. Jones has the burden of proving a prima facie case of disability discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence, which requires a demonstration that she (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(a); Hilburn v. Murata Electronics North America, Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). The ADA defines a "qualified individual with a disability" as an "individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Additionally, Jones must establish that defendant had actual knowledge of the disability or considered her to be disabled. Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1185 (11th Cir. 2005).
The  [*39] ADA defines a "disability" as:
(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual;
(B) a record of such impairment; or,
(C) being regarded as having such impairment.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Jones must be deemed to be "disabled" for purposes of the ADA if she satisfies any one of these three definitions. However, a physical impairment alone is not necessarily a disability under the ADA. Commentary to the federal regulations contains a non-exclusive list of conditions that constitute a physical impairment. 45 C.F.R. pt. 84, App. A., subpart (A)(3) (1997). Courts, including the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, frequently look to EEOC regulations to assess whether a physical impairment substantially limits a major life activity. See, e.g., Gordon v. E. L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir. 1996). These regulations explain that the term "substantially limits" means "[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform" or "[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity  [*40] as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity."6 29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.2(j)(1)(i), (ii) (1997).
Major life activities are defined in the regulations as "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (1997). With respect to the major life activity of working, the regulations explain that the term "substantially limits" means "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute  [*41] a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (1997); see Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226-27.
Driving is not a "major life activity" under the ADA. See Maldonado v. Cooperativa De Ahorro, 685 F.Supp.2d 264, 273 (D.P.R. 2010); Winsley v. Cook County, 563 F.3d 598, 603 (7th Cir. 2009); Kellogg v. Energy Safety Servs., Inc., 544 F.3d 1121, 1126 (10th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1167, 129 S.Ct. 1916, 173 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2009); Chenoweth v. Hillsborough County, 250 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 2001); Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998), superseded by statute on other grounds by 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A). Lifting restrictions also may not satisfy the definition of disability. See Marinelli v. City of Erie, Pa., 216 F.3d 354, 364 (3d Cir.2000) (holding that a plaintiff who was restricted from lifting more than ten pounds was not "sufficiently different from the general population such that he is substantially limited in his ability to lift").
As explained by the court in Bear v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23278, 2004 WL 2603727 (E.D.La. Nov. 15, 2004):
The Court agrees that performing basic household chores, i.e. those that are  [*42] necessary to maintain a sanitary environment, is an activity that is of central importance to most people's daily lives and, thus, constitutes a major life activity under the ADA. See, e.g., Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc., 534 U.S. at 202, 122 S.Ct. at 693 ("household chores . . . are among the types of manual tasks of central importance to people's daily lives"); Marinelli v. City of Erie, Pennsylvania, 216 F.3d 354, 362-63 (3d Cir. 2000) (cleaning is a major life activity to the extent necessary to live in a healthy or sanitary environment). The Court disagrees, however, that these basic household chores include washing the car, gardening, cutting and "weed-eating" the grass, washing vinyl siding, painting the house, and making carpentry repairs. See, e.g., Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 914 (8th Cir. 1999) (shoveling snow, gardening, mowing the lawn, playing tennis, fishing, and hiking are not major life activities); Colwell v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998) (driving, mechanical work on cars, housework other than basic chores, going shopping at the mall with spouse, skiing, golfing, moving furniture, yard work, painting, plastering, gardening,  [*43] and shoveling snow are not major life activities). Although the Court recognizes that these activities may be important to the daily lives of some persons, the Court does not find that they have the same significance as the activities that have been specifically identified as constituting major life activities, e.g., breathing, seeing, walking, bathing, brushing one's teeth, and working.
2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23278, [WL] at *4 (footnote omitted). That court also found that while purchasing groceries is a major life activity, the fact that the plaintiff was limited to small, quick purchases and/or buying less than "a full basket" did not rise to the level of "severe restrictions." 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23278, [WL] at *5.
Courts have determined that mowing the lawn, doing yard work, and performing other unidentified outside chores are not considered major life activities. See Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 202, 122 S.Ct. 681 (noting that gardening is not a major life activity); Moore v. J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., 221 F.3d 944, 951 (7th Cir. 2000) (finding argument that mowing the lawn is a major life activity would not be meritorious); Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 914 (8th Cir. 1999) (finding shoveling snow, gardening, and mowing the  [*44] lawn are not major life activities); Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998) (finding that doing yard work is not a major life activity); Soler v. Tyco Elecs., Inc., 268 F. Supp. 2d 97, 105 (D.P.R. 2003) (holding that "taking care of backyard" is not a major life activity); Ruggles v. Keebler Co., 224 F.Supp.2d 1295, 1301 (D.Kan. 2002) (concluding that trimming trees is not a major life activity).
Defendant asserts that plaintiff was not "disabled" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act because her medical conditions (bilateral carpal tunnel and torn rotator cuff)7 did not "substantially limit" a "major life activity."
In plaintiff's case, her physical limitations do not substantially limit her ability to care for herself, perform manual tasks, walk, see, hear, speak, breathe or learn. As for working, plaintiff is substantially limited in performing the duties of  [*45] her former job as a sales store checker. However, she is not necessarily disabled from performing other jobs, such as the light-duty assignments she was given as an accommodation. However, the light-duty customer service clerk positions were abolished in the RIF. Defendant was not obligated to provide other light duty positions for plaintiff which already were filled by more senior employees or to create other light duty positions within DeCA merely so plaintiff could continue to work for DeCA. This is not the "reasonable accommodation" which the ADA requires. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626-27 (11th Cir. 1998) (employer not required to create part-time position for plaintiff where all part-time positions had already been eliminated from company); Quick v. Tripp, Scott, Conklin & Smith, P.A., 43 F.Supp.2d 1357, 1369 (S.D.Fla. 1999) ("an employer is not required to create a position to accommodate a disabled employee, nor must an employer reassign the employee to a position occupied by a non-disabled employee. . . . The ADA seeks only to provide qualified disabled employees with opportunities equal to their non-disabled co-workers; it does not demand that employers give disabled  [*46] employees priority in hiring and reassignment over non-disabled employees.").
Even if plaintiff can show that she is an individual with a disability, she has not shown that she can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of a sales checker position. "A 'qualified individual with a disability' is an 'individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position.'" Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "Essential functions" are defined as the fundamental duties of a job that a disabled employee actually is required to perform. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i). That plaintiff may have been able to perform the duties of a customer service clerk is irrelevant inasmuch as all such positions were eliminated in the RIF. Further, the fact that plaintiff is receiving Social Security disability benefits creates a discrepancy between her claim that she is totally disabled from working and her claim in this action that she is a qualified individual with a disability capable of performing the functions of her former job, or any  [*47] job for that matter. See Meier v. Family Dollar Servs., Inc., 443 F.Supp.2d 1036 (N.D.Iowa 2006); Varga v. Clark Foodservice of Indiana, 240 F.Supp.2d 851 (N.D.Ind. 2003). Social Security determinations of disability are not synonymous with a determination of disability under the ADA. See Robinson v. Neodata Servs., Inc., 94 F.3d 499, 502 n.2 (8th Cir. 1996); Horwitz v. L. & J.G. Stickley, Inc., 20 Fed. Appx. 76, 80 (2d Cir.2001); Overton v. Reilly, 977 F.2d 1190, 1196 (7th Cir.1992); Couts v. Beaulieu Group, LLC, 288 F.Supp.2d 1292 (N.D.Ga. 2003). See also Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 802-03, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 1601-02, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999) (because of differences in the definitions of "disability" under the ADA and the Social Security Act, a person could be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration but yet also fail to be substantially limited in performing major life activities according to the ADA). To survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff who receives social security benefits "must explain why that SSDI contention is consistent with her ADA claim that she could 'perform the essential functions' of her previous job  [*48] at least with 'reasonable accommodation.'" Id. at 798, 119 S.Ct. at 1600.
Thus, plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because she was unable to perform the duties of a sales checker. The ADA may require the employer to "reassign," i.e., transfer, the disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation. The reassignment duty, however, does not require the employer to remove or "bump" another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee. See Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 284 (11th Cir. 1997); Fussell v. Georgia Ports Auth., 906 F.Supp. 1561, 1571 (S.D.Ga. 1995). Nor does it require the employer to promote a disabled employee. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001).
There is simply no basis for finding that plaintiff was discriminated against on account of any disability. The actions of defendant in assigning plaintiff to light duty positions as an accommodation for her bilateral carpal tunnel and shoulder problems were not discriminatory; they were an attempt to accommodate her disability. Defendant's decision to abolish the customer service clerk position was not taken to discriminate against plaintiff;  [*49] it was done to effect costs savings as required by the Regional authority. The termination of plaintiff when the customer service clerk positions were abolished also was not done to discriminate against plaintiff. Instead, the termination was the only possible option for defendant because plaintiff was not able to perform the functions of sales store checker and no other positions were available for her to transfer to, in light of the seniority of Isle Mello and lack of availability of any other positions for which plaintiff could perform the essential job functions, with or without accommodation.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, it is RECOMMENDED that the motion for summary judgment of defendant be GRANTED with respect to all claims asserted by plaintiff and this action DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
