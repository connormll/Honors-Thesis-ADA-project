Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Kenesia Cason sues her former employer, the Coca-Cola Company (hereinafter "Defendant"), for racial discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. ("Title VII") (Counts 1, 2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count 3), discrimination against a person with a disability in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., ("ADA") (Count 4), violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 20 U.S.C. § 201 ("FLSA") (Count 5), and for state law torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress (Counts 6, 7). The Second Amended Complaint also includes a remedial claim for punitive damages (Count 8).
The case is now before the Court on Defendant's Motion for [*2]  Summary Judgment [61]. For the reasons stated herein, the Court RECOMMENDS that the Motion [61] be GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. Specifically, the Court finds triable issues of fact precluding entry of summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim under the FLSA (Count 5) and recommends that this claim proceed to trial. However, the Court finds that the motion should be granted as to all other claims, as to which judgment should be entered in Defendants' favor.

I. BACKGROUND
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendant's Statement of Material Facts [61-2] ("Def. SOMF") and Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts [65] ("Pl. SOMF") and their associated exhibits. The Court also draws some facts from the parties' responses to each other's statements of material facts. See Pl. Resp. SOMF [67]; Def. Resp. SOMF [80].
For those facts submitted by a movant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and which the non-movant has not expressly disputed with citations to record evidence, the Court must deem those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's [*3]  fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1(B)(1)."); see E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007).
The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Court has excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial, or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa ("The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."). See also LR 56.1(B)(2)(b) (respondent's statement of facts must also comply with LR 56.1(B)(1)). Indeed, both parties object to some of the opposing party's proffered [*4]  facts on various grounds, including that the asserted fact is not relevant or material to the claims and defenses presented in this case, or is based on inadmissible hearsay. Nevertheless, the Court includes certain facts that are not necessarily material, but which are helpful to present the context of the parties' arguments. The Court will not rule on each objection or dispute presented by the parties and will discuss those objections and disputes only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.
Plaintiff originally began working for Defendant as a temporary employee in 2008. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 1. During the time that Plaintiff worked as a temporary employee for Defendant, through a placement firm known as Spherion, she received no discipline, written warnings, suspensions or negative feedback, and instead received positive feedback from Spherion. Pl. SOMF at ¶¶ 3-4.
Defendant later hired Plaintiff as an Administrative Assistant on July 20, 2011 to support Senior Research Director Robert Scott. Def. SOMF at ¶ 8. Plaintiff's duties included assisting with Scott's calendar and meeting schedule, purchase order creation, managing office space, onboarding [*5]  new employees, arranging travel, ordering office supplies, and other tasks. Id. at ¶ 9; Pl. SOMF at ¶ 6.
Plaintiff's performance was evaluated annually. Def. SOMF at ¶ 10. The evaluation system including four ratings: (1) "EP" for exceptional performance (the highest level); (2) "SP" for successful performance, (3) "DP" for Developing Performance; and (4) "NP" for Not Meeting Performance Expectations (the lowest). Id. at ¶ 11. Scott rated Plaintiff as a "DP" in 2012. Id. at ¶ 12. Scott noted the following: Plaintiff's "poor performance on having everything ready for meetings to start on time," "much room for development and improvement in the administrative work requirements," "missing details of travel on multiple occasions, lack of attention to detail and follow up," "key growth areas are paying attention to detail, delivering on expectations on time, reducing the number of times an assignment will need to be requested and following through on commitments from this office," "needs to continue to pay attention to detail and anticipate the routine needs associated with standard calendar events and travel," and "attention to detail continues to be a relevant feedback." Id. at ¶ 13. However, [*6]  Scott then rated Plaintiff with the improved SP rating for 2013 and 2014. Id. at ¶ 12. During her time reporting to Scott, Plaintiff's salary was increased at least once. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 7.
In mid-2014, Plaintiff was granted a medical leave of absence after experiencing a sudden hearing loss. Def. SOMF at ¶ 27; Pl. Resp. SOMF at ¶ 27.1 Plaintiff had suffered hearing problems as a child, and so she had informed "co-workers and management" at the time she was hired that she had hearing loss in one ear. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 17. Plaintiff does not identify the particular people that she informed of this condition back when she was originally hired. Plaintiff reported the recurrence of her hearing problem in 2014 to Scott. Id. at ¶ 18. Scott reached out to Human Resources and Employee Relations on Plaintiff's behalf. Id. at ¶ 19.
In September 2014, Plaintiff's hearing had improved, but she could still only hear out of one ear, as she informed Scott. Pl. SOMF at ¶¶ 22-23. After Plaintiff returned from leave, she was contacted by a Cathy Dorton, a vocational rehabilitation specialist with Defendant. Def. Exh. 7 [62-2] at 91; Pl. SOMF at ¶ 21. Dorton stated, "I'm here to help you," "I'll be responsible [*7]  for any work adjustments that we'll make," indicated that she (Dorton) had researched sources of assistance for Plaintiff "both at home and at work." Def. Exh. 7 [62-2] at 91. Dorton indicated that she (Dorton) made an appointment for Plaintiff to meeting with a representative with the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency who would identify devices or other resources that would be of assistance. Id. Dorton stated that "I'll work with them [i.e., GVRA] for your work needs but you'll work with them for your home and personal needs." Id. Dorton pointed out that personal devices like hearing aids are not covered under the company's medical insurance, but Dorton forwarded links to other potential sources of financial assistance. Id.
Defendant cites the email as support for the assertion that "the Company would purchase the ancillary devices that connect a hearing aid with Company phones and mobile devices," Def. SOMF at ¶ 28, but the Court cannot locate that specific statement in the cited document, see Def. Exh. 7 [62-2] at 91-93. Nevertheless, Dorton stated that "I'll work with [the GVRA] for your work needs" and that the next step would be for Plaintiff to meet with a GVRA representative, [*8]  and that "she'll work with you and will reach out to me about your work environment." Id.
Upon Plaintiff's return from leave, Dorton met with Plaintiff and loaned her a device referred to an "Ubi-Duo" that could be used as an instant messaging device on Plaintiff's desktop to allow her to communicate with everyone who came to her desk. Def. SOMF at ¶ 30. In November 2014, Dorton sent an email to check in, and stated that if Dorton could do anything further to help, to "please let [her] know." Id. at ¶ 31. Subsequently, in August 2015, Dorton emailed Plaintiff to ask whether Plaintiff was still using the Ubi-Duo device, to ask Plaintiff to return the device if she was not using it, and to offer to purchase another such device for Plaintiff's ongoing use if she still needed it. Id. at ¶¶ 32-33. Plaintiff responded that she would return the Ubi-Duo, and that "My hearing did come back, thank God!! But not all the way.. I have a new norm which I am adjusting to. I have had some pains and weird noises but had not had a chance to go to the doctor and check it out due to my new boss and busy schedule." Id.; Def. Exh. 9 [62-2] at 95.
Scott and Plaintiff had also discussed the possibility of her [*9]  being provided a light that would go off in case of a fire alarm, "just in case my hearing went out again," but they did not discuss the need for any other accommodations at that time. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 24; Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 107. Plaintiff looked into the possibility of a hearing aid but was not sure if it would be of any help. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 25.
Plaintiff's "new boss," to whom Defendant attributes much of Defendant's discriminatory actions, was an individual named Yu Shi. A few months before the exchange between Dorton and Plaintiff about the Ubi-Duo, in March 2015, Coca-Cola promoted Scott to another managerial position and promoted Yu Shi to take his place. Def. SOMF at ¶ 14. Under Yu Shi, Plaintiff's duties and pay remained the same. Id. at ¶ 15. As of mid-2015, Yu Shi found that Plaintiff was lacking in "attention in detail." Id. at ¶ 16; Yu Shi Dep. [63-1] at 93.2 In preparing the 2015 evaluation, Yu Shi reached out to and solicited feedback from other Coca-Cola employees who Plaintiff supported. Id. at ¶ 17. Defendant cites to several negative statements that were received, including "[Plaintiff] can use improvements on turn-around time, accuracies, follow ups, and ensure all are [*10]  completed" (from Shen Yang); "significant delays in communication and needs" (from Robert Kriegel); "[Plaintiff] did a poor job at following up on tasks that she had committed herself on doing" [from Indaue Mello]. Id. at 18. Plaintiff does not dispute that Yu Shi received such negative feedback but argues that these selective quotes are misleading as they omit some positive comments, such as "her responsiveness and accountability . . . have improved." Pl. Resp. SOMF at ¶ 18.
Yu Shi explained that these comments, in combination with her own experience with Plaintiff's work, led Yu Shi to rate Plaintiff with a "DP" rating for 2015. Def. SOMF at ¶¶ 19-20. Plaintiff does not dispute that she was given this rating for 2015 but argues that Yu Shi applied this rating because of discrimination and not genuine concern over Plaintiff's performance. Pl. Resp. SOMF at ¶¶ 19-20. According to Plaintiff, Yu Shi only supervised Plaintiff for a short period before Yu Shi already started having issues with Plaintiff; Yu Shi has previously discriminated against African Americans including by terminating a project manager named Dawn Nuridden and replacing her with a Caucasian person; and Yu Shi is not [*11]  credible because she claimed to have no knowledge of Plaintiff's hearing loss despite being aware of Plaintiff's temporary use of the "Ubi-Duo" device. Id.
At some point in 2015, Yu Shi met with Director of Global Employee Relations Robin Elinger to discuss issues with Plaintiff's performance. Def. SOMF at ¶ 21. According to Defendant, Yu Shi and Plaintiff jointly met with Elinger to discuss the performance problems. Id. at ¶ 11. Plaintiff disputes this. According to Plaintiff, Elinger told Plaintiff that Yu Shi had previously come to her (Elinger) to speak about Plaintiff, apparently in Plaintiff's absence. Pl. Resp. SOMF at ¶ 22. At around this time, it was decided that Plaintiff should report to another manager, Indaue Mello, instead of to Yu Shi. Def. SOMF at ¶ 23. Plaintiff reported to Mello through end of her employment. Id. at ¶ 25.
In March 2016, Yu Shi accused Plaintiff of making errors with respect to arranging certain travel. Def. SOMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 123; Pl. Exh. 10 [70] at 31-33. Yu Shi began by emailing Plaintiff, apparently while Yu Shi was traveling, stating "Let's talk about this trip when I am back." Pl. Exh. 10 [70] at 32. Plaintiff responded by stating, [*12]  "I want to build our communication in every possible way. I really want everything to work out. As you know I have a hearing impairment, therefore please put all communications/request/rules in writing to help transparency." Id. Yu Shi responded with a lengthy email, copying Mello, which detailed the errors in the arrangements that Plaintiff had booked, including that Yu Shi's return ticket from Singapore was booked incorrectly, resulting in Yu Shi having to stay an extra night with no meetings and with no child care arranged back in Atlanta, and in Yu Shi having to purchase another return ticket for $3,000 more so that she could fly home after only the one day delay (as opposed to four more days, as the ticket Plaintiff booked would require). Id. at 31-32. Yu Shi stated:
I would do everything I can to help you out. In the past, I have put your objectives, my expectations and requests in emails and writing so that it is clear. I believe [Mello] also did the same for your objectives and expectations this year. Even though I tried my best to put all the requests in emails, there will be times when I drop off with requests for calendar changes or meeting set up verbally as I go from in [*13]  between meetings every day. As explained before, I expect you to write down the requests and if there is anything unclear, please let me know.
Id.
Yu Shi further stated: "Also when we discussed last, you told me that your hearing was back to normal. I was not aware that you have hearing impairment now. Have you informed anyone? I want to make sure that we provide any assistance that you may need." Id. Mello similarly responded:
I wasn't aware that you had a hearing impairment as you have not informed me of it. You've met with me for face to face discussions and have attended group meetings where you participated and actively engaged in the discussions. You didn't ask that any communication be restricted to emails or that we speak in a more suitable manner, such as louder, slower or more clear. If verbal meetings and instructions are a hindrance to you, your manager needs to be aware of it so that we can adjust our form of communication to meet your impairment. Have you communicated to HR that you have a hearing impairment?
Id.
Plaintiff disputes that Yu Shi was unaware of any hearing impairment or that she (Plaintiff) ever told Yu Shi that her hearing was completely "back to normal." Plaintiff [*14]  told "co-workers and management" about her hearing problem from the beginning. Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 100. Cason specifically told Yu Shi, in April 2015, that "I can only hear in one ear and we need to discuss how we're going to—to deal with it," to which Yu Shi responded "no problem, and I'm a little bit too new and I need some time to adjust, so we can have that conversation later." Id. at 119-20. Plaintiff admitted that she at some point told Yu Shi something like "my hearing was back," although Plaintiff disputes saying "back to normal," and according to Plaintiff what she meant was, "I can still hear in one ear." Id. at 125. Plaintiff also testified that her hearing ability "went down a little bit" during the time she worked with Yu Shi, although Plaintiff did not say whether she informed Yu Shi or any other supervisor of such. Id. at 108. At some unspecified times, Yu Shi said "what, you can't hear me?" in a tone that Plaintiff took to be derogatory. Id. at 125-26, 202-03.
During the time that Plaintiff worked with Yu Shi, Yu Shi on occasion asked two other individuals, who were Asian-American, to arrange travel. Pl. SOMF at ¶¶ 49-50. Plaintiff also perceived that Yu Shi treated her [*15]  differently from other employees. Plaintiff testified that, on occasion, Yu Shi would assign her (Plaintiff) a task, but then "get another person to do that task without my knowledge of it," and Yu Shi would later tell Plaintiff that this was because she (Plaintiff) was "incompetent." Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 206-07. Yu Shi would also sometimes make changes at the last minute to various tasks, and when there were problems she would say, "well, [Cason] is doing my calendar." Pl. SOMF at ¶ 82. Yu Shi would also blame errors in purchase orders on Cason, which errors Cason did not perceive to be her fault. See id. at ¶ 83. Yu Shi would sometimes also approve travel plans that Cason had made, only to later blame Cason for problems and claim that she (Yu Shi) had not approved the plans. Id. at ¶ 84. Yu Shi would also make last minute changes to interviews and then blame Cason for the last-minute changes. Id. at ¶ 85.3 Plaintiff and Dawn Nuridden (a project manager) were the only two African-American individuals under Yu Shi's supervision. Id. at ¶ 96. Nuridden was terminated and replaced by a Caucasian individual at some point. Id. at ¶ 96. Plaintiff's facts offer no details as to the timing and [*16]  reasons for Nuridden's termination, the nature of her position, or other facts. Yu Shi had three administrative assistants at her prior employer (Colgate) and one other one with Defendant, all four of which were Caucasian. See Pl. SOMF at ¶¶ 108, 111. Yu Shi never gave these individuals any negative ratings, demoted them, or recommended them for termination. See id. at ¶¶ 92, 112.
Yu Shi also had six or seven one-on-one meetings with Plaintiff during the time she supervised Plaintiff, in which Yu Shi criticized Plaintiff for calendaring and other errors. Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 140. During some of these meetings, Yu Shi made racially derogatory comments. Id. at 172-73. In one instance, Yu Shi referred to Plaintiff as a "Black Maid." Id. Plaintiff reported and complained that Yu Shi made this comment to Tim Martin in Human Resources at some unknown time prior to Plaintiff's transfer to Mello's supervision. See id. at 175. Yu Shi made other racially derogatory comments from time-to-time, including that "Black people need to stand in the back," and "Blacks can't do anything." Id. at 198-200. Plaintiff did not specifically report that Yu Shi made these comments to Human [*17]  Resources, Employee Relations, or in an evaluation that she gave of Yu Shi to another supervisor, Ivan Gage. Id. at 198-201. Plaintiff told Gage that the one-on-one meetings with Yu Shi left her (Plaintiff) feeling frustrated, depleted and disrespected. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 54.
Plaintiff filed her Charge of Discrimination in March 2016. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 63. Plaintiff, however, admits that she never went back to Human Resources to ask for accommodations—including to obtain another "Ubi-Duo" device—in response to Yu Shi's and Mello's emails. Def. SOMF at ¶ 39; Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 130.4 However, Plaintiff testified that at some unknown point in between April 2015 and the incident in March 2016 she told Yu Shi that she (Plaintiff) "prefer[ed]" to have communications in writing, and that Yu Shi was irritated. See Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 130-31.
Instead of contacting Human Resources in March 2016 to discuss accommodations, Plaintiff requested another leave of absence, which was granted. Def. SOMF at ¶ 40. Plaintiff returned from this leave in May 2016, although left again shortly thereafter, and ultimately returned in August 2016. Id. at ¶ 41; Shi Dep. [63-1] at 100.
Upon Plaintiff's return from leave in [*18]  August, she was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP"). Def. SOMF at ¶¶ 41-43, 47. The PIP had been drafted by Mello back in May 2016, with input from Yu Shi. Id. The ostensible reasons for the PIP were Plaintiff's alleged shortcomings vis-à-vis attention to detail, calendar management, travel mishaps, and other administrative errors. Id. at ¶ 46. Plaintiff does not appear to dispute that these alleged deficiencies formed the ostensible basis for the PIP but contends that the PIP was a pretext for racial and other discrimination, as will be discussed in more detail in the analysis. Although the PIP was implemented in August 2016, Plaintiff and Yu Shi had discussed the possibility of a PIP in September 2015. Id. at ¶ 44.5 Indeed, Plaintiff had been told that one reason Mello was taking over as supervisor was because Mello was "the only one that would have the capacity to implement a PIP." Id. at ¶ 45; Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 137. Plaintiff was not terminated, demoted, or subjected to any reduction in pay pursuant to being placed on this PIP. Def. SOMF at ¶ 48.6
Mello went over the requirements of the PIP with Plaintiff when Plaintiff returned from work on August 4, 2016. Pl. SOMF [*19]  at ¶¶ 67-68. After this meeting, Plaintiff went to the roof of the Coca-Cola building with the intent of jumping and taking her own life, although she did not do so after a security guard intervened. Pl. SOMF at ¶¶ 69-70. Plaintiff did not return to work and has been on medical leave or other inactive status ever since. Def. SOMF at ¶¶ 51-52.
Plaintiff's set number of hours were forty (40) hours per week, and she had the option to work from home with no limits on the hours worked. Pl. SOMF at ¶ 9. While she mainly worked in the office, during her time with Yu Shi, Plaintiff worked more from home. Id. at ¶ 10. Yu Shi would often contact Plaintiff after work hours and on weekends to do tasks, thus in Plaintiff's view constituting at least implicit authorization to do that work, but Yu Shi would tell her after the fact that she (Plaintiff) needed prior authorization for that overtime. Id. at ¶ 102. If Plaintiff worked in excess of 40 hours, Yu Shi instructed Plaintiff to remove those excess hours from her timesheet. Id. at ¶ 103.7

II. ANALYSIS
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits [*20]  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). In making its determination, the Court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). The nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).
If a fact is found to be material, the Court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported [*21]  by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 242. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
When considering motions for summary judgment, the Court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the Court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do [*22]  not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
B. Plaintiff's Claims
1. Retaliation in Violation of Title VII
Title VII acts to shield employees from retaliation for certain protected practices. Specifically, the statute provides, in relevant part:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because [the employee or applicant] has opposed any practice made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Retaliation claims under Section 1981 are also analyzed under the same legal standards applicable to retaliation claims under Title VII. Locascio v. BBDO Atlanta, Inc., 56 F. Supp. 3d 1356, 1363 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (Thrash, J.) (collecting cases).
Proof of retaliation is governed by the framework of shifting evidentiary burdens established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). Donnellon v. Fruehauf Corp., 794 F.2d 598, 600 (11th Cir. 1986); see also Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1162-63 (11th Cir. 1993). A plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Goldsmith, 996 F.2d at 1162-63; Donnellon, 794 F.2d at 600-01; see also Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1991); Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985). The employer must come forward with a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its action and plaintiff then bears the burden of proving [*23]  pretext. Goldsmith, 996 F.2d at 1162-63; Donnellon, 794 F.2d at 600-01.
Plaintiff alleges that she was placed on the PIP in August 2016, immediately after she returned from medical leave, in retaliation for the charge of racial and disability discrimination that she lodged with the EEOC on March 16, 2016. Defendant argues that the claim should be dismissed because Plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative remedies, because the facts are inadequate to show a prima facie case of retaliation, and because Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant's proffered reasons for placing Plaintiff on a PIP were a pretext for retaliation.
a. Administrative Exhaustion
Before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of Title VII, a Plaintiff must complain of the underlying conduct to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. See Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 963 F.2d 1543, 1547 (11th Cir. 1989)). A plaintiff who then sues under Title VII cannot bring any claim that was not included in her EEOC complaint. See Zellars v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 907 F. Supp. 355, 358 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47 (1974)).
In determining the permissible scope of an employment discrimination complaint, therefore, the Court must first look to the EEOC complaint and investigation. Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 696 F.2d 925, 929 (11th Cir. 1983). A plaintiff is precluded from pursuing any claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff [*24]  in their EEOC complaint or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. See Coon v. Ga. Pac. Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1569 (11th Cir. 1987); Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970). See also Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985); Evans, 696 F.2d at 928; Buffington v. General Time Corp., 677 F. Supp. 1186, 1192 (M.D. Ga. 1988). Therefore, additional charges in the civil complaint which do not arise naturally and logically from the facts presented to the EEOC are not related to the original complaint and cannot be pursued in a civil action.
In Plaintiff's March 16, 2016 EEOC Charge itself, she did not refer to any alleged retaliation, check the box indicating that she was asserting retaliation, or state any facts supporting her retaliation claim. See Def. Exh. 21 [62-2] at 156. In her intake questionnaire before the EEOC, the Plaintiff checked a box to indicate that she was alleging retaliation, but then appeared to cross that check out. See id. at 152. Plaintiff did not include any facts specifically discussing retaliation for any protected activity. Plaintiff filed no second EEOC Charge after suffering the actions that allegedly constituted retaliation for her filing the first charge.
To the extent Plaintiff bases her claim of retaliation on any alleged informal complaints about discrimination and acts of retaliation pre-dating the filing of her EEOC Charge, any such [*25]  claim was not presented to the EEOC and is unexhausted. A plaintiff, however, is not required to file a separate EEOC charge alleging retaliation where that claim grows out of the filing of an earlier EEOC charge. See Baker v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 856 F.2d 167, 168-69 (11th Cir. 1988) (quoting Gupta v. E. Tex. State Univ., 654 F.2d 411, 411 (5th Cir. 1981)); see also Thomas v. Miami-Dade Pub. Health Trust, 369 F. App'x 19, 23 (11th Cir. 2010) (considering retaliation claims "to the extent [the plaintiff] contended they were caused by the filing of her EEOC charge"). As the Eleventh Circuit has explained:
[I]t is unnecessary for a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies prior to urging a retaliation claim growing out of an earlier charge; the district court has ancillary jurisdiction to hear such a claim when it grows out of an administrative charge that is properly before the court.
There are strong practical reasons and policy justifications for this conclusion. It is the nature of retaliation claims that they arise after the filing of the EEOC charge. Requiring prior resort to the EEOC would mean that two charges would have to be filed in a retaliation case-a double filing that would serve no purpose except to create additional procedural technicalities when a single filing would comply with the intent of Title VII.
Baker, 856 F.2d at 169 (quoting Gupta, 654 F.2d at 411).
Therefore, because Plaintiff is alleging that she was [*26]  retaliated against for filing her EEOC Charge, the Court finds that the retaliation claim is properly exhausted as to that issue and will proceed to consider Defendant's merits-related arguments.
b. Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of illegal retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must generally show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity or expression; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. See, e.g., Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1454 (11th Cir. 1998); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1991); Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985). Protected activity includes formal participation in a Title VII proceeding as well as more informal internal "opposition" to allegedly unlawful practices. See EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir. 2000); Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir. 1999). It is undisputed that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in the form of filing her EEOC Charge. Defendant, however, contests whether Plaintiff's evidence establishes any material adverse action or any causal link between her protected activity and that action.
(1) Adverse Action
Defendant argues that merely being placed on a PIP is not a material adverse action. Generally, to constitute an adverse action for purposes of the anti-discrimination provisions of Title VII, the action must "alter the employee's [*27]  compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprive him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affect his or her status as an employee." Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008).
The standard for showing an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim is more inclusive, however. See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006) ("[W]e conclude that Title VII's substantive provision and its anti-retaliation provision are not coterminous. The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm."); see also Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 973 (11th Cir. 2008) ("Under the holding of Burlington, the type of employer conduct considered actionable has been broadened from that which adversely affects the plaintiff's conditions of employment or employment status to that which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related.").
[A] plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. . . . We speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from [*28]  trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth a general civility code for the American workplace. An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.
Burlington, 548 U.S. at 67-68 (internal quotes and citations omitted). The standard for material adversity is "objective," meaning that the standard is not based on the individual plaintiff's "unusual subjective feelings." See id. at 68-69.
Here, Plaintiff does not point to any specific requirements or provisions of her PIP that qualify it as a material adverse action. Plaintiff, rather, seems to argue that the mere placement on any sort of PIP would qualify. Placement on a PIP that does not impact pay or otherwise alter an employee's basic responsibilities, however, does not generally constitute a material adverse action even under the more inclusive Burlington standard. See, e.g., Fields v. Bd. of Educ. Of City of Chi., 928 F.3d 622, 626 (7th Cir. 2019) (holding that the plaintiff's "performance improvement plans, even though they had the potential to lead to termination or other discipline, are not enough" to rise "to the level of a materially adverse employment action") (emphasis in original); [*29]  Jarvis v. Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., 460 F. App'x 851, 854, 858-59 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming grant of summary judgment to employer in a retaliation case, because denial of requested training, as well as placement on a PIP, were not adverse actions); Howell v. Compass Grp., 448 F. App'x 30, 36 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding that the plaintiff's placement on a PIP could constitute a material adverse action because it was intended to be a "disciplinary action"); Frizzell v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., No. 1:19-CV-1573-TWT-JSA, 2019 WL 5459074, at *12-13 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 29, 2019) (finding that warning letter from employer that caused no "repercussions [to the plaintiff], including [no effect to] her pay, benefits, eligibility for promotions or raises, etc. beyond merely causing her to have subjective concern" could not constitute a material adverse action), report & rec. adopted, (N.D. Ga. Oct. 9, 2019).
Here, the PIP does not substantially change Plaintiff's basic job responsibilities. It simply required her to propose and then follow specific steps to improve her performance. The PIP makes clear that Plaintiff may be terminated for failing to comply with her obligation to improve performance. But the mere possibility of future termination for failure to comply with the requirements and standards of her employment is not itself a material adverse action. Plaintiff, in other words, might be under additional supervisory scrutiny by being under a [*30]  PIP, but she does not show that the PIP itself was a materially concrete adverse action. Thus, the PIP itself is not an adverse action, even for purposes of the retaliation claim, and Plaintiff therefore fails to establish a prima facie case.
(2) Causation
A plaintiff must independently establish a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. A plaintiff is not required to establish "the sort of logical connection that would justify a prescription that the protected participation in fact prompted the adverse action. Such a connection would rise to the level of direct evidence of discrimination, shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant." Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., 9 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir. 1993); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1525 (11th Cir. 1991).
Rather, to establish a causal connection, a plaintiff was traditionally required to show that the relevant decision maker was aware of the plaintiff's protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action "were not wholly unrelated." Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted).
The Supreme Court has ruled, however, that "Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation." Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360 (2013). This standard "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation [*31]  would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Id.
A plaintiff may establish an inference of causation merely by showing that she suffered the adverse action shortly after she engaged in the protected activity. Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1220; Bass v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, Orange Cty., 256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir. 2001); Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. For a plaintiff to establish such a link by mere temporal relationship, however, the challenged decision must follow very closely after the protected expression to support the logical inference that the two events were related. See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001) ("The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be very close.") (internal quotes omitted).
Here, Plaintiff filed her EEOC Charge in mid-March 2016 and, although she was not placed on the PIP until August 2016, the evidence shows that the PIP was drafted as early as May 2016. Presumably, Plaintiff was not formally placed on the PIP until August because she went out for another medical leave from May until August 2016. Normally, a two-month time period between an employee's protected activity [*32]  and the decision to subject her to an adverse action would be sufficiently close to permit the inference of a causal link, albeit barely so.8
However, an inference of causation is not created simply by engaging in protected activity once already on "thin ice." See, e.g., Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272-73 (2001) (when the evidence revealed that the employer contemplated transferring an employee before the employer learned that the employee filed a Title VII suit, the employer's decision to proceed "along the lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined," did not establish evidence of causality)); Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir. 2010) ("We emphasize that Title VII's anti-retaliation provisions do not allow employees who are already on thin ice to insulate themselves against termination or discipline by preemptively making a discrimination complaint."); Dowlatpanah v. Wellstar Douglas Hosp., No. 1:05-CV-2752-WSD-RGV, 2006 WL 4093123, at *14 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 5, 2006) (Vineyard, M.J.) (holding that "temporal proximity, standing alone, may not be sufficient to establish the causal link between them, particularly when the defendant establishes intervening factors"), report & rec. adopted sub nom. Dowlatpanah v. Wellstar Health Sys., Inc., 2007 WL 639875, (N.D. Ga. Feb. 26, 2007); see also Spence v. Panasonic Copier Co., 46 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1348 (N.D. Ga. 1999) (Brill, M.J.) (the mere chronological factor alone that the adverse employment action followed the protected activity is insufficient to demonstrate [*33]  causation).
Plaintiff's causation argument cites the outdated "not wholly unrelated standard" for causation. Thus, Plaintiff does not explain how the evidence meets the more stringent "but for" causation established under Nassar. In any event, the evidence fails to allow an inference of causation under either standard, because Plaintiff was already on more than "thin ice" before she filed her EEOC Charge.
As explained above, although the PIP may not have been drafted until May 2016, it is undisputed that her supervisors discussed the possibility of placing Plaintiff on a PIP as early as January 2016, months before she filed her EEOC charge. Indeed, Plaintiff does not dispute that one reason for placing her under Mello's supervision in early 2016 (before the EEOC Charge) was that Mello had more capacity to administer a PIP. Thus, it was contemplated that Plaintiff would be placed on a PIP prior to her filing of an EEOC Charge. Moreover, Yu Shi had already given Plaintiff a poor "DP" rating for 2015 prior to the events of March 2016.
In March 2016—in the wake of the "DP" rating for 2015 and the discussion about placing Plaintiff on a PIP—Plaintiff made serious errors in arranging Yu Shi's travel [*34]  back from Singapore. As noted above, these errors caused Yu Shi's return to be delayed and cost the company more than $3,000 to correct. At this point, the prospect of at least placing Plaintiff on a PIP was clear. That Plaintiff pre-emptively initiated an EEOC Charge in the wake of this incident does not insulate her from the obvious discipline that was to come. Nor do these facts suggest that the EEOC Charge itself was a "but for" cause of the PIP. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment for failing to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.
c. Pretext
Even if Plaintiff were to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Defendant argues that it placed Plaintiff on a PIP for the legitimate non-discriminatory reason that she had made calendaring errors, include the serious error involving Yu Shi's Singapore travel in March 2016, and had otherwise shown problems with attention to detail.
A plaintiff may carry the burden of showing that the employer's proffered reasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact, that they were not the true factors motivating the decision, or that the stated reasons were insufficient to motivate the decision. A plaintiff can either [*35]  directly persuade the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the employer's ultimate justification is not believable. See Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1522 (11th Cir. 1991). In other words, the plaintiff can come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.
A plaintiff may carry her burden of establishing pretext by demonstrating "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997). Because a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that a defendant's reasons are a pretext for discrimination, a plaintiff "must present 'significantly probative' evidence on the issue to avoid summary judgment." Young v. Gen. Foods Corp., 840 F.2d 825, 829 (11th Cir. 1988) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-25 (1986)). "Conclusory allegations of discrimination, without more, are not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext or intentional discrimination where [a defendant] has offered extensive evidence of legitimate, [*36]  non-discriminatory reasons for its actions." Young, 840 F.2d at 830. In order to establish that the employer's reasons were pretextual, a plaintiff must show "both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Brooks v. Cty. Comm. of Jefferson Cty., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (emphasis in original) (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515 (1993)).
Plaintiff addresses the issue of pretext in a sentence: "Cason has shown the pretext through Defendant's failure to accommodate Cason's poor hearing and its supervisor showing a despicable pattern of discriminatory behavior towards Cason and other African Americans." Pl. Br. [64] at 20. This brief statement does not show, however, that Defendant's concerns with Plaintiff's work performance, and desire to monitor that performance via a PIP, were pretextual. Nor do these arguments suggest that her filing of an EEOC Charge was the likely reason for the PIP.
First, it is highly relevant against a finding of pretext that Defendant began discussing a PIP for Plaintiff, and even transferred her to Mello's supervision for purposes of the contemplated PIP, prior to the filing of any EEOC Charge. Retaliation against the EEOC Charge could not be the true reason for the PIP, if the PIP was happening already before the EEOC Charge.
Second, even if Defendant [*37]  failed to adequately accommodate Plaintiff's hearing impairment, that would not make it more likely that Defendant placed Plaintiff on the PIP because of the EEOC Charge. Yu Shi clearly had a critical view of Plaintiff from an early juncture in their relationship and gave Plaintiff a negative "DP" rating months before any EEOC charge. Whether Yu Shi appropriately considered Plaintiff's disability and/or harbored some racial animus, the fact is that the filing of the EEOC Charge itself did not trigger Yu Shi's harsh criticism of Plaintiff. That criticism long pre-dated the filing of the EEOC Charge—and in fact constituted the conduct complained of in the EEOC Charge. There is no evidence that Yu Shi suddenly treated Plaintiff differently or materially more harshly after the EEOC Charge.
Third, nothing about Plaintiff's alleged need for accommodations necessarily contradicted the need for a PIP. The PIP itself does not deny any accommodations or exclude the need for accommodations as one way of improving performance. Indeed, the PIP itself required Plaintiff to first propose steps and measures to achieve improvement.
Fourth, as for Yu Shi's "despicable pattern of discriminatory behavior [*38]  towards Cason and other African Americans," this also has nothing specifically to do with whether Plaintiff was put on a PIP because of her EEOC Charge. Indeed, the EEOC charge was addressed primarily to Plaintiff's allegations relating to her disability. More generally, race discrimination is fundamentally different from retaliation against protected activity. Plaintiff's terse, unexplained, argument is that Yu Shi's racial animus is proof that the PIP was based on something other than race, that is, punishment for filing of an EEOC Charge. This does not follow, and Plaintiff's argument fails to show significantly probative evidence of pretext.
Therefore, for all these reasons, Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under Title VII (Count One) fails and summary judgment should be awarded to Defendant.
2. Race Discrimination Under Title VII and § 1981
Counts Two and Three allege that Defendant discriminated against her based on her race (African-American), in violation of both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.9 Plaintiff alleges two species of race discrimination under both statutes: (a) disparate treatment, that is, that Defendant subjected Plaintiff to material adverse employment actions, including ultimately being [*39]  placed on a PIP, because of her race; and (b) hostile working environment, that is, that Defendant allowed Yu Shi to engage in a pattern of harassment of Plaintiff on the basis of Plaintiff's race. These are separate theories of racial discrimination, and so the Court will address them individually.
a. Disparate Treatment
(1) General Standards
To prevail on a claim of discrimination brought under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 980-81 (11th Cir. 1989); Clark v. Huntsville City Bd. of Educ., 717 F.2d 525, 529 (11th Cir. 1983). Such discriminatory intent may be established either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence meeting a four-pronged test set out for Title VII cases known as the McDonnell Douglas test. See Lewis v. City of Union City, 918 F.3d 1213, 1220 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc).
Direct evidence is defined as evidence "that is based on personal knowledge or observation and that, if true, proves a fact without inference or presumption." Evidence, Black's Law Dictionary 596 (8th ed. 2004). See also Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1226 (11th Cir. 1993); Carter v. City of Miami, 870 F.2d 578, 581-82 (11th Cir. 1989); Rollins v. TechSouth, Inc., 833 F.2d 1525, 1528 n.6 (11th Cir. 1987). Only the most blatant remarks whose intent could only be to discriminate constitute direct evidence. Clark, 990 F.2d at 1226; Carter, 870 F.2d at 581. Evidence that only suggests discrimination, see Earley v. Champion Int'l Corp., 907 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (11th Cir. 1990), or that is subject to more than one interpretation, see Harris v. Shelby Cty. Bd. of Educ., 99 F.3d 1078, 1083 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996), does not constitute direct evidence. "[D]irect evidence relates [*40]  to actions or statements of an employer reflecting a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee." Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea, 904 F.2d 1549, 1555 (11th Cir. 1990); see also Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641-42 (11th Cir. 1998).
Evidence that merely "suggests discrimination, leaving the trier of fact to infer discrimination based on the evidence" is, by definition, circumstantial. Earley, 907 F.2d at 1081-82. Because direct evidence of discrimination is seldom available, a plaintiff must typically rely on circumstantial evidence to prove discriminatory intent, which can be done using the framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) and Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561-62 (11th Cir. 1997), abrogated on other grounds, Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1226; Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1527-28 (11th Cir. 1997). Under this framework, a plaintiff is first required to create an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. See also Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Med. Ctr., 137 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir. 1998), reh'g denied and opinion superseded in part, 151 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 1998); Combs, 106 F.3d at 1527. Demonstrating a prima facie case is not onerous; it requires only that the plaintiff establish facts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination. Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310-11; Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310. If the defendant carries this [*41]  burden and explains its rationale, the plaintiff must then show that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54; Perryman v. Johnson Prods. Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983).
A plaintiff is entitled to survive a defendant's motion for summary judgment if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the truth of the employer's proffered reasons for its actions. Combs, 106 F.3d at 1529. A prima facie case along with sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation is all that is needed to permit a finding of intentional discrimination. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148 (2000); see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993); Combs, 106 F.3d at 1529.
The McDonnell Douglas proof structure "was never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination." U.S.P.S. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983); see also Grigsby v. Reynolds Metals Co., 821 F.2d 590, 594 (11th Cir. 1987). The Eleventh Circuit has held that this framework of shifting burdens of proof is a valuable tool for analyzing evidence in cases involving alleged disparate treatment, but the framework is only a tool. Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comm., 738 F.2d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1984), abrogated on other grounds, Lewis, 918 F.3d at 1226. The "ultimate question" is not whether a plaintiff has established a prima facie case or demonstrated pretext, but "whether the defendant [*42]  intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." Id. (quoting Aikens, 460 U.S. at 713-14). The plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving that the defendant is guilty of intentional discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff can generally establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under Title VII by showing that: (1) she is a member of a protected class, (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action by her employer, (3) she was qualified to do the job in question, and (4) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside her protected classification (i.e., those of a different race) more favorably than it treated her. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. See also Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir. 1999).
(2) Adverse Action
For purposes of a disparate treatment claim, "[a]n adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that 'alters the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.'" Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3d Cir. 1997)), overruled on other grounds by Burlington, 548 U.S. at 53. For disparate treatment, an adverse employment action must "impact the 'terms, conditions, or [*43]  privileges' of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way." Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Burlington, 548 U.S. at 53. Proof of "direct economic consequences" is not required, but a plaintiff must show "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Id. (emphasis in original).
Plaintiff has not been demoted or terminated or subjected to any other final or ultimate decision at least in any traditional sense. Plaintiff, again, appears to argue that Yu Shi's treatment of her, culminating in Plaintiff being placed on a PIP, constitutes an adverse action for purpose of the anti-discriminatory provisions of Title VII. The Court, however, has already explained that mere placement on a PIP that simply requires compliance with already-existing performance obligations, and provides a tool to more closely supervise compliance with those obligations, is generally not an "adverse action" even under the more inclusive standards governing "adverse actions" for purposes of retaliation claims. It follows that the PIP is also not an adverse ultimate employment action for purposes of any disparate treatment claim. See, e.g., Rowell v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., No 1:12-CV-491-WSD, 2013 WL 6080274 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 18, 2013) (granting summary judgment, as Plaintiff "failed to produce [*44]  any evidence showing that being placed on the PIP had a 'serious and material' adverse impact on his employment because Plaintiff was not fired or demoted, and did not take any cut in pay as a result of the PIP."); Johnson v. Gwinnet Cty. Sch. Dist., Civil Action No. 1:11-CV-00471-TWT—RGV, 2012 WL 5987584, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Oct.17, 2012), report & rec. adopted by 2012 WL 5987581, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 28, 2012) (finding no adverse employment action in race discrimination case where plaintiff received negative performance evaluations, was placed on PDP [professional development plan], and was ignored by supervisor); Kelly v. Mills, 677 F. Supp. 2d 206, 222 (D.D.C. 2010) (citations omitted) (holding that neither poor performance evaluations nor placement onto a PIP constituted adverse employment actions); Smith v. CA, Inc., No. 8:07-cv-78-T-30TBM, 2008 WL 5427776, at *7 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 30, 2008) (holding that placement onto a PIP was not an adverse employment action because it merely required plaintiff to improve his performance to comply with previously established expectations); Brown v. Sybase, Inc., 287 F. Supp. 2d 1330, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2003) (PIP did not impose any tangible harm on plaintiff and was not an adverse action).
Plaintiff's claims of disparate treatment fail to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and summary judgment is due for Defendant on any claim of disparate treatment, on this basis alone.10
b. Hostile Work Environment
Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against any [*45]  individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). An employer is liable for a violation of Title VII when harassing conduct "unreasonably interferes with an employee's job performance by creating a hostile, intimidating, or offensive work environment." Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986). Thus, a plaintiff may establish that she was discriminated on the basis of a protected category in violation of Title VII by proving that she was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of that protected category and that such harassment affected a condition of her employment. Meritor Sav. Bank, 477 U.S. at 66; Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 902-04 (11th Cir. 1982). As the United States Supreme Court has stated:
[T]he language of Title VII is not limited to "economic" or "tangible" discrimination. The phrase "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" evinces a congressional intent to "'strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women'" in employment.
Meritor Sav. Bank, 477 U.S. at 64 (internal citations omitted). Thus, Title VII grants employees the right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult. Id. at 65.
To establish a prima facie case for a Title [*46]  VII claim against an employer for a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she belongs to a protected group, (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment, (3) the harassment was based on race (or another protected class under Title VII), (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment, and (5) there is a basis for holding the employer liable for the harassment either directly or indirectly. See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., 594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002); Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Cross v. Alabama, 49 F.3d 1490, 1504 (11th Cir. 1995); Henson, 682 F.2d at 903-05. See also Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 762-63 (1998).
To demonstrate the fourth element of a prima facie case of a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must show that her work environment was "permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). A court must consider the "totality of the circumstances" in determining whether a hostile environment is severe or pervasive enough to be actionable under Title VII; it must consider not only the frequency of the incidents alleged but also the gravity of those incidents. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23; Vance v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 863 F.2d 1503, 1511 (11th Cir. 1989). Other factors that are relevant are whether the offensive conduct is physically [*47]  intimidating or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with plaintiff's work performance. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.
As the Supreme Court has stated, "simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment." Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998) (citation omitted). In evaluating whether a reasonable person would find conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive, "the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering 'all the circumstances.'" Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998); see also Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc) ("[C]ourts should examine the conduct in context, not as isolated acts, and determine under the totality of the circumstances whether the harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment.").
Plaintiff points to Yu Shi's series of overtly racist comments that included comments directly to Plaintiff, and which otherwise directly denigrated African-Americans as inferior in the workplace. As noted above, Yu Shi referred to Plaintiff as a "Black Maid," stated that [*48]  "Black people need to stand in the back," and that "Blacks can't do anything." Plaintiff also testified that Yu Shi would slam the door in her face (but no one else's at least as far as Plaintiff personally could observe), and humiliated Plaintiff by referring to her to others as "incompetent," and by explaining errors by saying thing such as "well, [Cason] is doing my calendar."
As for the overtly racist statements, Plaintiff was unable to identify specifically how many such statements were made and when they were made. Thus, the Court is left with a record that shows a handful of statements made at unknown times during the year or so that Plaintiff worked with Yu Shi. While these comments were despicable, if made, they were too infrequent and sporadic to sustain a claim for hostile working environment under the precedents of this Circuit. See, e.g., Marable v. Marion Military Inst., 595 F. App'x 921, 927 (11th Cir. 2014) (racially offensive comments by a supervisor too sporadic and isolated to sustain a claim for hostile working environment); Guthrie v. Waffle House, Inc., 460 F. App'x 803, 807 (11th Cir. 2012) (finding a few dozen instances of sexual harassment over an eleven-month period too infrequent to sustain a claim for hostile working environment); Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1249 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (finding five instances of sexual harassment over an [*49]  eleven-month period too infrequent).
As for the belittling of Plaintiff's performance, such comments might have been unprofessional ways of expressing displeasure with Plaintiff's work. But there is no evidence that these statements were made based on race. In any event, even if harsh or unkind, these were supervisory comments about Plaintiff's work. Ordinary supervisory actions such as giving an employee a low performance rating, giving critical feedback, or even placing an employee on a performance improvement plan, are not, without substantially more facts, considered "severe" acts of insult or degradation within the meaning of a hostile work environment claim. See Harris v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., No. 1:07-CV-2086-RWS/AJB, 2009 WL 10665027, at *32 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 9, 2009) (Baverman, M.J.) ("Plaintiff's placement on a PDP and receipt of a negative evaluation are not severe events."); Na'im v. Rice, 577 F. Supp. 2d 361, 377 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding that low performance ratings and placement on PIP are not severe as a matter of law).
Thus, Plaintiff has not shown conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to sustain her claim of racially hostile working environment and summary judgment is warranted on this claim.11
3. ADA Discrimination
Plaintiff's final claim of discrimination is that Defendant discriminated against her [*50]  as a disabled person by failing to reasonably accommodate her hearing-related disability in violation of the ADA.
a. Standards Under the ADA
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). Title I of the ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that [*51]  the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), for employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII. See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 F. App'x 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework does not apply because a plaintiff is not required to prove intentional discrimination in those cases. See Nadler, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation [*52]  cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Ga. Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 WL 779326, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims").
To prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she: 1) has a disability under the ADA; 2) was a "qualified individual" when she suffered the adverse employment action; and 3) she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation that would allow her to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226; Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Morisky v. Broward Cty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). In addition, a plaintiff must present evidence establishing that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-11 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky, 80 F.3d at 447-48.
The only prong of this test that Defendant contests for purposes of summary judgment is the third [*53]  prong, that is, that Plaintiff was denied a reasonable accommodation. A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's [*54]  job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corrections, 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate [*55]  the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
b. Failure to Accommodate
It is not disputed for purposes of this motion that Plaintiff suffered from a disability in the form of her hearing impairment, which during the relevant time period of this case prevented her from hearing out of one ear. According to Plaintiff, this impairment impacted her ability to hear verbal instructions from Yu Shi and other supervisors, which directly led to the errors in Yu Shi's travel in March 2016. Plaintiff alleges that Yu Shi was aware of this disability, made derogatory statements about the disability, and failed to adequately accommodate it.
The record, viewed [*56]  in its entirety, shows proactive efforts by Defendant to accommodate Plaintiff's hearing impairment. It is undisputed that when Plaintiff came back from her original medical leave, Defendant's Director of Compliance, Dorton, reached out to Plaintiff about the vocational needs required by her impairment, and stated, "I'm here to help you," and "I'll be responsible for any work adjustments that we'll make." Def. Exh. 7 [62-2] at 91. Dorton indicated that she (Dorton) made an appointment for Plaintiff to meeting with a representative with the Georgia Vocational Rehabilitation Agency who would identify devices or other resources that would be of assistance. Id. Dorton stated that "I'll work with them [i.e., GVRA] for your work needs but you'll work with them for your home and personal needs." Id. Dorton stated that the next step would be for Plaintiff to meet with a GVRA representative, and that "she'll work with you and will reach out to me about your work environment." Id.
Dorton then specifically provided Plaintiff a "Ubi-Duo" device that could be used as an instant messaging device on Plaintiff's desktop to allow her to communicate with everyone who came to her desk. Def. SOMF at ¶ [*57]  30. Dorton later sent an email to check in and stated that if Dorton could do anything further to help, to "please let [her] know." Id. at ¶ 31. Subsequently, in August 2015, Dorton emailed Plaintiff to ask whether Plaintiff was still using the Ubi-Duo device, to ask Plaintiff to return the device if she was not using it, and to offer to purchase another such device for Plaintiff's ongoing use if she still needed it. Id. at ¶¶ 32-33. Plaintiff responded that she would return the Ubi-Duo, and that "My hearing did come back, thank God!! But not all the way.. I have a new norm which I am adjusting to. I have had some pains and weird noises but had not had a chance to go to the doctor and check it out due to my new boss and busy schedule." Id.; Def. Exh. 9 [62-2] at 95.
Plaintiff does not claim that she ever followed up with or asked for any additional assistance from Dorton, despite Dorton saying that "I'll be responsible for any work adjustments that we'll make." Instead, Plaintiff claims that on three occasions after she came under Yu Shi's supervision, she (Plaintiff) attempted to discuss her hearing impairment with Yu Shi, and Yu Shi refused to take time to discuss the matter. See [*58]  Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 119-23. Plaintiff does not indicate that she made any specific requests for accommodations during this time to anyone or informed anyone that she required assistance to perform the essential duties of her job, including Dorton.
Plaintiff did testify that at some unknown time she told Yu Shi she "prefer[red]" to have communications in writing, and that Yu Shi displayed irritation. See id. at 130-31. But a mere "preference" is very different from an accommodation. To be a request for an accommodation within the meaning of the ADA, the measure must have been necessary to allow Plaintiff to perform an essential task of her job. There is simply no evidence that Plaintiff made any such request simply by at some unspecified point expressing a "preference" for written communications.
To be sure, after the March 2016 calendaring error that led to criticism from Yu Shi and Mello, Plaintiff presented the request in arguably stronger terms: "As you know I have a hearing impairment, therefore please put all communications/request/rules in writing to help transparency." Id. at 123; Pl. Exh. 10 [70] at 31-33. Even assuming, however, that this email (or any previous statement of Plaintiff's "preference" [*59]  were written communications) constituted a request for accommodations, the record does not show that Defendant denied accommodations. After all, Defendant was not required to provide any specific accommodation that Plaintiff requested or "preference" she expressed. Defendant's obligation, rather, was to engage in an interactive process to identify what measures could reasonably be accomplished that would satisfy Defendant's needs as well as allow Plaintiff to perform the essential tasks of her job.
Here, the record shows no violation of that obligation. As noted above, Dorton had specifically told Plaintiff that she (Dorton) would be the person to provide any assistance that Plaintiff needed; that she (Dorton) would work with vocational consultants at GVRA to provide what Plaintiff needed; provided Plaintiff a temporary Ubi-Duo device and offered to provide permanent one; checked in with Plaintiff; and specifically told Plaintiff to inform her (Dorton) if she needed anything further. As for Yu Shi, she responded to the March 4 email explaining that she had tried to put requests in emails as much as possible but could not always do so because she sometimes needed to relay instructions [*60]  as she (Yu Shi) walked by Plaintiff's desk. Nevertheless, Yu Shi and Mello, who by this time was Plaintiff's supervisor, asked Plaintiff whether she had indicated her need for assistance to anyone, including Human Resources, and Yu Shi concluded by saying, "I want to make sure that we provide any assistance that you may need." Def. Exh. 10 [62-2] at 97.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not subsequently contact Dorton or anyone else in Human Resources about any need for accommodations. Nor did she at any time request that Dorton provide another Ubi-Duo device—or provide any other device. This was so, even though that device would have allowed Plaintiff's supervisors to type written instructions as they dropped by her desk. Ironically, it was Plaintiff who appeared to disclaim the need for this device, or otherwise seek out any additional assistance from the individual responsible for any necessary "work adjustments." If anything, therefore, it was Plaintiff that failed to appropriately engaged with Defendant to discuss her need for accommodations. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.12
4. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
To make out a prima facie case [*61]  of intentional infliction of emotional distress under Georgia law, a plaintiff must prove each of the following elements: (1) the conduct must be intentional or reckless; (2) the conduct must be extreme and outrageous; (3) there must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress must be severe. Bridges v. Winn-Dixie Atlanta, Inc., 176 Ga. App. 227, 230 (1985); see also Gaston v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 674 F. Supp. 347, 352 (N.D. Ga. 1987). A plaintiff's burden is a stringent one. Bridges, 176 Ga. App. at 229. Whether conduct is sufficiently outrageous and whether the resulting emotional distress is sufficiently severe to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress are questions of law. Yarbray v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 409 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ga. 1991); accord Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1229 (11th Cir. 1993).
Georgia courts recognize that the existence of an employer-employee relationship, where one party may exercise control over the other, may produce a character of outrageousness that otherwise might not exist. Bridges, 176 Ga. App. at 227.
The workplace is not a free zone in which parties are permitted duty not to engage in willfully and wantonly causing emotional distress through the use of abusive or obscene language does not exist. Actually, by its very nature, it provides an environment more prone to such occurrences because it provides a captive victim who may fear reprisal for complaining, [*62]  so that the injury is exacerbated by repetition, and it presents a hierarchy of structured relationships which cannot easily be avoided. The opportunity for commission of the tort is more frequently presented in the workplace . . . .
Coleman v. Hous. Auth. of Americus, 191 Ga. App. 166, 171 (1989); see also Lightning v. Roadway Express, Inc., 60 F.3d 1551, 1558 (11th Cir. 1995). Even where an employment relationship exists, however, "major outrage in the language or conduct complained of is essential to the tort." Bridges, 176 Ga. App. at 227.
Furthermore, it is well-recognized under Georgia law that a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress will not lie where the basis for the claim is an allegedly wrongful discharge from employment. See, e.g., Aspinwall v. Herrin, 879 F. Supp. 1227, 1241 (S.D. Ga. 1994) (Alaimo, J.) ("Unfortunately, unfair or even wrongful termination does not equal intentional infliction of emotional distress."); see also Kitfield v. Henderson, Black & Greene, 213 Ga. App. 130, 135 (1998) ("The mere termination of employment does not authorize a recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress."); Borden v. Johnson, 196 Ga. App. 288, 290-91 (1990) (the termination of employment does not rise to a level of outrageousness that would authorize a recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress).
The Georgia Court of Appeals addressed this standard of outrageousness in an employment context in Sossenko v. Michelin Tire Corp., 172 Ga. App. 771 (1984), in which it affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in an action [*63]  brought by a plaintiff against his former employer. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant and its representatives had made approximately ten threats against his future employment and retirement benefits, as well as his life. The court held that these threats, considered individually or collectively, did not rise to the requisite level of outrageousness and egregiousness. Sossenko, 172 Ga. App. at 773. The court contrasted the defendant's conduct with those cases in which courts have found outrageous and egregious conduct and found that the acts complained of did not rise to a sufficient level of outrageousness. See id. (citing Am. Fin. & Loan Corp. v. Coots, 105 Ga. App. 849 (1962) (defendant terrorized a frightened plaintiff at gunpoint in an attempt to collect a bill); Stephens v. Waits, 53 Ga. App. 44 (1936) (defendant physically intimidated frightened mourners as they attempted to bury a family member at a cemetery)).
Plaintiff's evidence simply does not rise to the high level required by these precedents. Plaintiff primarily relies on the handful of racist statements that she claims that Yu Shi made. For the same reasons that these statements were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to sustain a hostile working environment claim, however, they also cannot sustain an emotional distress tort claim. [*64]  See e.g., Grimsley v. Marshalls of MA, Inc., 284 F. App'x 604, 611 (11th Cir. 2008) (no IIED even where plaintiff's white manager used the word "n****r about once a week").13
5. FLSA
If an employee has worked overtime without pay, he may bring a private FLSA action for damages. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). An unpaid-overtime claim has two elements: (1) an employee worked unpaid overtime, and (2) the employer knew or should have known of the overtime work. Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. for Bibb Cty., 495 F.3d 1306, 1314-15 (11th Cir. 2007). Knowledge may be imputed to the employer when its supervisors or management "encourage [ ] artificially low reporting." See id. at 1319; Brennan v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 482 F.2d 825, 828 (5th Cir. 1973) ("The company cannot disclaim knowledge when certain segments of its management squelched truthful responses."). Cf. Reich v. Dep't of Conservation & Natural Res., 28 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir. 1994) ("The cases must be rare where prohibited work can be done and knowledge or the consequences of knowledge avoided.") (alteration adopted) (quoting Gulf King Shrimp Co. v. Wirtz, 407 F.2d 508, 512 (5th Cir. 1969)).
Plaintiff testified that Yu Shi would often contact Plaintiff after work hours and on weekends to do tasks and would reprimand her Plaintiff if she failed to accomplish those tasks immediately. Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 68. However, when Plaintiff submitted her timesheet, Yu Shi would tell Plaintiff that she needed to have received prior authorization to work overtime and would instruct Plaintiff to remove those excess hours. Id. at 68, 218-19, [*65]  227. Plaintiff stated that she was asked to delete at least 40 hours worth of overtime work. Id. at 227.
Defendant asks for summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff has not adduced any documentary or other evidence corroborating her bare testimony about these instructions from Yu Shi. Defendant argues that "in light of the evidence provided . . . this testimony is not credible." Def. Mot. [61-1] at 22. Defendant points out that its policies ensure payment for all hours worked, and that Plaintiff has admitted to receiving full payment for tasks assigned to her in certain specific emails produced in discovery. Id. at 22-23. The problem with Defendant's argument, however, is that the Court cannot award summary judgment based on any opinion it may have on the weight of the evidence, or the credibility of Plaintiff's testimony. The fact is that Plaintiff has offered sworn testimony sufficient to show that she was instructed to work overtime but then was also instructed to delete those hours from her timesheet, and so she was not paid. Whether credible or corroborated or not, the Court must accept this testimony and allow this claim to go forward.
Defendant also argues, in reply, that [*66]  "Plaintiff admits that she was allowed to work from home, and thus the fact that she performed work at night or on weekends is not evidence that she worked over 40 hours in any given workweek." Def. Reply [79] at 4. But Plaintiff specifically testified that she was given "overtime work to do" by Yu Shi on nights and weekends. Pl. Dep. [62-1] at 68. Indeed, the jury could infer that Yu Shi understood that she was directing overtime work to be performed, by contacting Plaintiff on weekends and late at night, and then reprimanding Plaintiff for not doing that work promptly. Id. at 218-19. All of this is sufficient to create an issue of triable fact and to allow this claim to proceed.
6. Punitive Damages
Plaintiff also brings a standalone claim for punitive damages. As all of Plaintiff's discrimination and tort claims are due for dismissal on summary judgment, however, the claim for punitive damages must also be dismissed. The only claim that would survive to trial, if this Report and Recommendation is adopted, would be Plaintiff's FLSA claim, which does not provide for "punitive" damages,14 and none of the evidence offered in support of the punitive damages claim relates specifically to the [*67]  FLSA claim. See Pl. Br. [64] at 24. Summary judgment is thus warranted on the standalone claim for punitive damages.

III. RECOMMENDATION
Thus, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [61] should be GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. The Court RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be awarded to Defendant on all claims under than Count 5 (FLSA), which Count should proceed to trial.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 23rd day of March, 2020.
