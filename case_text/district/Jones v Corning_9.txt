Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 64.] Pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., this magistrate judge is authorized to review all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases and submit findings and recommendations to the district court.
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed this action on December 30, 2015, alleging discrimination, retaliation, and failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.1 [Doc. 1.] On November 16, 2016, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 64.] Plaintiff filed a response in opposition on December 22, 2016. [Doc. 76.] Defendant filed a reply on January 11, 2017. [Doc. 78.] Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is ripe for review.

BACKGROUND
Defendant employed Plaintiff from April 1, 1987, through October 30, 2014, at its Ridgeview Plant in [*2]  Duncan, South Carolina. [Docs. 64-2 at 24; 64-11 ¶ 18; 76-3 ¶ 2.] At all times relevant to this matter, Plaintiff was employed as a Production Parts Technician. [Docs. 64-11 ¶ 5; 76-3 ¶ 2.] In that position, Plaintiff was responsible for operating two pieces of machinery, which were located beside one another in the same work cell. [Doc. 64-16 ¶ 5.]
On August 17, 2014, Plaintiff suffered a heart attack. [Doc. 76-1.] Plaintiff was out of work on paid medical leave for his condition from August 18, 2014, through September 4, 2014. [Docs. 64-11 ¶ 7; 76-4 at 26.] Plaintiff returned to work on September 4, 2014, with no limitations. [Docs. 64-11 ¶ 8; 76-4 at 26.]
On or around September 22, 2014, Plaintiff's supervisor, Kevin Mullens ("Mullens"), observed that Plaintiff was working only one of the two machines for which he was responsible. [Doc. 64-16 ¶ 9.] Mullens avers that Plaintiff informed Mullens for the first time that Plaintiff no longer felt capable of walking the distance between the two machines, nor was Plaintiff able to walk at the frequency the job required during the course of the day. [Id.] Mullens told Plaintiff that he would need to submit medical documentation from a physician [*3]  outlining his capabilities and suggesting reasonable accommodations. [Id. ¶ 10.] Plaintiff informed Mullens that his next physician's appointment was scheduled for October 27, 2014; however, he later told Mullens that he moved his appointment to October 3, 2014. [Id.] Mullens notified Lisa Anderson ("Anderson"), the facility's Human Resources Leader of his discussion with Plaintiff. [Id. ¶ 11.]
On September 24, 2014, Anderson spoke with Plaintiff regarding his ability to carry out the functions of this job, including running the two machines. [Doc. 64-11 ¶ 11.] Anderson provided Plaintiff with a copy of his job description along with Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and Short Term Disability documentation for Plaintiff to take to his doctor to complete and return. [Id.] On October 3, 2014, Sabrina Roark ("Roark"), an Occupational Health Nurse affiliated with Defendant, followed up with Plaintiff regarding what was needed from Plaintiff and his physician in order for Defendant to consider possible accommodations. [Id. ¶ 12.] Defendant permitted Plaintiff to work only one of the two machines for which he was responsible while it waited for Plaintiff to produce the required documentation. [*4]  [Doc. 64-16 ¶ 13.]
On October 6, 2014, Mullens observed that Plaintiff left before his shift was complete. [Doc. 64-16 ¶ 14.] Then, Mullens reviewed Plaintiff's Kronos timecard entries2 for the period of October 6, 2014, through October 15, 2014. [Id. ¶ 15.] Mullens noticed several inaccuracies between the hours Plaintiff worked and the times Plaintiff reported on his Kronos timecard. [Id.] On October 21, 2014, Mullens reported the timecard inaccuracies to Anderson. [Id. ¶ 17.] Mullens and Anderson reviewed footage from the plant's security cameras,3 which showed Plaintiff's arrival and departure times from work between October 6 and 15, 2014, were inconsistent with the times reported on Plaintiff's Kronos timecard. [Id. ¶ 18; Doc. 64-13.] The following inaccuracies were noted:

[Docs. 64-3 at 2; 64-4; 64-5.] Defendant suspended Plaintiff on October [*5]  21, 2014, citing timecard inaccuracies. [Doc. 64-11 ¶ 14.]
On October 28, 2014, Plaintiff's physician faxed a copy of the completed Short Term Disability Application to Defendant. [Doc. 64-15.] The stated diagnosis on the Application was depression and plantar fasciitis. [Id.] The treatment plan stated "wear heal cups" and to get as much rest as possible. [Id.] No restrictions, limitations, nor accommodations were listed. [Id.] Plaintiff was terminated on October 30, 2014. [Doc. 64-2 at 46.]

APPLICABLE LAW

Liberal Construction of Pro Se Complaint
Plaintiff brought this action pro se, which requires the Court to liberally construe his pleadings. Estelle, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976); Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972) (per curiam); Loe v. Armistead, 582 F.2d 1291, 1295 (4th Cir. 1978); Gordon v. Leeke, 574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th Cir. 1978). Pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than those drafted by attorneys. Haines, 404 U.S. at 520. Even under this less stringent standard, however, a pro se complaint is still subject to summary dismissal. Id. at 520-21. The mandated liberal construction means that only if the court can reasonably read the pleadings to state a valid claim on which the complainant could prevail, it should do so. Barnett v. Hargett, 174 F.3d 1128, 1133 (10th Cir. 1999). A court may not construct the complainant's legal arguments for him. Small v. Endicott, 998 F.2d 411, 417-18 (7th Cir. 1993). Nor should a court "conjure up questions never squarely presented." Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985).

Summary Judgment [*6]  Standard
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states, as to a party who has moved for summary judgment:
The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect disposition of the case under applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257. When determining whether a genuine issue has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and ambiguities against the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).
The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant has made this threshold demonstration, the non-moving party, to survive the motion for summary judgment, may not rest on the allegations averred in his pleadings. Id. at 324. Rather, the non-moving party must demonstrate specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine issue. Id. Under this standard, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of [*7]  the non-movant's position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory allegations or denials, without more, are insufficient to preclude granting the summary judgment motion. Ross v. Commc'ns Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Further, Rule 56 provides in pertinent part:
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Accordingly, when Rule 56(c) has shifted the burden of proof to the non-movant, he must produce existence of a factual dispute on every element essential [*8]  to his action that he bears the burden of adducing at a trial on the merits.

DISCUSSION

Failure to Accommodate Claim
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against him because it failed to accommodate his disability. [Doc. 1 at 3-4.] Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim is without merit. [Doc. 64-1 at 14-17.]
To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, Plaintiff must show (1) he suffered a disability; (2) his employer knew of the disability; (3) with reasonable accommodations, he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job; and (4) his employer refused to make such reasonable accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). "[A]n employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he or she requests or prefers; the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Crawford v. Union Carbide Corp., 202 F.3d 257, at *4 (4th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision) (quoting Baert v. Euclid Beverage, Ltd., 149 F.3d 626, 633 (7th Cir. 1998)). In defining "reasonable accommodation," the ADA regulations provide:
To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise [*9]  limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). Thus, the ADA imposes upon employers a good-faith duty "to engage [with their employees] in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Id. This duty is triggered when an employee communicates his disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation. Id. However, an employer will not be liable for failure to engage in the interactive process if the employee ultimately fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of the position. Id. at 347; see also Deily v. Waste Mgmt. of Allentown, 55 F.App'x. 605, 607 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Shapiro v. Twp. of Lakewood, 292 F.3d 356, 360 (3d Cir. 2002)). Further, during "the interactive process, an employer may request and require that the employee provide sufficient medical documentation." Gilreath v. Cumberland Cty. Bd. of Educ., No. 5:11-CV-627-BR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105904, 2014 WL 3779090, at *8 (E.D.N.C. July 31, 2014). "Such medical documentation allows the employer to determine the precise nature and extent of the employee's restriction due to a disability under the ADA and to assess potential reasonable accommodations." Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F.Supp.3d 470, 483 (E.D.N.C. 2015); Williams v. Revco Disc. Drug Ctrs., 552 F.App'x 919, 922 (11th Cir. 2014).
Here, Plaintiff returned to work on September [*10]  4, 2014, without limitations. [Doc. 76-4 at 26.] On September 22, 2014, Mullens observed that Plaintiff was only working one of the two machines for which he was responsible. [Doc. 64-16 ¶ 9.] Mullens questioned Plaintiff as to why he was only working one of the two machines. [Id.] Plaintiff informed Mullens that he no longer felt capable of keeping up with both machines, nor was he able to walk the frequency his job required during the course of the day. [Id.; Doc. 76 at 2.] Mullens requested that Plaintiff submit medical documentation from his physician outlining any necessary accommodations. [Doc. 64-16. ¶ 10.] In the interim, Defendant permitted Plaintiff to work only one of the two machines while it waited for Plaintiff to submit the required documentation. [Id. ¶ 13.]
On September 24, 2014, Plaintiff spoke with Anderson about his ability to carry out the essential functions of his job, including running the two machines. [Doc. 64-11 ¶ 11.] Plaintiff asserts that he requested that one machine be turned around to face the other. [Doc. 76 at 2.] Anderson provided Plaintiff with his job description as well as with FMLA and Short Term Disability documentation for Plaintiff to take [*11]  to his doctor, complete, and return. [Doc. 64-11 ¶ 11.] Subsequently, on October 3, 2014, Roark followed up with Plaintiff regarding what was needed from Plaintiff and his physician in order for Defendant to consider possible accommodations. [Id. ¶ 12.] On October 28, 2014, Plaintiff's physician faxed a copy of Plaintiff's completed Short Term Disability Application to Defendant. [Doc. 64-15.] The stated diagnosis on the Application was depression and plantar fasciitis. [Id.] The treatment plan stated "wear heal cups" and to get as much rest as possible. [Id.] No restriction, limitations, nor accommodations were noted. [Id.]
Based on the foregoing, the undersigned cannot find that Defendant denied Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. In response to noticing Plaintiff was operating only one machine, Defendant promptly met with Plaintiff and engaged in the interactive process in order to identify which reasonable accommodations were necessary. Defendant provided Plaintiff with the necessary documentation to complete and return. Defendant permitted Plaintiff to work only one of the two machines for which he was responsible while it awaited return of the necessary documentation. However, [*12]  the Short Term Disability form that Plaintiff's physician faxed to Defendant failed to identify any restrictions or the need for accommodations related to Plaintiff's heart issues. Because Defendant engaged in the interactive process and Plaintiff failed to submit medical documentation suggesting that he required a reasonable accommodation to perform his job, the undersigned recommends that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim.4

Discrimination and Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff also alleges that he was terminated on the basis of disability discrimination and in retaliation for requesting accommodations. [Doc. 1 at 3-4.] Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation under the ADA, nor can Plaintiff establish that Defendant's legitimate reason for terminating Plaintiff is really a pretext for unlawful discrimination or retaliation. [Docs. 64, 78.]
The ADA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, [*13]  job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA's retaliation provision provides, in relevant part, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual . . . made a charge . . . under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Absent direct or circumstantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an impermissible factor motivated an employer's adverse employment action, a plaintiff may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas "pretext" framework to establish a claim of employment discrimination or retaliation.5 Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004)); see Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'l of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding that "the McDonnell Douglas scheme of proof applies to appropriate claims under the ADA").
Under this framework, an employee must first prove a prima facie case of discrimination.6 McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. By providing such an explanation, the employer rebuts the presumption of discrimination created by the prima facie case, and "[t]he presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the [employer] to come forward with some response, simply drops out [*14]  of the picture." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). If the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the articulated reason was actually a pretext for discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.
Here, even assuming that Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination and/or retaliation, Defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.7 Specifically, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff's termination resulted from his falsification of time records in violation of company policy. Defendant's Handbook clearly articulates that employees are subject to discipline, up to and including termination, for falsification of timekeeping records. [Doc. 64-6 at 35.] Records demonstrate, and Plaintiff does not contest, that his Kronos timecard for the period of October 6 through 15, 2014, was inaccurate and did not reflect the time he actually worked. [Docs. 64-2 at 7-10; 64-3 at 2; 64-4; 64-5.] Because Defendant has met its burden of proffering a nondiscriminatory, nonretaliatory reason for its termination decision, Plaintiff must show that the asserted reason [*15]  is pretext for discrimination. After a careful review of the record, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to this issue.
A plaintiff can show pretext by demonstrating that the defendant's explanation is "unworthy of credence" or by "offer[ing] other forms of circumstantial evidence sufficiently probative of intentional discrimination." Dugan v. Albermarle Cty. Sch. Bd., 293 F.3d 716, 721 (4th Cir. 2002). Mere conjecture and speculation, however, are insufficient to overcome a summary judgment motion. See Autry v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., 820 F.2d 1384, 1386 (4th Cir. 1987). Plaintiff does not dispute that the hours he logged in Kronos were inaccurate, or that Defendant's policy articulated that falsification of time records was a basis for termination. [Docs. 64-2 at 22; 76 at 7.] Rather, Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not follow the policies and procedures written in the Handbook, and it is "widespread custom amongst Defendant's employees not to keep accurate hours." [Doc. 76. at 7-8.] Plaintiff asserts that he was not actually required to work the hours he logged in Kronos, but instead he worked only those hours he was required to work. [Doc. 76-3 at 3.] However, Plaintiff fails to set forth any evidence to support his conclusory allegations. Further, Plaintiff's argument that Defendant has been "cleaning house in the past three years by suddenly enforcing their time card policy after years of ignoring it" [Doc. [*17]  76 at 8-9], cuts against Plaintiff's argument that Defendant does not enforce its timecard policy. Indeed, no fewer than four other employees have been terminated in the past three years for similar timecard violations. [Doc. 64-11 ¶ 19.] In the absence of evidence of pretext, "[i]t is not our providence to decide whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination." DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1988). Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant's articulated reason is mere pretext. Because Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence suggesting that Defendant's decision to discharge him for falsification of time records was pretextual, the undersigned recommends that summary judgment be granted on Plaintiff's claims for ADA discrimination and retaliation.

CONCLUSION
Wherefore, based on the foregoing, it is recommended that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
