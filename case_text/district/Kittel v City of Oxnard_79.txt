Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL
Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE [20]; DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO [*2]  DISMISS [21]; PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS [24]
Before the Court is Defendants City of Oxnard, Sylvia Paniagua, and Eric Sonstegard's (together, "Defendants") Motion to Strike Plaintiff's First Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Strike Motion"), filed on October 24, 2017, 2017. (Docket No. 20). Plaintiff April Kittel filed an Opposition (the "Strike Opposition") on November 13, 2017. (Docket No. 22). Defendants replied (the "Strike Reply") on November 20, 2017. (Docket No. 28).
Also before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Dismissal Motion"), also filed on October 24, 2017. (Docket No. 21). Plaintiff filed an Opposition (the "Dismissal Opposition") on November 13, 2017 (Docket No. 23), and Defendants replied (the "Dismissal Reply") on November 20, 2017. (Docket No. 29).
The Court has reviewed and considered the papers on the Motions, and held a hearing on December 4, 2017. For the reasons described below, the Strike Motion is GRANTED to the extent it requests a more definite statement pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e). The FAC is long, redundant, and confusing. This alone would not be fatal, as despite those flaws, the allegations do [*3]  appear to be largely relevant to claims for relief rooted in disability discrimination. The Court is able, with substantial effort, to derive a general narrative from the allegations, and sets it forth below. However, the claims for relief themselves are pled in an impermissible shotgun style that inhibits Defendants' and the Court's ability to respond to each claim. Per the Court's instructions below, Plaintiff may revise the FAC to bring it into compliance with Rule 8.
The Dismissal Motion is DENIED at this time.
In light of this Order, Plaintiff's pending Motion to Certify Class (Docket No. 24), which is currently set for hearing on January 8, 2018, is DENIED without prejudice. As discussed at the hearing, the Court encourages the parties to discuss and agree to a briefing schedule.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff commenced this putative class action on July 24, 2017 in Ventura County Superior Court. (Notice of Removal at 1-2 (Docket No. 1)). Defendants removed the action to federal court on September 12, 2017, after being served with the Complaint and Summons on August 14, 2017. (Notice of Removal at 3). Defendants then promptly moved to dismiss and strike Plaintiff's Complaint. (Docket Nos. 7, 8). Before the Court held a hearing on the motions, Plaintiff filed a First Amended [*4]  Complaint ("FAC") on October 10, 2017. (Docket No. 16). Defendants then filed the present Motions on October 24, 2017.
The FAC alleges the following facts, which, for purposes of these Motions, the Court assumes are true and construes any inferences arising from those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See, e.g., Schueneman v. Arena Pharm., Inc., 840 F.3d 698, 704 (9th Cir. 2016) (restating generally-accepted principle that "[o]rdinarily, when we review a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept a plaintiff's allegations as true 'and construe them in the light most favorable' to the plaintiff" (quoting Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 989 (9th Cir. 2009)).

A. Allegations of Misconduct Against Plaintiff
Plaintiff, a former Police Records Technician within the Police Department of the City of Oxnard, brings this action against the City; Plaintiff's former supervisor, Sylvia Paniagua, in her individual and official capacities; and Assistant Police Chief Eric Sonstegard, in his individual and official capacities. (FAC ¶¶ 11-21).
Since early 2013, Plaintiff has had a physical disability resulting from a pinched ulner nerve and carpal tunnel/cubital tunnel syndrome that causes extreme pain after repetitive upper extremity use, such as typing, and prevents her from lifting more than 30 pounds. (FAC [*5]  ¶ 22). Plaintiff provided to the City documentation from her doctors that restricts her from typing for more than four hours per day, with appropriate breaks after continuous typing. (Id. ¶ 23).
Plaintiff alleges she repeatedly provided medical documentation to Defendant Paniagua that restricted Plaintiff to no more than four of typing per day, plus a five-minute break after every 50 or 60 minutes of continuous typing. (Id. ¶¶ 90-91). Plaintiff also requested she be reassigned to one of several positions that required less continuous typing activity. (Id. ¶ 94). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Paniagua refused to grant the requests, and rebuked Plaintiff for seeking special treatment. (Id. ¶ 95). The City failed to intervene to stop Defendant Paniagua's conduct, failed to engage in the interactive process, and failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 99-101).
On August 28, 2013, after learning of more restrictive limitations ordered by Plaintiffs' doctors, Defendant Paniagua became verbally hostile with Plaintiff, and suspended her from work until her doctors cleared her of all work restrictions. (FAC ¶ 102). On August 29, 2013, Plaintiff's union representative contacted [*6]  the City's Human Resources Department to formally request a meeting to discuss accommodating Plaintiff's work restrictions. (Id. ¶ 103). Plaintiff alleges that the City ignored the request. (Id. ¶ 104).
On September 18, 2013, Plaintiff emailed the liaison between the City and the Police Department for worker's compensation and disability issues to inform him that her doctor extended the restrictions until October 11. (Id. ¶ 106). She asked, "I'm assuming this means I'm out until he clears me to come back without limitations. Or am I incorrect?" (Id.). That same day, the liaison replied, "You are correct. We're going to keep you off." (Id. ¶¶ 106-07).
Plaintiff was unable to return to work until March 11, 2015, when her doctor released her from all restrictions. (FAC ¶ 108). Throughout 2013, 2014, and 2015, Plaintiff sought employment elsewhere in the City, but the City did not hire her for any of the other positions. (Id. ¶ 113-118). When Plaintiff did return to work, she was reassigned to the same typing-intensive position over her objections. (Id. ¶ 119). When Plaintiff's pain flared up again and her doctor reinstated her work restrictions, the City and Defendant Paniagua again suspended [*7]  Plaintiff from work. (Id. ¶ 120). She was unable to return to work again until April 6, 2015. (FAC ¶ 120). The City briefly accommodated her from April 6 to April 13, 2015 by assigning her to a less typing-intensive position. (Id. ¶ 122).
Defendant Sonstegard became Defendant Paniagua's immediate supervisor, and Plaintiff alleges they entered into an agreement to discriminate against Plaintiff based on her disability. (FAC ¶ 124). Pursuant to this agreement, Defendant Sonstegard forced Plaintiff to sign a "Temporary Modified Duty" agreement for which she did not qualify. (Id. ¶¶ 124-26). Plaintiff only signed the agreement to keep her job. (Id. ¶ 126).
In May 2015, when Plaintiff missed work due to illness, Defendant Sonstegard tried to coerce her into admitting she had not actually been sick, and to quit her job by way of taking a disability retirement. (FAC ¶ 127). Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Sonstegard took other actions that targeted her because of her disability, such as revising the Modified Duty Policy (Id. ¶ 129) and requiring Plaintiff to sign additional Temporary Modified Duty agreements (Id. ¶¶ 130-32). On September 14, 2015, Plaintiff was ordered not to return [*8]  to work despite her requests to remain on the assignment she had for the last several months, which reasonably accommodated her disability. (Id. ¶ 133).
Plaintiff commenced a worker's compensation case in December 2015, and was examined by the Qualified Medical Examiner ("QME") in February 2016. (FAC ¶¶ 135-36). After receiving the QME's report, which contained clearly erroneous attachments setting forth incorrect work restrictions, Defendants Paniagua and Sonstegard, along with other City employees, agreed to wrongly induce Plaintiff to take a disability retirement. (Id. ¶¶ 137-38).
In May of 2016, Plaintiff had "Reasonable Accommodations Meetings" with City representatives. (Id. ¶ 140). The representatives made clear to Plaintiff that she could not be accommodated in her existing position. (Id. ¶¶ 143-45). They made no effort to engage in the interactive process. (Id. ¶¶ 151-57). Eventually, Plaintiff accepted a disability retirement, which Plaintiff alleges was a constructive discharge. (Id. ¶ 157).
Plaintiff alleges that she has exhausted her administrative remedies before bringing this action. (FAC ¶¶ 4-10).

B. Allegations Regarding City and Department-Wide Policies and Practices
 [*9] Plaintiff alleges that the City's current written policy with respect to reasonable accommodation of disabled employees and the required interactive process, as well as the City's patterns of practice, overly burdens employees and exempts the City from responsibility for initiating the interactive process. (FAC ¶¶ 58-59). Without a written request for an accommodation or a worker's compensation claim, the City will not engage in the interactive process. (Id. ¶ 59-60). Moreover, the City makes no effort to educate its employees regarding their rights to an interactive process. (Id. ¶ 62). Plaintiff describes the policies, practices, and patterns in great detail. (Id. ¶¶ 64-78).
Plaintiff also alleges that the Oxnard Police Department's current policies and patterns of practice are to suspend employees when it learns that they are disabled and require reasonable accommodations. (FAC ¶ 79). Employees are not permitted to return to work until they are "100 percent healed." (Id. ¶¶ 79-80). Moreover, the Department has a written "Modified Duty" policy, but has no practice of providing permanent modified duties to any of its disabled employees. (Id. ¶¶ 81-83). Instead, it provides only temporary modified duties. (Id. ¶¶ 81-85).
In 2015, Defendant Sonstegard revised the Modified Duty policy to forbid any employee from being assigned to any modified duties unless the treating physician believes [*10]  the employee will be able to return to a full duty status within 180 days. (FAC ¶ 86).
The Department also has a pattern of policy and pattern of practice of retaliating against employees who use their sick leave (FAC ¶ 87), and failed to provide furnishings that met ergonomic standards despite requests from Plaintiff and other employees. (Id. ¶ 88).

C. Proposed Class
Pursuant to Federal Rule of 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3), Plaintiff seeks to represent various Classes and Subclasses. In the FAC, Plaintiff proposes the following Class:
(i) All persons who have been, or currently are, employed by the City of Oxnard at any time after 1974, including, but not limited to, those employees who have been or are absent from work while receiving either workers compensation or short or long-term disability insurance benefits, and
(ii) Have been, or currently are absent from work because of medical reasons, and
(iii) During the time of such absence from work, and presently, were and are, qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and
(FAC ¶ 29). Plaintiff proposes the following subclasses:
(A) For any [*11]  amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of the City of Oxnard's discriminatory Policy on Reasonable Accommodation; or
(B) For those class members whose disabilities stem from a work-related injury at the CITY and result in a worker's compensation proceeding involving the CITY, for any amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of the CITY's use of a QME's or AME's work restrictions to the exclusion of the employee's treating physician's work restrictions; or
(C) For any amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of the discriminatory use by the City of Oxnard of uniform pretextual job descriptions; or (D) For any amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of the Oxnard Police Department's "100% healed policy"; or
(E) For any amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of the Oxnard Police Department's discriminatory implementation of its formal "Modified Duty" Policy; or
(F) For any amount of time during such absence from work, did not return to work by reason of other patterns or practices of discrimination [*12]  by the City of Oxnard, as described in this Amended Complaint.; or
(G) Were, at any time during the absence from work, forced by the City of Oxnard to submit to an involuntary fitness-for-duty examination, when the employee's own physician had already prescribed for the employee, work restrictions sufficient for the employee to return to work; or
(G)(a) Upon completion of a fitness-for-duty examination ordered by the CITY, as above, were refused disclosure of the examination results due to the direction of the CITY to the provider of the examination.
(Id. ¶¶ 29-30). Plaintiff appears to have duplicated this Class and these Subclasses in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the FAC. It is unclear to the Court if this is meant to be an additional class or is an error.
Plaintiff also proposes a Class "seeking relief only under 34 CFR § 100.7(e)," which comprises: "All persons currently employed, or in the future will be employed, by the City of Oxnard who, during such employment, may now be, or in the future will become qualified individuals with disabilities under the ADA, §504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or FEHA and, at such time, need or will need the City of Oxnard to timely engage in a good faith interactive process with them [*13]  for their reasonable accommodation within the meaning of these statutory provisions." (FAC ¶ 33).
Plaintiff alleges that the proposed class meets the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements of Rule 23. (FAC ¶¶ 34-49).

D. Claims for Relief
Based on the allegations described above, Plaintiff brings six claims for relief on behalf of herself and all persons similarly situated:
• First Claim, against the City only: "Employment Discrimination — Disparate Treatment and Hostile Work Place on the Basis of Disability and Disparate Impact Against Department Employees; Constructive Discharge of Plaintiff" (Id. ¶¶ 159-249);
• Third Claim, against the City only: "Failure to Engage in a Timely Good Faith Interactive Process for Reasonably Accommodating Plaintiff" (Id. ¶¶ 250-317);
• Fourth Claim, against the City only: "Failure to Reasonably Accommodate Plaintiff Due to a Disability Resulting in Constructive Discharge" (Id. ¶¶ 318-35);
• Fifth Claim, against all Defendants: "Harassment, Intimidation, Coercion, and Retaliation Resulting in Constructive Discharge" (Id. ¶¶ 336-53);
• Sixth Claim, against the City only: "Unlawful Employment Practice of Requiring Fitness for [*14]  Duty Exam without Business Necessity", "Policy and Pattern of Practice in Violation of . . ." (Id. ¶¶ 354-62);
• Seventh Claim, against the City and Provider of the Fitness-for-Duty Examination: "Conspiracy on the Part of the City and its Chosen Medical Care Provider to Deny Plaintiff Access to the Records of Her Fitness for Duty Examination", "Policy and Pattern of Practice in Violation of . . ." (Id. ¶¶ 363-70);
• Eighth Claim, against the City and Provider of the Fitness-for-Duty Examination: "Declaratory Relief" (Id. ¶¶ 371-75).
Plaintiff's Second Claim for Relief, brought against the City only, is brought on behalf of herself individually: "Discriminatory Failure or Refusal to Hire or Transfer Plaintiff for/to Positions of 'Office Assistant II', 'Police Records Technician III', 'Recreation/Human Resources Coordinator', and 'Customer Services Representative I.'" (FAC ¶¶ 232-49).

III. MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendants move to strike Plaintiff's FAC in its entirety for failure to comply with the Rule 8 requirement that complaints in civil actions must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." (Strike Mot. at 1 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2))). Alternatively, Defendants [*15]  move for a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e). (Id.). Defendants request that the Court limit any Second Amended Complaint to 20 pages. (Id.).

A. Legal Standards
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that courts "may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). "The function of a 12(f) motion to strike is to avoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial." Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi—Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). In determining whether to grant a motion to strike, courts must determine whether the matter the moving party seeks to have stricken is (1) an insufficient defense; (2) redundant; (3) immaterial; (4) impertinent; or (5) scandalous. Id. at 973-74. Motions to strike are not favored and "should not be granted unless it is clear that the matter to be stricken could have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation." Colaprico v. Sun Microsystems, Inc., 758 F. Supp. 1335, 1339 (N.D. Cal. 1991). When considering a motion to strike, the court "must view the pleading in a light most favorable to the pleading party," and deny the motion if there is any doubt regarding whether the allegations might be relevant.  [*16] In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Lit., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 965 (C.D. Cal. 2000).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) provides that a "party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading . . . which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e). Motions for a more definite statement are also disfavored, and are "restricted to situations where a pleading suffers from unintelligibility rather than want of detail." Dri—Eaz Products, Inc. v. Nguyen, No. CV 11-1654, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60860, 2012 WL 1537598, at *1 (W.D. Wash. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted); Sagan v. Apple Computer, Inc., 874 F.Supp. 1072, 1077 (C.D.Cal.1994) ("Motions for a more definite statement are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted because of the minimal pleading requirements of the Federal Rules."). "A Rule 12(e) motion is proper only if the complaint is so indefinite that the defendant cannot ascertain the nature of the claim being asserted in order to frame a response." Medrano v. Kern Cty. Sheriff's Officer, 921 F. Supp. 2d 1009, 1013 (E.D. Cal. 2013). If the complaint is specific enough for the defendant to frame a responsive pleading, the motion must be denied. See Bureerong v. Uvawas, 922 F. Supp. 1450, 1461 (C.D. Cal. 1996).

B. Discussion
Defendants argue that Courts routinely dismiss excessively verbose or confusing complaints for failure to comply with Rule 8, and cite to several Ninth Circuit cases affirming dismissal of Complaints that were excessively long, confusing, conclusory, or redundant. (Strike Mot. at 4-5).
For example, in McHenry v. Renne, the Ninth Circuit [*17]  affirmed the district court's dismissal of Complaint that was "argumentative, prolix, replete with redundancy, and largely irrelevant." 84 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 1996). The district court had given the plaintiff specific instructions regarding on how to amend the complaint, but the amended complaints suffered from the same deficiencies, and the district court dismissed them again, with prejudice. Id. at 1175-76. Despite the complaint's length, "one [could not] determine from the complaint who is being sued, for what relief, and on what theory, with enough detail to guide discovery." Id. at 1178. In affirming the district court's decision, the Ninth Circuit considered the burden on the court and the litigants of responding to such a confusing, prolix complaint. Id. at 1179-80.
Likewise, in Carrigan v. Cal. State Legislature, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal with prejudice of a 150-page complaint describing the plaintiff's thoughts, worries, hearsay conversations, frustrations and difficulties with doctors and insurance companies, medical reports, and so on. 263 F.2d 560, 566 (9th Cir. 1959). See also Nevijel v. North Coast Life Ins. Co., 651 F.2d 671, 675 (9th Cir. 1981) (affirming dismissal of complaint that was "verbose, confusing and almost entirely conclusory"); Hatch v. Reliance Ins. Co., 758 F.2d 409, 415 (9th Cir. 1985) (affirming district court's dismissal of complaints that "exceeded [*18]  70 pages in length, were confusing and conclusory, and not in compliance with Rule 8"); United States ex rel. Mateski v. Raytheon Co., No. CV 06-3614-ODW (KSx), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93901, 2017 WL 1954942 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2017) (dismissing with leave to amend 134-page, undecipherable complaint).
Here, Plaintiff's FAC is exceedingly long, redundant, and confusing. However, unlike the cases Defendant cites, described above, the Court cannot conclude that all of the excessive detail is irrelevant because, for the most part, it does appears to pertain to Plaintiff's experiences attempting to obtain reasonable accommodations for her disability and Defendants' conduct, policies, or practices with regard to treatment of disabled employees.
That said, as Defendants point out, the lengthy titles of Plaintiff's claims each appear to combine several claims under various statutory and regulatory schemes. Each claim for relief cites to several discrete statutory and regulatory provisions. Moreover, each claim incorporates by reference hundreds of allegations, many of which are clearly irrelevant to the claim at issue. Although incorporation by reference is common practice, "allegations . . . which incorporate each preceding paragraph, regardless of relevancy, are not permitted." [*19]  Destfino v. Kennedy, No. CV F-081269-LJO (DLBx), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109691, 2008 WL 4810770, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 3, 2008), aff'd sub nom 630 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2011). Indeed, the Eight Claim for Relief incorporates all the preceding allegations - 370 paragraphs. The Fifth Claim incorporates nearly all of the preceding allegations — over 300 paragraphs. The Second Claim, which is brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually, inexplicably incorporates allegations regarding how the proposed Class meets the requirements of Rule 23. This style of "shotgun" pleading violates Rule 8. Id. When faced with such a complaint, it is appropriate for the defendant to move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e). Id.
Defendants' briefing demonstrates that although they can in part respond to the allegations, Defendants are sufficiently confused by the lengthy, shotgun-style claims that they have not been able to formulate comprehensive responses to each claim. Cf. Bureerong, 922 F. Supp. at 1461-62 ("While Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint is not always a model of clarity . . . . Defendants' briefs amply demonstrate that they do understand the issues presented by the First Amended Complaint."); Medrano, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 1018 ("[A]lthough the Court agrees that portions of the Complaint are inelegantly pleaded, the nature of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs are intelligible and unambiguous."). [*20] 
In Opposition, Plaintiff does little to justify the FAC's pleading style, and in fact contributes to the existing confusion. For example, Plaintiff contends that the length of the FAC is necessary to meet the heightened pleading standard for fraud. (Strike Opp. at 9). Yet, none of the claims appears to be based in fraud. As Defendants argue, this lack of clarity regarding what claims are being pursued is exactly what Rule 8 is intended to avoid. (Strike Reply at 3).
It is neither Defendants' nor the Court's responsibility to "expend time and effort searching through large masses of conclusory, argumentative, evidentiary and other extraneous allegations in order to discover whether the essentials of claims asserted can be found in such a mélange. Jacobson v. Schwartzenegger, 226 F.R.D. 395, 397 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (citation omitted) (dismissing 200-page complaint with leave to amend for failure to comply with Rule 8).
As discussed above, the Court cannot conclude that the entirety of the Complaint is immaterial or redundant. Nor do Defendants argue that the FAC is scandalous or impertinent. The Court therefore DENIES the Strike Motion to the extent it seeks to strike the FAC in its entirety. Whittlestone, 618 F.3d at 973-74. However, the Court GRANTS the Strike Motion to the extent it seeks a more definite statement. [*21]  Plaintiff is ordered to amend the FAC to streamline the allegations to remove the excessive redundancy, clarify the title and nature of each claim for relief, and simplify which relevant factual allegations are incorporated by each claim.
Because the Court grants the Strike Motion under Rule 12(e), it does not at this time reach Defendants' Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Strike Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend to the extent it seeks a more definite statement pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e).
The Dismissal Motion is DENIED at this time. Plaintiff's pending Motion to Certify Class is DENIED without prejudice.
Plaintiff shall file a Second Amended Complaint that complies with the Court's instructions above by December 27, 2017.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
