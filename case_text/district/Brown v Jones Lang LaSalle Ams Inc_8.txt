CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (in chambers): ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 24]
This matter is before the Court on Defendant Jones Lang LaSalle, Inc.'s ("JLL" or "Defendant") Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("Motion"), filed April 6, 2016. Plaintiff Eric Brown ("Plaintiff") opposed the Motion ("Opposition") on April 21, 2016. Defendant replied ("Reply") on April 25, 2016.1 The Court found this matter suitable for disposition without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for May 9, 2016. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). For the following reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Except as otherwise noted, the following facts are either undisputed or supported by sufficient admissible evidence that they are "admitted to exist without controversy" for purposes of this Motion. L.R. 56-3.2
A. Plaintiff's Employment with JLL
JLL hired Plaintiff on September 1, 2001, when it took over the facilities management contract for Bank of America's Brea Center ("Center"), (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 1; Def.'s Facts ¶ 1), and employed him as an Assistant Chief Engineer ("ACE") through out his tenure, (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 4; Brown Dep. at 1563). Plaintiff retired in 2015, after he was notified that his temporary disability benefits would be ending in August of that year. (See Brown Dep. at 320:17-321:22.)
In his role as an ACE, Plaintiff belonged to a team of engineers who are collectively responsible for [*3]  installing and maintaining the Center's equipment. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 2-3.) Defendant's written description of Plaintiff's position includes the following responsibilities: (1) supervising and training operations staff; (2) maintaining and installing new equipment; (3) giving hands-on instruction in basic maintenance, safety, and trouble-shooting; (4) demonstrating proper tool and instrument use; (5) scheduling, performing, and/or delegating preventative maintenance; (6) preparing and submitting purchase orders for required parts and equipment; (7) maintaining inventory; and (8) periodically checking supplies. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 8; Decl. of Pamela McKibben Teren in Supp. Opp'n ("Teren Decl."), Ex. A, ECF No. 37.) At least some of the Center's equipment is very large and taller than head height, requiring that an ACE maintaining or repairing such equipment work on his or her feet. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 10.) Additionally, the collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between JLL and the International Union of Operating Engineers ("IUOE"), of which Plaintiff was a member, states that an ACE "may stand a shift and work with the tools of his trade." (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 97.)
B. Comments and Work Conditions
Plaintiff [*4]  alleges that Defendant, through its employees, subjected Plaintiff to harassment and discrimination because of his race. (See generally Notice of Removal, Ex. 1 ("Complaint"), ECF No. 1.) These employees and their interactions with Plaintiff are described below.
1. Cordero, the Chief Engineer
In 2002, Enswins Cordero ("Cordero") became the Center's Chief Engineer. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 7.) While the exact scope of Cordero's authority is disputed, (compare Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 114-21, with Def.'s Facts ¶¶ 114-21), the parties agree that Cordero has prepared write-ups for employees on four or five occasions. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 118.)
Over the course of Plaintiff's employment with JLL, Cordero insulted Plaintiff on a number of occasions. First, in 2007, Cordero told a contractor that he was "doing all right, it could be worse, look at [Plaintiff]." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 62.) Second, in either 2008 or 2009, Cordero told Plaintiff that his co-worker, Karen Williams, was timing the frequency and duration of his restroom visits. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 80.) Third, Cordero called Plaintiff "lazy" at least twice between 2007 and 2010. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 64.) Fourth, in 2009 or 2010, Cordero informed Plaintiff that he disliked Plaintiff's [*5]  facial expressions and that Plaintiff ought to change them. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 65.) Fifth, in 2010 or 2011, Cordero called Plaintiff "fat," stated that Plaintiff needed to purchase new uniforms, and commented that Plaintiff walked on sides of his feet. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 68.) Sixth, and most egregiously, in either 2011 or 2012, Cordero called Plaintiff a "fucking nigger" while the two were working together on the roof of a building." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 72.)
Cordero also made a series of decisions that impacted Plaintiff negatively. In 2005, he "took away Plaintiff's over-scale pay," and this decision became "final" in 2006. (Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 61, 92.) Likewise, in 2009 or 2010, Cordero denied Plaintiff "on-call pay" when at least one other worker received it. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 66.) In April of 2011, Cordero moved Plaintiff's desk into his own office and instructed a contractor to make Plaintiff's workspace as small as possible. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 69, 70.) At that time, Cordero prohibited Plaintiff from using their shared office's restroom. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 71.) Additionally, in or around March of 2013, Cordero asked two operating engineers, William Quiroz and Karen Williams, to begin "gather[ing] dirt" on [*6]  Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 73.)
Since November 2013, when Plaintiff went on medical leave, Cordero's contact with Plaintiff has been limited to email exchanges and telephone calls. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 73.)
2. The Operating Engineers
In or before 2010 and again at some undetermined date, Mark Morehouse, an operating engineer, informed Plaintiff that he had learned, through Quiroz, of several additional insults made by Cordero directed at Plaintiff. According to Morehouse, Quiroz told him that Cordero said "[t]hat nigger isn't very smart," referring to Plaintiff, (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 67), and called Plaintiff a "nigger" at least one other time during a conversation in the Center's cafeteria, (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 74).
It is likewise undisputed that Quiroz himself called Plaintiff a "nigger" twice between 2010 and 2011 and that, in the summer of 2014, Morehouse told Plaintiff that he heard Quiroz repeat the racial slur in reference to Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 84-86.)
On or around October 19, 2005, Tim Hall, another operating engineer, informed Plaintiff that Karen Williams had embarked on a public cursing tirade"" in which she referred to Plaintiff as a "shit bird" and "that fucker." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 79.) Likewise, [*7]  in the fall of "maybe" 2013, Mike Siancuno, an Operating Engineer, told Plaintiff that Karen Williams had accused Plaintiff of stealing gasoline from work. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 82.) In April of 2014, Plaintiff was informed, this time by Morehouse, that Williams had discussed finding someone to beat him up, but that she "decided against it because 'she only gave [Brown] two years to live anyway . . . ." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 81.)
C. Plaintiff's Ladder Fall and Initial Doctor's Visits
On November 17, 2013, Plaintiff was injured at work "after falling off a ladder." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 25.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant, through its employees, failed to engage in the interactive process to reasonably accommodate his disability and discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. (See generally Compl.)
Five days after his fall, Plaintiff visited Dr. Paul Kim ("Dr. Kim") in connection with his injuries and was instructed not to return to work until November 27, 2013. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 26-27.) On November 27, 2013, Plaintiff visited Dr. Kim a second time, at which point Dr. Kim released him to return to work with the following restrictions: (1) no climbing; (2) a sit down job; (3) no overhead [*8]  work; and (4) no lifting, pushing, or pulling more than 20 pounds at a time. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 28.)
JLL was required to honor Dr. Kim's restrictions, and Dr. Kim intended these restrictions to indicate—at the very least—that Plaintiff should refrain from climbing ladders. (Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 29, 98-99.) Given these restrictions, Plaintiff could not "have walked around and checked the work done on rounds" and that Dr. Kim's Work Status Report indicated, if no modified work was available, JLL was to "keep [Plaintiff] off work unless, and until, such modified work is made available." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 29, 98-99.)
On December 5, 2013, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Kim for a third, "follow-up appointment." (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 30.) Following that appointment, Plaintiff emailed Cordero asking in part:
Is the policy that I must be able to perform my job according to the job description? Would you please let me know exactly what the policy is.
(Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 31, Teren Decl. Ex. D ("First Email Exchange"), ECF No. 37.) Cordero responded that he would discuss the matter with his supervisor, Dan Estrada, and get back to Plaintiff. (First Email Exch.)
On December 6, 2013, Defendant's workers' compensation carrier, the [*9]  Hartford Insurance Company ("Hartford"), emailed Cordero and asked him if JLL could accommodate Plaintiff's return to work with restrictions. (First Email Exch.) Cordero informed Hartford that JLL could not accommodate Plaintiff's medical restrictions because Plaintiff's job involved both walking and sitting down, performing as an operating engineer, and mobilizing rapidly in response to emergencies. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 34; First Email Exch.)
Subsequently, Plaintiff filed for medical leave in accordance with the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). (Def.'s Facts ¶ 36; Brown Dep. at 289:7-14.) Defendant's third-party leave administrator, Liberty Mutual, approved Plaintiff's medical leave from November 22, 2013 through February 13, 2014. (Decl. of Laura McCorry in Supp. Mot. ("McCorry Decl."), Ex. 4-5, ECF Nos. 24-11, 24-12.)
While on medical leave, Plaintiff followed Dr. Kim's recommendation and visited a surgeon, Dr. Albert Simpkins ("Dr. Simpkins"). (Def's Facts ¶ 38; Brown Dep. at 301:10-16.) After examining Plaintiff on January 31, 2014, Dr. Simpkins deemed Plaintiff totally temporarily disabled ("TTD"). (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 40.) Plaintiff saw Dr. Simpkins again at least twice before May 15, 2015. (Def.'s Facts ¶ 46; Brown Dep., [*10]  Exs. 10, 12.) Throughout this period, Dr. Simpkins issued work status reports that used the words "totally temporarily disabled." (Def.'s Facts ¶ 40; Brown Dep. at 305:8-19; Brown Dep., Exs. 10,12.) There is considerable dispute over what Dr. Simpkins meant by these words.
On February 11, 2014, two days before to the end of Plaintiff's approved FMLA leave, Plaintiff emailed Cordero requesting clarification of Defendant's policy concerning his return to work. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 42; Brown Dep., Ex. 11 ("Second Email Exchange").) Cordero responded that "[o]ur policy is, and has been, no restrictions." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 43; Second Email Exch.) Cordero further explained that Plaintiff could not return to work unless he was physically capable of (1) performing all site engineer duties; and (2) responding to emergencies. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 43; Second Email Exch.) On February 12, 2014 Plaintiff responded, "so it's 100% or nothing?" (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 44; Second Email Exch.) Cordero replied, "as I stated below, No restrictions." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 45; Second Email Exch.)
On April 15, 2015, Laura McCorry, a member of JLL's Human Resources department, mailed Plaintiff a letter advising him that JLL was hiring a replacement [*11]  to fill his ACE position. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 112.) The letter also indicated that if Plaintiff was ever "certifi[ed] to return to work", Defendant would "make reasonable efforts to restore [Plaintiff] to an open position" if one became available for which Plaintiff was qualified. (Def's Facts ¶ 112; Brown Dep., Ex. 13.) Plaintiff never responded to this letter. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 113.)
D. Plaintiff's Partial and Total Disability Benefits and His Retirement
Proceeding under a theory of constructive discharge, Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant wrongfully terminated him. (Compl. ¶¶ 72-76.)
Between November 22, 2013 and August 13, 2015, Plaintiff received temporary partial disability benefits through JLL's workers' compensation carrier. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 55-56, Brown Dep., Ex. 16.) In June of 2015, Plaintiff also applied for "total disability benefits" through the Social Security Administration ("SSA"). (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 48.) In his application for SSA benefits, Plaintiff attested that his job involved walking the Center's 23-acre campus, checking electrical and equipment rooms, assisting crews, and operating plant equipment. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 49.) He likewise stated that he typically spent 3.5 hours [*12]  per day walking, 2.5 hours per day standing, and 1.5 hours per day seated and attested that he frequently lifted 25 lbs. and had lifted up to 100 lbs. in the course of his employment. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 50; Def. Ex. 19 ("Plaintiff's SSA Application") 5-10, ECF No. 29-7.) Additionally, Plaintiff wrote that he "could only walk short distances," at most 100 and 125 feet, "without having to rest" for up to four minutes. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 51; Pl.'s SSA Appl. 5-10.) Plaintiff concedes that he represented to the SSA, in his application, that he was incapable of working "at all" for JLL without modified duties. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 53.)
On July 16, 2015, Plaintiff visited Dr. Paul Bouz ("Dr. Bouz") in connection with his temporary disability benefits. (Brown Dep. 317; Brown Dep. Ex. 16.) At that time, Dr. Bouz concluded that Plaintiff had "reached maximum medical improvement." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 54-55; Brown Dep. 319:8-13.) This visit resulted in the Hartford ending Plaintiff's temporary partial disability benefits on August 13, 2015. (Brown Dep., Ex. 16.) Having "[run] out of options," because he could neither return to work nor continue to receive benefits, Plaintiff retired on October 31, 2015.4 (Pl.'s Resp. [*13]  ¶ 57.)
Less than three weeks later, the SSA denied Plaintiff's total disability benefits claim. (Teren Decl. Ex. I ("SSA Denial letter") at 2-3, ECF No. 38.) In its November 18, 2015 denial letter, the SSA noted that it had reviewed over ten medical reports concerning Plaintiff's medical condition in arriving at its decision. (SSA Denial Letter at 2-3.) It likewise explained the bases for its decision, noting that it had determined (1) that Plaintiff was not sufficiently disabled under the SSA's rules to qualify, and (2) that while Plaintiff's condition resulted in limitations, these were not severe enough to prohibit him working as he had "in the past as an Assistant Chief Engineer, as normally performed in the national economy." (SSA Denial Letter at 2-3.)
E. Defendant's Anti-Discrimination Policies
JLL maintains an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action policy ("A.A. Policy"), an Anti-Harassment policy ("A.H. Policy"), and a Code of Ethics. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 14.) JLL's A.A. Policy prohibits discrimination based on race or disability. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 15.) Its A.H. policy prohibits harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, color, or disability. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 17.) Both [*14]  JLL's A.H. policy and its Code of Ethics include (1) procedures for reporting harassment or discrimination through human resources or an ethics hotline; (2) a statement that Defendant is committed to promptly investigating complaints and taking corrective action; and (3) a prohibition against retaliation for reporting unlawful harassment or discrimination. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 18, 20.)
Plaintiff read JLL's Code of Ethics and was aware of the ethics hotline, (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 21; Brown Dep. at 235:12-17); that each year of his employment, he affirmed he would abide by the Code, (Brown Dep. 236:4-13); and that he "never complained to Defendant's human resources department" and "never filed any union grievances[,]" (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 24).
F. Plaintiff's EEOC Charges, DFEH Complaint, and the Instant Litigation
On July 1, 2014, Plaintiff filled out an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") intake questionnaire. (Teren Decl. Ex. J ("EEOC Intake Questionnaire"), ECF No. 38.) In that form, Plaintiff complained that Cordero and subordinate employees called him "nigger" and subjected him to racially themed jokes. (EEOC Intake Questionnaire.) He also averred that JLL refused to permit him to return [*15]  to work unless he was "100% able," and explained that he felt he had been discriminated against because of his race and his injured back. (EEOC Intake Questionnaire.)
On August 21, 2014, Plaintiff filed formal discrimination charges with the EEOC, alleging both racial and disability related discrimination. (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 58.) Likewise, on October 10, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Complaint of Employment Discrimination Before the State of California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH"), alleging at least discrimination, harassment, retaliation, denied employment, denied promotion, denied reasonable accommodation, failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation, and failure to engage in the interactive process. (Brown Dep., Ex. 5.)
On April 7, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against JLL in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angles ("Superior Court"), alleging multiple violations of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940 et seq., for (1) harassment; (2) discrimination; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to engage in the interactive process to determine reasonable disability accommodations; (5) failure to provide reasonable disability accommodations; and (6) failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, [*16]  and retaliation. (See Notice of Removal, Ex. B ("Compl."), ECF No. 1-2.) Plaintiff also alleged that JLL was liable for (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (9) violation of California's Whistleblower law, Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5. (Compl.)
On May 22, 2015, Defendant removed the instant action to this Court. (Notice of Removal.) On April 6, 2016, Defendant's filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment. (Mot., ECF No. 24)
II. DISCUSSION
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when the Court determines that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The substantive law underlying the claims and defenses at issue will determine which facts are material. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. Only disputes over facts "that might effect the outcome of the suit. . . will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Id. Likewise, a dispute is genuine only if the evidence is such that it could "reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Id. at 250.
Rule 56 requires the moving party to make a prima facie showing that it is entitled to summary [*17]  judgment. Celotex Corp. v Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 331, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The matter in which this burden can be satisfied differs depending on "which party will bear the burden of persuasion on the challenged claim at trial." Id. If the nonmoving part bears this burden, then the moving party must adduce evidence that either (1) negates one of the challenged claim's essential elements or (2) demonstrates that the nonmoving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element. Id. On the other hand, if the moving party bears the burden of persuasion, then it must establish every "element essential to that party's [claim], and on which [it] bear[s] the burden of proof at trial" with credible evidence sufficient to "entitle it to a directed verdict" if left uncontroverted at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 331.
If the movant meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party must "come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party may not rest on mere allegations, but must support its averred facts with evidence sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252. "If the nonmoving party cannot muster sufficient evidence to make out its claim. . . the moving party is entitled to summary judgment." [*18]  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 331.
In ruling on summary judgment, a Court's function is not to determine "the truth of the matter" by conducting a "trial on affidavits." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249, 255. Instead, the Court role is to decide "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury." Id. at 251-52. Accordingly, the nonmovant's evidence is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be made in the nonmovant's favor, leaving "[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts" to the jury. Id. at 255; accord Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. If, remaining mindful of the substantive evidentiary standards that apply to the case, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could determine "either that the plaintiff proved his case . . . or that he did not," then it should deny summary judgment. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 254 (emphasis in original).
B. Related Motions and Evidentiary Objections
Both parties have lodged procedural and evidentiary objections as well as a variety of related motions. The Court examines each in turn.
1. Procedural Objections
a. Objections as to Timeliness
Both parties have intermittently asserted multiple objections related to the timeliness of their opponent's pleadings. (See Opp. 1-2, ECF No. 33; [*19]  Def.'s Objs. and Mot. to Strike Brown Decl., ECF No. 47) As both sides have, at one point or another, acknowledged a preexisting agreement to waive at least some arguments regarding timeliness, (see Mem. in Supp. Pl.'s Ex Parte App. for Relief 14, ECF No. 50; Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Ex Parte App. for Relief 2, ECF No. 53), the Court will not decline to rely on any materials submitted in connection with this Motion as a result of untimeliness. Accordingly, all corresponding objections are DENIED as moot.
b. Objections Regarding Signatures
Defendant also objects to Plaintiff's declaration on the basis that he failed to sign this document. (See Decl. Eric Brown in Supp. Opp'n ("Brown Decl."), ECF No. 44; Objs. to Brown Decl. 1, ECF No. 47.) Plaintiff has since re-filed a signed duplicate declaration. (Not. of Errata Correcting Brown Decl., ECF No. 52.) Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's objection as moot.
c. Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application
Defendant also objects to Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for Relief from Procedural Defects. (Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Ex Parte App. for Relief.) Defendant argues that the application is, in essence, an unauthorized sur-reply and Defendant urges [*20]  the Court to sanction Plaintiff by awarding Defendant $4,465 in attorneys' fees. Id. at 6-7. The Court disagrees. With the exception of footnote three, the arguments Defendant refers to are directed at the procedural and quasi-procedural defects from which Plaintiff prays for relief. Moreover, each of the alleged procedural defects Defendant has objected to in its Reply and elsewhere have been excused, repaired, deemed inconsequential, or found to be without merit. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's requests to strike Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application and declines to impose sanctions, monetary or otherwise.
2. Evidentiary Objections
Defendant has lodged numerous evidentiary objections to which Plaintiff has replied in part. (See Notice of Errata Re: Objs. to & Mot. to Strike Teren Decl. ("Mot. to Strike Teren Decl."), ECF No. 45; Objs. to & Mot. to Strike Brown Decl. ("Mot. to Strike Brown Decl."), ECF No. 47; Pl.'s Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. Ex Parte Appl. for Relief ("Appl. for Relief"), ECF No. 51; Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Appl. for Relief ("Opp'n to Appl. for Relief"), ECF No. 53.)
When parties assert that facts are or cannot be genuinely disputed, Federal Rule 56 allows their opponents [*21]  to object if the material they cite in support of their contention "cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). At the summary judgment stage, an admissibility objection of this sort functions much as an objection does at trial. Id. The burden is on the proponent of the assertion to show that the material cited is admissible as presented "or explain the admissible form that is anticipated." Id.
The following analysis contains rulings on Defendant's objections. However, in the interest of the efficiency, some categories of objections will be ruled upon generally. See Capitol Records, LLC v. BlueBeat, Inc., 765 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (quotation omitted) (noting that on motions with voluminous objections it is often "unnecessary and impractical for a court to methodically scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of each argument raised").
a. Attorney-Client Privilege
In its Motion to Strike Teren Declaration, Defendant argues that portions of Plaintiff's counsel's declaration impermissibly rely on privileged information inadvertently disclosed during discovery. (Mot. to Strike Teren Decl. 1-3.) California law governs privilege matters in diversity litigation. See Star Editorial, Inc. v. United States District Court for the Central District of California (Dangerfield), 7 F.3d 856, 859 (9th Cir. 1993). In California, privileges are narrowly construed because [*22]  their invocation tends to impair the search for the truth. See McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Superior Court, 115 Cal. App. 4th 1236 (2004). Moreover, the party claiming privilege bears the burden of establishing that the evidence it seeks to suppress falls within the terms of an applicable statute, which in this case is California Evidence Code section 952. Thus, in a motion to "claw back" documents, the party claiming inadvertent disclosure bears the initial burden of demonstrating that the documents at issue are privileged under Section 952.
Section 952 provides that
confidential communication between client and lawyer means information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which, so far as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted, and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.
Cal. Evid. Code § 952.
The portion of the Teren Declaration at issue is an email between Brian Cheske, JLL's non-attorney employee, and James Jobson, [*23]  an non-attorney employee of JLL's workers compensation carrier, Hartford. This email was carbon copied to Laura Garofalo, JLL's in-house counsel, along with an attachment not at issue. (Mot. to Strike Teren Decl. 1-3; Teren Decl., Ex. D.) That email reads as follows:
Hi James, Please give us a current update on Eric Brown; Is there an expected return to work date? Will this be full duty? If not, what are his current restrictions? Thank you.
(Teren Decl. in Sup. of Plaintiff's Ex Parte Appl. Ex J, ECF No. 51.)
The Court acknowledges that, despite appearances, the email may have had some relevance to the consultation between Cheske and Garofalo, and therefore may have been related to Garofalo's rendering of legal advice. However, Defendant has not established that the communication between the three employees was confidential or in furtherance of a legal consultation. Indeed, there is a clear business purpose for Cheske's email independent of Defendant's averred consultation. Moreover, Jobson did not copy Garofalo when he replied and his reply mirrors the stated business purpose. (Decl. David Z. Feingold in Supp. of Def.'s Opp'n to Relief ("Feingold Decl."), Ex. G ¶ 1.) This strongly implies [*24]  that Jobson, at the very least least, did not believe he was part of a confidential legal communication.
What more, courts in this circuit have repeatedly looked askance at assertions of privilege, even those based on the carbon copying outside counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Chevron Texaco Corp., 241 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1075 (N.D. Cal .2002) ("The mere fact that outside counsel was copied with the e-mail will not shield communications not made for the purpose of securing legal advice"); cf. Fru-Con Constr. Corp. v. Sacramento Mun. Util. Dist., No. S-05-0583 LKK GGH, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59066, 2006 WL 2255538, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2006) (noting that if documents carbon copied or forwarded to an attorney are created for routine business purposes, by non-attorneys, they likewise "do not fall within the purview of the work product privilege").
Accordingly, the Court finds that no privilege applies to any component of Exhibit D to the Teren Declaration because the sole component in question was not confidential.
i. Rule 26(b)(5)(B)
Defendant places a great deal of emphasis on Plaintiff's alleged violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B) ("Rule 26(b)(5)(B)"), urging the Court preclude Plaintiff from using the information at summary judgement "or at all," regardless of its privilege determination. (Mot. to Strike Teren Decl. 2-3.)
Rule 26(b)(5)(B) governs the procedure involved for when "information produced in discovery is subject to a claim of privilege." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(B). It states,
If information produced [*25]  in discovery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the party making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(B).
Reviewing the arguments on both sides, it is clear that Plaintiff has technically violated the procedural rule. However, three factors weigh against imposing the sanctions or penalties. First and foremost, the Court in no way relies in its ruling on the minute portion Exhibit D upon which Defendant's privilege claim is based. Second, as previously mentioned, the Court finds that the material in question is not privileged under California law. Third, the circumstances which Plaintiff and Defendant describe, the [*26]  emails correspondence both parties have produced, and the remedies Plaintiff proposes—including Plaintiff's offer to produce the documents in question to the Court under seal, as provided for in the rule—all indicate that this violation was neither intentional nor blatant. (See Mot. to Strike Teren Decl., Appl. for Relief, Opp. to Relief.)
The Court DENIES Defendant's requests for penalties and sanctions.
b. Lack of Foundation/Personal Knowledge/Failure to Authenticate
Defendant appears to be quite fond of Federal Rule of Evidence 602, which states that "[a] witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness's own testimony. This rule does not apply to a witness's expert testimony under Rule 703." Fed. R. Evid. 602. The Court addresses each of Defendant's challenges in turn.
i. Brown Declaration
Defendant objects to a number of statements in Plaintiff's declaration on the grounds that they are unsupported by other evidence demonstrating personal knowledge. (See Objs. to Brown Decl). However, a witness's own testimony concerning events he participated in and aspects of his workplace [*27]  that he oversees—including testimony contained in declarations—is sufficiently grounded in personal knowledge. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A), (B); see also In re Kaypro, 218 F.3d 1070, 1075 (9th Cir. 2000) ("Personal knowledge may be inferred from a declarant's position.") Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES the aforementioned objections.
ii. Reporter's Certifications
Ordinarily, the absence of a reporters certification would result in exclusion of a deposition. See Orr v. Bank of America, NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 775 (9th Cir. 2002). Where the opposing party has already authenticated the same deposition, however, the requirement of authenticity is satisfied. See id. at 776. Defendant has already authenticated and relied upon all objected to depositions and exhibits excepting the deposition of Ed Lane. What more, the Court does not rely upon the Lane Deposition in its ruling. Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's objections to all but the deposition of Ed Lane and OVERRULES as moot Defendant's objections to Ed Lane's deposition.
Iiii. Plaintiff's Exhibits "F" and "I"
Finally, Defendant objects to paragraph seven of Plaintiff's Teren Declaration and the documents it references, labeled exhibit "F." (Objs. Teren Decl. ¶ 6.) Paragraph seven reads, in part, "Attached as Exhibit 'F' are true and correct copies of the JLL documents, reflecting [*28]  Liberty Mutual correspondence about Plaintiff's FMLA leave, which McCorry confirmed she had never seen before the deposition and confirmed that she did not know anything about the documents." (Teren Decl. ¶ 7.) If the deposed witness lacks personal knowledge to authenticate the documents and no other witness is referred to or proffered who might authenticate them, then the defendant is correct that the authenticity standard has not yet been met.
Defendant likewise objects to paragraph ten of the Teren Declaration and the attached SSA denial letter, labeled exhibit "I", which Plaintiff allegedly received on November 15, 2015. (Objs. Teren Decl. ¶ 10.) Specifically, Defendant argues that "Ms. Teren . . . has no foundation to declare the authenticity of Exhibit I, or to state what the SSA found or why it denied Brown benefits." Id. Without a seal, signature, or certification, Plaintiff's SSA denial letter is not self authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 902. Consequently, absent "evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what [Plaintiff] claims it is" the authenticity standard has not yet been met here either. Fed. R. Evid. 902(a).
The Ninth Circuit, however, has held that "to survive summary judgment, a party [*29]  does not necessarily have to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial." Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (9th Cir.2003). So long as the evidence "may be presented in an admissible form at trial, a court may still consider that evidence." Id. at 1037. In other words, if the defect is curable, the Court may look past temporary deficiencies. Morever, as a general principle, courts in this circuit "treat the opposing party's papers more indulgently than the moving party's papers." Lew v. Kona Hosp., 754 F.2d 1420, 1423 (9th Cir.1985).
Here, it is easy to envision witnesses who could testify at trial as to the authenticity of these documents. Moreover, the Court sees no indicia of inauthenticity, instead finding the opposite. For example, the claim reference numbers, document reference numbers, phone numbers, and addresses contained in the SSA denial letter lend it significant credibility to be considered at the summary judgment stage.
Accordingly, for the purposes of ruling on the instant Motion, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's objections to paragraphs seven and ten of Plaintiff's Teren Declaration and exhibits "F" and "I".
c. Hearsay
Defendant also raises a not insubstantial number of hearsay objections. Hearsay is any out-of-court statement offered into evidence to prove the truth [*30]  of the matter asserted. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). It is generally inadmissible unless it meets the definition of non-hearsay or falls under an exception. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d), 802, 803, 804.
i. The Secondhand Comments of Operating Engineers
Defendant objects to many of the secondhand statements Plaintiff reports in his deposition on the grounds that they are impermissible hearsay and double hearsay to which no "admission of party opponent exception" applies. (Mot. 10-11.) The Court acknowledges that this objection applies broadly to all statements that Plaintiff attests were made to him by other operating engineers. However, the inapplicability of Defendant's noted hearsay exception is not dispositive in this case.
First, William Quiroz and Karen Williams have been deposed in this action. Any statements they made directly concerning activities they witnessed or participated in are therefore not hearsay and not subject to exclusion on hearsay grounds.
Second, Plaintiff's deposition testimony about other operating engineers' assertions would be admissible as non-hearsay so long as it was not submitted as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). In the instant case, the allegation that Plaintiff's coworkers made these assertions [*31]  to Plaintiff is relevant in and of itself. For example, suppose Mark Morehouse's assertions about Quiroz's racial slurs were utterly false. An argument could be made that, by sharing such fabricated statements, Morehouse was himself harassing Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's aforementioned hearsay objections. The Court does not consider these statements for the truth of what is asserted therein, but only as evidence that Plaintiff's co-workers made the assertions he described.
ii. Emails
Defendant also objects to two e-mail chains between Cordero and Plaintiff and the previously discussed e-mail chain Cheske, Jobson, and Garofalo. (Objs. Teren Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13.) "[U]nder Rule 801(d)(2)(D), a statement made by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship, is non-hearsay." Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 454 F. Supp. 2d 966, 973 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)). Likewise, if content created by other individuals is incorporated into an email, "the content is also admissible non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(B)." Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Lozen Intern., LLC, 285 F.3d 808, 821 (9th Cir. 2002).
Here, Cordero and Cheske were Defendant's employees. Likewise, Defendant has previously adopted Jobson its agent. (Feingold Decl., Ex. G ¶ 1.) Moreover, all of their relevant [*32]  statements concern Plaintiff's leave, a matter well withing the scope of their employment. (Teren Decl., Exs. D, K.) Consequently, these statements are non-hearsay. What more, Plaintiff's questions and non-statements also fall outside the definition of hearsay. Additionally, the statements at issue are important in the present case, not for the truth of the matters they assert but for the fact of their assertion.
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's hearsay objections regarding Exhibits D and K.
iii. EEOC Forms
Defendant also objects to copies of forms Plaintiff provided the EEOC. (Objs. Teren Decl. ¶ 11; Teren Decl., Ex. J.) Again, the Court does not rely on Plaintiff's statements in this document for the truth of the matter asserted therein, but only for the fact that statements were written. Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's hearsay objections regarding Exhibit J.
iv. Cordero's Statements
Defendant objects to several of Plaintiff's statements concerning assurances or representations Cordero made to him about the procedure for reporting ethics violations and the scope of Cordero's own workplace authority. (Objs. Brown Decl. ¶¶ 9, 20.) As with his statements in the emails [*33]  discussed above, Cordero was an employee of JLL at the time he allegedly uttered these statements and they concern matters within the scope of his employment. (Brown Decl. ¶¶ 7, 16.) Accordingly, the statements are non-hearsay, and the Court OVERRULES Defendant's objections.
v. Paragraphs Describing Documents
Defendant likewise objects on hearsay grounds to several paragraphs in both the Teren and Brown Declarations, which refer to or describe attached documents. (Objs. Teren Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, 17; Objs. Brown Decl. ¶¶ 4, 9, 16, 20.) To the extent the declarant in each paragraph reasserts, restates, or characterizes portions of the documents referenced, the Court relies on the documents themselves and not on Plaintiff or his counsel's characterizations of statements in those documents. Where the documents referenced are not part of the record, (see, e.g., Brown Decl. ¶ 4), the court disregards the statements in their entirety. Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's aforementioned objections.
D. Contradicted by Testimony
Defendant objects that paragraphs 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 17 of the Brown Declaration are contradicted by earlier sworn testimony. (Objs. Brown Decl. ¶¶ 9, 13, 14, 16 [*34]  20.) "The general rule in the Ninth Circuit is that a party cannot create an issue of fact by an affidavit contradicting his prior deposition testimony." Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266 (9th Cir. 1991). However, a party's deposition testimony must clearly and unambiguously justify striking the objected to affidavit. See Van Asdale v. Int'l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2009). Here, with the exception of paragraph 11, the Court finds that Plaintiff's deposition testimony does not clearly and unambiguously contradict his current declaration testimony. With respect Plaintiff's assertion that he was not contacted by JLL concerning his return to work after Cordero's "100% physically able" email, the Court agrees that this statement is directly contradicted by Plaintiff's testimony concerning Laura McCorry's letter. (Brown Dep. 307:10-308:20). The Court does not rely on this testimony in its ruling, however.
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant's objections to paragraphs 7, 12, 14, 16, and 17 of the Brown Declaration, and OVERRULES as moot Defendant's objections to paragraph 11.
E. Irrelevant, Speculative, Argumentative, Conclusory, and Mischaracterized Statements
"Objections to evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant, speculative, and/or argumentative, or that it constitutes an [*35]  improper legal conclusion are all duplicative of the summary judgment standard itself and are thus redundant and unnecessary" for a court to consider when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Stonefire Grill, Inc. v. FGF Brands, Inc., 987 F. Supp. 2d 1023, 1033 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Burch v. Regents of Univ. of California, 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (E.D. Cal. 2006)). Likewise, objections aimed at conclusory statements, mischaracterizations, or purported misstatements of evidence are not considered "because such objections should be aimed at the evidence supporting those statements." Id. Accordingly, the Court declines to rule on any of these objections.
III. Analysis
Having disposed of the myriad evidentiary issues, the Court now addresses the merits of Defendant's Motion.
A. Fair Employment and Housing Act Claims
In his Compaint, Plaintiff alleges seven violations of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12900 et seq. The stated purpose of FEHA is "to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of race . . . color . . . physical disability . . . [or] medical condition" Cal. Gov't Code § 12920. Declaring this policy "fundamental," the California Supreme Court and the California Legislature have directed that FEHA "be construed liberally so as to accomplish its purposes." Brown v. Superior Court, 37 Cal. 3d 477, 486-87, 208 Cal. Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272 (1984) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12993).
In this regard, FEHA and Title VII [*36]  of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 are identical in their "antidiscriminatory objectives" and "overriding public policy purposes." Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 606, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989); see also Alameda v. Fair Emp't & Hous. Comm'n, 153 Cal. App. 3d 499, 504, 200 Cal. Rptr. 381 (1984). Accordingly, the California Supreme Court has observed that while they is not bound or limited by federal law when interpreting FEHA, see Johnson v. Loma Linda, 24 Cal.4th 61, 73, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 316, 5 P.3d 874 (2000), "California courts consistently look to Title VII for guidance in interpreting FEHA" when there are no California reported decisions available addressing specific issues, Kohler v. Inter-Tel Techs., 244 F.3d 1167, 1172 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 121, 129, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999).
1. Harassment Claim
In his first cause of action, Plaintiff alleges that JLL violated FEHA's prohibition against racially motivated harassment.5 (Compl. ¶¶ 20-26.) "One form of employment discrimination is harassment on the basis of race or national origin." Aguilar, 21 Cal. 4th at 129. "[FEHA] explicitly prohibits an employer from harassing an employee on the basis of race, sex or ethnicity." Dee v. Vintage Petroleum, Inc., 106 Cal. App. 4th 30, 35, 129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 923 (2003), as modified on denial of reh'g (Mar. 5, 2003) (internal citations omitted). To be actionable under FEHA, harassment "must be sufficiently severe or pervasive [1] to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment" and (2) to create an environment that is both objectively and subjectively abusive. Aguilar, 21 Cal. 4th at 138-39 (adopting the Supreme Court's standard for evaluating sexual [*37]  harassment claims under Title VII as the standard for evaluating all harassment claims under the FEHA).
a. Plaintiff Has Made Out a Prima Facie Case
Defendant adduces a house-of-cards style argument that Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for hostile work environment harassment. (Mot. 14-17.) Specifically, Defendant asserts that because Plaintiff's harassment charges must be based on actions taken "because of race," the Court must disregard all race-neutral derogatory comments. Likewise, Defendant insists that the Court should disregard any of Plaintiff's alleged detrimental personnel management actions because they fall outside the definition of harassment, and are more properly categorized as "discriminatory." Accordingly, Defendant contends that the Court in evaluating Plaintiff's harassment claim should consider only the racial slurs directed at Plaintiff over the course of several years. Defendant thus argues that, viewed in isolation, these sporadic racial epithets "do not meet the severe and pervasive standard" required to make out a prima facie harassment case.
Unfortunately for Defendant, its house of cards does not stand. First, Defendant's contention that the [*38]  Court should "carve out" all race-neutral comments would result in reversible error. The California Supreme Court has held that, in harassment cases, "[t]he working environment must be evaluated in light of the totality of the circumstances." Miller v. Dep't of Corr., 36 Cal. 4th 446, 462, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77, 87 (2005). These circumstances may include "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1042, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). Accordingly, California courts have often considered facially race-neutral conduct when evaluating harassment claims brought pursuant to FEHA. See, e.g., Dee, 106 Cal. App. 4th at 37 (reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment because "[defendant's] ethnic slur combined with other evidence established a triable issue of fact on the issue of a hostile work environment").
Second, while Defendant is correct that "commonly necessary personnel management actions . . . do not come within the meaning of harassment," this does not mean that discriminatory personnel actions should be disregarded. Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 645-646, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998). Indeed, the opposite is true, and "in analyzing the sufficiency of evidence in support of a harassment claim, there is no [*39]  basis for excluding evidence of biased personnel management actions so long as that evidence is relevant to prove the communication of a hostile message." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 708, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 773, 219 P.3d 749 (2009), as modified (Feb. 10, 2010).
Third, while it is true that "courts have held an employee generally cannot recover for harassment that is occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial," the exception only arises where the harassment alleged is sufficiently infrequent or minimal. Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Prods., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 283, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006). Consequently, "there is neither a threshold 'magic number' of harassing incidents that gives rise. . . to liability. . . nor a number of incidents below which a plaintiff fails as a matter of law to state a claim." Smith v. Staples Contract & Commercial, Inc., No. CV 14-07836-AB ASX, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175576, 2014 WL 7333421, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2014) (citing Dee, 106 Cal. App. 4th at 36). Instead, "[t]he required level of severity or seriousness varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct." Mokler v. Cty. of Orange, 157 Cal. App. 4th 121, 142, 68 Cal. Rptr. 3d 568 (2007) (citing Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 256 F.3d 864, 872 (9th Cir. 2001)); McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir. 2004). The pertinent question is therefore whether, considering all the circumstances, a defendant's acts would lead a reasonable person "belonging to the racial or ethnic group of the Plaintiff" to perceive the workplace as hostile or abusive. Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 264, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296, 314 (2009); accord Lyle, 38 Cal.4th 284.
Here, Plaintiff testified during his deposition that he felt constantly harassed at work. (See generally Brown Dep.) Likewise, Defendant does not dispute [*40]  that Plaintiff's supervisor, Cordero, insulted Plaintiff directly on a number of occasions, calling Plaintiff a "fucking nigger," "lazy," and "fat" at various points over the course of his employment. (Def's Facts ¶¶ 64, 68, 72.) It is also undisputed that Plaintiff's coworker, Quiroz, called Plaintiff a "nigger" at least twice. (Def.'s Facts ¶ 84.) Moreover, two operating engineers, Morehouse and Hall, reported to Plaintiff that Cordero, Quiroz, and Williams referred to Plaintiff using of the word "nigger" and other derogatory language several times outside of his presence.6 (Def's Facts ¶¶ 67, 74, 79, 86.) In addition to not disputed several incidents in which Plaintiff was verbally abused, Defendant does not dispute that Cordero made several decisions that affected Plaintiff negatively, including revoking Plaintiff's over-scale pay, denying him on-call pay, instructing contractors to make his work space as small as possible, denying Plaintiff bathroom privileges, instructing other employees to "dig up dirt" on Plaintiff, and ultimately refusing to allow Plaintiff to return to work unless he was 100% restriction free. (Def's Facts ¶¶ 43, 45, 61, 66, 69-71, 73.)
Thus, while Defendant [*41]  is correct that the isolated use of racial epithets by coworkers is insufficient to create a hostile work environment as a matter of law,7 a trier of fact, considering the totality of the circumstances, is likely to conclude that the racial epithets in this case are outrageous, pervasive, and is conduct that should not be tolerated in any civilized working environment. A supervisor's use of an extreme racial epithet, such as the use of the "N" word, presents a clearly distinguishable situation from those presented in cases cited by Defendant.8
A reasonable trier of fact, therefore, could conclude that JLL objectively and subjectively created a hostile work environment for Plaintiff. See Dee, 106 Cal. App. 4th at 33-37.9 Accordingly, Plaintiff has adduced more than enough evidence to make out a prima facie case for harassment in violation of FEHA, rendering summary judgment inappropriate on this basis.
b. Plaintiff's Race Harassment Claim Is Not Time-Barred
Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's race harassment claim is time-barred because the continuing violations doctrine does not apply and Plaintiff cannot point to a single act that contributed to the hostile work environment [*42]  within the applicable limitations period.
In the hostile work environment context, a continuing violation occurs if the employer's unlawful actions are "(1) sufficiently similar in kind—recognizing. . . . that similar kinds of unlawful employer conduct. . . may take a number of different forms; (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; and (3) [ ] have not acquired a degree of permanence." Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 90, 29 P.3d 175 (2001). In this context, a "degree of permanence" means that "an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts. . . to end harassment will be futile." Id. If there is a triable issue as to each of these elements, then the Court cannot conclude, at summary judgment, that the doctrine is inapplicable as a matter of law. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1061, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005).
There are triable issues of material fact as to whether the continuing violation doctrine applies to Cordero's bathroom prohibition. It is undisputed that Cordero prohibited Plaintiff from using the restroom in their shared office in 2011. (Def.'s Facts ¶ 71.) Plaintiff attests that other employees, contractors, and visitors were permitted its use the restroom and that he was the only person subject to this prohibition, which was extended [*43]  until Plaintiff went on medical leave in November of 2013. (Brown Dep. 93; Brown Decl. ¶ 6.) The denial of restroom facility access is a form of racial prejudice reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. See, e.g., Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 394, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978) (Marshall, J. concurring) (categorizing Jim Crow laws, bathroom segregation included, as the unfortunate "legacy of years of slavery and years of second-class citizenship"); United States v. Baird, 85 F.3d 450, 454-55 (9th Cir. 1996) (categorizing the segregation of public accommodations—including bathrooms—as a "[g]reat evil" that established "public badges of inferiority" for the excluded groups and marked them as "of lower status"). Accordingly, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Cordero's bathroom apartheid directive was sufficiently similar in kind to the antecedent prejudicial conduct Plaintiff has alleged. A prohibition that affects an employee's workplace restroom habits necessarily comes in to play on a regular basis. Considered in conjunction with the other alleged conduct, a reasonable trier of fact could therefore conclude that Defendant's unlawful actions occurred with reasonable frequency. What more, given the remaining questions surrounding the nature, motivation, and severity of the various forms of unlawful conduct [*44]  alleged, the Court considers the question of whether a reasonable employee would understand the futility of any further efforts to end harassment properly within the province of the jury.
California courts have held that "the continuing violation doctrine comes into play when an employee raises a claim based on conduct that occurred in part outside the limitations period." Richards, 26 Cal.4th at 812. The doctrine requires that at least one of the acts which collectively comprise a hostile work environment occur within the limitations period. Reszetylo v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 84 Fed. App'x 822, 824 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 116-18, 122 S.Ct. 2061 (2002). However, provided one or more acts are timely and that "all the elements of the continuing violation doctrine are met (i.e., if a triable issue exists as to each element), the harassment should be viewed as a single, actionable course of conduct." Harris v. City of Fresno, 625 F. Supp. 2d 983, 1023-24 (E.D. Cal. 2009) (citing Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 802). Moreover, FEHA's statute of limitations establishes a one-year period from the date of the "unlawful practice" in which a wronged employee may bring suit. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12960. It likewise extends this period by 90 days if an aggrieved person learns of the unlawful practice after the initial year has expired. Id.
Here, Plaintiff filled out his EEOC intake questionnaire on July 1, 2014, filed formal discrimination charges [*45]  with the EEOC on August 21, 2014, and filed a formal complaint with the DFEH on October 10, 2014. (EEOC Intake Questionnaire; Def.'s Facts ¶ 58; Brown Dep. Ex. 5.) While the parties dispute from which of these dates the limitations period should run, (see Mot. 7-8; Opp'n 5), any violation occurring after October 10, 2013 would satisfy all possible limitations periods. As previously noted, there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Cordero's bathroom prohibition extended until November of 2013. Thus, a genuine issue of fact bearing on whether Plaintiff's cause of action is time barred remains.
Accordingly, the Court finds summary judgment to be inappropriate on this ground.
c. The Doctrine of Avoidable Consequences Does Not Bar Recovery
Relying on State Department of Health Services v. Superior Court, 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1042, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441, 79 P.3d 556 (2003) ("State Dept."), Defendant argues that the "doctrine of avoidable consequences" serves as an affirmative defense that bars Plaintiff from recovering under this FEHA cause of action. According to Defendant, because Plaintiff understood that he should report harassment to JLL's human resources department or ethics hotline but failed to do so, Plaintiff cannot recover.
Defendant is sorely mistaken. In State Dept., the California Supreme Court [*46]  "emphasize[d] that the affirmative defense of avoidable consequences "affects damages, not liability." 31 Cal.4th at 1045. Moreover, the Court limited the defense's applicability to FEHA sexual harassment claims where supervisors perpetrated harassing acts. See id. at 1042. When the harassing acts are perpetrated by non-supervisor employees, the defense is unavailable. See id.; see also Alvarado, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9973, 2006 WL 644875, at *8 ("However, the fact that [the plaintiff] did not complain of harassment of which managers allegedly knew and participated in, does not shield [the defendant] from liability"). Here, Plaintiffs race harassment claim includes allegations of harassment by non-supervisors, and in any event the doctrine would not shield Defendant from liability. The Court accordingly finds that the doctrine of avoidable consequences does not bar Plaintiff's recovery.
Defendant's arguments with respect to Plaintiff's race harassment claim in violation of FEHA each fail. The Court accordingly DENIES summary judgment as to this cause of action.
2. Discrimination Claim
Plaintiff alleges in his second cause of action that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his race and his disability in violation of FEHA. (Compl. ¶¶ 11-13, 27-34.) Under FEHA, [*47]  it is unlawful for an employer, "because of race, . . . [or] physical disability . . . to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). An employee can prove his FEHA claim of employment discrimination either by direct or circumstantial evidence. DeJung v. Super. Ct., 169 Cal. App. 4th 533, 549, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 99 (2008).
"Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption. Comments demonstrating discriminatory animus may be found to be direct evidence if there is evidence of a causal relationship between the comments and the adverse job action at issue." Id. at 550. "[V]ery little" direct evidence of discriminatory animus is required to succeed on a FEHA claim of employment discrimination. Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998). Showing that "a significant participant in an employment decision exhibited discriminatory animus is enough to raise an inference that the employment decision itself was discriminatory, even absent evidence that others in the process harbored such animus." DeJung, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 551.
Where a plaintiff instead relies on circumstantial evidence, California courts adopt a three-part burden-shifting test, commonly referred to as the "McDonnell Douglas test." See Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)) (adopting pertinent federal [*48]  precedent in interpreting FEHA). Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff generally must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Then, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a "legitimate business purpose" behind the adverse employment action. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's reasons are pretextual, "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Raad v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1196 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.
In the summary judgment context, several California courts have suggested that the burden imposed by the McDonnell Douglas test must be reversed "because a plaintiff opposing summary judgment need not demonstrate triable issues until the moving defendant has made an initial no-merit show[ing]." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356-57 (collecting cases). Under this view, the defendant bears the initial burden to show either that the plaintiff cannot establish one of the elements of its prima facie claim or that there [*49]  is a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See Dep't of Fair Em't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011). If the defendant meets this burden, the defendant will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff demonstrates that the employer's explanation is pretextual. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has "repeatedly cautioned" that "it should not take much for a plaintiff in a discrimination case to overcome a summary judgment motion." Wright v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 609 Fed. App'x 918, 922 (9th Cir. 2015). "This is because the ultimate question is one that can be resolved through a searching inquiry—one that is most appropriately conducted by a factfinder, upon a full record." Id.
a. Race Discrimination
Under FEHA, a race discrimination claim requires plaintiffs to show they (1) are members of a protected class; (2) were performing competently in the positions they held; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that circumstances other than the adverse employment action itself suggest a discriminatory motive. See Kelly v. Stamps.com Inc., 135 Cal. App. 4th 1088, 1098, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240 (2005). In the context of a motion for summary judgment, the burden is on Defendant to show either that Plaintiff cannot establish one of these elements or that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for its refusal to allow Plaintiff's to remain on leave.
Defendant argues that none [*50]  of Plaintiff's alleged adverse employment actions "raise a genuine issue of material fact." (Mot. 15.) Defendant reasons this is so because (1) several of the alleged actions are time barred; (2) at least two of the actions alleged do not qualify as adverse employment actions; and (3) no triable issue of pretext exists regarding Defendant's decision to place Plaintiff on leave. (Mot. Memo 15-17.) The Court examines each of these arguments in turn.
i. Plaintiff's Claim Is Not Time-Barred
First, as previously mentioned, conduct that occurred after October 10, 2013 satisfies all possible FEHA limitations periods. See Section III(A)(1)(b), supra. In the present case, Plaintiff alleges three discriminatory employment actions occurred: (1) Cordero refused to allow him to return from leave, (Compl. ¶¶ 11-12); (2) Cordero "blocked plaintiff from promotional opportunities," (Compl. ¶ 11); (3) Cordero refused "any and all accommodation," (Compl. ¶ 12).10 It is undisputed that, between November 2013 and February 2014, Plaintiff made several attempts to return from leave and several inquiries concerning reasonable accommodations. (See First Email Exch., Second Email Exch.) It is likewise undisputed [*51]  that Cordero prohibited Plaintiff from returning unless he could certify that he required no accommodation. (See First Email Exch., Second Email Exch.) Accordingly, at least these two employment actions are not time-barred.11
ii. Plaintiff Has Demonstrated a Genuine Dispute As to Whether Adverse Employment Actions Occurred
Second, both of the actions discussed immediately above qualify as adverse employment actions because they materially affected the terms and conditions of Plaintiff's employment. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal.4th at 1054-55; Pinero v. Specialty Restaurants Corp., 130 Cal. App. 4th 635, 639-42, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 348 (2005) (discussing adverse employment actions at length). Accordingly, at least these two employment actions—refusing to allow Plaintiff to return from leave and refusing to provide Plaintiff any accommodations—support Plaintiff's race discrimination claim.
iii. Plaintiff Has Raised a Triable Issue Regarding Pretext
Defendant finally argues that it had a legitimate reason for placing Plaintiff on leave and for refusing to accommodate him or allow his return, because "as far as [JLL] knew, his restrictions were so severe there was no way to modify the ACE job to allow for light duty." (Mot. 17.) This proffered reason and the evidence supplied by Defendant in support thereof are sufficient to shift [*52]  the burden to Plaintiff to prove that Defendant's averred non-discriminatory reason was merely a pretext.
"[A] plaintiff can prove pretext in two ways: (1) indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable, or (2) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more likely motivated the employer." Chuang v. Univ. of California Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225 F.3d 1115, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000). Likewise, "these two approaches are not exclusive; a combination of the two kinds of evidence may in some cases serve to establish pretext so as to make summary judgment improper." Id. A "plaintiff's burden to raise a triable issue of pretext is hardly an onerous one." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Here, Plaintiff points to the conduct underlying his racial harassment claim—specifically Cordero's racial slurs, insults, and other adverse employment related decisions—as both direct and indirect evidence of pretext. (Opp'n 8.) Much of the reprehensible conduct Plaintiff refers to is undisputed in this case. It is likewise undisputed that Cordero was a significant participant in the two alleged adverse employment actions that form the foundation of Plaintiff's second cause of [*53]  action. (Def.'s Facts ¶¶ 31-34, 42-45.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has offered sufficient specific and substantial facts to raise a triable issue of pretext.
Because Defendant has failed to point to the absence of a genuine dispute regarding elements of Plaintiff's race discrimination claim, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to this cause of action.
b. Disability Discrimination
"To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA, Plaintiff must show that she (1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations[;] and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Wills v. Super. Ct., 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011). The burden is placed on the defendant to show either that the palintiff cannot establish one of these elements or that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for its refusal to allow Plaintiff's to remain on leave.
i. Defendant Has Failed to Meet Its Burden of Pointing to Essential Job Functions
Defendant initially argues that Plaintiff cannot show that he could perform the essential functions of his job. (Mot. 22.) [*54]  Plaintiff correctly responds that Defendant has improperly flipped the burden, and that the employer bears the initial burden of identifying essential functions when it challenges a plaintiff's claim on the basis that he cannot perform them. See Tejeda v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 357 Fed. App'x 805, 806-07 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 991 (2007)). This burden requires more than a simple recitation or bare declaration that certain functions are fundamental. See Id. (denying the defendants motion for summary judgment because it failed to show why "climbing ladders and/or stairs" was essential to the Plaintiff's position); cf. Wright v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 609 Fed. App'x 918, 920 (9th Cir. 2015) ("An employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into a job function, let alone an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description") (quotation marks omitted)).
Here, Defendant notes that its written job description for the ACE position and the CBA between the union and Defendant list a number of responsibilities. (Mot. 18-19; Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 8, 97; Teren Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant likewise indicates that Plaintiff has described his typical work day, both in his deposition and in his application for disability benefits. (Mot. 18-19; Brown Dep. at 273-74; Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 49-53; Def. Ex. 19.) Defendant also [*55]  correctly points out that the evidence it references is certainly the sort of evidence that FEHA indicates may support an inference that particular duties are essential. (Mot. 19 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2))).
However, Defendant does not explicitly label as "essential" any of duties it references. At best, Defendant's argument equates to an assertion that all of the responsibilities listed are essential. Even if this were Defendant's intention, such an argument would fail to demonstrate how the evidence it cites confirm so general a designation. Without identifying specific job functions, Plaintiff would have no way of refuting Defendant's claim that his restrictions prohibited him from carrying out essential duties with or without accommodation. Accordingly, Defendant has not met its initial burden of identifying essential job functions.
ii. Defendant Has Failed to Demonstrate that Plaintiff Cannot Prove Disability Discrimination Animus
Defendant next argues that Plaintiff cannot prove he was subject to any adverse employment action "because of" his disability. (Mot. 22.) The only support Defendant offers for this argument is its assertion that Plaintiff "was placed on leave, because he asked for leave [*56]  and because his job could not be modified to meet his restrictions." (Mot. 22) (emphasis in the original).
These bare assertions are hardly sufficient to satisfy Defendant's burden as to this issue. First, neither assertion is bolstered by any supporting evidence. Second, Plaintiff does not allege that the initiation of his leave was discriminatory, but rather that Defendant's refusal to allow his return and unwillingness to reasonably accommodate his disability were done with discriminatory intent. (Compl. ¶¶ 11-12.) Thus, whether or not Plaintiff was placed on leave because "he asked" for it is irrelevant. Third, the question of whether Plaintiff's job could be modified to meet his restrictions is necessarily dependent on a determination of the ACE position's essential functions, which this Court has already indicated has not been established by Defendant, and may well require a determination by the trier off act. Accordingly, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot prove this element of his disability discrimination claim.12
iii. Judicial Estoppel Does Not Bar Plaintiff's Claims
Defendant argues next that the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars several of Plaintiff's [*57]  claims, including his disability discrimination claim. (Mot. 9.) Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff represented himself as completely incapacitated and conceded that he could not work at all. (Mot. 18; Reply 3-4, ECF No. 41.) Defendant likewise contends that Plaintiff is judicially estopped from contradicting this position and is therefore precluded from making out a prima facie case. (Mot. 18; Reply 3-4.)
Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine "invoked by the court to protect the integrity of the judicial process," Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996), and applied at the Court's discretion, see Ah Quin v. Cty. of Kauai Dep't of Transp., 733 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir. 2013). Federal courts apply the doctrine according to federal law. See Johnson v. Oregon, 141 F.3d 1361, 1369 (9th Cir. 1998); Rissetto v. Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 343, 94 F.3d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1996).13 Federal law provides that:
Several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position . . . . A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.
Zedner v. United States, 547 U.S. 489, 504, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749 (2006) (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). "A [*58]  party seeking to defeat summary judgment on judicial estoppel grounds must sufficiently explain a prior judicial position that is inconsistent with an essential element of its current claim." See, e.g., Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (noting that a party must provide a sufficient explanation regarding inconsistent positions to defeat summary judgment). Because it is a harsh sanction, courts limit its application to "egregious circumstances." Bourg v. Aetna Inc., 628 Fed. App'x 489, 490 (9th Cir. 2015); Ryan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co., 81 F.3d 355, 365 (3d Cir. 1996).
Here, none of these considerations support the application of judicial estoppel. First, Plaintiff's assertions in his SSA application do not equate to a representation that he could "not work at all." Instead, the Court finds them to be more akin to a representation that he could not return to his previous daily routine. (SSA Appl.) Such a representation is not wholly inconsistent with his current position—that he could have worked with reasonable accommodation—unless all of his daily activities were essential functions not amenable to accommodation. As previously noted, the burden of establishing which of the ACE position's functions is essential rests with Defendant, and that Defendant has failed to meet this burden. Additionally, Plaintiff has offered a [*59]  number of explanations as to why his daily activities had little or no relation to his position's actual responsibilities, including that Corder (1) usurped Plaintiff's supervisory duties, (Brown Decl. ¶ 6); (2) reassigned Plaintiff's desk-oriented duties to a subordinate, (Brown Decl. ¶ 14); and (3) required Plaintiff to walk rounds when other methods of discharging his duties were equally viable, (Brown Dep. at 155-162). Making all inferences in favor of Plaintiff, as the Court must when adjudicating a summary judgment motion, this factor weighs against the application of judicial estoppel.
Moreover, Plaintiff was unsuccessful in asserting the position in question before the SSA. (See SSA Denial Letter). Indeed the SSA concluded that while Plaintiff's condition resulted in limitations, these were not severe enough to prohibit him working as he had "in the past as an Assistant Chief Engineer, as normally performed in the national economy." (SSA Denial Letter at 2-3.) Accordingly, this factor weighs against applying judicial estoppel.
Third, no unfair advantage accrues to Plaintiff and no unfair advantage is imposed on Defendant if judicial estoppel is withheld. Plaintiff retains the [*60]  same burdens of proof at trial and Defendant retains the right to present Plaintiff's SSA assertions as relevant evidence to the jury. Accordingly, the Court declines to apply judicial estoppel in the present case. See, e.g., Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 795; Fredenburg v. Contra Costa Cnty. Dep't of Health Servs., 172 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir.1999); Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997).
Because Defendant has failed to point to the absence of a genuine dispute regarding elements of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim and because Defendant has not demonstrated that judicial estoppel ought to apply, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to this cause of action.
3. Retaliation and Failure to Prevent Retaliation Claims
Defendant next contends that Plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case for retaliation in violation of the FEHA or California's Whistleblower law for several reasons. Specifically, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a causal nexus between his alleged protected activities and adverse employment actions. (Mot. 22.) Defendant also contends (1) that Plaintiff cannot show he engaged in any protected activity before being subjected to any adverse employment action because Plaintiff never reported any harassment or discrimination to Defendant and the only protected activities he engaged in were his EEOC and DFEH [*61]  filings in August and October of 2014, (Mot. 22); and (2) that it has stated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the actions it took and Plaintiff cannot raise a material issue of fact as to this being a pretext, (Mot. 13).
When ruling on a motion for summary judgment regarding a defense to a retaliation claim brought pursuant to FEHA or California's Whistleblower law, courts apply the McDonnell Douglas test. Metoyer v. Chassman, 504 F.3d 919, 931 (9th Cir. 2007); Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., 797 F.2d 727, 730-731 (9th Cir. 1986). This requires that a plaintiff first show that "(1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz, 36 Cal.4th at 1042 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the plaintiff makes out her prima facie case, the burden shifts to her employer to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its actions. See id. If the employer succeeds, "the presumption of retaliation 'drops out of the picture,' and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation." Id. "If a plaintiff succeeds in raising a genuine factual issue regarding the authenticity of the employer's stated motive, summary judgment is inappropriate, because it is for the trier [*62]  of fact to decide which story is to be believed." Washington v. Garrett, 10 F.3d 1421, 1432-1433 (9th Cir. 1993). Moreover, "[a]s an alternative to the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff responding to a summary judgment motion may simply produce direct or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a . . . [retaliatory reason] more likely than not motivated [the defendant]." McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1122 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).
The Court does not agree with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for retaliation, concluding that Plaintiff has adduced sufficient circumstantial evidence from which a trier of fact could infer a causal nexus between his protected activities and Defendant's actions. First, the parties raise two possible protected actions: (1) Plaintiff's filing charges with EEOC and DFEH, (Mot. 22); and (2) Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodations, (Opp'n 19). As to the first, filing formal charges with public agencies clearly constitutes protected activity under both FEHA and California's Whistleblower law. See Arn v. News Media Grp., 175 Fed. App'x 844, 846 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that filing a DFEH complaint is protected under FEHA); Green v. Ralee Eng'g Co., 19 Cal.4th 66, 76-77, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998) (confirming that Section 1102.5 applies to "employees who report to public agencies"). As to the second, Plaintiff is correct that requests for reasonable accommodation are now considered [*63]  protected activities under California law. See Castro-Ramirez v. Dependable Highway Express, Inc., 246 Cal. App. 4th 180, 205, 200 Cal. Rptr. 3d 674 (2016) (noting that a recent amendment to section 12940 makes it "clear that a request for reasonable accommodation on the basis of religion or disability is a protected activity"). Plaintiff alleges two adverse employment actions: (1) Cordero's denial of Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation; and (2) Defendant's decision to replace Plaintiff by hiring someone to fill his position. Because these actions materially affected the conditions of Plaintiff's employment, both qualify as adverse employment actions. See Yanowitz, 36 Cal 4th at 1054-55.
The question, then, is whether Plaintiff has demonstrated a causal link between these protected activities and Defendant's adverse employment actions. Plaintiff correctly notes both that in retaliation cases, the causal link may be established by an inference derived from circumstantial evidence, see Jordan v. Clark, 847 F.2d 1368, 1376 (9th Cir.1988), and also that "[c]lose proximity in time of an adverse action to an employee's resistance or opposition to unlawful conduct is often strong evidence of a retaliatory motive," Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1020, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). So noting, Plaintiff points to Cordero's refusals to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff and to the timing of Defendant's decision to fill Plaintiff's position as circumstantial [*64]  evidence of a causal link between Plaintiff's protected activities and Defendant's adverse employment actions. (Opp'n 20.)
It is undisputed that Cordero's refusals to accommodate Plaintiff occurred in close proximity to Plaintiff's requests to return from work. Moreover, strong evidence has been adduced leading to the conclusion that Cordero felt racial animus toward Plaintiff. As a result, Cordero's refusal to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff is suspect, and a jury could reasonably conclude that Defendant's arguments regarding its allegedly legal, nondiscriminatory motives behind its adverse employment actions were pretextual. Accordingly, the Court therefore DENIES Defendant's summary judgment motion as to Plaintiff's FEHA and Section 1102.5 retaliation and failure to prevent retaliation claims.
4. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations Claim
Independent of the general prohibition against unlawful disability discrimination, it is unlawful for an employer to fail to provide reasonable accommodations for the known physical disability of an employee who is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m); Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "Reasonable accommodation" may include "making existing facilities used [*65]  by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities" and "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). The employer need not provide such accommodation if the employer demonstrates that the accommodation will "produce undue hardship to its operation." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). An employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless:
it establishes through undisputed facts that [1] reasonable accommodation was offered and refused, [2] that there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation, or [3] that the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith.
Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 743-44 (citation and quotation marks omitted).
In this case, Defendant avers that Plaintiff cannot meet his burden as to (1) establishing that he could perform the essential functions of the ACE position, or (2) demonstrating that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate him. (Mot. 17-20.) [*66]  While the ultimate burden of proof as to this claim rests with Plaintiff, Defendant again misapplies the parties' burdens on summary judgment, rending his arguments inapposite. Even if Plaintiff were to bear the burden of production at the summary judgment stage, much of Defendant's reasoning fails for reasons previously discussed. See Sections III(A)(2)(b)(i) (discussing Defendant's failure to point to essential functions), III(A)(2)(b)(iii) (discussing the inapplicability of judicial estoppel).
Accordingly, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on these grounds, and the Court DENIES summary judgment as to this claim.
5. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process Claim
Defendant raises several arguments as reasons why the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's failure to engage in the interactive process claim. First, Defendant contends that an employer is not required to engage in a futile interactive process and that Plaintiff cannot raise a dispute of material fact that any reasonable accommodation was available at any material time. (Mot. 21.) Defendant likewise argues that because Plaintiff received the only accommodation he ever expressly sought and did not suggest any other [*67]  specific accommodation, Defendant was under no obligation to engage with him further. (Mot. 21-22). Additionally, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of his position or any other open position and that Plaintiff is judicially estopped from claiming that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process.
As noted in Section III(A)(2)(b)(i), supra, the burden of proving the existence of essential functions rests with Defendant, rather than Plaintiff, and that Defendant has failed to meet this burden. The Court likewise declines to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel to bar Plaintiff's claims for the reasons set forth in Section III(A)(2)(b)(iii), supra. Accordingly, the Court only considers Defendant's first two contentions.
An "employer's duty to engage in the interactive process generally is triggered by an employee . . . giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for an accommodation." Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1061 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds sub nom. U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391 (2002), 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589). "Although it is the employee's burden to initiate the process, no magic words are necessary[;]" rather, the obligation arises as soon as the employer becomes aware that the employee [*68]  requires an accommodation. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (quoting Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp.,140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62, n. 22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006)). This awareness triggers a "mandatory obligation" on the part of the employer "to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). This obligation "extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013. Liability for any failure "hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility . . . lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Id. at 1014. Accordingly, "an employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine dispute as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive process." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 261, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (citing Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1116).
Here, Plaintiff initiated the interactive process when, following his initial exam, he communicated Dr. Kim's restrictions to Cordero. (Def.'s Facts ¶¶ 31-32.) Defendant initially participated in the interactive process by granting Plaintiff his first requested reasonable accommodation, i.e., the temporary leave that [*69]  Plaintiff requested. (Def. Facts ¶¶ 36-37); see Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263 ("Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future.").
When that temporary leave came to an end and Plaintiff made clear inquiries regarding his return, however, Cordero foreclosed any further discussion of reasonable accommodation by informing Plaintiff—in no uncertain terms—that his return was conditioned upon him having "no restrictions" whatsoever. (Second Email Exchange.) It is unsurprising that Plaintiff suggested no additional accommodations after this point as he had been informed by his superior that no accommodation would suffice. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that Defendant was liable for the breakdown in the interactive process.
Defendant is correct, of course, that "section 12940(n) imposes liability only if a reasonable accommodation was possible." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 981, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Defendant is also correct that, after litigation commences and "particularly by the time the parties have concluded discover and reached the summary [*70]  judgment stage," Plaintiff should be able to identify "specific, available reasonable accommodations." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). Had Plaintiff failed in this regard, Defendant would be entitled to summary judgment on these grounds despite its responsibility for the breakdown.
Such is not the case, however, as Plaintiff has identified several possible accommodations, many of which Defendant acknowledges. (See Mot. 19-20.) These include reassigning duties that require climbing ladders or excessive movement and permitting Plaintiff to use a wheelchair in performing his rounds. (Brown Dep. at 283-85, 290-91.) In the present case, determining whether or not these accommodations are reasonable depends on the resolution of genuinely disputed facts, including but not limited to the precise scope of Plaintiff's limitations and which functions qualify as "essential functions" of the ACE position and other open positions for which Plaintiff was qualified.14 Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to this cause of action.
6. Failure to Prevent Harassment and Discrimination Claim
Defendant challenges Plaintiff's cause of action regarding Defendant's alleged failure to prevent harassment and discrimination by arguing [*71]  that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that it failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination or harassment. (Mot. 23.) Specifically, Defendant contends (1) that it implemented policies to prevent harassment and discrimination; (2) that it informed employees how to report issues; and (3) that because Plaintiff never reported any harassment or discrimination to Defendant's human resources department, Defendant cannot have breached its duty to prevent such conduct. (Mot. 23.)
Under FEHA, it is unlawful employment for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). "Indeed, the employer's duty to prevent harassment and discrimination is affirmative and mandatory." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 288, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (2009). "Reasonable steps an employer may take include the establishment of anti-discrimination policies, implementation of effective procedures to handle complaints and grievances regarding discrimination, and prompt investigation of discrimination complaints to prevent further discrimination." Beagle v. Rite Aid Corp., No. C 08-1517 PJH, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87073, 2009 WL 3112098, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2009) (citing Cal. Fair Empl. & Hous. Comm'n v. Gemini Aluminum Corp., 122 Cal. App. 4th 1004, 1025, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 906 (2004)). Other examples include "affirmatively raising the subject of harassment, expressing strong disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing [*72]  employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment under California law, and developing methods to sensitize all concerned." Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 804 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citing 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11019(b)). "A plaintiff seeking to recover damages based on a claim of failure to prevent discrimination or harassment must show three essential elements: (1) plaintiff was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Lopez v. Aerotek, Inc., No. SACV1400803CJCJCGX, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97086, 2015 WL 4504691, at *4 (C.D. Cal. July 23, 2015) (citing Lelaind v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008)) (quotation marks omitted). The Court examines the second of these elements, as the first and third are not challenged by Defendant.
a. A Genuine Dispute Remains Whether Defendant Took "All Reasonable Steps" to Prevent Discrimination and Harassment
Defendant has failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot prove that Defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment. While it is undisputed that Defendant took several significant, predicate steps, including creating anti-harassment policies and informing Plaintiff of reporting procedures, (Pl.'s Resp. ¶¶ 14-20), Plaintiff suggests a number [*73]  of equally critical steps that Defendant failed to take, (see Reply 21). These include (1) ensuring adequate supervision of Cordero and Estrada, which Plaintiff asserts may have prevented them from refusing him accommodation and impeding his return to work for discriminatory reasons; and (2) training or disciplining Cordero regarding Defendant's alleged "contact H.R." policy, which Plaintiff asserts may also have prevented the harm. (Reply 21.) Whether or not these suggested steps are among the reasonable precautions Defendant was obligated to take is a triable issue that must be resolved by the trier of fact. Accordingly, the Court finds that summary judgment is not appropriate on these grounds, and DENIES Defendant's Motion on this basis. See, e.g., Gonzales v. City of Martinez, 638 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 1162 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (holding that where a plaintiff's underlying claims survived, so did her related failure to prevent claims).
b. Plaintiff's Alleged "Failure to Report" Does Not Absolve Defendant of Liability
Defendant is mistaken that Plaintiff's failure to avail himself of Defendant's reporting procedures absolves Defendant of liability. First, to the extent that Defendant assumes a duty to prevent misconduct can only be breached after the employer is [*74]  given notice that misconduct has occurred, this is only the case where the harassing employee is a not a supervisor. See, e.g., Saindon v. Fed. Express Corp., No. C 02-01080 WHA, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5861, 2003 WL 1872959, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 7, 2003) (citing Cal. Gov. Code 12940(j)(1)). When a supervisor is involved, notice is irrelevant because the employer is subject to strict liability. Id. (citing Fisher, 214 Cal. App. 3d at 590). Here, Plaintiff's harassment and discrimination claims center on Cordero, Plaintiff's alleged supervisor.15
Second, to the extent that Defendant is attempting to assert the "reasonable care" or "Ellerth-Faragher" affirmative defense, see Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998), Defendant has failed to properly invoke this defense. In the Title VII sexual harassment context, this defense succeeds only where an employer demonstrates (1) that it exercised reasonable care to "prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior[;]" and (2) a plaintiff "unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise." Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807-08. The defense is unavailable when a supervisor's harassment "culminates in a tangible employment action." Id. Here, issues of fact exist as whether Cordero's harassment culminated in one of many adverse employment actions. Moreover, Plaintiff has argued that reporting Cordero's conduct to Defendant's human resources department would have been futile because Cordero "ran the H.R." (Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 20; Brown Dep. at 231-35.) Defendant has not challenged these claims, and therefore a triable issue of fact exists regarding whether Plaintiff's [*76]  failure to report was unreasonable. Additionally, this Court has found no case in which the "reasonable care" defense has been extended beyond the scope of sexual harassment, and further notes that the California Supreme Court has intentionally limited the application of the similar "avoidable consequences" doctrine, holding that the doctrine is only relevant to the issue of damages and is incapable of absolving an employer of liability. See State Dep't, 31 Cal. 4th at 1042. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate on these grounds.
B. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress ("IIED") Claim
Plaintiff's seventh cause of action alleges that Defendant intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him. Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate it engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct during the applicable limitations period. (Mot. 23.) Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff's IIED claim fails as a matter of law because it is based on a personnel management decision.16 (Mot. 23-24.)
To succeed on an IIED claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard for the probability of causing, emotional distress; [*77]  (2) that the plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) that the defendant's conduct actually and proximately caused the plaintiff's emotional distress. Conley v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco, 85 Cal. App. 4th 1126, 1133, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 679 (2000); Cervantes v. J.C. Penny, 24 Cal.3d 579, 593 (1979).
1. A Genuine Issue Exists As to Whether Defendant Engaged in "Extreme and Outrageous Conduct"
To succeed on an IIED claim, a defendant's conduct must be "so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community." Davidson v. City of Westminister, 32 Cal.3d. 197, 210 (1982). "It is established that ordinarily mere insulting language, without more, does not constitute outrageous conduct." Delfino v. Agilent Techs., Inc., 145 Cal. App. 4th 790, 809, 52 Cal. Rptr. 3d 376 (2006) (quotation marks omitted). However, behavior may be considered outrageous if a defendant "abuses a relation or position which gives him power to damage the plaintiff's interest." Agarwal v. Johnson, 25 Cal.3d 932, 946-47, 160 Cal. Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58 (1979), disapproved of on other grounds, White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999); Alcorn v. Anbro Eng'g, Inc., 2 Cal.3d 493, 498, 86 Cal. Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216 (1970) (asserting that a reasonable trier of fact could find that circumstances including racial epithets, conduct calculated to humiliate, and eventual termination constituted sufficiently outrageous conduct).
Here, Cordero's insults, racial epithets, over-scale and on-call payroll decisions, and bathroom restrictions are all undisputed. (Def.'s Facts ¶¶ 62-72.) Moreover, a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether Defendant's refusal to allow [*78]  Plaintiff to return from leave was racially motivated. See Section III(A)(2)(a), supra. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant, the Court concludes that a reasonable trier of fact could find that these actions constitute a pattern of racial harassment so extreme as to exceed all bounds usually tolerated by civilized society. See, e.g., Large v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. 2:08-CV-02835-MCE, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119265, 2012 WL 3647455, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2012) (denying summary judgment where a supervisor's pattern of harassment formed the basis of a plaintiff's IIED claim); Deering v. Lassen Cmty. Coll. Dist., No. 2:07-CV-01521 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111500, JAMDAD, 2008 WL 4570339, at *8 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 14, 2008) (same).
2. Plaintiff's IIED Claim Is Not Time-Barred
The applicable statute of limitations for IIED claims in California is two years. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1. Plaintiff filed the instant action on April 7, 2015. (See Compl.) Accordingly, the conduct alleged must have occurred after April 7, 2013.
As previously mentioned, triable issues of material fact exist concerning whether the continuing violations doctrine applies to Cordero's alleged unlawful actions and whether those actions included conduct that extended up and until Plaintiff's last work day of employment with JLL in November 2013. See Section III(A)(1)(b), supra. Should a jury conclude that Defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous [*79]  conduct at some point between April 7, 2013 and November 2013, Plaintiff's IIED claim would not be barred. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate on this basis.
3. The Personnel Management Action Rule Does Not Bar Plaintiff's IIED Claim
Defendant is correct that a personnel management activity alone "is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if improper motivation is alleged." Metoyer v. Chassman, 248 Fed. App'x 832, 835 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996)) (emphasis in the original). Defendant is mistaken, however, in its assertion that Plaintiff's IIED claim is based entirely on a personnel management action because "this case is fundamentally about [Defendant's] decision to grant [Plaintiff's] request for leave of absence." Here, Plaintiff's IIED claim centers on the totality of Defendant's alleged harassing and discriminatory conduct. While that pattern includes personnel management decisions, it also includes conduct that cannot be tolerated in any civilized working environment. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate on this basis.17
C. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Claim
Termination of an employee constitutes a tort when it violates fundamental principles [*80]  of public policy. Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167, 170, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 1331 (1980). To succeed in proving a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) the existence of an employer-employee relationship; (2) that the termination of plaintiff's employment was in violation of public policy; (3) that the termination of employment was a legal cause of Plaintiff's damages; and (4) the nature and the extent of plaintiff's damages. See Holmes v. Gen. Dynamics, Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1427 n. 8, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (Ct. App. 1993). Discrimination under FEHA can form the basis of wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. See Moorpark v. Super. Ct., 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1159-61, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim fails because he admitted that he voluntarily retired.18 (Mot. 24.) While Plaintiff does admit that he voluntarily retired, (Opp. 20; Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 57), he contends that the circumstances surrounding his retirement constitute constructive discharge, (Opp'n 20). Indeed, Plaintiff avers that he was placed on leave for two years despite being able to return with accommodations ten days after his accident. (Opp'n 20.) Plaintiff also attests that he faced financial devastation because he was "forced to exhaust all leaves and benefits and still barred from return to work." (Opp'n [*81]  20.) He concludes that his resignation, effective October 31, 2015, was his only viable choice. (Opp'n 20; Pl.'s Resp. ¶ 57.)
Under both federal and state law, a discriminatory constructive discharge can constitute a wrongful termination in violation of public policy. See Woods v. Intel Corp., 173 F.3d 862 (9th Cir. 1999). "The essence of constructive discharge is that it is a termination of employment secured by the employer through indirect means." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 822. To establish constructive termination, an employee must show (1) that his working conditions were intolerable; (2) that his employer intentionally created or knowingly permitted such conditions; and (3) that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have been compelled to resign. See Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1251, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994).
Here, the evidence adduced affirms most of Plaintiff's contentions set forth in his pleadings. For example, it is undisputed that Plaintiff went on leave for an extended period of time following his accident and that Hartford terminated Plaintiff's temporary disability benefits on August 13, 2015. It is likewise undisputed that, in October 2015, the SSA had not yet determined whether Plaintiff was entitled to total disability benefits. (Brown Dep., Ex. 19; SSA denial letter.) Additionally, Plaintiff [*82]  has successfully raised triable issues of material fact regarding when and under what circumstances he would have been able to return to work with reasonable accommodation.
Making all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the Court concludes that a reasonable trier of fact could find that Plaintiff was constructively discharged. See, e.g., Velente-Hook v. E. Plumas Health Care, 368 F. Supp. 2d 1084, 1102 (E.D. Cal. 2005) (holding that Defendant's continual refusal to explore reasonable accommodations and failure to participate in the interactive process raised triable issues of fact that Plaintiff was constructively discharged). Because Defendant has met its burden, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on these grounds, and the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion on this basis. See Caldwell v. Paramount Unified Sch. Dist., 41 Cal. App. 4th 189, 203, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448 (1995), as modified on denial of reh'g (Jan. 17, 1996) (holding that granting summary judgment on a defense motion is inappropriate only if a defendant shows that the plaintiff cannot establish one or more elements of his cause of action or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action).
D. Negligent Retention and Supervision Claim
Plaintiff's ninth and final cause of action is for negligence; in particular, for negligent retention and supervision. (See Compl. ¶¶ 82-88.) [*83]  Defendant contends that Plaintiff's negligence claims fail (1) because Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant owed him a duty; (2) because Defendant did take steps to prevent harassment and discrimination; and (3) because Plaintiff has failed to plead his causes of action in a manner sufficient to satisfy the federal pleading standards.19 (Mot. 24.)
An employer may be liable for an employer's negligence in hiring, retaining, or supervising an employee who is "incompetent or unfit." Delfino v. Agilent Techs., Inc., 145 Cal. App. 4th 790, 815-16, 52 Cal. Rptr. 3d 376 (2006) (quotation marks omitted); Doe v. Capital Cities, 50 Cal. App. 4th 1038, 1054, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 122 (1996). In order to establish a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) the defendant had a legal duty to conform to a standard of conduct to protect the plaintiff; (2) the defendant failed to meet this standard of conduct; (3) the defendant's failure was the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury; and (4) the plaintiff was damaged as a result. Ladd v. Cnty. of San Mateo, 12 Cal.4th 913, 917, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 309, 911 P.2d 496 (1996). At summary judgment, the initial burden rests on Defendant to demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot establish one or more of the elements of his cause of action or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. See Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 956, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997) (holding this to be true in the context of negligence actions as well).
Here, Defendant's [*84]  bare allegation that Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant owed him a legal duty falls far short of the burden required at summary judgment. (See Mot. 28.) While Defendant may be correct that Plaintiff's allegations themselves do not explicitly point to the sources of the duties alleged, (Compl. ¶¶ 82-88), this is not tantamount to an inability identify such sources.
Defendant's pleading standard argument also fails. Defendant's primary issue with Plaintiff's pleading of his negligence claims appears to be that Plaintiff's allegations lack specificity or that Plaintiff failed to identify the legal source of the duties he alleged. (Mot. 24 n. 11.) "Under Rule 8, a complaint must be a plain statement that shows that the pleader is entitled to relief." Grassi v. Moody's Inv'rs Servs., 540 Fed. App'x 737, 738 (9th Cir. 2013). It must "give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). First, while a few subsections of Plaintiff's paragraph alleging the existence of a duty are quite general, other subsections of the same paragraph are exceptionally detailed. (See Compl. ¶ 83.) Taken as a whole, Plaintiff's allegations with respect to the duty owed are more than sufficiently specific to meet the pleading standard. [*85]  Second, Plaintiff's negligence cause of action begins with the phrase "Plaintiff re-alleges each and every allegation in the preceding paragraphs." (Compl. ¶ 82.) Previous allegations refer to numerous possible sources of the legal duties alleged, including FEHA.20 The Court is also unconvinced that Defendant was not afforded fair notice regarding the nature of these negligence claims, for Defendant answered Plaintiff's Complaint on May 19, 2015 and did not file a motion to dismiss for failure to meet the pleading standards. (See Def.'s Notice of Removal Ex. 3 ("Answer"), ECF No. 1-3).
Additionally, Defendant's contention that it did take reasonable steps to prevent harassment and discrimination presents a triable issue of material fact best left to a jury. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate on these grounds, and the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion on this basis.
E. Punitive Damages
Defendant's final argument is that Plaintiff's request for punitive damages fails because no officer, manager, or directing agent (1) took any adverse action against Plaintiff; or (2) acted with oppression, fraud, malice, or reckless indifference to Plaintiff's rights. Under California [*86]  law, a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages where she can show by "clear and convincing evidence[ ] that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. Where the defendant is a corporation, the evidence must show that an officer, director or managing agent of the defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud. See McCullough v. Xerox Corp., No. 13-cv-04596-HSG, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135715, 2015 WL 5769620, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2015) (adding that "supervisory employees" are not considered managing agents unless they have "substantial discretion" in their decision-making capability).
In this case, there is a genuine dispute as to the nature and scope of Cordero's authority vis-a-vis JLL and Plaintiff. In light of this dispute, and because Plaintiff's FEHA and wrongful termination claims survive summary judgment, the Court DENIES summary judgment on this basis.
IV. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment. A jury trial to resolve Plaintiff's remaining claims shall commence on Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 9:00 a.m., with a final pretrial conference to be held on Friday, June 17, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. The parties are restricted to a total of four (4) motions in limine per side. [*87]  The parties shall lodge their respective pretrial materials in accordance with the Court's Initial Standing Order and the Central District of California's Local Rules. Strict compliance with the Court's Initial Standing Order is required. The trial will be time-managed.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
