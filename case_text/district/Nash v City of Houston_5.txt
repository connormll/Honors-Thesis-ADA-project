Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant City of Houston's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 39) and Plaintiff Katherine Nash's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgement Evidence (Document No. 49). Having considered the motions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines Defendant's motion should be granted and Plaintiff's motion should be denied.

I. BACKGROUND
This case concerns an alleged employment discrimination claim by Plaintiff Katherine Nash ("Nash") against Defendant City of Houston (the "City"). The undisputed facts leading up to this lawsuit are as follows. On May 10, 1999, Nash began her employment with the City. On January 24, 2006, Nash suffered an on-the-job injury as the result of a fall on City property. That same day, according to City protocol, Nash was transported to Concentra Medial Center where she was treated by Dr. Cedrick Smith ("Dr. [*2]  Smith"). Dr. Smith diagnosed Nash with wrist sprain and knee pain, and he instructed her to return to work on January 30, 2006 with restricted duty. Specifically, Dr. Smith instructed that Nash should not engage in any repetitive lifting over 20 pounds and should complete only ground level work. This restriction was anticipated to last until February 14, 2006, and a follow up visit was scheduled for February 2, 2006. As instructed, Nash returned to work on light duty restrictions on January 30, 2006. Ultimately, Nash applied for and received workers' compensation benefits. Additionally, as the result of restricted duty, Nash was apprised of and instructed to comply with the City's Work Ability Guidelines.1
In September 2006, Nash was hospitalize for an unrelated condition. From this point forward, Nash did not return to work. In October and November 2006, Nash submitted three separate medical records, signed by Dr. William H. Fleming, III ("Dr. Fleming"), stating that she was "unable to return to work." On January 12, 2007, Candy Clarke Aldridge ("Aldridge"), Deputy Director in the City's Human Resources Department, and Janet McCown ("McCown"), Division Manager in the City's Human Resources [*3]  Department, convened a meeting with Nash to discuss her work status and discrepancies in her compliance with the City's Work Ability Guidelines. Contemporaneously with this meeting, Nash submitted an FMLA certificate to the City indicating she was suffering from a kidney illness and was, at that time, incapacitated.2 Shortly thereafter, on February 2, 2007, the City indefinitely suspended Nash. This decision was affirmed on an administrative appeal on February 27, 2007.
On November 28, 2007, Nash filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging the City violated her rights under the ADA. On December 30, 2008, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter ("right to sue letter"), which Nash received on January 5, 2009. On Apri 13, 2009, Nash instituted the present lawsuit alleging the City: (1) violated Texas Labor Code § 451.001 by terminating her employment in retaliation for her filing a workers' compensation claim; (2) violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2610 et seq., by denying her medical leave and by terminating her employment in retaliation for requesting leave; and (3) violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), [*4]  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., by subjecting her to discrimination due to her disability and failing to accommodate her disability.
On May 1, 2009, the City filed a motion to dismiss Nash's claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court granted the City's motion with respect to Nash's state-law retaliation claim under the Texas Labor Code but denied the City's motion with respect to Nash's FMLA and ADA claims. Additionally, the Court granted Nash leave to amend her complaint to assert a claim of willful violation of the FMLA. The City now moves for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) Nash's FMLA claim is time-barred; and (2) Nash cannot prove a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA nor is she entitled to assert a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA. Nash opposes dismissal on summary judgment.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper when "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant. Coleman v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 113 F.3d 528, 533 (5th Cir. 1997). Initially, the movant bears the burden of presenting the basis for the motion and the elements of the causes of action upon which the nonmovant [*5]  will be unable to establish a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "A dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., 5 F.3d 955, 956 (5th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).
But the nonmoving party's bare allegations, standing alone, are insufficient to create a material issue of fact and defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Moreover, conclusory allegations unsupported by specific facts will not prevent an award of summary judgment; the plaintiff cannot rest on his allegations to get to a jury without any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint. Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps. v. City Pub. Serv. Bd. of San Antonio, 40 F.3d 698, 713 (5th Cir. 1994). If a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmoving party, then summary judgment is appropriate. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. sat 248. The nonmovant's burden cannot be satisfied by conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or "only a scintilla of evidence." Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)). Furthermore, it is not the function of the court to search the record on the nonmovant's behalf for evidence that may raise a fact issue. Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1137 n.30 (5th Cir. 1992) [*6] .

III. LAW & ANALYSIS

A. Nash's Motion to Strike the City's Summary Judgment Evidence
As an initial matter, the Court addresses Nash's motion to strike certain exhibits that make up the City's summary judgment evidence. Nash moves to strike the following exhibits on the basis that they are not properly authenticated:
• Exhibit No. 4 — The City's Work Ability Guidelines;
• Exhibit No. 5 — Physician activity status report, prepared and signed by Dr. Smith;
• Exhibit No. 6 — Offer of employment;
• Exhibit No. 7 — Calendar (Jan 2006 — Jan 2007);
• Exhibit No. 8 — Suspension letter;
• Exhibit No. 9 — Instructions for municipal service worker injured on the job;
• Exhibit No. 10 — Medical records, prepared and signed by Dr. Fleming;
• Exhibit No. 11 — Notice of suspension appeal;
• Exhibit No. 12 — Civil service commission order disposing appeal;
• Exhibit No. 16 — Affidavit of Aldridge; and
• Exhibit No. 17 — Affidavit McCown.
In resolving the City's motion for summary judgment, the Court relies on Exhibit Nos. 10, 16, and 17, in addition to other exhibits not objected to. Accordingly, the Court address Nash's objections with respect to these exhibits only.

1. Exhibit No. 10
Exhibit No. 10 contains three [*7]  medical records to which Nash objects on grounds of authenticity. Nash argues that because these medical records were not certified as business records under Rule 902(11) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they are not authentic and therefore not competent summary judgment evidence. "'[T]he fact that a document is unauthenticated does not mean that it is inadmissable for purposes of summary judgment. Admissible evidence may be submitted in an inadmissible form at the summary judgment stage, although at trial such evidence must be submitted in admissible form.'" Worldpak Intern., LLC v. Diablo Valley Packaging, Inc., No. 4:08-CV-469, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95689, 2010 WL 3657335, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2010) (quoting Mackey v. Owens, No. 98-60758, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 40674, 1999 WL 423077, at *1 (5th Cir. June 2, 1999) (affirming summary judgment where district court relied on documents submitted in unauthenticated and inadmissible form). The medical records at issue here purport to be medical certificates prepared and signed by Dr. Fleming, Nash's treating physician, stating that Nash is "unable to return to work." Having thoroughly reviewed these records, the Court determines they could easily be authenticated through a proper affidavit or by testimony at trial. Therefore, the Court overrules Nash's objection to the City's Exhibit No. 10.3

2. Exhibit Nos. 16 & 17
Exhibits Nos. 16 and 17 are affidavits by [*8]  Aldridge, Deputy Director in the City's Human Resources Department, and McCown, Division Manager in the City's Human Resources Department. Nash objects to these affidavits because the testimonies therein are not based on personal knowledge. In the summary judgment context, a district court may rely upon affidavits where the affiants' "'personal knowledge and competence to testify are reasonably inferred from their positions and the nature of their participation in the matters to which they swore.'" DIRECTTV, Inc. v. Budden, 420 F.3d 521, 530 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Barthelemy v. Air Lines Pilots Ass'n, 897 F.2d 999, 1018 (9th Cir. 1990)). The Fifth Circuit has stated that "[a]n affiant . . . may have personal knowledge of activities in which she has not actually participated." Hamilton v. Troyer Solutions, Inc., No. 03-30547, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 13764, 2004 WL 1491587, at *1 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Dalton v. FDIC, 987 F.2d 1216, 1223 (5th Cir. 1993). For example, "a manager of an organization can glean personal knowledge of the practices of that organization by participating in those practices or reviewing the organization's records." Id. (citing FDIC v. Patel, 46 F.3d 482, 484 (5th Cir. 1995); FDIC v. Selaiden Builders, Inc., 973 F.2d 1249, 1255 (5th Cir. 1992)).
A review of Aldridge's affidavit reveals that during the relevant time periods of the facts underlying this case, Aldridge was the Acting Director of the City's Human Resources Department and that she was authorized to make employment decisions including medical separations and indefinitely suspensions. Likewise, a review of McCown's [*9]  affidavit reveals that during the relevant time periods of the facts underlying this case, McCown was the Division Manager in the City of Houston's Human Resources Department responsible for overseeing the Records Management Division and that Nash worked as a Senior Clerk under McCown's leadership. These affidavits further reveal that, in January 2007, Aldridge and McCown met with Nash to discuss her work status and when she would return to work. Nash does not dispute this meeting took place. Thus, based on their positions and involvement with Nash, the Court determines that both Aldridge and McCown were personally aware of the circumstances surrounding Nash's work status and the decisions regarding her employment. Therefore, Nash's objections to these affidavits are overruled.

B. The City's Motion for Summary Judgment

1. ADA Claims
The City moves for summary judgment on Nash's ADA claims. Nash alleges the City discriminated against her in two ways. First, Nash claims that the City terminated her employment as the result of an alleged disability. This amounts to a disparate treatment claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Second, Nash alleges that the City failed to accommodate her disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "The two relevant [*10]  claims, failure to accommodate and disparate treatment, represent distinct categories of disability discrimination under the ADA." Hamar v. Ashland, Inc., 211 F. App'x 309, 310 (5th Cir. 2006); see also Windhauser v, Bd. of Supervisors, No. 360 F. App'x 562, 565 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) ("A failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA is distinct from a claim of disparate treatment."). Therefore, the Court will address these claims separately.

a. Disparate Treatment
The ADA "is an antidiscrimination statute designed to remove barriers which prevent qualified individuals with disabilities from enjoying employment opportunities available to persons without disabilities." Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 300 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 160-61 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1029 (1996). It makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against "'a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.'" Rodriguez v. ConAgra Grocery Prods. Co., 436 F.3d 468, 476 (5th Cir. 2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). A plaintiff may establish a discrimination claim under the ADA by presenting either direct or circumstantial evidence. Seaman, 179 F.3d at 300. Here, Nash contends she can show both.

i. Direct Evidence
"Direct evidence proves intentional [*11]  discrimination without inference or presumption when believed by the trier of fact." Jones v. Overnite Transportation Co., 212 F. App'x. 268, 272 (5th Cir.2006) (citing Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., 309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir.2002)). "In a Title VII [and ADA] context, direct evidence includes any statement or document which shows on its face that an improper criterion served as a basis-not necessarily the sole basis, but a basis-for the adverse employment action." Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. Dist., 329 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir. 2003), overturned on other grounds by Smith v. Xerox Corp., 602 F.3d 320, 328 (5th Cir. 2010); see also Fierros v. Texas Dep 't. of Health, 274 F.3d 187, 195 (5th Cir. 2001) ("In the context of Title VII [and the ADA], direct evidence includes any statement or written document showing a discriminatory motive on its face." (citing Portis v. National Bank of New Albany, Miss., 34 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir. 1994)). Workplace comments, for example, may be sufficient direct evidence of discrimination if they are: (1) related to the protected class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member; (2) proximate in time to the terminations; (3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue; and (4) related to the employment decision at issue. Auguster v. Vermilion Parish Sch. Bd., 249 F.3d 400, 405 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations, internal quotation marks, and internal brackets omitted). In any event, "[i]n such 'direct evidence' cases, 'the burden of proof shifts to the employer to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the same decision would have been made regardless of the forbidden factor.'" Fierros, 274 F.3d at 192 (quoting Brown v. East Miss. Elec. Power Assoc., 989 F.2d 858, 861 (5th Cir. 1993)).
Nash [*12]  contends she received several workplace comments regarding her disability from Leslie Merriman ("Merriman"), an employee of the City's third-party administrator in the City's Workers' Compensation Department. As proof of these comments, Nash points to several pages in her deposition taken by the City4 wherein she alleges Merriman made comments concerning Nash's disability. Nash argues these alleged comments are direct evidence of why the City indefinitely suspended her. The City contends Merriman's alleged comments are merely stray remarks and do not meet the criteria for workplace comments supporting discrimination. The Court agrees. Nash's deposition fails to identify whether any of the comments Merriman allegedly made were proximate in time to or otherwise related to Nash's indefinite suspension. At best these comments require an inference of a relationship between the alleged comments and the indefinite suspension. Moreover, Nash's deposition fails to identify whether Merriman is an individual with authority to effect Nash's indefinite suspension. Although Nash states in her deposition that Merriman recommended the suspension, the City offers affidavit by Aldridge and McCown, which [*13]  indicate Nash was terminated based on her refusal to comply with the City's Work Ability Guidelines by submitting medical documentation supporting her ability to return to work.5 Because Merriman's alleged comments are not direct evidence of discrimination, the Court determines the City's motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to Nash's direct evidence claim.

ii. Circumstantial Evidence
Because Nash has not presented any direct evidence of discrimination, the Court switches to the McDonnel Douglas burden-shifting framework to determine if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support Nash's claim of disparate treatment. Seaman, 179 F.3d at 300. Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, the plaintiff must first present a prima facie case of discrimination by showing: (1) she suffers from a disabled as defined by the ADA; (2) she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without an accommodation at the time of the adverse employment action; (3) she in fact experienced an adverse employment action as the result of the disability; and (4) the employer treated her less favorable than a nondisabled employee. Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., 321 F.3d 503, 511 (5th Cir. 2003); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Once the plaintiff demonstrates [*14]  a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. See Gowesky, 321 F.3d at 511. If the employer provides a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, the plaintiff must then demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons advanced by the employer are merely a pretext for the underlying discrimination. Id.
The City's motion for summary judgment focuses on only one aspect of Nash's prima facie case of discrimination—that is, whether or not Nash is a "qualified individual with a disability."6 The ADA defines "qualified individual with a disability" as "an individual with a disability who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Generally, "essential functions" are those that "bear more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue." Chandler v. City of Dallas, 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir. 1993). When determining whether a job function is essential, courts must consider the employer's judgment and any written job description the employer has prepared. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Lastly, courts are in agreement that "regular attendance is an essential function of most jobs." [*15]  Hypes v. First Commerce Corp., 134 F.3d 721, 727 (5th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases); see also Rogers v. Intl Marine Terminals, Inc., 87 F.3d 755, 759 (5th Cir. 1996) (lain essential element of any government job is an ability to appear for work . . . and to complete assigned tasks within a reasonable period of time") (quoting Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 217 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).
The City argues that, as a Senior Clerk, Nash's responsibilities necessitated her attendance at work and that, because Nash could not attend work, she is not a "qualified individual."7 It is undisputed that in January 2006, Nash sustained an on the job injury for which she was treated by Dr. Smith and instructed to return to work on restricted duty. It is also undisputed that in September 2006, Nash was hospitalized for an unrelated injury, after which she did not return to work.8 Evidence of Nash's inability to return to work is apparent in three separate medical records she submitted to the City in October and November 2006, all of which indicate Nash is "unable to return to work."9 Additionally, Nash submitted to the City an FMLA certificate, signed by Dr. Kerri Charles ("Charles"), stating that Nash was "incapacitated."10 On January 12, 2007, Aldridge and McCown convened a meeting with Nash to discuss her work status and when she could return to work. During this meeting, Nash stated that she [*16]  was able to return to work and was willing to do so. Nash further insisted that she could and would produce a physician's statement permitting her to return to work. Nash was given until January 29, 2007 to produce the physician's release as well as additional documents supporting her position that she was able to return to work. However, the City never received these documents. Subsequently, the City indefinitely suspended Nash's employment.11
The only evidence Nash offers to refute the City's position is a medical questionnaire completed by Dr. Fleming in January 2007, which states Nash can perform all of the duties associated with her position except that she cannot lift boxes weighing 25 pounds.12 This questionnaire, however, is contradicted by Dr. Charles's FMLA certificate stating Nash is incapacitated. Nash offers no evidence that Dr. Charles released her to return to work. Therefore, Nash has failed to establish that she was a "qualified individual" who could perform an essential function of her job, namely, regular attendance. Accordingly, Nash's prima facie case of disparate treatment fails as a matter of law, and the City is entitled to summary judgment.

b. Failure to Accommodate [*17] 
Under the ADA, and employer must make "'reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.'" Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d at 300 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). Thus, "[i]f a qualified individual requests an accommodation, then the "employer and employee should engage in flexible, interactive discussions to determine the appropriate accommodation." EEOC v. Agro Distrib., LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009). But the ADA only requires employers to accommodate the limitations arising from a disability, not the disability itself. Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9 and Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group, Inc., 93 F.3d 155 (5th Cir. 1996)). A plaintiff asserting a failure to accommodate claim must produce evidence that "the employer knew not only of the employee's disability, but also of the physical or mental limitations resulting therefrom." Id. (citing Burch v. Coca-Cola, 119 F.3d 305 (5th Cir. 1997)). Moreover, "[i]t is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed," and lacking such a request, "the employer cannot be held liable for failing to provide one." Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.
According to Nash's original complaint, she suffers from a kidney illness, which she alleges is a physical impairment that substantially limits [*18]  one or more of her major life activities. Nash further alleges that she made a request for an accommodation, and the City failed to initiate an informed, interactive process with her concerning a suitable accommodation. The City contends, however, that Nash never requested a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the City argues it was not required to engage in an interactive process regarding Nash's alleged need for an accommodation. Nash does not respond to this point. Nevertheless, the Court determines Nash failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her failure-to-accommodate claim.
The ADA incorporates the relevant procedural prerequisites to filing suit provided under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 12117(b); McNeill v. Atchison, Topeka & S.F. Ry., 878 F. Supp. 986, 989 (S.D. Tex. 1995). Thus to bring a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must exhaust all administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)—(f); Zamora v. City of Houston, No. 4:07-CV-4510, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62534, 2008 WL 3852416, at *4 (S.D. Tex Aug. 15, 2008) (quoting McClain v. Lufkin Indus., 519 F.3d 264, 273 (5th Cir. 2008)). To exhaust those administrative remedies, the plaintiff must file a charge with the EEOC and receive a right to sue letter. See Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 379 (5th Cir. 2002). On November 28, 2007, Nash filed an EEOC charge of discrimination,13 and on January 5, 2009 she received a right to sue letter. However, Nash's EEOC charge does not address her failure-to-accommodate claim. [*19]  Nash's EEOC charge states as follows:
I. I was employed with to City of Houston for 12 years. I was employed as a Senior Clerk. In January, 2006, I sustained an on the job injury. The seriousness of the injury caused me to be placed on Worker Compensation. During the next year, my condition did not improve and in September, 2006 I was placed on medical leave. As a result of the treatment for this injury, I developed a life threatening condition. Once the City of Houston found out about my disability, they took steps to remove me from my job. Although I complied with all of the City's requests, on February 27, 2007, I was placed on indefinite suspension.
II. I was able to document that I had complied with all of the requests made to me. However, the City failed to consider this documentation and terminated my employment. My doctors confirmed that I was able to perform the essential functions of my job. However, I believe that the City of Houston felt that my condition was disabling and did not want me to return to work.
III. I believe that I have been discriminated against because of my disability and because the City regarded me as disabled, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities [*20]  Act (ADA).
Nash's EEOC charge alleges only a disparate treatment claim, which is distinct from a failure-to-accommodate claim. Windhauser v. Bd. of Supervisors, 360 F. App'x 562, 565 (5th Cir. 2010) ("A failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA is distinct from a claim of disparate treatment"); Hamar, 211 F. App'x at 310 ("The two relevant claims, failure to accommodate and disparate treatment, represent distinct categories of disability discrimination under the ADA." (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112(a), 12112(b)(5)(A))). Further, the scope of Nash's EEOC charge is "too narrow to have exhausted a claim for failure to accommodate," and "the EEOC could not reasonably have been expected to investigate the entirely distinct failure-to-accommodate claim." Hamar, 211 F. App'x at 310; see also MacKenzie v. Denver, 414 F.3d 1266, 1274 n.13 (10th Cir. 2005); Jones v. Sumser Retirement Village, 209 F.3d 851, 854 (6th Cir. 2000); Green v. Nat '1 Steel Corp., 197 F.3d 894, 897-98 (7th Cir. 1999); Belmear v. Mary Kay Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1110, 2000 WL 127282 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 3, 2000). Therefore, the Court determines that Nash has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies concerning her failure-to-accommodate claim, and the City is entitled to summary judgment.

2. Nash's FMLA Claim
The City moves for summary judgement on Nash's FMLA claim. According to Nash's complaint, the City: (1) denied Nash medical leave and terminated her for filing a workers' compensation claim; (2) interfered with Nash's right to take medical leave despite physicians' orders; and (3) retaliated against Nash for requesting the leave, resulting in acts that altered [*21]  the terms and conditions of employment. The City contends summary judgment should be granted because Nash's FMLA claim is time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations.
Under the FMLA, a plaintiff must file a claim within two years of the event giving rise to the cause of action. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(1). However, when an FMLA action is brought for an employer's willful violation, the limitations period is three years. 29 U.S.C. § 2617(c)(2). In the Court's August 17, 2009 order addressing the City's motion to dismiss, the Court determined that the event giving rise to Nash's cause of action was February 27, 2007, the date the City's indefinite suspension became final. The Court further found that Nash's complaint did not assert a willful violation of the FMLA and therefore the applicable statute of limitations was two years, which barred her FMLA claim entirely. Despite this finding, however, the Court granted Nash leave to amend her original complaint to assert a willful violation of the FMLA.
On January 7, 2011, Nash attempted to amend her complaint to assert a willful violation. This attempt was denied as untimely. Nash's attempted amendment to her complaint came nearly one year and four months after the Court granted [*22]  her leave to do so and nearly one year and one month after the Court's deadline for amending the complaint.14 Because Nash did not assert a claim for willful violation of the FMLA in her original complaint, this claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, the City is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

3. Retaliation Claim
The City moves for summary judgement on Nash's retaliation claim. At the outset, the Court notes that it is not entirely clear what law Nash is invoking as the basis for her retaliation claim. Under the section heading, "VIII. Causes of Action of Plaintiff," Nash outlines three claims identified by the following subheadings:
A. VIOLATION OF AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
B. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
C. RETALIATION
Under the Retaliation subheading, Nash does not mention any specific federal or state law. Rather, she merely articulates that she engaged in a protected activity from which she suffered an adverse employment action. Additionally, while the word "retaliation" does not appear in the allegations for her ADA claim, the word is contained within the allegations for her FMLA claim. Thus, to the extend Nash's retaliation claim is part [*23]  of her FMLA claim, it is dismissed as time-barred. See discussion supra, III.B.2. To the extend Nash's retaliation claim falls within her ADA claim, it is dismissed because Nash failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Nash's EEOC charge does not assert a claim for retaliation. Moreover, the checkbox to identify a retaliation claim in the EEOC charge form is unchecked. Accordingly, the City's is entitled to summary judgment on any federal retaliation claim Nash may have asserted in her original complaint.

IV. CONCLUSION
Based on all the foregoing, the Court hereby
ORDERS that Plaintiff Katherine Nash's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgement Evidence (Document No. 49) is DENIED. The Court further
ORDERS that Defendant City of Houston's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 39) is GRANTED in all respects.
THIS IS A FINAL JUDGMENT.
SIGNED at Houston, Texas, on this 6 day of May, 2011.
