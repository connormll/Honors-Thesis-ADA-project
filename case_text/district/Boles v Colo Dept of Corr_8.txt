Opinion



RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
Entered By Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak
This matter is before the Court on three motions to dismiss: (1) Defendant Bryan Reichert, MD's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Prisoner's Complaint (the "Reichert Motion") [#124]; (2) CDOC Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (the "CDOC Motion") [#140];1 and (3) Defendant Rabbi Yisroel Rosskamm's Motion to Dismiss (the "Rosskamm Motion") [#209] (collectively, the "Motions"). The Motions have been referred to this Court. [#131, 142, 212] The Court has carefully considered the Motions and related briefing, the entire case file, and the applicable case law, [*2]  and has determined that oral argument would not materially assist in the disposition of the Motions. For the following reasons, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Reichert Motion be GRANTED and that the CDOC Motion and the Rosskamm Motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

I. BACKGROUND2
The instant lawsuit arises out of the conditions of confinement during Plaintiff's incarceration by Defendant Colorado Department of Corrections ("CDOC") at the Sterling Correctional Facility ("SCF"). [#116] Plaintiff is Jewish and "avidly practice[s]" Orthodox Judaism. [Id. at 23]

A. Food Preparation and Delivery
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Charleen Crockett is "the head administrator over food service and laundry operations for all of CDOC" and, at times, has claimed to be a dietician and, as such, has "weighed in" on Plaintiff's diet. [Id. at 9] Plaintiff contends that Ms. Crockett does not allow CDOC dieticians "to change anything." [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that the food at SCF is prepared under conditions that pose a substantial risk to the health of inmates, because the SCF food service employees do not have sufficient experience or knowledge regarding food service and lack sufficient [*3]  qualifications. [Id. at 11]
According to Plaintiff, Defendant Kristy Holjencin created a "low sodium kosher diet" for Plaintiff that contained more sodium than the recommended daily allowance, made Plaintiff sick, and "added more harm to [Plaintiff] then already done." [Id. at 9, 24] Plaintiff alleges that the low-sodium kosher diet contained "too much highly processed imitation food or food like substances, with layers of sodium and other chemicals" and that the small amount of fresh food in the diet "was always being stolen before the meal got to [Plaintiff]" or was so old as to be inedible. [Id. at 24] Plaintiff contends that "[i]t is a violation that CDOC diets—especially [Plaintiff's] kosher diet—do not meet current standards for content and variety" and that "[a]ll CDOC diets are far from nutritionally adequate." [Id. at 10]
Plaintiff contends that the CDOC's kosher diet was changed "from a relatively adequate [one] to a horribly harmful diet" and that the current kosher diet is "90% highly processed 'food-like substances'" and cannot be considered either nutritionally adequate or kosher. [Id. at 10] Plaintiff contends that the milk used in the kosher diet is not actually kosher, [*4]  because it is made by gentiles at the CDOC Four Mile Facility, is not subjected to the same regulatory inspections as other, private dairies, and the cattle are abused. [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that Rabbi Rosskamm, based upon his experience working in the food industry most of his life, knows or should know that the food and food processors he has approved for the CDOC kosher diet are neither nutritionally adequate nor kosher. [Id.] Plaintiff further alleges that Shulchan Aruch (the code of Jewish law) verifies that the food is not legitimately kosher. [Id.] Plaintiff contends that no one on the food service staff at SCF is familiar with kosher law or knows how to clean as required to satisfy the kosher standard. [Id.] Plaintiff also alleges that there is no Jewish person present with the inmates when they prepare the food, even though that is required under Jewish law. [Id. at 10-11] Plaintiff contends that, "[f]or awhile, a white supremacist [was] preparing kosher meals [and] was deliberately sabotaging [Plaintiff's] meals." [Id. at 24]
Plaintiff contends that much of the processed food included in the kosher diet looks and smells bad and was made by a company that has had several [*5]  lawsuits filed against it. [Id. at 11] Plaintiff claims that the produce used in his meals "rarely gets washed and is rarely fresh" and that the meals are assembled two or three days in advance and then wait in cold storage, which accelerates decomposition. [Id. at 11] Plaintiff further contends that dishes and utensils are not properly cleaned every day and, according to inmates who work in food service, health and safety laws are violated every day and most SCF personnel allegedly believe that they are exempt from Colorado food health and safety laws. [Id. at 11, 12]
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Jason Zwirn was in charge of food service at SCF from the time the incidents at issue began until the end of 2019 and did not have any food service experience prior to entering that role. [Id. at 11] According to Plaintiff, under Mr. Zwirn's management, food service employees were hired with inadequate experience and skill and attempted improvements to food service did not last. [Id. at 11-12] For example, Plaintiff alleges that despite guidance from the American Corrections Association requiring managing staff in prison kitchens to have at least three years of experience in food service [*6]  management, no one working in SCF food service has any prior experience. [Id. at 12]
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Kenneth Phipps, a food service manager at SCF during the relevant period, failed to adequately manage food service workers during his time in that role and let the workers "do[ ] whatever they wanted." [Id. at 3, 12] Plaintiff contends that, after he filed a grievance, Mr. Phipps "would see to it that [Plaintiff's] meals got worse" and ordered the inmates responsible for food preparation to put non-kosher food in Plaintiff's kosher meals in retaliation. [Id. at 12]
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Marc Taylor, Matthew Powell, Derrick Roberts, and Ian Barnes were personally responsible for regulating the preparation and delivery of Plaintiff's meals but shirked that duty. [Id. at 12-13] Despite photographing Plaintiff's meals, they would not correct clear problems with the meals. [Id. at 13] Plaintiff further alleges that his meals were often missing and not replaced with what Plaintiff was supposed to receive. [Id. at 13]
Plaintiff contends that, as a result of the deliberate indifference of these food service employees, he "eventually felt compelled to just not bother" [*7]  picking up his meals due to the poor quality of the food. [Id.] Plaintiff contends that, despite changes in staffing, there has been no improvement, and, in fact, things have gotten "more consistently bad." [Id.] In addition to the deliberate indifference, Plaintiff contends that Defendants "deliberately harm[ed] preparation and delivery of food to [Plaintiff]" in order to discriminate and retaliate against him. [Id.] More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Crockett, Holjencin, Zwirn, Rosskamm, Phipps, Clarkson, Barnes, Taylor, Powell, and Roberts discriminated against him by refusing to meet current standards for diet and preparation and delivery of his special meals. [Id. at 21]

B. Medical Care
Plaintiff alleges that his "medical disabilities (internal) are documented from a previous Colorado sentence and private providers that treated [him] in between sentences." [Id. at 14] Plaintiff alleges that, from the time he reentered the prison system and continuing through the present, he has "be[en] subjected to a barrage of medical personnel that do not have the requisite qualifications to treat [his] condition, refusal to provide access to persons who do have the requisite [*8]  qualifications, [and] records management problems." [Id. at 14-15]
Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he has the following documented conditions: central sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea, an intestinal disorder under the general term IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), and extensive arthritic bone and cartilage degeneration in his back, hands, and feet. [Id. at 16, 21] According to Plaintiff, as a result of these conditions, he is disabled in "performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, breathing, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working" and also is disabled "in bodily functions of immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, and endocrine systems." [Id. at 21]
Plaintiff alleges that, while he was at the intake facility, prior to his current incarceration at SCF, nurses without physician supervision, took away Plaintiff's day time sleep apnea treatment and medication after Plaintiff passed a test for COPD, even though the treatment and medication had been prescribed by physicians and specialists. [Id. at 15, 17-18] As a result, when Plaintiff was transferred [*9]  to SCF, there was a note in Plaintiff's file from intake stating that Plaintiff did not need medical care or medication. [Id. at 15] At the time, Plaintiff was in "horrendous pain." [Id.] Eventually, Plaintiff located a nurse who knew how to access Plaintiff's medical records from his prior sentence, but it took SCF medical staff a year to locate Plaintiff's medical records from private providers. [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Nicole Wilson3 is in charge of records management at the SCF medical clinic and thus is "partly to blame" for the disorganization, inaccuracy, and missing information associated with Plaintiff's medical records. [Id. at 16] Plaintiff contends that this records mismanagement led to "erroneous medical charges to [Plaintiff's] inmate account." [Id.] Based upon these allegations, Plaintiff contends that the medical departments at both the intake facility and SCF are staffed with "untrained and unqualified personnel." [Id. at 16]
Plaintiff contends that Dr. Reichert did not know how to access or to read Plaintiff's medical records. [Id. at 15] Plaintiff alleges that he had to direct Dr. Reichert on where in the records to find the treatment that had been prescribed [*10]  for his conditions during his prior prison sentence. [Id. at 17] That treatment included: Naproxen for brain inflammation, an oxygen concentrator, magnesium-citrate for intestinal issues, and access to a snack three times a day. [Id.] Dr. Reichert declined the three-snack regimen and, after consulting with Ms. Crockett, instead prescribed "a high-fiber snack 2 times per day." [Id.] According to Plaintiff, "[h]igh fiber snacks were proven the wrong treatment more than 20 years ago" and the snacks he has been provided "are not even fiber." [Id.]
Plaintiff further alleges that Dr. Reichert and Defendant Ryder May, an administrator of clinical services at SCF, "refuse to replace [the] worn out face mask that is an essential component in [Plaintiff's] sleep apnea machine" unless Plaintiff submits to another COPD test. [Id. at 5, 17, 18] Plaintiff argues that a COPD test is inappropriate because sleep apnea (which Plaintiff has) and COPD are two separate conditions and thus a COPD test "would most likely end with a false negative after which [Dr. Reichert and Mr. May] would erroneously take away the rest of [Plaintiff's] specialist[-]diagnosed care." [Id. at 18] Plaintiff argues that his [*11]  sleep apnea coupled with brain inflammation is a life-threatening condition, and thus he needs to have the face mask replaced and also needs to have the day-time equipment—that was taken away from him at the intake facility—returned. [Id. at 20] Plaintiff further alleges that Dr. Reichert and Mr. May have denied him access to qualified medical providers and have threatened to take away the treatment Plaintiff is currently receiving and to deny him additional treatment that he needs. [Id. at 18]
Plaintiff alleges that Mr. May does not properly staff medicine distribution times and, as a result, it is difficult for Plaintiff to obtain his medications, allegedly including requiring Plaintiff "to sit outside in sub-zero snowing weather for as long as 2 hours at a time to get [his] medication" over "the past few years." [Id. at 19] Plaintiff contends that his medications were "so hard to get that [Plaintiff] quit taking the self[-]medication [Plaintiff] would have had to pick up at lunch time." [Id.] Due to Mr. May's alleged errors in ordering medication, Plaintiff alleges that he has "had to go a day or 2 without medication for the brain inflammation." [Id.] Plaintiff contends that when [*12]  he does not receive his regular dose of Naproxen, his constant headache "builds into the absolute worst pain imaginable." [Id. at 20] Plaintiff further alleges that Dr. Reichert deliberately neglected to re-order Plaintiff's prescription for four days and contends that the magnesium-citrate he is supposed to receive for bowel blockages has been replaced with "a low grade version of a different formulation than the prescription intended." [Id. at 19-20] Plaintiff also alleges that Dr. Reichert falsely accused Plaintiff of rejecting a neurological consultation at Denver Health, but then subsequently denied that Plaintiff needed a neurological consultation despite his knowledge of Plaintiff's complaints of a constant headache, unusual gait, and issues with balance. [Id. at 19]
X-rays taken during Plaintiff's incarceration at SCF allegedly have confirmed "extensive arthritic bone and cartilage degeneration" and "two collapsed vertebrae pinching a nerve running from [Plaintiff's] lower back to [his] left foot." [Id. at 16-17] Based upon the radiologist's reading of these x-rays (rather than his own independent review), Dr. Reichert allegedly prescribed a wheelchair and physical therapy for [*13]  Plaintiff. [Id. at 17] According to Plaintiff, "so far [the physical therapy] just increases the pain." [Id. at 17]
Plaintiff contends that Defendant Jessica Dorcey, a manager at SCF, "refuses to admit that [Plaintiff is] entitled to mobility accommodations" and took away Plaintiff's accommodation for additional time to move around the facility. [Id. at 6, 22] Plaintiff alleges that one of Ms. Dorcey's reports told Plaintiff that the only accommodation that will be provided is an inmate assistant (referred to as an "OCA") but that OCAs do not actually provide the intended assistance/accommodations and instead, at most, push the wheelchair. [Id. at 22] Plaintiff also contends that SCF does not have "adequate quantity or quality of handicap[-]designated cells." [Id. at 22] More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he has to share a 70-square-foot cell with a cellmate, their property, and Plaintiff's wheelchair and that there thus is "no room to put anything" and Plaintiff "cannot use the sink or toilet without getting into contortions that are painful." [Id.]

C. Religious Exercise
Plaintiff alleges that, in 2018, Defendants Susan Fuller and Shawna Nygaard, who work or formerly worked in [*14]  program management at SCF, denied Plaintiff Passover meals, because Plaintiff did not sign up for them six months in advance. [Id. at 6, 24] Plaintiff contends that he had not been told that he needed to sign up for the meals and that the requirement had not been posted in a location he traveled through enough to see it. [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Fuller and Ms. Nygaard also denied space for Yom Kippur services in 2019 and denied him access to religious apparel that he won the right to have and wear at all times through a separate lawsuit. [Id. at 25]
In June 2019, Plaintiff requested that Ms. Crockett cancel his "low sodium" diet in the hopes that it would improve the quality of the food he received, but Ms. Crockett cancelled Plaintiff's kosher diet instead, and Ms. Crockett did not send an email to program staff to have Plaintiff's kosher diet restored until October 9, 2019. [Id. at 23, 24] Plaintiff alleges that, in October 2019, Ms. Nygaard and Cyrus Clarkson, a manager of food service operations at SCF, "refused to let [Plaintiff] participate in the religious holiday of Sukkot" and denied Plaintiff his kosher diet. [Id. at 3, 23] Ms. Nygaard and Mr. Clarkson told Plaintiff [*15]  that "their action was supported by [Ms.] Crockett's cancelation" of Plaintiff's kosher diet, but Plaintiff contends that Ms. Crockett had sent the email directing that Plaintiff's kosher diet be restored prior to the holiday. [Id. at 23] Plaintiff contends that, despite Ms. Crockett's October 9, 2019 email, Mr. Clarkson refused to reinstate Plaintiff's kosher diet until the middle of December 2019 and that Plaintiff thus "went without food except for hand[-]outs from other inmates for almost 6 months." [Id. at 23, 24]
Plaintiff contends that, because Rabbi Rosskamm does not properly assure that the kosher diet actually is kosher, Plaintiff "transgresses against [God] every time [he] eat[s]" and eating the non-kosher food "defiles the soul as well as the body." [Id. at 25]

D. Plaintiff's Property
Plaintiff alleges that social security funds, protected by the Social Security Act, have been deposited into his inmate account. [Id. at 25] According to Plaintiff, these social security funds "cannot be taken for fines, fees, court filings, restitution, or child support" and Colorado law requires that a "collections investigator" be assigned before this money is taken. [Id.] Plaintiff contends that no such investigator [*16]  has been appointed and no investigation has been conducted. [Id. at 26] According to Plaintiff, the CDOC accounting department, under the responsibility of Defendant Debra Goheen, ignored Plaintiff's letter alerting them to these restrictions on the use of funds in his inmate account and social security funds were improperly used to pay for child support and filing fees. [Id.] Plaintiff contends that he had already paid off the child support obligation and that the filing fees were not owed. [Id.] In addition, Plaintiff contends that, even though the order establishing Plaintiff's obligation to pay court fees "specifies that payment be taken from monies exceeding 10 dollars" and his account rarely exceeds ten dollars, "90% of everything deposited is being taken every month along with any change leftover from commissary purchases." [Id.] Plaintiff further alleges that debt is being improperly added to his existing debt. [Id.] As a result, Plaintiff contends that he is unable to purchase hygiene supplies that are not supplied by CDOC. [Id.]
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant GTL (Global Tel*Link Corporation) improperly charges a $3.00 fee every time a deposit is made to Plaintiff's inmate [*17]  account from a source other than state pay. [Id. at 26] According to Plaintiff, the $3.00 fee "does not buy anything" but instead "is money being stolen." [Id.]
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant David Custer, a cellhouse supervisor, took "discovery information" related to Plaintiff's criminal case from Plaintiff's cell without authorization during a search of the cell. [Id. at 6, 26] Specifically, Plaintiff contends that Mr. Custer "ransack[ed] [Plaintiff's] legal papers outside [Plaintiff's] presence, during a shake down." [Id. at 26] According to Plaintiff, it was a "targeted shake down" in that the search was conducted in response to Plaintiff bringing fruits and vegetables to his cell to wash them because they were not properly washed by the food service staff and there is no other place for Plaintiff to wash the produce. [Id. at 27] Although the discovery information was maintained on computer disks, Plaintiff contends that he was permitted to have the disks in his cell because they "came in through normal channels from the [Jefferson County] Sheriff" and "every inmate in the unit is allowed computer disks (video games, movies, etc.)." [Id.] Plaintiff contends that the improper [*18]  taking of these legal documents "contributed to the loss of [his] appeal." [Id.]

E. The Instant Lawsuit
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed the instant action on April 19, 2019. [#1] On May 29, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint, asserting the following claims against Defendants: (1) Claim One alleges a denial of adequate food [#116 at 8-13]; (2) Claim Two alleges the denial of adequate medical care [id. at 13-20]; (3) Claim Three alleges discrimination on the basis of a disability [id. at 20-22]; (4) Claim Four alleges discrimination on the basis of religion [id. at 22-25]; and (5) Claim Five alleges the illegal taking of money from Plaintiff's inmate account and property from Plaintiff's cell [id. at 25-27]. Although not identified as a "claim," the Second Amended Complaint also asserts that CDOC and SCF committed "[u]ntenable "[i]nterference [w]ith [t]his [l]itigation" by restricting Plaintiff's access to the law library and legal research resources. [Id. at 27-28] The Court construes these allegations as Plaintiff's Claim Six. Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages.4 [Id. at 29]
On June 11, 2020, Dr. Reichert filed the [*19]  Reichert Motion, arguing that all claims against him should be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim. [#124] Plaintiff filed a response to the Reichert motion [#146],5 Dr. Reichert filed a reply [#151], and Plaintiff then filed a document entitled "Rebuttal to Defendant Reichert's Motion" [#158].
On July 6, 2020, the CDOC Defendants filed the CDOC Motion, arguing that Plaintiff's Second Amended Compliant should be dismissed in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).6 [#140] Plaintiff filed a response to the CDOC motion [#149], the CDOC Defendants filed a reply [#157], and Plaintiff then filed a document entitled "Brief in Opposition to CDOC Defendants' Successive Motion for Dismissal" [#164].
On November 11, 2020, Rabbi Rosskamm filed the Rosskamm Motion, arguing that all claims against him should be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim. [#209] Plaintiff filed a response to the Rosskamm motion [#228], and Rabbi Rosskamm filed a reply [#232]. Plaintiff then filed a motion to strike Rabbi Rosskamm's reply [#234], which the Court denied but will consider as a sur-reply [#236].

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint [*20]  for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must "accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations . . . and view these allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."7 Casanova v. Ulibarri, 595 F.3d 1120, 1124 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting Smith v. United States, 561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009)). Nonetheless, a plaintiff may not rely on mere labels or conclusions, "and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Plausibility refers "to the scope of the allegations in a complaint: if they are so general that they encompass a wide swath or conduct, much of it innocent, then the plaintiffs 'have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.'" Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "The burden is on the plaintiff to frame a 'complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest' that he or she is entitled to relief." Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The ultimate duty of the court is to "determine whether the complaint sufficiently alleges facts supporting all the elements necessary to establish an entitlement to relief under the legal [*21]  theory proposed." Forest Guardians v. Forsgren, 478 F.3d 1149, 1160 (10th Cir. 2007).
"A pro se litigant's pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972)). "The Haines rule applies to all proceedings involving a pro se litigant." Id. at 1110 n.3. The Court, however, cannot be a pro se litigant's advocate. See Yang v. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008).

III. ANALYSIS
Each of the Motions seeks dismissal of all of Plaintiff's claims asserted against the moving defendant(s).8 [#124, 140, 209] Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to plausibly allege each of Plaintiff's claims.9 The Court addresses the sufficiency of each of the following claims asserted in the Second Amended Complaint: (1) Claim One alleging violation of the Eighth Amendment based upon the failure to provide adequate food; (2) Claim Two alleging violation of the Eighth Amendment based upon the failure to provide adequate medical care; (3) Claim Three alleging discrimination on the basis of disability; (4) Claim Four alleging religious discrimination; (5) Claim Five alleging violation of the Fourteenth Amendment based upon the improper taking of Plaintiff's property; and (6) Claim Six alleging the denial of access to the Courts.

A. Eighth Amendment Claim for Inadequate Food
Claim One of the Second Amended Complaint [*22]  alleges a "[d]enial of adequate food" in violation of the Eighth Amendment against the CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm. [#116 at 8] The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects a prisoner's right to "humane conditions of confinement guided by 'contemporary standards of decency.'" Penrod v. Zavaras, 94 F.3d 1399, 1405 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)). Prison officials are required to "ensur[e] inmates receive the basic necessities of adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care and . . . tak[e] reasonable measures to guarantee the inmates' safety." Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, 1310 (10th Cir. 1998). The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, however, "does not mandate comfortable prisons, and conditions imposed may be restrictive and even harsh." DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 973 (10th Cir. 2001) (quotations omitted).
A prison must provide inmates with "nutritionally adequate food that is prepared and served under conditions which do not present an immediate danger to the health and well[-]being of the inmates who consume it." Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 570-71 (10th Cir. 1980). "A substantial deprivation of food may be sufficiently serious to state a conditions of confinement claim under the Eighth Amendment." Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1222 (10th Cir. 2002). To state such a claim, an inmate must allege both an objective and subjective element. Womble v. Chrisman, 770 F. App'x 918, 923 (10th Cir. 2019). "The objective element requires that the inmate allege a sufficiently serious deprivation that denied the inmate the minimal civilized measures [*23]  of life's necessities." Id. (quotation omitted); see also Barney, 143 F.3d at 1310 (finding that "the deprivation alleged must be objectively sufficiently serious, . . . depriving the inmate of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities" (citation and quotation omitted)). "[T]he subjective element requires showing the prison official knew of and disregarded 'an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.'" Womble, 770 F. App'x at 923 (quoting Barney, 143 F.3d at 1310).
The CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm argue that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are insufficient to plausibly allege either the objective or subjective elements of the claim. [#140 at 8-10; #209 at 7-9] The Court agrees.

1. Objective Seriousness of the Deprivation
With regard to the objective component, Plaintiff alleges generally that "CDOC diets . . . do not meet current standards for content and variety" and are "far from nutritionally adequate," that food service employees lack experience and "required qualifications," that "dishes and utensils do not properly get cleaned," and that "food health and safety laws are broken every day." [#116 at 9-11] These vague and conclusory allegations—which, notably, are not specific to the food served to Plaintiff—are insufficient [*24]  to support a finding that the food served at SCF generally is so deficient as to deny inmates the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities. See Florer v. Bales-Johnson, 752 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1200 (W.D. Wash. 2010) ("The USDA guidelines and recommendations are not constitutional requirements."), aff'd, 473 F. App'x 651 (9th Cir. 2012); Gonsalves v. DeVeau, No. 3:11CV835 AWT, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180768, 2012 WL 6104788, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. 7, 2012) ("The Constitution does not, however, require adherence to any particular nutritional guidelines."). Plaintiff does not allege specifically how the food is defective, how the lack of qualifications has impacted the food, or specifically what food health and safety laws have been broken and "[a] lack of workplace safety policies or training does not necessarily establish deliberate indifference." Franklin v. Kan. Dep't of Corr., 160 F. App'x 730, 736 (10th Cir. 2005). Nor does Plaintiff allege that these allegedly deficient practices had a negative impact on inmate health, such as sickness or weight loss.
Specific to his own diet, Plaintiff alleges that the "low sodium kosher diet" created for him "contained more sodium than the recommended daily allowance" and that the kosher diet more generally consists of "90% highly processed 'food-like substances.'" [Id. at 9-10] Although Plaintiff alleges generally, that the low-sodium diet "added more harm to [him] than already done" and "always made [him] sick" [id. at 9, [*25]  24], he fails to specify what alleged harms were actually caused by the diet or the nature or severity of the sickness.10 Cf. Womble, 770 F. App'x at 924 (finding allegations sufficient to allege sufficiently serious deprivation where plaintiff alleged that continuous serving of spoiled food and inadequate portions "lasted more than 16 months" and resulted in plaintiff losing 21 pounds and suffering stomach pain, digestive damage, and vomiting"); Escobar v. Mora, 496 F. App'x 806, 808-09, 811 (10th Cir. 2012) (finding allegations sufficient where guards allegedly spit into two of plaintiff's three meals every day for fifteen months, resulting in emotional distress and the loss of 30 pounds).
Nor does Plaintiff cite any legal authority to support a finding that a diet containing more sodium than recommended and/or containing a high percentage of processed foods is constitutionally defective, and the Court is not aware of any. Plaintiff further alleges that "[a] lot of the highly processed food in the kosher diet by Meal Mart looks and smells like someone defecated or vomited in the package"11 and that the kosher diet includes milk that "is not subjected to the regulatory inspections" applicable to other dairies and is not kosher.12 [#116 at 10-11] Plaintiff, however, does [*26]  not allege either that the food and milk were inedible or nutritionally inadequate or that they had any negative health consequences for Plaintiff. Plaintiff also alleges that "[p]roduce in [his] meals rarely gets washed and is rarely fresh" and that his food "is being assembled 2 or 3 days ahead," accelerating decomposition."13 [Id. at 11] Although the Court understands that such conditions are not ideal, Plaintiff fails to allege with specificity with what frequency and for what duration they have occurred and, more importantly, fails to allege what impact these practices have had on Plaintiff's health.
Ultimately, Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to plausibly allege the "extreme deprivations . . . required to make out" the objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992). "Courts consider the amount and duration of the deprivation of food in determining whether a constitutional right has been infringed." Lockamy v. Rodriguez, 402 F. App'x 950, 951 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, Plaintiff's allegations are not sufficiently specific to establish that either the severity or duration of the alleged food handling practices denied him adequate nutrition. Notably, "[t]his is not a case where food and nutrition were withheld entirely" and Plaintiff has [*27]  not alleged "that the diet he was provided and the food that he had eaten caused any [specific] reaction or serious medical issues." Balcar v. Smith, No. 17-5159, 2017 WL 3613479, at *2 (6th Cir. July 17, 2017). Instead, Plaintiff alleges that "[m]ost of the time the majority of the meal was not worth picking up anyway, which is still the case." [#116 at 13] Plaintiff's allegation suggests that (1) some of the time, the majority of the meal was "worth picking up" and (2) even in those instances where Plaintiff did not subjectively believe the "majority of the meal" was "worth picking up," there was at least some portion of the meal that was sufficient. [Id.; see also id. at 11 (alleging that produce "rarely gets washed and is rarely fresh")] Plaintiff thus has not plausibly alleged "that he was denied nutritionally adequate food, only that he was denied his preferred diet."14 Moore v. Perrill, 51 F.3d 286, 1995 WL 139407, at *1 (10th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision) (quotation omitted).

2. Defendants' Subjective Intent
"[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts [*28]  from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference." Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). A plaintiff thus may demonstrate the requisite subjective intent by "alleg[ing] facts supporting an inference that Defendants knew about and disregarded a substantial risk of harm to his health or safety." Oxendine v. Kaplan, 241 F.3d 1272, 1277 (10th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted).
Plaintiff alleges that "[a]fter a while, when [he] filed a new grievance or voiced a complaint, [Defendant] Phipps would see to it that [Plaintiff's] meals got worse." [#116 at 12; see also id. at 24 (alleging that Plaintiff "complained and filed grievances" but Defendants "refused to fix the problems")] However, Plaintiff fails to include any specific factual allegations to support this conclusory statement. Plaintiff does not disclose the content or date of the alleged grievances and oral complaints or to whom they were directed.15 Nor does Plaintiff explain in what way his meals allegedly got worse or offer facts to establish that the resulting meals were inadequate or made Plaintiff sick. Similarly, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Taylor, Powell, Roberts, and Barns "would take pictures of [Plaintiff's] meals but not correct the problems [*29]  right before their eyes" [id. at 13], but Plaintiff does not allege when the photos were taken or what the alleged "problems" with the meals were. Plaintiff's allegations lack the specificity required to plausibly allege that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference with regard to the sufficiency of his meals. In Section 1983 cases, such as this case, where the plaintiff sues a "government agency and a number of government actors . . . in their individual capacities . . . it is particularly important . . . that the complaint make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations against the state." Robbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1249-50 (10th Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original).
Moreover, the Second Amended Complaint acknowledges that food service management has "[a]ttempted improvements" but alleges that they "do not last because there is no way to get the whole staff on board." [#116 at 12] Similarly, Plaintiff alleges that there have been "changes in staffing," but that it has not resulted in improvement. [Id. at 13] "If an official is aware of the potential for harm but takes reasonable efforts [*30]  to avoid or alleviate that harm, he bears no liability under [the deliberative indifference] standard." DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 975 (10th Cir. 2001).
The Court thus finds that Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to plausibly allege that Defendants were aware that the food being served to Plaintiff posed an excessive risk to his health or safety or that they disregarded any such risk.

3. Conclusion
Because the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to satisfy both the objective and subjective elements of his Eighth Amendment claim based upon inadequate food,16 the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Motions be GRANTED to the extent they seek dismissal of Plaintiff's Claim One.

B. Eighth Amendment Claim for Inadequate Medical Care
Claim Two alleges the denial of adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment against the CDOC Defendants and Dr. Reichert. [#116 at 13-20] A prison official's deliberate indifference to an inmate's serious medical needs violates the Eighth Amendment. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104. In the prison medical context, "deliberate indifference is present when prison officials intentionally deny or delay access to necessary medical treatment for non-medical reasons." Hammond v. Crum, No. 16-CV-0069-GPG, 2016 WL 153224, at *2 (D. Colo. Jan. 13, 2016) (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05).
"'Deliberate indifference' involves both an objective and a subjective component." [*31]  Sealock v. Colorado, 218 F.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000). "The objective component is met if the deprivation is 'sufficiently serious.'" Id. at 1209 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834). "[A] medical need is sufficiently serious if it is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention." Hunt v. Uphoff, 199 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted). "The subjective component is met if a prison official 'knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.'" Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1209 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837). Mere negligence, however, is not sufficient. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835. Rather, "[t]he subjective component is akin to 'recklessness in the criminal law,' where, to act recklessly, a 'person must "consciously disregard" a substantial risk of serious harm.'" Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1231 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837, 839). In other words, "the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and [s]he must also draw the inference.'" Mata v. Saiz, 427 F.3d 745, 751 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837); see also id. at 753 (The question is: "were the symptoms such that a prison employee knew the risk to the prisoner and chose (recklessly) to disregard it?").
Although the Second Amended Complaint includes a litany of complaints about the medical department at SCF generally and [*32]  Plaintiff's medical treatment specifically, Claim Two appears to be based upon the following: (1) the lack of appropriate qualifications of medical staff and denial of access to specialists [#116 at 14-15, 16, 18]; (2) deficiencies in records management and comprehension [id. at 15, 16, 17, 19]; (3) the failure to implement treatments previously prescribed [id. at 16, 17, 18]; (4) refusal to replace the face mask for Plaintiff's sleep apnea treatment system [id. at 17, 20]; and (5) allegedly inadequate access to medications [id. at 19-20]. The Court addresses each in turn.

1. Qualifications of Medical Staff and Access to Specialists
Plaintiff alleges that he is "being subjected to a barrage of medical personnel that do not have the requisite qualification to treat [his] condition" and "refus[e] to provide access to persons who do have the requisite qualifications." [Id. at 14-15; see also id. at 16 (alleging "systemic deficiencies in staffing with untrained and unqualified personnel"), 18 (alleging that medical staff lack "even a modicum of required knowledge and expertise" and that Dr. Reichert, Mr. Ward, and Mr. May did not allow Plaintiff "access to qualified personnel")] Plaintiff [*33]  fails to identify specifically which medical providers were unqualified, what qualifications they allegedly lacked, how the alleged lack of qualification manifested itself, or what specific harm Plaintiff suffered as a result of the alleged lack of qualifications.17 Nor do these allegations identify any specific facts regarding when or to whom Plaintiff made a request to see a specialist, what type of specialist(s) he requested to see, or what specific response he received to the request and from whom. These generalized allegations thus are insufficient, as "[i]t is well-settled in [the Tenth Circuit] that basic disagreements with medical professionals and complaints of failure to be referred to a specialist do not satisfy the subjective aspect of a deliberate-indifference claim." White v. Kan. Dep't of Corr., 617 F. App'x 901, 905 (10th Cir. 2015) (emphasis in original) (collecting cases).
The only specific allegation in the Second Amended Complaint regarding access to a specialist is that Dr. Reichert falsely accused Plaintiff of rejecting a neurological consultation and then "counter[ed] himself in saying he did not see evidence of the need" for a neurological consultation.18 [#116 at 19] Plaintiff's disagreement with Dr. Reichert about the need for [*34]  a referral to a specialist is insufficient to support an Eighth Amendment claim. A prisoner's contention that he was denied treatment by a specialist is generally insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. See, e.g., Duffield v. Jackson, 545 F.3d 1234, 1239 (10th Cir.2008) (finding that "decision that a patient's condition requires a specialist is a decision about the patient's course of treatment, and negligent diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition do[es] not constitute a medical wrong under the Eighth Amendment" (quotation omitted)); Self, 439 F.3d at 1232 ("[T]he subjective component is not satisfied, absent an extraordinary degree of neglect, where a doctor merely exercises his considered medical judgment" and "[m]atters that traditionally fall within the scope of medical judgment are such decisions as to whether to consult a specialist or undertake additional medical testing."); Ledoux v. Davies, 961 F.2d 1536, 1537 (10th Cir.1992) (finding that denial of treatment by a specialist is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation).
Moreover, the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint make clear that Dr Reichert's decision not to refer Plaintiff to a neurologist was not the result of conscious disregard for Plaintiff's condition. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Reichert was aware of Plaintiff's [*35]  "complaints about a constant headache, . . . unusual gait [,] . . . [and] apparent balance problem," but Dr. Reichert did not believe there was evidence to support the referral because his "records are so-disorganized he cannot find why he [previously] ordered [the neurological evaluation] and does not remember what the radiologist report said." [#116 at 19] Such allegations, at most, establish Dr. Reichert's negligence or malpractice and thus are insufficient to establish deliberate indifference. See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 ("Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner."); Perkins v. Kan. Dep't of Corr., 165 F.3d 803, 811 (10th Cir. 1999) ("A negligent failure to provide adequate medical care, even one constituting medical malpractice, does not give rise to a constitutional violation.").

2. Deficiencies in Records Management and Comprehension
Plaintiff alleges that SCF has records management problems and that Ms. Wilson is "partly to blame for disorganization, inaccuracy, and missing information." [#116 at 15, 16] Plaintiff further alleges that "[i]t took SCF medical staff a year to find [Plaintiff's] private provider records." [Id. at 15] Plaintiff, however, fails to identify any "substantial harm" that resulted [*36]  from this delay in obtaining his medical records. Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1210 (finding that delay in receiving medical care "only constitutes an Eighth Amendment violation where the plaintiff can show the delay resulted in substantial harm"). Instead, Plaintiff alleges only that he "believe[s] [the alleged records mismanagement] will result in disaster for [him]."19 [#116 at 15]
Furthermore, Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference with regard to obtaining, maintaining, and reviewing his medical records. Instead, the Second Amended Complaint includes numerous allegations indicating that the alleged records mismanagement and incomprehension resulted from negligence that Plaintiff and other medical staff took action to correct. [See, e.g., id. at 15 (alleging that Plaintiff "finally found a nurse who had been around long enough to know how to access medical record archives" and that nurse taught Dr. Reichert how to access the records), 17 (alleging that Plaintiff directed Dr. Reichert on where to find relevant information in the medical records)]. "When a [medical provider] provides treatment, albeit carelessly or inefficaciously, to a prisoner, he has not displayed a deliberate indifference to [*37]  the prisoner's needs, but merely a degree of incompetence which does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation." Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir.2001); see also Perkins, 165 F.3d at 811. The allegations do not support a finding that the alleged deficiencies with records management and comprehension were undertaken with "conscious[ ] disregard" to a substantial risk of serious harm. Self, 439 F.3d at 1231.

3. Failure to Implement Prior Treatment
Plaintiff alleges that, while serving a prior sentence, he saw specialists for his sleep apnea and intestinal disorder and "treatment [was] established . . . in accordance with specialist recommendations." [#116 at 16] Without specifically identifying those recommendations, Plaintiff contends that "all of those recommendations as modified should be followed now" and "[f]ailure to do so is a violation."20 [Id.] Similarly, in his briefing, Plaintiff argues that "[c]learly established law . . . says [Defendants] have to continue . . . treatment" prescribed by physicians and specialists during Plaintiff's prior sentence. [#164 at 12] Plaintiff, however, fails to cite any authority for this proposition and the Court is aware of none. Nor would such a bright line rule make sense as both the need for and effectiveness of specific [*38]  treatments often change over time. Moreover, the law is clear that a doctor's disagreement with and discontinuation of a prior course of treatment, standing alone, does not state a claim for deliberate indifference. See, e.g., Rascon v. Douglas, 718 F. App'x 587, 591 (10th Cir. 2017) ("Even if a different medical decision made almost two and one-half years after the original decision showed a disagreement about treatment, [i]t is well established that a difference of opinion between two doctors is insufficient" to support a deliberate-indifference claim. (quotation omitted)); Zackery v. Mesrobian, 299 F. App'x 598, 601 (7th Cir. 2008) (holding that "a difference of opinion among physicians is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference"); Hood v. Prisoner Health Servs., Inc., 180 F. App'x 21, 25 (10th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim where "an appropriate non-narcotic medication [was] offered as an alternative to the narcotic medication prescribed prior to plaintiff's incarceration"); Herrera v. Zavares, No. 09-CV-01229-MSK-KLM, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109222, 2010 WL 3853312, at *5 (D. Colo. Sept. 28, 2010) (finding that "an inmate must allege facts showing that the defendant's disagreement with another medical provider's judgment arises from something other than the defendant's good-faith medical judgment").
More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, prior to incarceration at SCF, as part of his treatment for the intestinal disease, he was instructed to have "a snack 3 times a day . . [*39]  . to make up for the more highly processed food that [Plaintiff] cannot eat from the kosher meals." [#116 at 17] Dr. Reichert initially "said he would decline to acknowledge the snack" and then replaced it with "a high-fiber snack 2 times per day." [Id.] Plaintiff contends that Dr. Reicher's decision constitutes deliberate indifference, because "[h]igh fiber snacks were proven the wrong treatment more than 20 years ago."21 [Id.] Plaintiff's disagreement with the course of treatment prescribed by Dr. Reichert is insufficient to support an Eighth Amendment claim. "At most, [Plaintiff's] allegations of incorrect treatment might establish malpractice, which also fails to establish an Eighth Amendment violation." Nasious v. Colorado, 495 F. App'x 899, 901 (10th Cir. 2012). Moreover, Plaintiff fails to allege any specific negative consequences that resulted from the high fiber snack Dr. Reichert prescribed.
Plaintiff also contends that, while at DRDC prior to being transferred to SCF, nurses took away his daytime sleep apnea machine that had been "mandated by physicians and specialists," because Plaintiff passed a test for COPD. [#116 at 15] Plaintiff states that he "want[s] it all replaced." [Id. at 18; see also id. at 20 (stating "I want my daytime equipment replaced")] Plaintiff [*40]  contends that "[i]nvoluntary sleeps happen to people during the day when they have conditions that do not permit proper sleep at night" and that sleep apnea can occur during this daytime sleep. [#116 at 20] Plaintiff, however, fails to allege that he has requested the replacement of his daytime sleep apnea machine, that any denial of that request constitutes more than a difference of opinion with the course of treatment for his sleep apnea, or that he has actually suffered any negative health consequences from not having access to the daytime sleep apnea machine. Plaintiff's allegations regarding his desire to have the daytime sleep apnea machine replaced thus do not support a claim for deliberate indifference.

4. Face Mask for Sleep Apnea Treatment System
Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Reichert and Mr. May "refuse to replace the worn out facemask that is an essential component in [Plaintiff's] sleep apnea machinery."22 [#116 at 17] Plaintiff argues that "even a lay person could recognize [the] need [for] routine replacement" of the facemask [#149 at 12], but Plaintiff does not allege any facts that support his conclusory allegation that the facemask needs to be replaced, such as the age of [*41]  the current facemask in relation to the manufacturer's recommendation for replacement. Nor does Plaintiff allege that the current facemask is damaged such that it no longer works or that he has suffered any adverse consequence as a result of Defendants' alleged refusal to replace the facemask.23
Moreover, allegations in the Second Amended Complaint make clear that Defendants have not actually refused Plaintiff's request to obtain a new facemask but instead Defendants merely "refuse to 'consider' a new face mask unless [Plaintiff] submit[s] to . . . another COPD test." [Id. at 18] Plaintiff contends that this is an "unreasonable condition," because COPD and sleep apnea are not related and thus "there is no need for [the] test." [Id.] Plaintiff speculates that the test "would most likely end with a false negative after which they would erroneously take away the rest of" Plaintiff's sleep apnea treatments. [Id.] Neither Plaintiff's disagreement about the need for the COPD test nor Plaintiff's speculation that the test results may lead to his sleep apnea treatment being taken away entirely support a claim for deliberative indifference. See, e.g., Williams v. Allred, 611 F. App'x 491, 495 (10th Cir. 2015) (rejecting argument that doctor's [*42]  "decision to examine [the plaintiff] before prescribing medication demonstrated deliberate indifference" and instead finding that it "demonstrated due diligence"); Perkins, 165 F.3d at 811 ("[A] prisoner who merely disagrees with a diagnosis or a prescribed course of treatment does not state a constitutional violation"); Brown v. Schmierer, No. CIV.A.08-3031-SAC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35277, 2008 WL 1884157, at *2 (D. Kan. Apr. 28, 2008) ("Plaintiff's bare claims of inadequate and negligent care, and his speculative concerns over future harm, fail to state any actionable claim of constitutional deprivation.").

5. Access to Medication
Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Ward fails to properly staff the times when inmates pick up their medications such that Plaintiff "had to sit outside in sub-zero snowing weather for as long as 2 hours at a time to get [his] medication" and that it became so burdensome to get medication that Plaintiff "quit taking the self[-]medication." [#116 at 19] Plaintiff further alleges that Mr. Ward's "ordering mistakes" resulted in Plaintiff "ha[ving] to go a day or 2 without medication" on several occasions. [Id.] These allegations, at most, establish Mr. Ward's negligence and Plaintiff's own choice not to take his medication—neither of which establishes a claim for deliberate indifference. See Perkins, 165 F.3d at 811 ("A negligent [*43]  failure to provide adequate medical care, even one constituting medical malpractice, does not give rise to a constitutional violation."); Luna v. Moon, No. 1:16-cv-00313-NONE-SAB(PC), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68177, 2020 WL 1904827, at *23 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2020) (finding that evidence did not support finding of deliberate indifference where Plaintiff chose not to take the medication that was prescribed), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198882, 2020 WL 6270630 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2020). Moreover, Plaintiff's generalized allegations of mismanagement fail to identify any "substantial harm" that resulted from the delay in obtaining his medications. Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1210.
Plaintiff also alleges that Dr. Reichert "deliberately neglected re-ordering" Plaintiff's medication for brain inflammation for four days. [#116 at 19] Plaintiff contends that, when he does not receive this medication, his "constant headache builds into the absolute worst pain imaginable." [Id. at 20] Plaintiff's conclusory allegation that Dr. Reichert "deliberately neglected" to order the medication is insufficient without supporting factual allegations. Plaintiff fails to allege any facts surrounding the event to support a finding that Dr. Reichert's conduct was, in fact, deliberate, rather than merely neglectful. See Jordan v. Doe, 15 F. App'x 564, 566 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding that "a conclusory allegation is not sufficient to make out an Eighth Amendment claim" but instead [*44]  plaintiff "must allege sufficiently specific facts to establish deliberate indifference"). Moreover, because Plaintiff has not alleged when the misconduct occurred or any of the surrounding circumstances, Plaintiff fails to provide "enough factual detail to provide 'fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'" Warnick v. Cooley, 895 F.3d 746, 751 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
Plaintiff further alleges that "[t]he magnesium-citrate [he is] supposed to get for bowel blockages has been replaced by a low grade version, of a different formulation than the prescription intended." [#116 at 19-20] Although Plaintiff alleges he was not provided his preferred medication, "he admits being given other medications, so his complaint amounts to merely a disagreement with [Defendants'] medical judgment concerning the most appropriate treatment." Gee v. Pacheco, 627 F.3d 1178, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010); see also Archer v. Simmons, 128 F. App'x. 716, 718-19 (10th Cir. 2005) (finding that plaintiff's allegation that medical staff substituted less-effective medications for his "prescribed medicine" failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim); Todd v. Bigelow, 497 F. App'x 839, 842 (10th Cir. 2012) ("[A] difference of opinion with the medical staff as to the optimal pain-management regimen does not amount to deliberate indifference."); Ledoux, 961 F.2d at 1537 ("Plaintiff's belief that he needed additional medication, other than that [*45]  prescribed by the treating physician, . . . [is] insufficient to establish a constitutional violation.").

6. Conclusion
In sum, Plaintiff "[c]learly . . . disagrees with [D]efendants' medical opinions and their prescribed courses of treatment for his various conditions, but such disagreement fails to establish an Eighth Amendment violation." Nasious, 495 F. App'x at 901. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff's allegations insufficient to plausibly allege an Eighth Amendment claim based upon inadequate medical care, and the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Motions be GRANTED to the extent they seek dismissal of Plaintiff's Claim Two.24

C. Failure to Reasonably Accommodate Disability
Claim Three alleges disability discrimination in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act ("RA") against the CDOC.25 Title II of the ADA states, in pertinent part, that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. The ADA "requires more than physical access to public entities: it requires public entities to provide meaningful access to their programs and services." Robertson v. Las Animas Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 500 F.3d 1185, 1195 (10th Cir. 2007) (emphasis in original) [*46]  (quotations omitted). Title II's provisions apply to prisoners. See Pa. Dep't of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1998). "Analysis of a claim under Title II of the ADA is identical to an analysis under the Rehabilitation Act." Kimble v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 925 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1182 (D. Colo. 2013) (citing Nielsen v. Moroni Feed Co., 162 F.3d 604, 608 n.7 (10th Cir. 1998)); Kimber v. Thiokol Corp., 196 F.3d 1092, 1102 (10th Cir. 1998)); see also Anderson v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 848 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1300 n.2 (D. Colo. 2012) ("The Rehabilitation Act is materially identical to and the model for the ADA[—]the elements are the same except the Rehabilitation Act requires that defendant receive federal funds." (quotations omitted)). Accordingly, the Court analyzes the Title II ADA claim and the RA claim together.
To state a claim under Title II, the plaintiff must allege that (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability, (2) who was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity's services, programs, or activities, and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of a disability."26 Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1193. "Courts have recognized three ways to establish a discrimination claim: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation."27 J.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 813 F.3d 1289, 1295 (10th Cir. 2016). Here, Plaintiff bases his claim upon an alleged failure to accommodate. [#116 at #149 at 15 (alleging that Plaintiff "[is] being denied the accommodations his . . . disabilities entitle [him] to under the ADA and RA")]
Pursuant to the Department of Justice's regulations implementing Title II,28 "[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability."29 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). In other words, "[a] public entity must provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA when it knows that the individual is disabled and requires an accommodation of some kind to participate in or receive the benefits of its services."30 J.V., 813 F.3d at 1299 (quotation omitted); see also Paine v. City of Chicago, No. 06 C 3173, 2009 WL 10687409, at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 21, 2009) ("Once an arrestee with a disability is in custody, the police have a duty to reasonably accommodate the arrestee's disability." (collecting cases)).
"[A] public entity is on notice that an individual needs an accommodation when it knows that an individual requires one, either because that need is obvious or because the individual requests an accommodation." J.V., 813 F.3d at 1299 (quotation omitted); see also Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197 ("When a disabled individual's need for an accommodation is obvious, the individual's failure to expressly 'request' one is not fatal to the ADA claim."). "[T]he critical component of the entity's knowledge [*48]  is that it is aware not just that the individual is disabled, but that the individual's disability affects his ability to receive the benefits of the entity's services." Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197 n.10.
In his response to the CDOC Motion, Plaintiff identifies accommodations that he seeks from the SCF medical program, the SCF food program, and the SCF general facility operation (or ADA coordinator). [#149 at 15] The Court addresses each category of accommodations in turn.

1. Medical Program Accommodations
From the SCF medical program, Plaintiff seeks the following accommodations: routine replacement of the facemask and distilled water for Plaintiff's sleep apnea treatment system, daytime sleep apnea equipment, and "access to specialists for various aspects of [his] condition." [Id.] The CDOC Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims seeking accommodations from the medical program should be dismissed because "inmates cannot use the ADA and RA to challenge the quality of their medical care or assert medical negligence claims." [#140 at 18 (citing Fitzgerald v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 403 F.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005))] The Court agrees.
The Supreme Court has noted that "the alleged deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate [an inmate's] disability-related needs in such fundamentals [*49]  as . . . medical care" may "constitute[] exclusion from participation in or . . . denial of the benefits of the prison's services, programs, or activities" under the ADA. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006) (alterations and quotations omitted). In determining whether the denial of medical treatment can give rise to an ADA claim, courts have distinguished between allegations of inadequate medical treatment, "versus claims alleging that a plaintiff was discriminatorily precluded from access to medical treatment altogether." Hughes v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 594 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1241 (D. Colo. 2009) (collecting cases). Generally, "the failure to provide medical treatment to a disabled prisoner, while perhaps raising Eighth Amendment concerns in certain circumstances, does not constitute an ADA violation." Rashad v. Doughty, 4 F. App'x 558, 560 (10th Cir. 2001) (collecting cases); see also Fitzgerald, 403 F.3d at 1144 (finding "purely medical decisions . . . do not ordinarily fall within the scope of the ADA or the [RA]"). "In contrast, the allegation that a disabled prisoner has been denied [medical] services that have been provided to other prisoners"—in other words, that the plaintiff has been denied medical treatment entirely—"may state an ADA claim." Rashad, 4 F. App'x at 560; see also Moore v. Prison Health Servs. Inc., 201 F.3d 448, 1999 WL 1079848, at *1 (10th Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision) (finding the ADA and RA afford disabled persons rights to programs and activities enjoyed by all, [*50]  not a general cause of action for challenging the medical treatment of underlying disabilities (collecting cases)).
Here, Plaintiff's requests for accommodations from the SCF medical program seek specific treatments for his alleged disabilities rather than accommodations that would permit him access to medical treatment. Plaintiff's claims seeking access to these accommodations—i.e., these forms of medical treatment—thus are properly asserted pursuant to the Eighth Amendment (and have been addressed above), not pursuant to the ADA or RA. See Rashad, 4 F. App'x at 560; Moore, 1999 WL 1079848, at *1.

2. Food Service Accommodation
From SCF food services, Plaintiff seeks an accommodation that would provide "a diet that will meet both medical and religious requirements." [#149 at 15] To the extent Plaintiff seeks a specific diet as an accommodation for his "medical . . . requirements," Plaintiff is seeking a specific medical treatment rather than an accommodation that would allow him access to medical treatment (or food services) generally. As such, Plaintiff's claim seeking access to a specific medical diet may be properly asserted pursuant to the Eighth Amendment, but not pursuant to the ADA or RA. See Rashad, 4 F. App'x at 560; Johnson v. Swibas, No. 14-CV-02258-BNB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154492, 2014 WL 5510930, at *3 (D. Colo. Oct. 31, 2014) ("[T]he denial of a medically-necessary, special diet to an inmate [*51]  does not implicate the ADA.").
To the extent Plaintiff seeks a specific diet as an accommodation for his "religious requirements," Plaintiff seeks an accommodation for his religious beliefs and not his disabilities. The failure to accommodate Plaintiff's request for a religious diet does not state a claim under the ADA or RA. Pursuant to the ADA and the RA, "an accommodation only is required when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of a disability." Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 751 (7th Cir.2006) (en banc) (emphasis omitted); see also Taylor v. Colo. Dep't of Health Care Policy & Fin., 811 F.3d 1230, 1236 (10th Cir. 2016) ("Colorado must modify its Medicaid programs only if [the plaintiff] could not otherwise obtain the same benefits made available to nondisabled individuals."); Mark H. v. Lemahieu, 513 F.3d 922, 937 (9th Cir.2008) (explaining that reasonable modifications are required under the RA only when "necessary to correct for instances in which qualified disabled people are prevented from enjoying 'meaningful access' to a benefit because of their disability" (quotation omitted)).

3. General Facility Accommodations
From the SCF general facility operation or ADA coordinator, Plaintiff seeks the following accommodations: (1) an extra time accommodation and either a reliable OCA or an electric wheelchair—i.e., a "mobility accommodation" and (2) a wheelchair [*52]  accessible cell. [#149 at 15] With regard to Plaintiff's request for a mobility accommodation, the CDOC Defendants argue that the Second Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff already is receiving an accommodation for mobility in the form of access to an OCA and thus "[b]ecause the ADA requires defendants to provide a reasonable accommodation—not the accommodation [Plaintiff] prefers—this allegation, too, fails to state a plausible ADA/RA claim." [#140 at 18] The Court agrees that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint with regard to his request for a mobility accommodation are insufficient to plausibly plead a claim under the ADA or RA.
Plaintiff alleges in the Second Amended Complaint that his accommodation for more time to move around the facility was replaced with an OCA and that he was told "there is an unwritten policy [at SCF] that being given an OCA . . . is the only accommodation there is." [#116 at 22] The Second Amended Complaint thus makes clear that Plaintiff is receiving a mobility accommodation. The ADA and RA require a public entity "to provide a 'reasonable accommodation, not the accommodation [the plaintiff] would prefer.'" Selenke v. Med. Imaging of Colorado, 248 F.3d 1249, 1263 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Rehling v. City of Chicago, 207 F.3d 1009, 1014 (7th Cir.2000)); see also Nunes v. Mass. Dep't of Corr., 766 F.3d 136, 146 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding, [*53]  in the context of a prisoner's claim against a prison system, that § 504 "entitle[s] [a disabled individual] to reasonable accommodations, not to optimal ones finely tuned to his preferences"); Brooks v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., No. 1:13-CV-02894-SKC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 229696, 2019 WL 8323948, at *9 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2019) (collecting cases for proposition that "a prisoner is not entitled to the best possible accommodation, but rather, only a reasonable accommodation which allows for meaningful access to the program or service").
With regard to the OCA accommodation that was provided, Plaintiff alleges that although "[t]here are a lot of alleged 'accommodations' an OCA is in theory supposed to fulfill[,] . . . all they actually do is push wheelchairs with staff refusing to make them reliable, even for that." [#116 at 22] This conclusory allegation is insufficient to allege that the OCA accommodation CDOC provided to Plaintiff was unreasonable. See Annenberg v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 818 F. App'x 674, 676 (9th Cir. 2020) (finding that plaintiff who already is receiving an accommodation must show "that the accommodation that was actually provided was unreasonable"). Plaintiff fails to identify what accommodations the OCA is supposed to be providing but is not, how frequently and with what duration that failure occurs, or what negative consequences, if any, have resulted. Even more important, [*54]  Plaintiff fails to identify any service, program, or activity to which Plaintiff is being denied access as a result of the inadequacy of the provided OCA accommodation.31
Finally, Plaintiff contends that CDOC violated the ADA and RA by failing to provide him with a wheelchair-accessible cell. [#149 at 15] Specifically, Plaintiff alleges in the Second Amended Complaint that he "ha[s] to share a 70 square foot cell with another man, [their] property, and [his] wheelchair" and that Plaintiff "cannot use the sink or toilet without getting into contortions that are painful." [#116 at 22] The CDOC Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot base an ADA or RA claim upon his need for a wheelchair-accessible cell, "because, as other courts have observed, 'a prison cell is neither an activity, nor a program, nor a service.'" [#140 at 19 (quoting Manning v. Quick, 16-CV-01387-CBS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111323, 2017 WL 3034624, at *5 (D. Colo. July 18, 2017))] The Court disagrees. In Manning, the plaintiff alleged a violation of the ADA based upon the prison's refusal to provide her "an ADA cell even though [she was] a high fall risk" and that court determined that allegation was insufficient to state a claim, because the cell itself was not an activity, program, or service. 2017 WL 3034624, at *5. Manning thus did not address an inmate's [*55]  need for a wheelchair-accessible cell and, as distinguished from Plaintiff here, does not appear to have involved an allegation concerning how the failure to accommodate the plaintiff's cell request impacted her ability to use the prison's facilities and her own daily activities. By contrast, Plaintiff here alleges that CDOC's failure to accommodate his request for a wheelchair-accessible cell interferes with his use of the cell's toilet and sink and thus impacts his corresponding daily activities. The Court thus finds Manning distinguishable, but, to the extent Manning may be read to hold that an ADA or RA claim cannot be based upon the failure to accommodate a cell accommodation, the Court respectfully disagrees.32 Numerous Courts have held that a prison's failure to accommodate an inmate's request for an accessible cell is sufficient to state a claim under the ADA and RA. See, e.g., Banks v. Patton, 743 F. App'x 690, 697 n.1 (7th Cir. 2018) (finding that defendant's argument "that placing an inmate in a cell with a toilet and bed is enough, even if the inmate cannot use either easily . . . is a dubious proposition because meaningful access is required" (emphasis in original)); Dinkins v. Corr. Med. Servs., 743 F.3d 633, 634 (8th Cir. 2014) (finding that "denials of meals and adequate housing [including denial of [*56]  request for accessible cell] by reason of his disability can form the basis for viable ADA and RA claims"); Ramirez v. Bernstein, No. 17 CV 3825 (VB), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 230264, 2020 WL 7230729, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2020) (finding allegation that plaintiff was denied reasonable accommodation, including wheelchair-accessible cell, sufficient to state a claim under ADA and RA); Cosby v. Rusi, No. 3:20CV459 (MPS), 2020 WL 3577482, at *6 (D. Conn. July 1, 2020) (finding alleged denial of accommodations, including "handicap accessible cell," sufficient to a state claim under ADA and RA).
The CDOC Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's claim based upon the failure to provide him a wheelchair-accessible cell fails because Plaintiff "does not allege he . . . requested . . . a single cell . . . [for] his alleged disabilities."33 [#140 at 19] As explained above, however, "[w]hen a disabled individual's need for an accommodation is obvious, the individual's failure to expressly 'request' one is not fatal" to his claim. Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197. Although a close call, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are sufficient to plausibly allege that Plaintiff's need for a wheelchair-accessible cell was obvious. Specifically, based upon the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint [*57]  and given that inmates live in a setting where they are observed by prison staff, one may reasonably infer that the CDOC was aware that (1) Plaintiff utilizes a wheelchair, (2) inmates with certain disabilities require "handicap designated cells," (3) Plaintiff was not provided such a cell despite his use of a wheelchair, because there is an insufficient quantity of those cells at SCF, and (4) Plaintiff is required to "get[ ] into contortions that are painful" to use the toilet and sink in his cell. [#116 at 22] The Court thus finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the CDOC had knowledge that Plaintiff's "disability limits h[is] ability to participate in or receive the benefits of [CDOC's] services." Robertson, 500 F.3d at 1197 n.10; see also Ulibarri v. City & Cty. of Denver, 742 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1215 (D. Colo. 2010) ("Given that his disability was obvious, the question of whether the Jail therefore should have known of [the] effect of the disability on [the plaintiff's] ability to participate in the Jail's programs and services should go to the jury.").

4. Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged an ADA and RA claim based upon the CDOC's failure to provide him the accommodation of a wheelchair-accessible cell but [*58]  finds that Plaintiff's ADA and RA claims otherwise fail. Accordingly, the Court respectfully recommends that the CDOC Motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART with respect to Claim Three and that Plaintiff's Claim Three should be dismissed except to the extent it asserts an ADA and RA claim against the CDOC for failing to accommodate his need for a wheelchair-accessible cell.

D. Religious Discrimination
Claim Four asserts religious discrimination in violation of the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 ("RLUIPA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc to 2000cc-5 against the CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm.34 [#116 at 22-25] Incarcerated individuals "retain fundamental constitutional rights," including "the reasonable opportunity to pursue one's religion as guaranteed by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment." Williams v. Wilkinson ("Williams"), 645 F. App'x 692, 703-04 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Makin v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 183 F.3d 1205, 1209 (10th Cir. 1999)). The right to free exercise of religion includes inmates' "constitutional right to a diet conforming to their religious beliefs." Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179, 1185 (10th Cir. 2002). "Congress enacted RLUIPA . . . in order to provide very broad protection for religious liberty." Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 356, 135 S. Ct. 853, 190 L. Ed. 2d 747 (2015) (quotation omitted). "Courts have recognized that, in the prison context, RLUIPA provides greater protections than the First Amendment." Fox v. Washington, 949 F.3d 270, 277 (6th Cir. 2020).
In his response to the CDOC Motion, Plaintiff identifies the following "substantial burdens on [his] beliefs" related to adequacy [*59]  of the kosher diet at SCF upon which Claim Four is based: (1) the cancellation of Plaintiff's kosher diet and the delay in restoring Plaintiff's kosher diet, including the denial of kosher meals for Sukkot; (2) the denial of Passover meals in 2018; (3) the participation of a white supremacist in the preparation of kosher meals; and (4) the inadequacy of the kosher diet offered to Plaintiff, in part as a result of Rabbi Rosskamm allegedly approving food and food preparation processes that are not kosher under Jewish law.35 [#149 at 17-18] The Court evaluates the sufficiency of the allegations supporting these alleged substantial burdens to state a claim, first, pursuant to RLUIPA, and then pursuant to the First Amendment.

1. The RLUIPA Claim
In relevant part, RLUIPA provides that:
No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution . . ., even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person—
(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling [*60]  governmental interest.
42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). Thus, a plaintiff asserting a RLUIPA claim must allege that he or she "wishes to engage in (1) a religious exercise (2) motivated by a sincerely held belief, which exercise (3) is subject to a substantial burden imposed by the government.36 Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1312 (10th Cir. 2010). Here, the CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm do not challenge the first two elements,37 but instead argue: (1) that Plaintiff's RLUIPA claims asserted against the Individual CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm in their individual capacities fail as a matter of law; (2) that Plaintiff's RLUIPA claims premised upon substantial burdens that are no longer in place are moot; and (3) that Plaintiff's allegations regarding the kosher diet he receives are inadequate to plausibly allege a substantial burden on his religious practice. [#140 at 20-23; #209 at 11-12] The Court addresses each argument in turn.

a. Individual Capacity RLUIPA Claims
In Sossamon v. Texas, the Supreme Court held that "[s]tates, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA because no statute expressly and unequivocally includes such a waiver." 563 U.S. 277, 293, 131 S. Ct. 1651, 179 L. Ed. 2d 700 (2011). As a result, "[t]he only relief available [*61]  to [a plaintiff] under RLUIPA is declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants in their official capacities." Warner v. Patterson, 534 F. App'x 785, 788 (10th Cir. 2013); Pfeil v. Lampert, 603 F. App'x 665, 668 (10th Cir. 2015) ("RLUIPA is limited to official capacity claims for equitable relief."). Plaintiff thus may not assert RLUIPA claims against Rabbi Rosskamm and the Individual CDOC Defendants in their individual capacities. See Stewart v. Beach, 701 F.3d 1322, 1335 (10th Cir. 2012) ("[T]here is no cause of action under RLUIPA for individual-capacity claims.").

b. RLUIPA Claims Based Upon Past Conduct
Similarly, because Plaintiff may only obtain equitable relief, his RLUIPA claims are moot to the extent they are based upon alleged substantial burdens that are no longer in place. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-3(e) ("A government may avoid the preemptive force of [the statute] by changing the policy or practice that results in a substantial burden on religious exercise . . . or by any other means that eliminates the substantial burden"). Specifically, Plaintiff's RLUIPA claim premised upon the cancellation of his kosher diet, the denial of meals for Passover in 2018, and the participation of a white supremacist in the preparation of his kosher meals are moot, because the Second Amended Complaint makes clear that these alleged substantial burdens are no longer in place. [*62]  [See #116 at 24 (alleging that Plaintiff was denied meals for Passover in 2018, that Plaintiff's kosher diet was improperly cancelled but then restored in December 2019, and that "for a while," a white supremacist was involved in the preparation of meals)] "Given that the burden on [Plaintiff's] religious exercise [by these practices] has been lifted, and the only available relief against [Defendants] is prospective, there is nothing to be gained in the real world by continuing to litigate" Plaintiff's RLUIPA claims based upon denial of Passover meals in 2018, the cancelation of his kosher diet or the involvement of the white supremacist in the preparation of his meals. AlAmiin v. Morton, 528 F. App'x 838, 842 (10th Cir. 2013).

c. RLUIPA Claim Based Upon Ongoing Conduct
Plaintiff's contention that his kosher diet is inadequate, including because Rabbi Rosskamm approves food and food preparation processes that are not actually kosher, however, is allegedly ongoing. [See #116 at 25 (alleging that Rabbi Rosskamm "[is] approving foods and [food] handling processes he knows are not kosher")] To successfully state an RLUIPA claim based upon the allegedly inadequate diet, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that it imposes a substantial burden on his [*63]  religious practice. The "substantial burden" inquiry focuses only on "the coercive impact the government's actions [have] on the individual claimant's ability to engage in a religious exercise, as he understands that exercise and the terms of his faith." Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F.3d 48, 55 (10th Cir. 2014).
The Tenth Circuit "has explained that a burden on a religious exercise rises to the level of being 'substantial' when (at the very least) the government (1) requires the plaintiff to participate in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief, (2) prevents the plaintiff from participating in an activity motivated by a sincerely held religious belief, or (3) places considerable pressure on the plaintiff to violate a sincerely held religious belief—for example, by presenting an illusory or Hobson's choice where the only realistically possible course of action available to the plaintiff trenches on sincere religious exercise." Id. With regard to the third category, the Tenth Circuit explained that "a burden can be 'substantial' even if it does not compel or order the claimant to betray a sincerely held religious belief" but instead "[i]t is enough that the claimant is presented with a choice in which he faces considerable [*64]  pressure to abandon the religious exercise at issue." Id. In other words, "a 'substantial burden' need not be a complete or total one." Id.
Specifically with regard to the failure to provide a religious diet, the Tenth Circuit has found that "the failure to provide [the claimant] with a [religious] diet will either prevent him from exercising his sincerely held religious belief or force him to make the Hobson's choice of eating a diet contrary to his beliefs or not eating at all." Williams, 645 F. App'x at 702; see also Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1317. The Tenth Circuit has cautioned, however, that "every single presentation of a meal an inmate considers impermissible" does not "constitute[ ] a substantial burden on an inmate's religious exercise." Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1321. Thus, "[w]hile a single or sporadic service of inedible religious meals does not rise to the level of substantial burden," the Tenth Circuit "ha[s] recognized that 'as the frequency of presenting unacceptable foods increases, at some point the situation would rise to the level of a substantial burden.'" Blair v. Raemisch, 804 F. App'x 909, 919 (10th Cir. 2020) (quoting Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1321).
Here, Plaintiff does not allege that he is currently being refused a kosher diet, but instead alleges that the food he is served as part of that diet is not actually kosher or nutritionally [*65]  adequate. The CDOC Defendants argue that Plaintiff "alleges no facts to plausibly support his allegation that the kosher diet he receives 'is not kosher'" and that "the specific facts he alleges plausibly infer—at most—minor incidents or complaints about kosher meals that fail to state a plausible RLUIPA claim." [#140 at 21 (emphasis in original)] The Court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that the food he receives as part of his kosher diet is not actually kosher, because "[t]here is no Jewish person present with inmates that pre[pare] . . . [the] kosher meals, though required by Jewish law" and "[n]o one knows how to clean to kosher standards." [#116 at 10-11] Plaintiff further contends that the kosher diet he is served "is currently 90% highly processed 'food-like substances'" and such foods "cannot be considered . . . kosher."38 [Id. at 10] As a result, Plaintiff contends that he "transgress[es] against Hashem (God) every time [he] eat[s]." [#116 at 25] Although the CDOC Defendants contend that these allegations are too conclusory to plausibly support a claim, the Court finds them sufficient at this stage to plausibly allege that Plaintiff sincerely believes that the food he is being [*66]  served as part of his kosher diet is not actually kosher,39 and thus "force[s] him to make the Hobson's choice of eating a diet contrary to his beliefs or not eating at all."40 Williams, 645 F. App'x at 702.

d. Conclusion
The Court thus finds Plaintiff's allegations sufficient to state a RLUIPA claim only with respect to Plaintiff's allegations that the kosher diet he currently receives places a substantial burden on the exercise of his religion. As explained above, Plaintiff's RLUIPA claim may only be asserted against the CDOC and individuals in their official capacities. The only individuals sued in their official capacities who are alleged to have responsibility for Plaintiff's diet are Ms. Crockett and Mr. Zwirn.41 Because Mr. Zwirn is alleged to be the "Former Head of SCF Food Services" and to have left that position in 2019 [#116 at 3, 11], the Second Amended Complaint does not plausibly allege that Mr. Zwirn has the authority to provide the requested prospective injunctive relief. See, e.g., West v. Denver Cty. Jail Warden, No. 07-CV-00226-REB-KLM, 2008 WL 732600, at *6 (D. Colo. Mar. 18, 2008) (finding that plaintiff's request for injunction "must fail because the named Defendants lack the authority to provide Plaintiff with the relief he desires"); Johnson v. Ward, No. 20-CV-00447-PAB-MEH, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2956, 2021 WL 78876, at *8 (D. Colo. Jan. 7, 2021) (same).
The Court thus respectfully RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's RLUIPA claim be DISMISSED except to the extent it asserts a claim against the CDOC and Ms. Crockett in her official capacity based upon the substantial burden the kosher diet he receives allegedly places on the exercise of his religion.

2. The First Amendment Claim
"[I]n order to allege a constitutional violation based on a free exercise claim, a prisoner-plaintiff must survive a two-step inquiry." Kay v. Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007). "First, the prisoner-plaintiff must . . . [allege] that a prison regulation [or practice] substantially burdened . . . sincerely-held religious beliefs." Id. (quotation omitted). "With respect to the second inquiry in a free exercise claim, 'prison-official defendants may identify the legitimate penological interests that justified the impinging conduct,' and the court must apply a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of the regulation." Williams, 645 F. App'x at 704 (quoting Kay, 500 F.3d at 1218-19). However, "only the first of these inquiries is relevant at the motion-to-dismiss stage." Id. (citing Kay, 500 F.3d at 1219).
Thus, "[t]o state a claim for violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, a plaintiff must plead facts that plausibly show or allow the inference that the prison regulation or action at issue 'substantially burdened [*68]  sincerely-held religious beliefs.'"42 Khan v. Barela, 808 F. App'x 602, 614 (10th Cir. 2020) (quoting Kay, 500 F.3d at 1218). Here, Defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations with regard to his sincerely-held belief to maintain a kosher diet. The Court thus first considers whether the Second Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that the Defendants' alleged failures with regard to Plaintiff's kosher diet "substantially burdened" his religious exercise and then turns to the alternative arguments for dismissal of Plaintiff's First Amendment claim made by the CDOC Defendants and Rabbi Rosskamm.

a. Substantial Burden
"To determine whether plaintiff has made an initial showing of a substantial burden on religious exercise, courts use the same test under the First Amendment as is used under RLUIPA." Orwig v. Williams, No. 16-CV-00781-PAB-SKC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168556, 2019 WL 4751775, at *8 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2019); see also Strope v. Cummings ("Strope"), 381 F. App'x 878, 881 (10th Cir. 2010) ("While the analysis under [the First Amendment and RLUIPA] differs in some respects, the principle dispositive here is the same: [the plaintiff] must show that defendants' conduct imposed a substantial burden on his religious practice."); Khan, 808 F. App'x at 614 n.12 (finding that Tenth Circuit's "discussion of substantial burden in . . . RLUIPA cases applies as well to a First Amendment free-exercise claim"). Thus, as in the context of a RLUIPA claim, "a burden on a religious exercise rises to the level of being [*69]  'substantial' when . . . the government (1) requires the plaintiff to participate in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief, (2) prevents the plaintiff from participating in an activity motivated by a sincerely held religious belief, or (3) places considerable pressure on the plaintiff to violate a sincerely held religious belief." Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55. Isolated or sporadic violations, however, generally are insufficient to support a finding of substantial burden. See Gallagher v. Shelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1070 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding allegations of "isolated" violations of kosher requirements insufficient to state free-exercise violation); Abdulhaseeb, 600 F.3d at 1321 (finding evidence of only one specific incident of items being placed on the plaintiff's tray that rendered all of the food on the tray contaminated and inedible for religious purposes insufficient to support a finding of substantial burden).
The Court thus finds that Plaintiff's allegations that all of the items he is served as part of the kosher diet are not actually kosher as a result of their composition and the way they are prepared sufficient to plausibly allege a substantial burden under the First Amendment for the same reasons explained above with regard to Plaintiff's RLUIPA claim. The Court finds that this [*70]  claim is properly asserted against the CDOC and Ms. Crockett in her official capacity to the extent it seeks injunctive relief and against Ms. Crockett and Rabbi Rosskamm in their individual capacities to the extent it seeks monetary damages.43
The Court also finds Plaintiff's allegation that Ms. Crockett improperly cancelled Plaintiff's kosher diet in June 2019 and did not take action to correct it until October 9, 2019 and Plaintiff's allegation that Mr. Clarkson did not restore the kosher diet until December 2019 despite Ms. Crockett's October 9, 2019 directive to do so, sufficient to plausibly allege a substantial burden to his religious practice. [#116 at 23-24] In further support of this claim, Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Clarkson denied him kosher meals—after Ms. Crockett's directive to restore his kosher diet—for the religious holiday of Sukkot in October 2019, during which "meals are consumed in a tent[-]like structure" and the "meals have to be kosher."44 [Id. at 23] Plaintiff alleges that as a result of the cancellation and delay, he "went without food except for hand[-]outs from other inmates for almost six months." [#116 at 24] Plaintiff thus alleges that he was denied access [*71]  to a kosher diet, including meals for the celebration of Sukkot, and thus plausibly alleges that Ms. Crockett and Mr. Clarkson "prevent[ed] the plaintiff from participating in an activity motivated by a sincerely held religious belief." Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55. Moreover, "these were not isolated or sporadic occurrences," but rather occurred for a continuous period of six months. Blair, 804 F. App'x at 918-19 (finding allegations sufficient to allege substantial burden where plaintiff alleged that inedible items were served as part of the religious diet "nineteen out of every twenty-eight days, or two out of every three days"); see also Khan, 808 F. App'x at 615 (finding allegations sufficient to allege substantial burden where defendants offered food that did not meet religious requirements for holiday that lasted "approximately one month").
The Court finds Plaintiff's allegations with regard to the denial of "Passover meals" in 2018 and the participation of a white supremacist in the preparation of kosher meals insufficient to establish a substantial burden on his religious practice. With regard to the denial of "Passover meals" in 2018, Plaintiff alleges only that Ms. Fuller and Ms. Nygaard denied the meals "because [Plaintiff] did not sign up for them 6 months [*72]  ahead of time." [#116 at 24] As distinguished from his allegations with regard to the Sukkot holiday, Plaintiff does not allege that the consumption of the "Passover meals" was itself an activity motivated by a sincerely held religious belief and, regardless, this one, isolated incident is insufficient to establish a substantial burden. See Gallagher, 587 F.3d at 1070 (finding allegation that multiple requests for meal accommodations for religious holidays were not approved until after the holidays had passed insufficient to establish substantial burden); Strope, 381 F. App'x at 882-83 (finding allegation that plaintiff was denied permission to attend religious services "on three consecutive Tuesday nights" due to inadvertently being left off applicable list insufficient to establish substantial burden). With regard to Plaintiff's claim regarding the involvement of a white supremacist in meal preparation, Plaintiff fails to include any supporting factual allegations such as (1) the duration of the white supremacist's involvement; (2) any of the named defendants' knowledge of that involvement or reaction thereto;45 or (3) in what way the white supremacist allegedly was "sabotaging" his kosher meals. Plaintiff's allegations regarding the involvement [*73]  of the white supremacist thus are insufficient to state a First Amendment claim. See Robbins, 519 F.3d at 1249-50 (finding that allegations must "make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations against the state").
The Court thus finds Plaintiff's allegations sufficient to plausibly allege a substantial burden in violation of the First Amendment with respect to Plaintiff's allegations regarding the denial of a kosher diet between June 2019 and December 2019, including the denial of kosher meals for Sukkot, and the deficiencies in the kosher diet he is provided at SCF.

b. Discriminatory Purpose
The CDOC Defendants argue, in a footnote, that to state a First Amendment claim, Plaintiff "must plead sufficient factual matter to show [the] CDOC Defendants acted with discriminatory purpose" but Plaintiff "fails to include any allegations plausibly indicating CDOC Defendants' discriminatory purpose under the First Amendment."46 [#140 at 19-20 n.5] The Court disagrees. The only case the CDOC Defendants cite for this proposition is Carr v. Zwally, 760 F. App'x 550 (10th Cir. 2019). The court in Carr, however, did not evaluate the plaintiff's Free Exercise claim as one alleging a policy [*74]  or practice that placed a substantial burden on the plaintiff's religious exercise. Instead the Carr court construed the plaintiff's claim as one for invidious discrimination. Id. at 554. In that context, the Court noted that "[t]he Supreme Court has stated that '[w]here the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First . . . Amendment[ ], [its] decisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose.'" Id. (emphasis added) (alterations in original) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676). The analysis of a claim for invidious discrimination, which considers whether the complained-of action was taken "not for a neutral . . . reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of . . . religion," id. at 555 (quotation and emphasis omitted), is entirely different from the "substantial burden" inquiry, which focuses only on "the coercive impact the government's actions [have] on the individual claimant's ability to engage in a religious exercise, as he understands that exercise and the terms of his faith," Yellowbear, 741 F.3d at 55 (emphasis added). As a panel of the Tenth Circuit explained in Blair, "whether CDOC intentionally pressured [the plaintiff] to abandon his religious diet is not the proper focus in [*75]  assessing whether [the plaintiff] sufficiently alleged substantial burden under the 'pressure' test," because the "inquiry focuses only on the coercive impact of the government's actions."47 804 F. App'x at 918 (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted). The Court thus finds that Plaintiff was not required to allege "purposeful discrimination" to allege a claim that Defendants' policies or practices imposed a substantial burden on the free exercise of his religion.

c. Rabbi Rosskamm's Arguments for Dismissal
Although Rabbi Rosskamm does not make any arguments specific to Plaintiff's First Amendment claim, he argues generally that Plaintiff's claims against him fail because the allegations are insufficient to plausibly allege either: (1) that Rabbi Rosskamm is a state actor or (2) that Rabbi Rosskamm personally participated in the alleged violations. [#209 at 4-7] The Court addresses each in turn.
"To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person [*76]  acting under color of state law." West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1988). "The traditional definition of acting under color of state law requires that the defendant in a § 1983 action have exercised power possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law." Id. at 49.
In West, the Supreme Court found that a physician who contracted with the state to provide medical care to state inmates acted under color of state law for purposes of a Section 1983 claim. Id. at 54-55. The Supreme Court explained that, because "[a]n inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs [and] if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met . . .[,] the State has a constitutional obligation, under the Eighth Amendment, to provide adequate medical care to those whom it has incarcerated." Id. at 54 (quotation omitted). The state contracted with the physician (and other medical providers) and deferred to their judgment to fulfill that constitutional obligation and thus the physician "is authorized and obligated to treat prison inmates," "does so clothed with the authority of state law," and "is a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor." Id. at 55 (quotations omitted). That the physician had a non-exclusive contractual—rather [*77]  than employment—relationship with the state was of no consequence. Id. at 56-57. Instead, "the dispositive issue concerns the relationship among the State, the physician, and the prisoner"—e.g., "[t]he State bore an affirmative obligation to provide adequate medical care to [the plaintiff]; the State delegated that function to [the contracted physician]; and [the physician] voluntarily assumed that obligation by contract." Id. at 56.
The same analysis is equally applicable here. The state bears an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide prisoners "a diet conforming to their religious beliefs." Beerheide, 286 F.3d at 1185. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that the state delegated that function to Rabbi Rosskamm and that he assumed it. [#116 at 3 (alleging that Rabbi Rosskamm is a "policymaker" and "is supposed to assure compliance with kosher laws"), 25 (alleging that Rabbi Rosskamm "approv[es] foods and handling processes")] Rabbi Rosskamm's actions in approving food and handling processes thus "was state action fairly attributable to the State," and Rabbi Rosskamm "therefore acted under color of state law for purposes of § 1983." West, 487 U.S. at 57. Although Plaintiff does not expressly allege that Rabbi Rosskamm contracted with the state [*78]  to undertake these obligations, that is unnecessary. "Regardless whether [Rabbi Rosskamm] contracted directly with the [state], the determinative fact is that he was delegated . . . [the state's] constitutional duty to provide prisoners at the jail with a diet conforming to their religious requirements."48 Woodstock v. Shaffer, 169 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1171 (D. Colo. 2016). The Court thus finds the allegations sufficient to plausibly allege that Rabbi Rosskamm was acting under color of state law in approving food and food handling policies for the kosher diet.
Rabbi Rosskamm also argues that Plaintiff's claims against him fail, "because [Plaintiff] has failed to allege Rabbi Rosskamm was personally involved in any of the specific acts of which he now complains." [#209 at 6] "In order for liability to arise under § 1983, a defendant's direct personal responsibility for the claimed deprivation of a constitutional right must be established." Trujillo v. Williams, 465 F.3d 1210, 1227 (10th Cir. 2006). In other words, "[t]here must be an affirmative link between the alleged constitutional violation and each defendant's participation, control or direction, or failure to supervise." Aguilar v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., Civil Action No. 16-00509-GPG, 2016 WL 1626024, at *1 (D. Colo. Apr. 25, 2016) (citing Butler v. City of Norman, 992 F.2d 1053, 1055 (10th Cir. 1993)).
Rabbi Rosskamm contends that "there is no allegation Rabbi Rosskamm had power to actually affect what foods prison officials [*79]  served [Plaintiff]." [#209 at 7] The Court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Rabbi Rosskamm is a "policymaker" who "is supposed to assure compliance with kosher laws." [#116 at 3] Moreover, Plaintiff expressly alleges that Rabbi Rosskamm is "fraudulently approving foods and handling processes he knows are not kosher." [Id. at 25] The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege that Rabbi Rosskamm has direct personal responsibility for the inclusion of non-kosher food in Plaintiff's kosher meals and thereby direct personal responsibility for placing a substantial burden on Plaintiff's religious practices.

d. Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged a First Amendment claim: (1) against the CDOC and Ms. Crockett in her official capacity for injunctive relief and against Ms. Crockett and Rabbi Rosskamm in their individual capacities for monetary damages based upon the alleged deficiencies in his current kosher diet, and (2) against Ms. Crockett and Mr. Clarkson in their individual capacities for monetary damages based upon the denial of access to a kosher diet, including meals for the celebration of Sukkot, between June 2019 and December 2019.49 The Court finds [*80]  the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint insufficient to state a First Amendment violation based upon any of the other "substantial burdens" identified in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.
Accordingly, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's First Amendment claim be DISMISSED except to the extent it asserts a claim against the CDOC, Ms. Crockett, and Rabbi Rosskamm based upon the alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet and against Ms. Crockett and Mr. Clarkson based upon the alleged denial of a kosher diet from June 2019 through December 2019.

E. Fourteenth Amendment Claim for Taking Property
Claim Five alleges that CDOC and Ms. Goheen removed money from Plaintiff's inmate account and that Mr. Custer removed property from Plaintiff's cell without providing "a due process hearing before the taking." [#116 at 25-27] Property rights are protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. "Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of liberty or property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the . . . Fourteenth Amendment." Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976) (quotations omitted). "Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections [*81]  as the particular situation demands." Id. at 334 (quotation and alteration omitted). The Tenth Circuit has "held that, '[t]o assess whether an individual was denied procedural due process, courts must engage in a two-step inquiry: (1) did the individual possess a protected interest such that the due process protections were applicable; and, if so, then (2) was the individual afforded an appropriate level of process.'" Brown v. Montoya, 662 F.3d 1152, 1167 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Merrifield v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 654 F.3d 1073, 1078 (10th Cir.2011)). "Although the exact procedures required by the Constitution depend on the circumstances of a given case, the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Pater v. City of Casper, 646 F.3d 1290, 1298 (10th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted).
"[A]n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by a state employee does not constitute a [due-process] violation . . . if a meaningful post[-]deprivation remedy for the loss is available," and "the state's action is not complete until and unless it provides or refuses to provide a suitable post[-]deprivation remedy." Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984). However, "post[-]deprivation remedies do not satisfy due process where a deprivation of property is caused by conduct pursuant to established state procedure, rather than random and unauthorized action." [*82]  Id. at 532.
Under Hudson, a prisoner's complaint must allege facts sufficient to plausibly allege either: (1) that the taking was predictable or authorized by an established state procedure or (2) the lack of an adequate post-deprivation state remedy.50 See Stengel v. N.M. Corr. Dep't, 640 F. App'x 701, 704 (10th Cir. 2016) (affirming dismissal where plaintiff did not allege either "an established state procedure" or that the taking was predictable, and did not allege the lack of meaningful post-deprivation state remedies); Durre v. Dempsey, 869 F.2d 543, 548 (10th Cir. 1989) (per curiam) ("In order to state a claim under § 1983, a complaint must allege facts sufficient to show . . . the lack of an adequate state remedy.") A plaintiff may not satisfy this requirement by resorting to conclusory or speculative allegations. Stengel, 640 F. App'x at 704. For example, in Durre, the Tenth Circuit rejected the plaintiff's conclusory allegation that indigency, lack of counsel, and confinement prevented him from commencing a state court action, because he did not allege that "they ha[d] in fact denied him an adequate state remedy." 869 F.2d at 548 (emphasis in original); cf. Freeman v. Dep't of Corr., 949 F.2d 360, 362 (10th Cir. 1991) (reversing dismissal for failure to allege inadequacy of state remedy where plaintiff alleged that "he tried to make use of state procedures, but the state court never responded to any of his inquiries [*83]  as to the status of his case" and "prison officials, either through deception or promises not kept, wrongfully caused him to lose those state procedures").
Here, the Second Amended Complaint includes no allegations—let alone plausible allegations—that either the prison grievance process or the available state remedies were unavailable to Plaintiff.51 In his response to the CDOC Motion, Plaintiff argues that he was entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing, because the alleged takings "involve[d] 'established procedure,' 'policy,' 'predictability,' or it was 'authorized.'" [#149 at 18] The allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, however, do not support such a finding. Instead, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that money was taken out of his inmate account to pay child support and court fees in violation of the Social Security Act, Colorado law, and the order establishing the obligation to repay the court fees. [#116 at 25-26] Moreover, the Tenth Circuit has found that "it would be impractical for the prison to provide pre-deprivation proceedings to an inmate prior to the deduction of [payments] from his account, and because requiring such proceedings 'for what are essentially ministerial matters would [*84]  significantly increase transaction costs.'" Tijerina v. Patterson, 507 F. App'x 807, 810 (10th Cir. 2013) (quoting Tillman v. Lebanon Cnty. Corr. Facility, 221 F.3d 410, 422 (3d Cir.2000)).
Similarly, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that Mr. Custer took property from Plaintiff's cell following a "shakedown" of the cell and in violation of the rules regarding what inmates are permitted to keep in their cells. Plaintiff does not identify any policy or procedure pursuant to which the property was confiscated. "[I]ndividual correctional officers' alleged practice of arbitrarily seizing inmates' property with scant justification is not the type of established state procedure under which the state can predict precisely when the loss will occur and thus provide a hearing beforehand." Frazier v. Flores, 571 F. App'x 673, 676 (10th Cir. 2014) (quotation omitted).
Accordingly, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the CDOC Motion be GRANTED to the extent it seeks the dismissal of Claim Five.52 See, e.g., Durre, 869 F.2d at 548; Payne v. Friel, 266 F. App'x 724, 727 (10th Cir. 2008) (affirming dismissal for failure to state a "property-seizure claim because [the plaintiff] failed to allege insufficient post-deprivation procedure"); Scott v. Crowley Cty. Corr. Facility, 76 F. App'x 878, 880 (10th Cir. 2003) (confirming dismissal of takings claim as frivolous where plaintiff failed to explain, even if grievance procedure was insufficient, "why he could not bring a state court action seeking damages for the loss of [*85]  his property, under a theory of conversion").

F. First Amendment Claim for Denial of Access to Courts
Liberally construed, Claim Six alleges a violation of the right of access to the Courts. [#116 at 27-28] Inmates have a constitutional right of access to the courts.53 Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 350, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996). To assert a claim for denial of access to the courts, the plaintiff "must show that any denial or delay of access to the court prejudiced him in pursuing litigation." Treff v. Galetka, 74 F.3d 191, 194 (10th Cir. 1996). With regard to prison law libraries and legal assistance programs, the Supreme Court has held that they "are not ends in themselves, but only the means for ensuring a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts." Lewis, 518 U.S. at 351 (quotation omitted). Thus, to state a claim based upon alleged deficiencies in access to the law library, the plaintiff must plausibly allege "that the alleged shortcomings in the library . . . hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim." Id.
Here, although the Second Amended Complaint alleges that, due to the COVID-19 response, Plaintiff "do[es] not have any access to the law library or its resources what so ever" [#116 at 27-28],54 the Second Amended Complaint does not allege any injury Plaintiff [*86]  has suffered as a result of the limitation on his access to legal research materials.55 As the docket in this case makes apparent, Plaintiff "has filed numerous complaints, motions, and [other filings] with the Court, amply demonstrating that his right of access to the courts has not been hindered." Stout v. Seitz, No. 17-cv-01904-GPG, 2017 WL 10237465, at *2 (D. Colo. Dec. 6, 2017); see also COTNER v. KNIGHT, 61 F.3d 915, 1995 WL 441408, at *13 (10th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision) ("[A]s evidenced by the [p]laintiff's numerous pleadings within this case alone, he has not been denied access to the courts."). With regard to the instant Motions, Plaintiff filed lengthy responses to each of the motions and then also filed sur-replies with respect to each motion. In addition to the briefing on the instant Motions, Plaintiff has filed numerous motions and briefs regarding his request for injunctive relief. [See, e.g., #89, 114, 125, 174, 202, 240]
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged a claim for denial of access to the Courts, and the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the CDOC Motion be GRANTED to the extent it seeks to dismiss Claim Six.56 See, e.g., Gee, 627 F.3d 1178, 1191 (10th Cir. 2010) (finding allegations that defendants "engaged in confiscating, reviewing, and hindering access to his legal files, hindering his communications [*87]  with a jailhouse lawyer, denying him access to a law library, and interfering with his legal mail" insufficient to state a claim, because "a prisoner must demonstrate actual injury from interference with his access to the courts—that is, that the prisoner was frustrated or impeded in his efforts to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim concerning his conviction or his conditions of confinement"); Carr, 760 F. App'x at 556-57 (finding allegations insufficient where plaintiff failed to allege "anything regarding the nature or objectives of his trial preparations, or specifically how the loss of his legal property scuttled those preparations").

G. Plaintiff's Claims Against GTL
Plaintiff also asserts Claim Five against GTL (Global Tel*Link Corporation), which has not yet appeared in this action.57 Plaintiff has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915. [#4] 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) requires a court to dismiss sua sponte an action at any time if the action is frivolous, fails to state a claim for relief, or if the plaintiff seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. The Court applies the same legal standard applied to a motion filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to determine whether an action fails to state a claim [*88]  pursuant to Section 1915(e)(2)—i.e., whether "the specific allegations in the complaint . . . plausibly support a legal claim for relief." Hooks v. Atoki, 983 F.3d 1193, 1200 (10th Cir. 2020) (quotation omitted).
With regard to GTL, the Second Amended Complaint alleges only: (1) that GTL "acts in individual capacity under color of state law" [#116 at 6] and (2) that "[e]ver since defendant GTL came on the scene a $3.00 charge is being taken for every deposit other than state pay" and "[t]hat $3.00 does not buy anything" but rather "is money being stolen" [id. at 26]. These bare and conclusory allegations with regard to GTL clearly are insufficient to plausibly allege a due process claim, including because, as discussed above, Plaintiff has not alleged that state remedies are unavailable. See United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 63, 110 S. Ct. 387, 107 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1989) (holding that "a reasonable user fee is not a taking if it is imposed for the reimbursement of the cost of government services"); Durre, 869 F.2d at 548 ("In order to state a claim under § 1983, a complaint must allege facts sufficient to show deprivation, in this case the lack of an adequate state remedy.").
Accordingly, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's claim against GTL be DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).

IV. CONCLUSION

(7) The CDOC Motion be GRANTED to the extent it seeks the dismissal of Claim Four as to the CDOC, Ms. Crockett, and Mr. Clarkson except DENIED to the extent it asserts (1) a RLUIPA claim against the CDOC and Ms. Crockett in her official capacity based upon the alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet and (2) a First Amendment claim against the CDOC and Ms. Crockett based upon the alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet and against Ms. Crockett and Mr. Clarkson based upon the alleged denial of a kosher diet from June 2019 through December 2019 and that Claim Four be DISMISSED as to the CDOC, Ms. Crockett, and Mr. Clarkson except as to those specific portions of Claim Four;
(8) The Rosskamm Motion be GRANTED to the extent it seeks the dismissal of Claim Four as to Rabbi Rosskamm except DENIED to the extent it asserts a First Amendment claim against Rabbi [*91]  Rosskamm based upon the alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet and that Claim Four be DISMISSED as to Rabbi Rosskamm except as to that specific portion of Claim Four;
(9) Plaintiff's claims against Defendant GTL (Global Tel*Link Corporation) be DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2); and
