Opinion



UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court on Defendant Fayette County, Georgia's Motion for Summary Judgment. [Doc. 36]. For the reasons set forth below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the motion be GRANTED.
On January 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed her judicial complaint against Defendant, alleging in Count I, violation of the Americans with Disability Act ("ADA") Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., for not accommodating her disability1; in Count II, violation of the ADA, for discriminating against her due to her disability; in Count III, violation of the ADA, for retaliating by terminating her; in Count IV, violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. ("ADEA") for terminating her; and in Count V, violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. ("FMLA"), for retaliating [*2]  against her. [Doc. 1].
After an extended discovery period, Defendant filed the pending motion. [Doc. 36]. Plaintiff responded, [Doc. 47], and Defendant replied, [Doc. 50]. The issues being fully briefed, the matter is now ripe for recommended adjudication.

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue as to any material fact is present, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., 443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2006) ("Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party."). The moving party carries the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). A fact is "material" if it "might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The moving party may also meet its burden by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support an element of the case on which the nonmoving party bears the burden of proof. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. "Only when that burden has been met does [*3]  the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The nonmoving party is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmovant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. "[F]acts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id. If the record does not blatantly contradict the nonmovant's version of events, the court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also EPL Inc. v. USA Fed. Credit Union, 173 F.3d 1356, 1362 (11th Cir. 1999); Duke v. Cleland, 884 F. Supp. 511, 514 (N.D. Ga. 1995). "If the record presents disputed issues of material fact, the Court [*4]  may not decide them; rather, it must deny the motion and proceed to trial." FindWhat Inv. Grp. v. FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Tullius v. Albright, 240 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2001)).

II. Background

A. Factual Background2

1. Plaintiff's Job
Plaintiff, a sixty-four-year-old woman, [Doc. 51 at ¶ 1], was hired in 2006 to work as a Customer Service Representative ("CSR") in Defendant's Water Department, [Doc. 49 at ¶ 1]. She initially worked in the CSR inner office but, in October 2013, requested a transfer to a then-vacant position at the front office. [Id. at ¶ 2; Doc. 51 at ¶ 6]. At another time, Sheila Godfrey ("Godfrey"), a CSR with a hearing impairment, requested and was moved to the inner office when a new position became available. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 132-134].
The front office is a single room with three desks and the inner office is a quieter back room. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 10, 29]. There also is a room behind the inner office to the left where two CSRs sit. [Id.]. There are six total CSRs and front- and inner-office CSRs have the same job titles, supervisor, and job descriptions, but have different assignments. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 5; Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 8, 11].
The CSR job description lists, as "major duties":
• Answers incoming telephone calls regarding customer service inquiries and complaints.
• Operates [*5]  and balances cash drawer.
• Assists customers with questions and payment options.
• Takes orders for new service and terminations; organizes new service agreements and mails to customers;
• Issues and keeps track of petty cash;
• Documents work orders for customer who need assistance.
Deposition of Brenda Groover ("Pl. Dep."), [Doc. 39-2], at 38; Pl. Dep. Exh. 2, [Doc. 39-1 at 3]. The inner-office CSRs do not answer phones as often as front-office CSRs (for example, they only answer calls on high volume days), do not operate the cash drawer, do not put together new customer packages or service agreements, and serve as back up for the front-office CSRs. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 17-18, 22, 24, 51]. However, inner-office CSRs have other duties, including managing Excel spreadsheets, preparing reports on new customers, and billing. [Id. at ¶ 20].
At the front office, Plaintiff's duties included "interacting with customers related to water service and billing issues, handling payments, preparing work orders, selling water meters, renting fire hydrant meters, balancing the cash drawer, preparing and mailing new service agreements, and utilizing the County's Munis system for billing related issues." [Doc. [*6]  49 at ¶ 4]. Working with the cash drawer required Plaintiff to get up from her desk to the cash counter, a task that, on exceptionally busy days, Plaintiff performed 40 to 50 times. [Id. at ¶¶ 8-9]. Preparing new service agreements required completing a Microsoft Word template, printing it, and putting it in a mailing envelope with other documents. [Doc. 51 at ¶ 33]. Adjusting customer service bills and taking orders for new service also required use of a Microsoft Word document. [Id. at ¶ 34]. Plaintiff also interacted with customers in person or the phone and used the radio to assist field technicians. [Id. at ¶ 35]. Plaintiff used the Munis system to access customer accounts during calls or in person, which required keying in the account number or address and sometimes entering notes of each call. [Id. at ¶¶ 38-45]. On average, Plaintiff fielded between 25 and 30 calls a day. [Id. at ¶ 41]. Plaintiff was required to write down customer numbers, which she did by hand. [Id. at ¶ 41 (citing Pl. Dep. at 24-26); [Doc. 49 at ¶ 7])].

2. Plaintiff's Disability
On October 23, 2014, Plaintiff suffered a spinal cord injury when her husband fell onto her from a ladder while doing yard work. [Doc. [*7]  51 at ¶ 53]. The injury caused numbness in her arms and legs, initially making it difficult to walk unassisted, and limited the use of and feeling in her hands. [Id. at ¶ 54].
On October 31, 2014, Lori Smith ("Smith"), Defendant's Benefits Administrator, sent Plaintiff a letter informing her of her rights under the FMLA and enclosing FMLA paperwork. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 14]. Plaintiff was released from the hospital on November 14, 2014 and returned the FMLA forms to Defendant on or around November 16, 2014. [Id. at ¶ 15]. After she exhausted her accrued leave,3 Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave beginning on November 19, 2014, was approved and she received FMLA leave through the end of 2014, at which point Defendant granted her an additional twelve weeks of FMLA leave beginning January 1, 2015. [Id. at ¶¶ 17-18].
On January 16, 2015, Plaintiff contacted her supervisor, Capri Reeves ("Reeves"), after an appointment with her neurosurgeon, Dr. Frankel, to let her know that she was scheduled for a reevaluation in three months and to discuss her return to work. [Id. at ¶ 19]. At that time, Plaintiff still experienced numbness in her arms and legs, burning pain in her hands, and wore a gait belt [*8]  so that her husband could assist her walking if needed. [Id. at ¶¶ 20, 24].

3. Plaintiff's Meeting with Defendant Regarding Disability
On January 26, 2015, Plaintiff and her husband met with Reeves, Lisa Speagle ("Speagle"), the Administrative Manager, and Lee Pope ("Pope"), the Water Director. [Id. at ¶ 21]. Plaintiff advised them that her next visit to Dr. Frankel was scheduled for April 20, 2015 and requested additional time off; however, knowing that her FMLA leave would expire before this, she asked about her options. [Id. at ¶¶ 25-26]. She was directed to Human Resources ("HR"). [Id. at ¶ 26].
Plaintiff also discussed that she was learning Dragon Software ("Dragon"), a voice-to-text program, which she had not previously used in a call-center environment, but thought that it would assist her in typing and returning to work. [Id. at ¶¶ 27, 68]. Dragon requires that the user speak words to be typed into a microphone and can pick up other speech and noise in the vicinity. [Id. at ¶¶ 69-70]. Dragon had been installed on five of Defendant's computers since 2014, including one in the HR Department; but Smith found that it did not work when she tried to use it to take minutes of a retirement [*9]  benefits meeting. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 78-79]. Pope and Plaintiff discussed if Dragon was compatible with Munis. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 29]. Plaintiff's husband also brought up the possibility of Plaintiff working a more sedentary position and Pope stated that there was none. [Id. at ¶ 31].
Following the meeting, Pope instructed Plaintiff to speak with Smith about possible accommodations. [Doc. 51 at ¶ 92]. Pope later advised Smith that Plaintiff had mentioned Dragon, but did not, himself, inquire with anyone if it would work with Munis. [Id. at ¶ 93]. Pope also told Lewis Patterson (the Director of HR) about his meeting with Plaintiff and that he had instructed her to contact Smith. [Id.].
Plaintiff discussed Dragon with Smith and Smith told her to speak to Pope. [Id. at ¶¶ 103, 114]. Plaintiff claims that "each time [she] turned in her leave paperwork, she asked Lori Smith about getting an appointment with Louis Patterson or Steve Rapson [the County Administrator] to discuss the use of Dragon" but "Smith told her 'now is not the time.'"[Id. at ¶¶ 116-117]. Plaintiff also asserts that she did not try to contact Rapson or Patterson "directly because doing so would have violated the chain of command." [*10]  [Id. at ¶ 118]. Patterson testified that he did not investigate Dragon because, at the time, it was unclear whether Plaintiff would be medically released to return to work or what type of accommodation Plaintiff might need. [Id. at ¶ 119]. Rapson testified that he directed Pope to work with IT to determine if Dragon was compatible with Munis. [Id. at ¶ 99]. Defendant's IT Director testified that he never spoke with Pope or Patterson about Dragon. [Id. at ¶ 101]. Ultimately, Defendant did not investigate if Dragon was compatible with Munis and whether it would enable Plaintiff to return to work with her condition. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 30].

4. Plaintiff's Leave Requests
On or around February 3, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a recertification form for FMLA leave completed by Dr. Frankel, who reported that Plaintiff had "limited sensation, limited motor skills in hands, numbness, imbalance [and] nerve pain[,]" needed assistance to walk, and could not drive. [Id. at ¶ 34]. At Patterson's direction, Smith drafted Plaintiff a letter informing her that her FMLA leave would be exhausted by March 27, 2015 and her options included being able to return to work with a full release, resignation, or requesting [*11]  an unpaid leave of absence under Defendant's Leave of Absence Policy. [Id. at ¶¶ 35-36; Doc. 51 at ¶ 121]. Patterson edited the letter, [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 122-25], and it was dated March 17, 2015, [Doc. 49 at ¶ 35]. The letter did not mention accommodations other than leave, [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 126-27], but enclosed a health provider certification form (which requested information about Plaintiff's limitations and accommodations that would assist her in performing her job), Plaintiff's job description, and leave of absence application. [Id; Doc. 49 at ¶ 37].
Plaintiff subsequently applied for a 180-day leave of absence and sent a letter to Smith stating that she was requesting this leave to "heal from a spinal cord injury." [Id. at ¶¶ 38-39]. Plaintiff also submitted the health provider form completed by Dr. Frank Alena, her treating physician, who evaluated her on March 31, 2015. [Id. at ¶ 41]. In response to the form's question of whether "there are any job duties that the employee cannot perform due to her limitation[,]" Dr. Alena checked the box for "yes" and stated "cannot type, no endurance very limited motor skills," indicated these limitations would last for over six months, and responded [*12]  to the follow-up question of whether Plaintiff could "perform those duties [noted in previous response] with assistance or an accommodation" by checking the box "no." [Id. (citing Doc. 39-2 at 43-44)]. Rapson approved Plaintiff for an additional thirty-day leave of absence4 beginning on March 29, 2015, once she exhausted her FMLA leave. [Id. at ¶ 43]. Plaintiff received a total of sixty days of additional, unpaid leave; Smith explained that additional unpaid leave requests were approved on a month-to-month basis. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 130-131].
After her April 20 follow-up with Dr. Frankel, Plaintiff submitted another request for a 180-day leave of absence beginning on April 28, 2015, the end of her previously granted thirty-day leave period, which Rapson approved through May 28, to see if her condition improved, and noted that it was the "final extension." [Doc. 49 at ¶¶ 50-51, 53-54]. Rapson testified that, in making leave determinations, he did not perform an independent analysis of employees' medical situations and whether they can perform their job with or without accommodation, but reviewed information from HR and medical providers. [Doc. 51 at ¶ 71]. Rapson also confirmed that he [*13]  gives a second leave request more scrutiny. [Id.].
On May 20, 2015, Plaintiff submitted another request for 120-days of leave. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 55]. Plaintiff was terminated effective May 29, 2015, in a letter signed by Pope which stated: "I am writing to inform you that your request for additional leave time was not approved. Based on your inability to return to work, we are unable to continue your employment with Fayette County. Enclosed is your separation notice." [Id. at ¶ 56; Lori Smith Dep. Exs., [Doc. 45-1], at 68]. This letter was drafted by Patterson on May 27, 2017, who forwarded it to Smith on May 28, 2015. [Doc. 45-1 at 68-72].

5. Plaintiff's Long-Term Disability Application
On April 27, 2015, Smith completed and signed the employer portion of Plaintiff's long-term disability benefits application. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 46]. The application included three sections for different people to fill out; the first section was filled out by Plaintiff (as the employee), the second by Smith (as the employer), and the third by Dr. Alena (as the attending physician). [Doc. 45-1 at 42-57]. At the time of Plaintiff's termination, Pope had not seen Plaintiff's medical documents, but Rapson was aware she had applied for long term disability. [*14]  [Doc. 51 at ¶ 70].
On the application's employee section, in response to the question "what specific duties of your occupation are you unable to perform due to your medical condition," Plaintiff wrote "typing, cash drawer, spreadsheets, standing/walking for long period of time." [Doc. 49 at ¶ 47]. Plaintiff indicated she was also seeking Social Security Disability benefits and was being treated by Dr. Alena, who filled out the form on April 16, 2015. [Doc. 45-1 at 46-48, 55-57]. Dr. Alena stated that Plaintiff's last office visit was on March 31, 2015 and checked the "yes" box in response to the question "Did you advise your patient to stop working?" [Id. at 55]. Dr. Alena also responded to the question about Plaintiff's "current physical restrictions" by stating that she is "unable to complete household chores, social, recreational & work duties" and that these restrictions were ongoing. [Id. at 56]. Plaintiff was ultimately approved for both long term and Social Security Disability benefits and began receiving long term benefits in October 2015 and Social Security Disability benefits retroactive to April 2015. [Id. at ¶ 65].

B. Relevant Administrative Proceedings
On August 26, 2015, Plaintiff signed [*15]  her EEOC intake questionnaire in support of her Charge of Discrimination; her husband had filled out the form on her behalf. In it, she represented that her disability prevented her from "working full time, typing rapidly, restricted mobility in transiting [sic] up and down constantly." [Doc. 49 at ¶¶ 62-64]. In her EEOC Charge, the boxes for age and disability discrimination were checked, but not the box for retaliation. [Id. at ¶ 71].

III. ADA Discrimination Claims
The ADA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment." E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., No. 1:10-cv-2816-JEC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91370, 2012 WL 2726766, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2012) (Carnes, J.); see also Holton v. First Coast Service Options, Inc., 703 Fed. Appx. 917, 920 (11th Cir. Aug. 11, 2017) ("The ADA prohibits discrimination by an employer 'against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability' in any of the 'terms, conditions, [or] privileges of employment.' . . . Such discrimination includes an employer's failure [*16]  to reasonably accommodate a qualified employee's disability.") (citations omitted).
Plaintiff brings both reasonable-accommodation and disparate-treatment claims. First, Plaintiff claims that she requested accommodations of reassignment to the inner office and Dragon software that Defendant failed to research or provide (Count I). [Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 60-72]. Second, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability by terminating her (Count II). [Id. at ¶¶ 73-83].
Absent direct evidence of discrimination, "[t]he familiar burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination actions is equally applicable to ADA claims." Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff therefore "has the burden of proving a prima facie case of" her employer's failure to accommodate her disability "by a preponderance of the evidence." Id. To make out this prima facie case, Plaintiff is required to show that: (1) she was disabled; (2) she was a qualified individual; and (3) she was discriminated against by Defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). An employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as [*17]  that individual is "otherwise qualified," and unless the employer can show undue hardship. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007). That is, unlike the traditional burden-shifting paradigm, an ADA plaintiff in a failure-to-accommodate case does not need to establish an intent to discriminate. Id.
To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) [s]he is disabled; (2) [s]he is a qualified individual; and (3) [s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability." Id. at 1256.
Defendant argues that summary judgment is appropriate because Plaintiff is not "a qualified individual" under the ADA since, at the time of her termination, she could not perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 36-2 at 13-14]. Plaintiff responds that she could perform the essential functions of her job with the accommodations she requested. [Doc. 47 at 14]. Defendant replies that it is Plaintiff's burden to show that the accommodations she requested would allow her to perform her job and were reasonable, which she cannot do. [Doc. 50 at 2-3].
Because both Plaintiff's ADA accommodation and discrimination claims require that she [*18]  demonstrate that she was a "qualified individual," the Court addresses that issue first before turning to the specific issues of whether Defendant failed to accommodate her or discriminated against her.

A. Whether Plaintiff Was a Qualified Individual Under the ADA
The ADA defines a "qualified individual" as an individual with a disability "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of her job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). See Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., Div. of Family & Children Servs., 446 Fed. Appx. 179, 182 (11th Cir. Nov. 2, 2011) (alterations in original) (footnote omitted). The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach in determining when a disabled person is otherwise qualified. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the court determines whether the person has the requisite qualifications for the position, such as sufficient experience and skills, education, and any appropriate licenses. Id. Second, the court assesses whether the person can perform the essential functions of the job in question, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id. Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Frix v. Fla. Tile Indus., Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1027, 1034 (N.D. Ga. 1997); Sidaris v. Runyon, 967 F. Supp. 1260, 1266 (M.D. Ala. 1997). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to: (1) the employer's judgment [*19]  as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; (4) the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function; (5) the work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or (6) the current work experience of the incumbents in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000); Frix, 970 F. Supp. at 1034.
The first inquiry is determining the essential functions of Plaintiff's job. The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff's duties as a front-office CSR required "interacting with customers related to water service and billing issues, handling payments, preparing work orders, selling water meters, renting fire hydrant meters, balancing the cash drawer, preparing and mailing new service agreements, and utilizing the County's Munis system for billing related issues." [Doc. 49 at ¶ 4]. Working with the cash drawer required Plaintiff to get up from her desk to the cash counter. [Id. at ¶¶ 8-9]. Preparing new service agreements, adjusting customer service bills, and taking orders for new service required use of a Microsoft Word. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 33-34]. Plaintiff used the Munis system to access customer accounts during calls or in person, [*20]  which required keying in the account number or address and entering notes of each call. [Id. at ¶¶ 38-43]. Plaintiff was required to write down customer numbers for each call, which she did by hand. [Id. at ¶¶ 44-46]. Accordingly, Plaintiff's essential job function was servicing customer accounts by phone or in person, and it is undisputed that her disability did not limit her ability to verbally interact with customers. [Id. at ¶ 60]. The issue is whether her disability affected her ability to perform the specific actions involved in the job's essential functions, such as typing, using Munis, using Microsoft Word, and operating the cash drawer.

1. Could Plaintiff Perform Essential Functions Without Accommodation
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot perform her essential job duties which "required mobility, manual dexterity, multi-tasking, and working in a fast-paced environment" because Plaintiff admits that "she could not perform at the same level she performed them prior to her injury." [Doc. 36-2 at 14-15]. Plaintiff responds that typing is not listed in her job description and she could perform her essential function of responding to customers and field technicians on the phone [*21]  or radio, fielding twenty to thirty calls in an eight hour day and could type "the few keystrokes necessary to operate Munis." [Doc. 47 at 15, 19].
However, Defendant contends that, "nearly every document Plaintiff submitted to the County, which included her doctor's assessment, noted similar limitations in Plaintiff's abilities—lack of fine motor skills, numbness/pain in her hands, limited mobility—and stated that Plaintiff was unable to work." [Doc 36-2 at 15]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination because her medical providers—who saw her job description—did not clear her to return to work; and Plaintiff admitted, in her April 2015 long term disability application, that she could not work, and, in her EEOC Charge, that her disability "prevented her from 'working full time, typing rapidly, restricted mobility in transitioning up and down constantly.'" [Doc. 50 at 7-8]. Plaintiff responds that her representations in her disability applications and her condition in April 2015 are irrelevant to whether she could perform her job in May 2015. [Doc. 47 at 7 n.3 (citing Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 805-06, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999)); Doc. 49 at ¶ 47]. [*22]  Defendant counters that Plaintiff is estopped from denying the truth of statements she made in her disability applications and, at any rate, she has presented no evidence that her condition improved between April and May 2015. [Doc. 50 at 7-8 & n.7 (citing Suidock v. Volusia Cty. Sch. Bd., 568 Fed. Appx. 659, 662-63 (11th Cir. Jun. 3, 2014))].
In Cleveland, the Supreme Court held that:
When faced with a plaintiff's previous sworn statement asserting "total disability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with or without a "reasonable accommodation."
Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 807; see also Chancey v. Fairfield Southern, Co., Inc., 580 Fed. Appx. 718, 720 (11th Cir. Sept. 8, 2014) (citing Cleveland in affirming district court's entry of summary judgment against plaintiff because he "failed to create a genuine factual dispute about whether he was a qualified individual"). Therefore, the Court may consider the factual assertions in Plaintiff's long-term disability application and other applications to determine if she can perform [*23]  the essential duties of her job, as long as Plaintiff is afforded an opportunity to explain any apparent inconsistency in prosecuting her ADA claims.
In February 2015, Dr. Frankel stated that Plaintiff had "limited sensation, limited motor skills in hands, numbness, imbalance [and] nerve pain[,]" needed assistance to walk, and could not drive. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 34].5 In March 2015, Dr. Alena stated that Plaintiff "cannot type, no endurance very limited motor skills[,]" for at least six months, and cannot perform her job duties "with assistance or an accommodation," [id. at ¶ 41]. Plaintiff stated on her April 2015 long-term disability application that she was unable to do "typing, cash drawer, spreadsheets, standing/walking for long period of time." [Doc. 49 at ¶ 47]. On April 16, 2015, Dr. Alena stated that plaintiff was "unable to complete household chores, social, recreational & work duties[,]" and that these restrictions were ongoing; and he advised her to stop working. [Id. at ¶¶ 55-56]. Therefore, it is undisputed that, from February through April 16, 2015, both Plaintiff and her physicians reported that she could not return to work, type, use the cash drawer or spreadsheets, or stand [*24]  and walk for long periods of time.6 Further, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that at the time of her termination that she had been cleared for work by her doctors, and in fact the evidence that after her "final" leave period she again sought more leave shows that she had not been cleared to return to work. See Cramer v. State of Fla., 117 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 1997) (plaintiff not a "qualified individual" where complaint alleges that he was unable to return to work); see also Morales, 446 Fed. Appx. at 184 (affirming dismissal of ADA termination claim where plaintiff did not return to work following conclusion of leave); Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 929 (11th Cir. May 20, 2010) (holding that plaintiff did not show he was qualified for his job where he had physical limitations inconsistent with job's essential functions "and, above all, he had not been cleared by a physician to return to work").7
It further is undisputed that without accommodations, the use of Munis and Microsoft Word required typing, an activity that Plaintiff and her treating physicians stated that she could not do at least through April 2015. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 34]. Further, using the cash drawer also involved this same skill but also walking, standing and sitting. Although Plaintiff claims that she "could type the few [*25]  keystrokes necessary to operate Munis[,]" this is clearly belied by the signed statements on the record indicating that Plaintiff could not type. [Doc. 47 at 15, 19]. Plaintiff fails to explain why her own and her physician's statements that she cannot type, operate the cash drawer, or do spreadsheets, are consistent with her present assertion that she could operate the equipment necessary to perform the essential function of her job. Rather, the bulk of her response is devoted to the assertion that she could complete her job's essential functions with accommodations.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff was unable to complete the essential functions of her job without accommodations.

2. Could Plaintiff Perform Essential Functions With Accommodation
Defendant argues that Plaintiff could not have performed her duties with the accommodations that she requested because no doctor cleared her to return to work. [Doc. 36-2 at 18]. Taken at face value, Dr. Alena's February, 2015 statement—that Plaintiff cannot perform her job duties "with assistance or an accommodation" and his April 16, 2015 statement, [*26]  that he advised her to stop working—supports Defendant's contention that Plaintiff could not perform her job even with accommodations and is, therefore, not a qualified individual under the ADA. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 41; Doc. 45-1 at 46-48, 55-57].
However, the undersigned recognizes that Dr. Alena made his determination in response to questions on a long-term disability form and that the Supreme Court has held that courts "should not apply a special legal presumption permitting someone who has applied for, or received SSDI benefits to bring an ADA suit only in 'some limited and highly unusual set of circumstances.'" Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 805 (citation omitted); see also Chancey, 580 Fed. Appx. at 720 (declining to find that plaintiff's prior disability benefits claim estopped him from arguing that he is a qualified individual and, instead, affirming grant of summary judgment after finding no genuine factual dispute). Therefore, the Court does not conclude that Plaintiff is estopped on this issue solely due to her application for disability benefits and examines whether, assuming Plaintiff was a qualified individual, she could work with accommodations.
Plaintiff argues that Dragon would enable her to perform her typing duties involving applications [*27]  like Microsoft Word, regardless if it was compatible with Munis. [Doc. 47 at 16]. Defendant argues that Dragon would not enable her to use the cash drawer or radio, which required some mobility. [Doc. 36-2 at 17]. Plaintiff also asserts that, if she had been transferred to an inner-office CSR position, she would not need to perform duties requiring mobility (such as operating the cash drawer), could use the radio in the inner office (as it "did not involve a high level of manual dexterity"), and would have fewer phone call duties. [Doc. 47 at 15-17].
It is undisputed that inner-office CSRs did not answer phones as often as front-office CSRs, operate the cash drawer, or put together new customer packages or service agreements. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 17, 22, 24, 51]. It also is undisputed that inner-office CSRs have other duties including managing Excel spreadsheets, preparing reports on new customers, and billing, tasks that Plaintiff submits she could do with Dragon. [Id. at ¶ 20]. A transfer to an inner-office CSR position would eliminate Plaintiff's cash drawer and other mobility-related duties, but she would still need to use Munis and note the customer telephone numbers while on customer [*28]  calls. [Id. at ¶¶ 38-41]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff could not have performed these duties with Dragon because she cannot show that Dragon was compatible with Munis and that she could use Dragon (by speaking) while simultaneously speaking to customers. [Doc. 36-2 at 16-17]. Defendant claims that using Dragon to respond to customer calls
would necessarily slow down this process and impact the customer experience, as Plaintiff cannot show how she would have performed these same tasks without having to place the customer on hold (likely multiple times) so she could speak into Dragon to pull up the customer's account and enter the customer's information.
[Id. at 17 (citations omitted)]. Plaintiff also conceded that "talking into [Dragon] may have been disturbing for [her coworkers] and the system itself may have picked up speech from other employees as well." [Id. at 17 n.14 (citing Pl. Dep., [Doc. 39], at 163-64)]. Plaintiff contends that she could use Dragon to respond to customer calls, [Doc. 47 at 20], but does not directly refute Defendant's argument that Dragon would require her to place customers on hold multiple times, might disrupt her coworkers, or that she could use Dragon without malfunctions due to it picking up other speech. [*29] 
Plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation and of demonstrating that it allows her to perform the job's essential functions. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. On a motion for summary judgment, when the moving party asserts facts, as Defendant has here, Plaintiff must "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324. Although "facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party" when opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Scott, 550 U.S. at 380.
Here, the Court is presented with a factual contradiction regarding Plaintiff's ability to use Dragon with Munis. On the one hand, Plaintiff and medical provider statements in her April 2015 long term disability application assert that she was unable to type at all. [Doc. 49 at ¶¶ 41, 47]. On the other hand, her declaration in support of her statement of additional material facts states that she "did [*30]  not need Dragon Software to look up customer accounts in Munis, which only required me to enter six digits into a dialogue box." [Doc. 48-1 at ¶ 23]. If Plaintiff and Dr. Alena's April 2015 statements in her disability application are true, Plaintiff could not type at all, which contradicts her deposition testimony and present statement that she could enter numbers into a dialogue box manually, i.e., by typing the entries. See UA Local 343 of the United Ass'n of Journeymen & Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Indus. of the U.S., 48 F.3d 1465, 1473 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that "internal inconsistencies in a party's own testimony fail to create a genuine issue of material fact" (citing Radobenko v. Automated Equip. Corp., 520 F.2d 540, 544 (9th Cir. 1975))); King v. Ala. Dep't of Pub. Health, No. CIV.A. 09-0503-WS-C, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91524, 2010 WL 3522381, at *1 n.4 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 2, 2010) ("A plaintiff cannot toggle back and forth between multiple inconsistent stories of her own creation to evade summary judgment by stitching together a hybrid version that picks and chooses the details from her own various narratives that are most advantageous to her."). Plaintiff explains this contradiction only by claiming that "her condition as of April 20, 2015 is not relevant to her condition when she sought to return to work five weeks later at the end of May 2015." [Doc. 49 at ¶ 47]. While this may be true, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that she sought to return to work [*31]  or that Defendants were aware her condition had improved as of the time of her termination on May 29, 2015. [Doc. 50 at 8]. Indeed, on May 20, 2015, Plaintiff submitted another request for 120 days of leave, indicating that she was not able to return to work. [Doc. 49 at ¶ 55]. Therefore, Plaintiff has not met her burden of refuting Defendant's argument (or explaining her and her doctor's statements) that, at the time of her May 2015 termination, Defendant was aware she could type enough to use the Munis features that were incompatible with Dragon. As accessing customer information on Munis was a necessary component of her essential job function of customer service, she has not shown that the accommodation she requested would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's ADA claims (Counts I and II) because she is not a qualified individual with or without a reasonable accommodation.

B. Defendant's Failure to Accommodate Plaintiff
In the event that the District Judge disagrees and concludes that Plaintiff was a qualified individual, the undersigned analyzes whether a [*32]  genuine issue of material fact exists that Defendant unlawfully failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. The Eleventh Circuit has held that:
An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide "reasonable accommodations" for the disability-unless doing so would impose undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). An accommodation can qualify as "reasonable," and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. See LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998). The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997).
Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255.

1. Plaintiff's Accommodation Requests
Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not request accommodations because, at the January 2015 meeting, her discussion of accommodations was not a request that they be implemented at that time, as she was still undergoing treatment and had not healed or sought to return to work. [Doc. 36-2 at 18-19]. Plaintiff responds that Defendant ignores the many times she made these requests subsequent to January 2015. [Doc. 47 at 7]. Defendant counters that the [*33]  only actual accommodation Plaintiff requested was additional leave. [Doc. 50 at 10].
"[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee," and "[o]nly after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (The employer's statutory "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.") (punctuation omitted); cf. Scott v. Shoe Show, Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 1343, 1361 (N.D. Ga. 2014) ("Simply put, the ADA does not require clairvoyance, and asking the employer to guess is asking too much of the employer, and of the ADA."). Moreover, the purpose of an accommodation is to "allow someone to perform his or her job duties in the present or in the immediate future," and—restating that principle—"the ADA covers people who can perform the essential functions of their jobs presently or in the immediate future." Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) (emphasis added); accord Counts v. WenMarr Mgmt. Co., LLC, No. 1:03-cv-2775-TWT, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11845, 2005 WL 1404792, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 3, 2005) (citing Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314; Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997)).
Here, although Plaintiff discussed accommodations with Defendant in January, 2015, [Doc. 49 at ¶ 21], she never confirmed that she was able to [*34]  return to work at all, and her last communication with Defendant, on May 20, 2015, was a request for an additional 120-days of leave beginning May 28, 2015, [id. at ¶¶ 53, 55], after she already had been on leave since October 23, 2014. [Id. at ¶ 13]. Indeed, on April 16, 2015, Dr. Alena stated that he had advised Plaintiff to stop working and that her inability to work would be ongoing. [Doc. 45-1 at 55]. Plaintiff fails to explain why, when she simultaneously requested more leave, sought long-term disability, and her medical providers indicated she could not return to work, her communications about Dragon (or a transfer to the inner office) could be construed as a request for accommodation.
As a result, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion and DISMISS Plaintiff's ADA failure to accommodate claim (Count I).

2. Reasonableness of Plaintiff's Accommodation Requests
In the event that the District Judge disagrees with the immediately-above recommendation, and concludes that Plaintiff's inquiries about Dragon8 constituted a request for an accommodation (or at least present a genuine issue to be tried), the Court discusses whether Plaintiff's request for [*35]  an accommodation was reasonable. Defendant argues that such requests were unreasonable. Defendant does not refute Plaintiff's claim that it could install Dragon on her computer and it would not be costly, [Doc. 47 at 7, 20; see also Doc. 50, passim]. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not shown reassignment would be reasonable because she has not identified a vacant inner-office CSR position. [Doc. 50 at 5 (citing Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 284 (11th Cir. 1997))].
Plaintiff argues that Defendant could have reassigned current inner-office CSRs to the front office so that she could be in the inner office. [Doc. 47 at 20-21]. Plaintiff claims that other employees, such as Godfrey and herself, were moved between the inner and front offices when they so requested. [Id. at 21]. Defendant points out that Plaintiff and Godfrey moved between the front and inner offices when the requested positions were vacant. [Doc. 50 at 6 n.4]. Defendant argues that an employer is not required to bump an employee from one position to accommodate a disabled employee. [Id. at 6 (citing Lucas, 252 F.3d at 1256; Bagwell v. Morgan Cty. Comm'n, 676 Fed. Appx. 863, 866 (11th Cir. Jan. 18, 2017))].
Defendant's position is in line with Eleventh Circuit precedent. In Lucas, the court stated that
[t]he ADA lists as examples of reasonable accommodations "job restructuring, part-time [*36]  or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." . . . [T]he ADA may require the employer to "reassign," i.e., transfer, the disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation. The reassignment duty, however, does not require the employer to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee.
Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1256 (internal and ending citations omitted). Since Plaintiff has not demonstrated that there was an inner office vacancy to which she could have been transferred, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's reasonableness-of-accommodation claim.
On the other hand, if the District Judge disagrees with this conclusion, the undersigned concludes that judgment as a matter of law is warranted on the failure to accommodate claim because Plaintiff has not demonstrated how a transfer to the inner office would not require an altering of the essential function of the CSR job. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized that the ADA does not require an employer in the course of reasonably accommodating an employee [*37]  with a disability to change the essential functions of the position:
An employer is not required to re-allocate job duties in order to change the essential function of the job or remove another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee. . . . An employer may be required to restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating marginal functions, but an employer is not required to transform a position into another one by eliminating essential functions.
Bagwell, 676 Fed. Appx. at 866 (citations omitted). Courts have cautioned that "[w]hether a particular job function is essential is 'evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining a number of factors'" and that "the question of whether a job function is essential is generally not suitable for resolution on a motion for summary judgment." Jernigan v. Bellsouth Telecomms., 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (quoting and citing Samson v. Fed. Express, Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200-01 (11th Cir. 2014)).
The parties agree that inner-office duties differ from front-office duties because inner-office CSRs do not operate the cash drawer and field fewer calls, but dispute whether this means that inner- and front-office CSRs had the same essential functions. [Doc. 51 at ¶¶ 17-20, 22, 29, 51-2]. Therefore, the undersigned turns to the 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3) factors.
First, the undersigned consults the job description [*38]  for all CSRs, which does not distinguish between inner- and front-office CSRs, but lists cash drawer functions as a CSR's second major duty. [Doc. 39-2 at 38]. It strikes the undersigned that, if there is one job description for all CSRs that lists as "major functions" duties that are only performed by some CSRs, it does not provide a reliable basis for determining if front-and inner-office CSRs have differing essential functions. See § 1630.2(n)(3)(ii). Therefore, the undersigned will disregard the CSR job description as a significant § 1630.2(n)(3) factor in resolving this claim.
Second, Plaintiff had experience performing the duties of both positions and neither required any special expertise or ability. See § 1630.2(n)(2)(iii), (3)(vii-viii). These factors weigh in favor of finding front- and inner-office CSRs had the same essential functions. However, the other factors in § 1630.2(n)(3) pertaining to time spent on activities and the consequences of not requiring an employee to perform certain job duties are matters of factual dispute: the parties disagree about the amount of time spent by front-office CSRs on the cash drawer, the amount of time spent by front- and inner-office CSRs on calls, and the consequences of not requiring Plaintiff to use the cash [*39]  drawer as a front-office CSR or take fewer calls. [Doc. 36-2 at 17; Doc. 49 at ¶ 9; Doc. 51 at ¶ 41]. The last factor, the employer's judgment about essential functions, weighs in favor of finding that the two jobs have differing essential functions. [Doc. 36-2 at 16-17]. However, while "the employer's judgment is 'entitled to substantial weight in the calculus,' this factor alone is not conclusive." Jernigan, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 1322 (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258).
As an examination of the § 1630.2(n)(3) factors does not tilt the balance in favor of either party, the undersigned is reluctant to hold, at the summary judgment stage, that reassigning an inner-office CSR to the front office (to accommodate Plaintiff as an inner-office CSR) was a change in the essential functions of the positions. However, the Defendant still is entitled to judgment unless the District Judge also is convinced that Plaintiff has shown a genuine issue of material fact as to both an inner-office transfer and her ability to use Dragon to fulfill the essential functions of her job.

3. Interactive Accommodation Process
Lastly, Plaintiff claims Defendant failed to accommodate her because it "failed to engage in a good-faith interactive process" by communicating with her and making [*40]  inquiries into the feasability of her requested accommodations. [Doc. 47 at 8 (citing Gilliard v. Ga. Dept. Of Corr., 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 868 (11th Cir. Dec. 7, 2012); Sims v. Alabama Dep't of Human Res., No. 2:15-cv-00421-TMP, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170314, 2017 WL 4611004, at *11 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 16, 2017); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997)]. Plaintiff claims that the inconsistent information regarding accommodations communicated to her by Pope, Smith, Rapson, and Patterson, when coupled with the April 2017 letter that omitted any mention of accommodations and giving her a "Hobson's choice" of returning to full work, resigning, or going on unpaid leave, presents a "convincing mosaic" of evidence that Defendant was unwilling to engage in a good faith interactive process. [Id. at 11-13 (citing Lewis v. City of Union City, 877 F.3d 1000, 1018 (11th Cir. 2017))].
Defendant responds that the ADA "provides no cause of action for 'failure to investigate' possible accommodation." [Doc. 50 at 3 (citing Willis, 108 F.3d at 285)].
The Eleventh Circuit has indicated that an employer does not have to engage in an interactive process where a plaintiff does not identify a reasonable accommodation. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; see also Webb v. Donley, 347 Fed. Appx. 443, 446 (11th Cir. Sept. 14, 2009) ("[I]f the employee does not identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer does not have to enter into an interactive dialogue or show undue hardship.") (citing Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367). The undersigned has concluded that Plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of material fact either as to whether [*41]  she was a qualified individual or requested reasonable accommodations. See Part III(A-B) supra. Consequently, the undersigned need not reach the predicate issue of whether any accommodation was reasonable and, relatedly, whether Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion as it pertains to Plaintiff's claim that Defendant violated the ADA by not engaging in an interactive process (Count I). However, in the event that the District Judge disagrees and concludes that a material fact issue is present on the reasonableness of the requested accommodations, then this issue, dependent as it is on the determination of the whether the accommodations requested were reasonable, also remains to be tried.

C. ADA Disparate Treatment Claims
As the undersigned concludes that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual, it follows that Defendant's motion should be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA disparate treatment claims. However, in the event that the District Judge concludes that Plaintiff was a qualified individual (or that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to that issue), [*42]  she has satisfied the first and second elements of a prima facie ADA discrimination claim, and the undersigned will analyze whether Defendant unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability. Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004).
Assuming that Plaintiff established a prima facie case of ADA disparate treatment, the burden of production then shifts to Defendant to rebut the inference of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. This burden is "exceedingly light." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir. 1997). Here, in Plaintiff's termination letter, Defendant stated her termination was "based on your inability to return to work," [Doc. 45-1 at 68]. Consequently, Defendant meets its light burden of offering a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination.
The burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to show a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant's articulated reason for her termination is pretextual. See, e.g., Vaughn v. NationsBank Corp., 137 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1322 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (applying traditional Title VII burden-shifting paradigm to ADA cases). The pretext analysis focuses on a narrow question: "Would the proffered evidence allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the articulated reason for the decision was not the real reason?" [*43]  Walker v. Prudential Property and Casualty Ins. Co., 286 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir. 2002); see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) ("[R]ejection of the defendants' proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.") (emphasis in original). In arguing pretext, "a plaintiff employee may not establish that an employer's proffered reason is pretextual merely by questioning the wisdom of the employer's reason" as long as "the reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer." Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1543 (11th Cir. 1997) ("[F]ederal courts do not sit to second-guess the business judgment of employers.")). However, a plaintiff's "prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. If, however, "the plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer's articulated reasons is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim." Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (emphasis added).
Plaintiff responds that discrimination is shown by the March 2015 letter in which Defendant only gave her the option to return to work with a "full release" and then [*44]  terminated her when she could not secure the same. [Doc. 47 at 22]. Defendant replies that Plaintiff has not shown that she could return to work and, even if she had, has not shown that those making her termination decision were aware at the time of her termination that she could return to work. [Doc. 50 at 11-12].
The crucial question here is not whether Plaintiff could return to work, but whether Defendant honestly believed she could not. Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 729 (11th Cir. 2004), overruled on other grounds by Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 546 U.S. 454, 457, 126 S. Ct. 1195, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (2006); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991). Stated another way, short of some evidence that Defendant did not genuinely believe Plaintiff could not return to work, the Court may not second-guess Defendant's honest assessment that, by requesting 120 days of additional leave, Plaintiff was indicating that she could not return to work. See id. ("Federal courts do not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions. . . . Rather, our inquiry is limited to whether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior." (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
As previously discussed, Plaintiff never confirmed that she was able to return to work at all and her last communication with Defendant, on May 20, 2015, after [*45]  her much-anticipated follow-up visit with Dr. Frankel, was a request for an additional 120-days of leave beginning May 28, 2015, [Doc. 49 at ¶¶ 53, 55], after she already had been on leave since October 23, 2014, [id. at ¶ 13]. Plaintiff offers no evidence whatsoever that she was able or intended to return to work in May 2015 or, more importantly, communicated that to Defendant and, as a result, has not shown that Defendant's stated reason for her termination—that she could not work at all—was pretextual.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim (Count II).

IV. Retaliation Claims
In Count III of her complaint, Plaintiff claims Defendant retaliated against her for seeking ADA accommodations by "failing and refusing to accommodate her requests for reasonable accommodation, including, but not limited to, refusing to allow use of Dragon Software and by terminating her after requested these accommodations." [Doc. 1 at ¶ 88]. Plaintiff also claims that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of the FMLA (Count V) by terminating her for using all of her FMLA leave. [Doc. 1 at ¶ 102].

A. Failure to [*46]  Administratively Exhaust ADA Retaliation Claim
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's retaliation claims fail as a matter of law because Plaintiff failed to include an ADA retaliation claim in her EEOC Charge and, thereby exhaust them. [Doc. 36-2 at 21].9
Plaintiffs proceeding under the ADA must comply with the same procedural requirements articulated in Title VII, including the duty to exhaust administrative remedies. See 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5). Thus, prior to filing a claim for discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must first file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Id. § 2000e-5(e)(1); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1626.7(a). Failure to file the charge within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice bars the claim. Alexander v. Fulton Cnty, 207 F.3d 1303, 1332 (11th Cir.2000), overruled in part on other grounds by Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1328 n.52 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc). Therefore, a plaintiff may not allege new claims that were not included in the scope of the EEOC Charge unless those claims could be expected to grow out of the original charge. Gregory v. Georgia Dep't Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004) (refusing to bar plaintiff's retaliation claim, although she only alleged race and sex discrimination and termination in her EEOC charge, since these facts would reasonably lead to an EEOC investigation of retaliation).
Plaintiff's EEOC charge stated that she requested [*47]  accommodations for her disability "multiple times but nothing was done about it. On May 29, 2015 I was discharged." [Doc. 1-1 at 2]. Therefore, the situation in this case is analogous to Gregory, because, although Plaintiff did not check boxes for retaliation, she alleged that she suffered negative consequences after requesting accommodations. Consequently, the undersigned concludes that Plaintiff's retaliation claims could be reasonably expected to grow out of and were related to claims that were contained in her EEOC Charge. Accordingly the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge DENY Defendant's motion on the grounds that Plaintiff did not administratively exhaust her ADA retaliation claim.

B. Prima Facie Case and Pretext Analysis of Retaliation Claims
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim fails because requesting accommodations is not protected activity. [Doc. 36-2 at 21 n.17 (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Svcs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998); Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. 1997))]. Plaintiff responds that disability accommodations constitute protected speech. [Doc. 47 at 24 (citing Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258))]. Defendant replies that "the plain terms of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision requires either opposition to discrimination under the ADA, or participation [*48]  in an ADA investigation, proceeding or hearing." [Doc. 50 at 13 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Suidock, 568 Fed. Appx. at 664)].10
The ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing an unlawful practice or making a charge under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To prevail on her ADA retaliation claim, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected expression, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260.
Defendant's argument that the Eleventh Circuit has not held that a request for accommodations is not protected speech for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision is flat out wrong. The Court does not understand how Defendant can argue that requesting reasonable accommodations is not protected activity under the ADA in this Circuit when the very cases it cites in support of the proposition hold exactly the opposite. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328 (holding that request for accommodation is protected speech but concluding that plaintiff did not have reasonable good faith belief that he was disabled); Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (holding that the first element of an ADA retaliation prima facie case "may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation," and citing Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328). [See Doc. 36-2 at 21 & n.17]. Not only that; after [*49]  denying in its opening brief that an accommodation request is not protected speech under the ADA, [id.], and being told by Plaintiff that its position was incorrect and not supported by caselaw, [Doc. 47 at 24, where Plaintiff quoted the language from Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258, that the Court just quoted)], Defendant repeated its incorrect argument in its reply brief. [Doc. 50 at 13].
The Court expects much more from counsel appearing before it. Counsel may argue contrary to binding precedent where, after stating the precedent, they point out why it is wrong or is likely to or should be overturned, or maybe even that it is dicta, or, as in Standard, that Plaintiff did not have a reasonable good faith belief, but counsel may not misrepresent to the Court what is clear binding precedent. Georgia Rule of Professional Responsibility 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal). Counsel's client, not to mention the Court, deserve better. Blind advocacy is no advocacy at all.
In its motion, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's retaliation claim fails because there is no causal connection between her January 2015 meeting, in which she brought up Dragon and her husband brought up transfer to the inner office, and her May termination. [*50]  [Doc. 36-2 at 21-22]. Plaintiff responds that she requested accommodations, not only in the January 2015 meeting, but in March, April and May, 2015 by following up with Smith, as Pope directed. [Doc. 47 at 24-25]. Plaintiff argues that "Defendant denied the leave she was told she could have; her termination occurred only a few days later." [Id. at 25 (citing Marria v. C.R. England, Inc., 679 Fed. Appx. 844, 849 (11th Cir. Feb. 10, 2017) (because "temporal proximity of seven days was sufficient to satisfy the causal element"))]. Plaintiff also asserts that "[t]he sheer inconsistency in Defendant's statements about whether and how it considered Ms. Groover's request for leave is sufficient for a finder of fact to conclude Defendant's proffered reason is pretext." [Id. (citing Lewis, 877 F.3d at 1019)]. Defendant replies that Plaintiff "has not proffered any evidence that Mr. Pope, Mr. Rapson, or Mr. Patterson were aware of these [later] requests" to Smith or "that Ms. Smith was involved in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment." [Doc. 50 at 13]. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot show that the proffered reason for her termination-her inability to return to work-was pretext. [Id. at 14].
Thus, first, the Court concludes that Plaintiff engaged in protected speech under the ADA by requesting [*51]  accommodations, which is protected speech under the ADA. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 ("The first element [of an ADA retaliation claim] may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation."); Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328. She also suffered an adverse employment action when she was terminated.
The Court also concludes that she satisfied the causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action since her termination occurred within the same month as her latest request for additional leave, and although Defendant disputes that anyone other than Smith was aware of Plaintiff's request, [Doc. 50 at 13 (citing Pl. Dep. at 153-57 for the proposition that Plaintiff only handed her leave requests to Smith)], Defendant points to no affirmative evidence in the record that Pope, Rapson, or Patterson were unaware of her leave requests. Thus, Defendant has not satisfied its burden on summary judgment. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325.
Furthermore, Defendant's argument about temporal proximity/causation is belied by Pope's May 29, 2015, letter terminating Plaintiff, which expressly states that "your request for additional leave time was not approved. Based upon your inability to return to work we are unable to continue your employment with Fayette County." [Doc. 39-3 [*52]  at 6].11 A lapse in time of one month between a protected activity and an adverse action is sufficiently close to support a causal connection between the two. See Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004). Therefore, Plaintiff has satisfied the both the prima facie case aspect of her ADA retaliation claim and has created at least a genuine issue of material fact as to an additional ADA retaliation claim element, that is, that unlawful retaliation under the ADA be the "but for" causation for the adverse employment action. See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (ADA retaliation subject to "but for" standard of causation).
Nevertheless, in the event the District Judge disagrees with this analysis, the undersigned will examine the new arguments Plaintiff asserts in response to Defendant's argument that her termination lacks a causal connection to any protected activity for termination purposes. First, Plaintiff asserts that "Defendant denied the leave she was told she could have." [Doc. 47 at 25]. Second, Plaintiff claims that Defendant gave inconsistent "statements about whether and how it considered Ms. Groover's request for leave[.]" [Id.]. However, Plaintiff bolsters neither of these assertions with citations to undisputed or additional material facts. [See [*53]  id.].
The Local Rules of this Court clearly provide that "[t]his Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent . . . directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number)." LR 56.1(B)(2), NDGa. While Plaintiff set forth separately numbered statements of material facts, as to this claim she did not cite to those statements of material fact (or to any facts). This greatly reduces the utility of the statements of material fact, as it requires the Court to search through the statements of material facts to determine whether the factual assertions alleged in Plaintiff's response have in fact been presented in a statement of material facts and whether the opposing party has had an opportunity to dispute the factual statement or object to the supporting evidence. The Court will not sua sponte scour the record for facts to support Plaintiff's arguments. In re Auto Body Shop Antitrust Litig., No. 6:14-CV-6006-ORL-31, 2015 U.S. Dist. Lexis 114292, 2015 WL 4887882, at *31 (M.D. Fla. June 3, 2015) ("It is not the Court's job to search the [pleadings] for facts that might support a particular claim for relief. 'Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in [pleadings].'" [*54]  ) (quoting United States v. Dunkel, 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991)). Without any facts to support her assertions that Defendant misled her about leave, Plaintiff's rebuttal of Defendant's legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her termination inevitably fails. Alternatively, if the District Judge concludes that Plaintiff did not fail to comply with LR 56.1, the Court concludes that despite Plaintiff's contention that she "repeatedly indicated that she could return to work with the accommodations she had requested" and repeatedly followed up with Smith, [Doc. 49 at ¶ 56], the undisputed facts remain that (1) Plaintiff requested another 120 days of leave on May 20, 2015, after her previous "final" leave was granted, [id. at ¶¶ 53-55], and (2) as of April 2015, she had not requested from any of her doctors a release to return to work, [Doc. 49 at ¶ 52 (citing Pl. Dep., [Doc. 39], at 236-37)]12; see also [Doc. 45-1 at 55 (Dr. Alena's statement that he advised Plaintiff to stop working).
Nonetheless, even though Plaintiff may have satisfied the prima facie case of an ADA retaliation claim, as discussed in Part III(C) supra, Plaintiff has not met her burden of showing that Defendant's proffered reason for her termination, that is, that she had not been released by her doctors to return [*55]  to work and there was no indication that she was able to come back to work, was pretextual, and thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.
As noted previously, Plaintiff does not separate out in her response the ADA and FMLA retaliation claims. [See Doc. 47 at 24-25]. Therefore, even though the elements of an ADA retaliation claim and an FMLA retaliation claim are different,13 the Court does not need to separately discuss Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim because the same non-pretextual legitimate non-discriminatory reason entitles Defendant to summary judgment.14
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's ADA and FMLA retaliation claims (Counts III and V).

V. ADEA Claims
Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her in violation of the ADEA (Count VI). [See Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 94-99]. The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because [*56]  of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of age discrimination if she shows: "(1) that she was a member of the protected group of persons between the ages of forty and seventy; (2) that she was subject to adverse employment action; (3) that a substantially younger person filled the position that she sought or from which she was discharged; and (4) that she was qualified to do the job for which she was rejected." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1359 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1432 (11th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted)). "[A] plaintiff bringing a disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the 'but-for' cause of the challenged adverse employment action." Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 180, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009). The Eleventh Circuit has held that the same "principles governing the order and allocation of proof in cases arising under Title VII" apply to claims arising under the ADEA as well. Walker v. NationsBank of Fla. N.A., 53 F.3d 1548, 1556 (11th Cir. 1995).
Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff meets the first two elements of the ADEA prima facie test, but claims that Plaintif cannot sustain her ADEA claim because, as previously discussed, she cannot show that she could work or that a younger, similarly-situated employee was treated more favorably. [Doc. 36-2 at 23]. In support of her [*57]  ADEA claims, Plaintiff alleges that Pope evinced an age-based bias against her because, during a November 20, 2014 meeting, he stated to her husband "that it was good that Brenda 'was about ready to retire anyway,'" [Doc. 47 at 23 (citing Declaration of Joseph Groover, [Doc. 48-2 at 2])], and then failed to act on her requests for accommodation and leave and, instead, terminated her. [Id.].
Defendant replies that Pope denies this comment and, even if he did make it, it constitutes "inadmissible hearsay" and "a stray remark unrelated to Plaintiff's termination." [Doc. 36-5 at 23-24 (citing Silvestri v. Jupiter Inlet Colony, 614 Fed. Appx. 983, 984 (11th Cir. Jun. 11, 2015))].
For purposes of summary judgment, Pope's statement to Mr. Groover is treated as made, and the statement is not hearsay, since the statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that Plaintiff was about to retire anyway), but rather as some evidence of Pope's ageist state of mind. See, e.g., Littlefield v. Am. Radio, No. 1:03-CV-3882-RWS, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23074, 2006 WL 735048, at *6 n.4 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 20, 2006) (explaining that the employer's testimony as to another employee's statements was not barred as hearsay by Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence because the statements were not proffered for the truth of the matter asserted but rather for the purpose of explaining the employer's decision [*58]  to terminate the plaintiff); see also Moore v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 683 F.2d 1321, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 1982) (holding that plaintiff's supervisors' memos regarding plaintiff's performance were not inadmissible hearsay, because "[t]he documents here were not tendered to prove the particulars of their contents, but to help establish that Sears was motivated, in good faith, to discharge Moore for reasons other than age."); Crockett v. Abraham, 284 F.3d 131, 134, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 296 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (holding that third party statements concerning employee were not hearsay where "[employer]'s decisionmaking was under challenge, and [the employer] explained it on the basis of the information [it] received."); Wolff v. Brown, 128 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 1997) ("In employment discrimination cases, internal documents relied upon by the employer in making an employment decision are not hearsay as that term is defined in Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)—statements offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Rather, such documents are relevant and admissible because they help explain (or may help explain) the employer's conduct.") (citations omitted).
On the other hand, the Court accepts Defendant's argument that Pope's statement qualifies as an offhand, stray or isolated remark. [Doc. 50 at 14] See Short v. Mando Am. Corp., 601 Fed. Appx. 865, 874 (11th Cir. Feb. 27, 2015) (holding that stray remark insufficient to show pretext, quoting Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir. 2002) ("While we agree that a stray remark by a decision [*59]  maker can be considered circumstantial evidence of discriminatory animus, we nevertheless conclude that this particular remark was 'isolated and unrelated to the challenged employment decision' and therefore insufficient by itself to establish a genuine fact issue on pretext.")); see Scott v. Suncoast Beverage Sales, Ltd., 295 F.3d 1223, 1228-29 (11th Cir. 2002) (one stray remark long before termination is insufficient to show pretext); see also Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 190 Fed. Appx. 924, 926 (11th Cir. Aug. 2, 2006) (stray remarks not uttered in context of challenged personnel actions are not sufficient circumstantial evidence to provide a reasonable basis for a finding of discrimination in the context of the employment decisions at issue); Norrell v. Waste Away Group, Inc., 246 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1226 (M.D. Ala. 2003) (isolated remark by decisionmaker unrelated to challenged employment decision insufficient to establish pretext).
Plaintiff also claims that Pope evinced age-based bias because he "failed to act on any of Ms. Groover's requests, even though he did so for other employees not in the protected age group." [Doc. 47 at 23 (citing Lee Pope Deposition, [Doc. 44], at 213-15, 215-17)]. Once again, Plaintiff does not include a citation to the statement of facts in support of this assertion. However, she does refer to Pope's deposition and, in looking at the cited portions, the undersigned sees no mention whatsoever of "other employees." Without any facts [*60]  to support her assertions that Defendant treated younger employees differently, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the prima facie case for ADEA discrimination.
Further, even if she had satisfied this burden, Plaintiff has not rebutted Defendant's legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her termination, that is, that she had not been cleared to return to work after exhaustion of her FMLA and other extended leave.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's ADEA claim (Count IV).

VI. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Judge GRANT Defendant's motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 36].
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the referral to the undersigned magistrate judge.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED AND DIRECTED, this the 27th day of July, 2018.
