BARBARA S. JONES
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Plaintiff Barbara K. Nixon-Tinkelman ("Plaintiff" or "Nixon-Tinkelman") brings the instant action raising claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq., and Sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 791 and 794. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that she was denied a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities and that she was retaliated against for requesting such accommodations.
Defendants New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ("DOHMH") and City of New York (together with DOHMH, "Defendants") move for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure ("Fed. R. Civ. P.") 56. For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion is GRANTED in its  [*2] entirety.

BACKGROUND1
Defendant DOHMH employed Plaintiff for approximately 23 years. At DOHMH, Plaintiff was employed primarily in administrative supervisory roles; her most recent title was Associate Staff Analyst and her office title was Regional Director. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 1,4; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 1,4.)

1. Plaintiff's Employment Background
Plaintiff began her employment with DOHMH in or about 1984 as a part-time resource coordinator. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 2; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 2.) After passing a civil service examination, Plaintiff was appointed as an Associate Staff Analyst. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 2; Pl.'s Rule 56.1  [*3] stmt. ¶ 2.)
Between approximately 1988 and 1990, Plaintiff was assigned to DOHMH's office located at 125 Worth Street, in Manhattan. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 3; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 3.) In or about 1990, Plaintiff was assigned to a position with the in-house title of Regional Director in DOHMH's Health Care Access and Improvement Division ("HCAI"), Bureau of Oral Health Programs and Policy ("OHP"). (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 4; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 4.) Between 1990 and 1994, Plaintiff's office was located at 90-37 Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 5; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 5.) In or about 1994, the Oral Health regional office was relocated to 120-34 Queens Boulevard in Kew Gardens, Queens, where Plaintiff reported for work until March 2000. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 5; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 5.) According to Plaintiff, her duties as Regional Director required her to travel to various field locations approximately three times per week. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 7; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 7.)
In or about 1994, Plaintiff applied for, and was granted, admission into the City's 55-a program for disabled individuals, pursuant to New York Civil Service Law § 55-a  [*4] because she suffered from a hearing impairment caused by a childhood illness. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 8; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 8; Am. Comp. ¶ 7.) Shortly after her admission into the 55-a program, DOHMH supplied Plaintiff with a specially-equipped telephone for the hearing impaired. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 10; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 10.)
In or about May 1997, Plaintiff was granted a requested leave of absence under Section 3.5 of the DOHMH Time and Leave Regulations, beginning on April 19, 1997, and ending on July 17, 1997. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 11; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 11.) In or about December 1998, Plaintiff was granted another requested leave of absence under Section 3.5 of the DOHMH Time and Leave Regulations, beginning November 13, 1998, and ending January 8, 1999. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 13; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff subsequently was granted an extension of the leave of absence through February 9, 1999. (Id.)
In or about March 2000, Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence from DOHMH in order to undergo treatment for cancer. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 14; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 14.) In 2001, Plaintiff returned to work following her medical leave of  [*5] absence and was informed that that she would be reporting to the DOHMH offices located at 120-34 Queens Boulevard in Kew Gardens, Queens ("Queens Boulevard offices"). (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 17, 18; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 17, 18.) Following her return to duty, Plaintiff claims she was officially assigned to work at the the Queens Boulevard offices, while Defendants claim that although Plaintiff frequently worked at the Queens location, her officially assigned work address was 299 Broadway in Manhattan. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 19; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 19.) Plaintiff usually traveled to the Queens Boulevard offices in her domestic partner's car, but if she was unable to borrow a car, she would use public transportation. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 21, 22; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 21, 22.)
In or about July 2001, the Director of DOHMH's Bureau of Pest Control, another DOHMH bureau located in the Queens Boulevard offices, offered to let Plaintiff work out of a Pest Control office that was recently vacated ("Pest Control Office"). (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 24; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 24.)
In November 2005, Joyce Weinstein ("Weinstein"), the Assistant Commissioner for Oral Health,  [*6] informed Plaintiff that it would be helpful if Plaintiff moved to DOHMH's offices in Manhattan. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 25; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 25; Seacord Decl., Ex. Q). In January 2006, Plaintiff was assigned to HCAI's Bureau of Health Insurance Services ("BHIS"), located at 161 William Street, New York, New York 10038. At this time, Plaintiff reported to Teri Galvin ("Galvin"). (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 26; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 26.) Galvin informed Plaintiff that her new assignment would involve distributing flyers regarding the services provided by DOHMH to various community-based organizations located in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 27; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 27.)
On or about May 19, 2006, Plaintiff met with Galvin and, according to Plaintiff, "Galvin made verbally abusive remarks to [her]." (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 28; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 28.) On the same day, Plaintiff suffered a transient ischemic attack. (Id.) Following the May 19 meeting, Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence until or about August 21, 2006. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 29; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 29.) During Plaintiff's medical leave, she wrote a letter to Weinstein  [*7] stating that she felt she had been working "out of title" and suggesting that HCAI develop an independent Outreach Unit that she could head. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 30; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 30.) In the letter, Plaintiff also noted that she felt Galvin found it "very discomforting" to work with her. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 30; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 30.)

2. Plaintiff is Assigned to THCC
On August 21, 2006, Plaintiff returned to work and was told to report to Michael Aragon ("Aragon"), HCAI's Executive Director for Employee/Labor Relations, EEO, and timekeeping. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 31; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 31.) Aragon decided to have Plaintiff report to him so that she would no longer report to Galvin. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 32; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 32.)
In late August, Plaintiff was assigned to work for HCAI's bureau of Transitional Health Care Coordination ("THCC") out of the Pistilli building in Whitestone, Queens ("Pistilli"). While at Pistilli, Plaintiff's assigned duties were answering phones and other administrative tasks. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 34; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 34.) Plaintiff also assisted the employees prepare for an upcoming move. (Defs.' Rule 56.1  [*8] stmt. ¶ 34; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 34.) During her time at Pistilli, Plaintiff reported to Alison Jordan ("Jordan"), THCC's Executive Director. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 37; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 37.) Plaintiff purchased a telephone amplifier to assist her in answering the phones. After receiving approval from Jordan, Plaintiff was reimbursed for the device. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 38; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 38.)
In October 2006, the lease at Pistilli expired and Jordan assigned Plaintiff to work at the Morrisania Health Center ("Morrisania") in the Bronx. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 40; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 40.) Plaintiff reported to Morrisania three days per week and to THCC's Brownsville Health Center ("Brownsville") two days per week. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 42; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff traveled to both locations by car, and the trips took approximately one-and-a-half hours each way. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 43, 45; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 43, 45.)

3. Plaintiff Requests Transfer to Queens
On or about November 13, 2006, Plaintiff sent an email request to Aragon that she be assigned to the OHP offices in Queens when her assignment at THCC was complete. (Defs.'  [*9] Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 47; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 47.) Plaintiff requested the move because she believed the OHP offices in Queens to be understaffed and because "the work I could help out on [in Queens] would also be more in line with my civil service title." (Seacord Decl., Ex. Z.) On or about November 20, 2006, Plaintiff sent another email to Aragon requesting a transfer to Queens as a reasonable accommodation because her current commute, made difficult by her "handicapped status," was too lengthy. (Seacord Decl., Ex. AA.) Aragon responded and informed Plaintiff that the request could not be granted because of restructuring and budgetary constraints at the Queens office. (Seacord Decl., Ex. BB.)
In or about January 2007, the THCC staff moved to new offices at 225 Broadway in Manhattan. Plaintiff was told she was to report to 225 Broadway four days per week, and Morrisania one day per week. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 52; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 52.) At 225 Broadway, Plaintiff was assigned a workstation outside the office of Sehu Jeppe ("Jeppe"), the Deputy Executive Director of THCC, and Plaintiff's direct supervisor. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 53; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 53.)
In or about  [*10] April 2007, Plaintiff requested, and was granted, a leave of absence under the FMLA after being hospitalized with viral pneumonia, a cardiac infarction, and asthma. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 55; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 55.) In or about April 18, 2007, Plaintiff reported to DOHMH's Employees' Health Program ("EHP") offices for a return to duty evaluation by Dr. Michael Gehl, EHP's Clinical Medical Director. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 56; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 56.) Plaintiff submitted several letters from her physicians which stated that she could return to work, but with a recommendation that she be assigned closer to home in Queens. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 57, 58; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 57, 58.) On or about April 24, 2007, Dr. Robert Martin, one of Plaintiff's treating physicians, sent a letter to Aragon in which he stated that he did not believe that Plaintiff should return to work until May 21, 2007. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 59; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 59.)
On May 21, 2007, Plaintiff was cleared to return to full duty and returned to work. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 60; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 60.) When Plaintiff returned from FMLA leave, Jordan informed her not to return to  [*11] Morrisania, and subsequently, Plaintiff only reported to 225 Broadway. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 62; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 62.)
On May 21, 2007, Plaintiff sent Aragon an email suggesting that she be reassigned to DOHMH's Take Care New York Program because, due to her experience, she would be qualified to make presentations to hard to reach groups. (Seacord Decl., Ex. LL.)

4. Plaintiff Submits Formal Request for Reasonable Accommodation
On June 6, 2007, Plaintiff sent an email to DOHMH EEO Investigator Harold Bailey ("Bailey") in which she requested "a transfer back to the Queens office at 120-34 Queens Blvd. due to medical hardship." (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 64; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 64.) In the email, Plaintiff also indicated that Jordan had denied her request to be transferred to the Queens office. (Id.) At the suggestion of Bailey, on June 7, 2007, Plaintiff completed a Request for Reasonable Accommodation form and submitted it to DOHMH's EEO office. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 66; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 66.) In the section of the form entitled "Accommodation Requested," Plaintiff stated:
I would like to minimize travel and be nearer my doctors/hospital for complications from to  [*12] [sic] severe chronic breast cancer, chemotherapy, uterine cancer, stroke TIA, and heart attack - documentation is at NYCDOHMH Employee Health - I would like to go back to my old office in Queens.
(Seacord Decl., Ex. NN.)
On June 8, 2007, Plaintiff sent another email to Aragon stating that Jordan had provided her with a printout of the available DOHMH positions in Queens. Plaintiff acknowledged that none of the available positions were appropriate for her "from a skill and background point of view." (Seacord Decl., Ex. OO.) In the same email, Plaintiff proposed that DOHMH "create" a position for her whereby she could work from her former Queens office and travel to various community groups to give presentations on health topics. (Id.) Plaintiff proposed that a position be created because "[i]t is a waste of my skills to have me sit around here doing something that is not appropriate. The Agency should get 'more bang for their buck' so to speak." (Id.)

5. Defendants Attempt to Find Appropriate Alternative Assignments for Plaintiff
On or about June 21, 2007, Plaintiff met with the Deputy Commissioner of HCAI, Louise Cohen ("Deputy Commissioner Cohen"), to discuss possible alternative assignments  [*13] for her. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 71; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 71.) Plaintiff expressed an interest in working with DOHMH's Take Care New York program, but Deputy Commissioner Cohen informed Plaintiff that positions with this organization required extensive travel. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 72, 73; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 72, 73.) Plaintiff also suggested the possibility of working out of the Pest Control Office in Queens as she'd previously done, but Cohen did not believe this to be a viable option. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 79; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 79.) Following this meeting, Plaintiff wrote to Deputy Commissioner Cohen, stating that "I was glad to be provided with the opportunity to discuss my current health and disability problems with you and my request to work in the Queens DOHMH Administrative offices." (Seacord Decl., Ex. QQ.) Cohen testified at her deposition that she determined that assigning Plaintiff to work with Take Care New York would be inappropriate because it would require too much travel and that she "was not confident that [Plaintiff] could represent the agency in a way that I thought would be appropriate." (Cohen Dep. 189-190.) While Deputy Commissioner Cohen  [*14] testified that she inquired about available positions for Plaintiff, Plaintiff was not reassigned.
On or about July 6, 2007, Plaintiff submitted a second Request for Accommodation form to DOHMH's EEO office in the form of a "work location closer to home in order to reduce the stress and anxiety associated with the hour and a half commute each way every day." (Seacord Decl., Ex. RR.) Plaintiff also stated that "[t]his stress and anxiety is having a detrimental effect on my health, as my doctors['] letters support." (Id.)
On July 11, 2007, Plaintiff wrote a letter to DOHMH Commissioner Thomas Frieden ("Commissioner Frieden") appealing the denial of her request for a reasonable accommodation within the agency. (Seacord Decl., Ex. SS.) Plaintiff wrote that "because of [Deputy Commissioner Cohen's] decision, I am now making an appeal to you." (Id.) On July 13, 2007, after learning of the July 11, 2007 letter, Deputy Commissioner Cohen sent Plaintiff a memorandum to further discuss her request for a different assignment. (Seacord Decl., Ex. TT.) Cohen stated additional alternatives that Plaintiff might consider, such as working at the THCC program at Rikers Island and the Queensboro Facility,  [*15] but rejected Plaintiff's request to work out of the Pest Control Office in Queens as it was not "appropriate or practical for one individual to be oustationed at a location away from clients, colleagues and supervision." (Id.) In the memorandum, Cohen also suggested that Plaintiff speak to her union about the possibility of negotiating a "swap" with another Associate Staff Analyst in Queens. (Id.) Subsequent to receiving this memorandum, Plaintiff did not request to work at Rikers Island or the Queensboro Correctional Facility, nor did she apply for any positions in other agencies or pursue a swap. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 96, 97, 98; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶¶ 96, 97, 98.)
On August 1, 2007, a meeting was held at 225 Broadway for the purpose of discussing Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation. Present at the meeting were Plaintiff, Aragon, Jeppe, Jordan, and Fausto Zapata ("Zapata"), the union attorney representing Plaintiff. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 101; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 101.) At the meeting, it was decided that the possibility of Plaintiff working at Rikers Island would not be appropriate because of her anxiety. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 102; Pl.'s Rule 56.1  [*16] stmt. ¶ 102.) According to Aragon, even though THCC had offices in other boroughs, locations in the Bronx were not discussed because Plaintiff was adamant about working in Queens. (Aragon Dep. 80.)
On or about August 29, 2007, Plaintiff and Zapata met with Aragon. Plaintiff gave Aragon a list of positions within DOHMH to which she claimed to have applied. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 104; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 104.) Of the positions to which Plaintiff applied, three were for Associate Staff Analysts. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 105; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 105.) Of those three positions, one was located in Manhattan, and the other two indicated the office location as "Multiple Locations in NYC". (Id.) Plaintiff did not follow up on any of her applications. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 108; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 108.)
On or about September 6, 2007, Plaintiff sent Aragon a memorandum further discussing her request for a reasonable accommodation. In the memorandum, Plaintiff again requested she be able to work out of the Pest Control Office in Queens. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 109; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 109.) In addition, Plaintiff attached a separate letter signed by several members of the  [*17] Pest Control staff, indicating that the Pest Control Office in which she'd previously worked had been vacant since her transfer, that it was equipped with a computer, desk and telephone, and that "the Pest Control staff would greatly welcome her return." (Seacord Decl., Ex. YY.) Plaintiff testified during her deposition that she didn't speak to anybody about working at the Bureau of Pest Control because she was not aware of any appropriate openings at the Bureau itself. (Seacord Decl., Ex. G: Pl.'s Dep. 182)

6. Plaintiff Files EEOC Charge and Complaint in State Court
On or about October 3, 2007, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), alleging, inter alia, that Defendants denied her request for a reasonable accommodation and retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 112; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 112.) Additionally, on October 3, 2007, Plaintiff initiated an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, raising claims under the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), New York State Executive Law §§ 290, et seq., and the New York City Human Rights Law  [*18] ("NYCHRL"), New York City Administrative Code §§ 8-101, et seq. By order to show cause dated October 25, 2007, Plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in her state court action directing that DOHMH "grant [her] the reasonable accommodation of assigning her to a work site situated near her home together with a telephone for the hearing impaired." (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 114; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 114.) By Order dated January 2, 2008, Plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction was denied. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 115; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 115.)
In or about February 2008, DOHMH provided Plaintiff with a telephone for the hearing impaired. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 117; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 117.)
In or about April 2008, Plaintiff lost consciousness at work as a result of cardiac arrhythmia. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 119; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 119.) According to Plaintiff, one of her treating cardiologists subsequently recommended that she not return to work and that she apply for Social Security disability. (Seacord Decl., Ex. H: Pl.'s Dep. 33.)

7. Plaintiff Initiates the Instant Action
On or about May 15, 2008, Plaintiff initiated  [*19] the instant action.
In or about June 2008, Plaintiff applied for Social Security Disability Insurance ("SSDI") benefits. (Seacord Decl., Ex. H: Pl.'s Dep. 34.) By in or about December 2008, Plaintiff began receiving SSDI benefits. (Id. at 35.)
Plaintiff retired from her employment with DOHMH on February 1, 2009. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 123; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 123.)
On or about February 11, 2009, the United States Department of Justice issued Plaintiff a letter informing her of her right to initiate a civil action under the ADA within 90 days of her receipt of that letter. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 124; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. ¶ 124.)
On or about May 9, 2009, Plaintiff served an amended complaint in which she added causes of action under the ADA.

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a court shall grant a motion for summary judgment "if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of establishing that no genuine  [*20] issue of material fact exists and that the undisputed facts establish her right to judgment as a matter of law." Rodriguez v. City of New York, 72 F.3d 1051, 1060-61 (2d Cir. 1995). The substantive law governing the case will identify those facts that are material and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, a court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "If, as to the issue on which summary judgment is sought, there is any evidence in the record from any source from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, summary judgment is improper." Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994).

DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiff's Reasonable Accommodation Claims
Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act require employers to provide "reasonable accommodations" for qualifying employees. See Powell v. Nat' 1 Bd. of Med. Examiners, 364 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir. 2004) [*21] . In order to establish a prima facie case of failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability." Giordano v. City of N.Y., 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001). If a plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, an employer can nonetheless prevail if it can show that providing the proposed accommodation would have resulted in undue hardship. See Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 99 (2d Cir. 1999).
Plaintiff testified at her deposition that she requested two types of accommodations from DOHMH: (1) that she be provided with a telephone for the hearing impaired; and (2) that she be transferred to a work location in Queens, and, specifically, that she be permitted to work at the Pest Control Office in Queens. (See Pl.'s Dep. Part 6, Exhibit H, at 44-45.) In Plaintiff's responsive  [*22] papers, she claims she requested additional accommodations, which were wrongfully denied: she requested a car, a parking permit, and the ability to work from home for a few days a week. (See Pl.'s Opp. Br. 13.)

1. Request for Telephone for Hearing Impaired
Plaintiff claims that she was improperly denied a reasonable accommodation in the form of a telephone for the hearing impaired in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Defendants argue that this claim fails as a matter of law because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendants actually denied her requests for such an accommodation. The Court agrees.
Although Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that she never received a telephone for the hearing impaired, Plaintiff testified at her deposition that, on three separate occasions, she was provided with such a telephone or some sort of telephone amplification device: (1) shortly after plaintiff's admission into the 55-a program in or about 1994, see Pl.'s Dep. Part 2, Ex. D, at 125-26; (2) when she was assigned to Pistilli in August 2006, see Pl.'s Dep. Part 3, Ex. E, at 67-69; Reimbursement Form, Exhibit Y; and (3) in February 2008, when Plaintiff worked at 225 Broadway, see Pl.'s  [*23] Dep. Part 5, Ex. G, at 191.
Nonetheless, Plaintiff claims, and Defendants concede, that Plaintiff did not possess such a device between the time she first was assigned to 225 Broadway, in or about January 2007, and in or about February 2008, when it is undisputed that Plaintiff received such a device. (See Pl.'s Opp. 12-13; Pl.'s Dep. Part 5, Ex. G, at 191.) Plaintiff, however, has provided no documentary evidence showing that she ever requested such a device from January 2007 to February 2008, either formally or informally. Even assuming that she made such a request and it was denied, her claim nonetheless fails for the following two reasons.
First, an employer need only provide accommodations that are necessary in order for an employee to perform the essential functions of his or her job. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) ("The term reasonable accommodation means ... (ii) Modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position") (emphasis added); Raffaele v. City of New York, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17786, at *51 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2004).  [*24] The ADA does not obligate the employer to meet the personal preferences of disabled employees. "The obligation to make reasonable accommodation . . . does not extend to the provision of adjustments or modifications that are primarily for the personal benefit of the individual with a disability." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630.9, App. Accommodations need only be "sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated." Id. (emphasis added).
Here, Plaintiff has testified that while she was assigned to 225 Broadway, she did not have to use the telephone as part of her job duties. (See Pl.'s Dep. Part 5, Ex. G, at 193.) Therefore, because a telephone device for the hearing impaired would not have affected Plaintiff's ability to perform the essential functions of her job, Defendants were not required to provide her with one under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act - though they did so in February 2008. As a result, her claim must be dismissed.
Second, even if DOHMH was required to provide Plaintiff with a device for the hearing impaired, Plaintiff's claim still fails. Where a failure to accommodate claim is premised on a delay in providing the requested accommodation, a Plaintiff  [*25] must prove that the delay was "motivated by discriminatory intent." See Powers v. Polygram Holding, Inc., 40 F. Supp. 2d 195, 202 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (summary judgment granted on employee's claim that a three-week delay in granting a request to work reduced hours violated the ADA); Manessis v. NYC Dep't of Transportation, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1921, *51 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2003)(finding that Plaintiff's ADA claim must be dismissed because the delay in providing the accommodation was not motivated by discriminatory intent and in fact appeared to be "an oversight" on Defendant's part). Although "unreasonable delay in providing an accommodation can provide evidence of discrimination," Jay v. Intermet Wagner Inc., 233 F.3d 1014, 1017 (7th Cir. 2000), there is nothing here that suggests that the delay Plaintiff experienced in receiving her telephone hearing device was motivated by discriminatory intent. In fact, Plaintiff's supervisors discussed obtaining a device for her in the Fall of 2007, and the email exchange between Plaintiff's supervisors suggests that the delay was caused by a search for a specific hearing device that was compatible with the instruments used by DOHMH. (See Telephone  [*26] Device emails, Seacord Reply Decl., Exhibit GGG.) Nor can Plaintiff offer any evidence to prove that Defendants intentionally delayed receipt of the requested device, or that the delay affected her performance as Plaintiff testified that it was not necessary for her to use a phone as part of her job duties.
For these reasons, Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim pertaining to a telephone device for the hearing impaired fails as a matter of law and must be DISMISSED.

2. Request to Accommodate Plaintiff's Commute to Work

(a) Request to be transferred to Queens
The second accommodation that Plaintiff requested was to be transferred from her work location in Manhattan to a location closer to her home in Queens. (See Seacord Decl., June 2007 Request for Reasonable Accommodation, Ex. NN; July 6, 2007 Request for Reasonable Accommodation, Ex. RR.) Plaintiff's commute required "two buses, three subways, lots of stairs, standing, and crowding." (Pl.'s Opp. Br. 14)(citations omitted). According to Plaintiff, she requested this accommodation because she wanted to "be nearer to [her] doctors," see Seacord Decl., Ex. NN, and because she wanted to "reduce the stress and anxiety" associated with  [*27] traveling to and from work, which had a "detrimental effect on [her] health." (See Seacord Decl., Ex. RR.) Plaintiff argues that a reduced commute would lessen the "wear and tear of her body." (Pl.'s Opp. at 14.)
Additionally, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Robert Martin ("Martin"), testified that he was concerned about the stress associated with Plaintiff's traveling to and from Manhattan to work, although he believed that she would ultimately be able to adapt to it. (See Martin Deposition, Exhibit CCC, at 64-65.) Neither Plaintiff nor Martin testified that Plaintiff had any difficulties performing her duties once she arrived at her work location in Manhattan.
As already discussed, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act require only that an employer accommodate the "job-related needs" of its employees. See Raffaele, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17786, at "51 (E.D.N.Y. 2004). Thus, the majority of courts that have addressed this issue, including two in this District, have concluded that an employer need not accommodate an employee's difficulties commuting to and from work. See Raffaele, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17786, at *51 (E.D.N.Y. 2004)("Difficulties commuting to a job need not be accommodated.");  [*28] Pimentel v. City of New York, 00-CV-0326 (SAS), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20426 at *52-55 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2001) (finding that employer was not required to reduce plaintiff's commuting time so that she could receive her interferon injections and weekly blood work); see also Bull v. Coyner, No. 98 C 7583, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1905, at *24-*25 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 23, 2000) ("Activities that fall outside the scope of the job, like commuting to and from the workplace, are not within the province of an employer's obligations under the ADA."); Salmon v. Dade County Sch. Bd., 4 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1163 (S.D. Fla. 1998) ("[P]laintiff's commute to and from work is an activity that is unrelated to and outside of her job."); Schneider v. Continental Cas. Co., 95 Civ. 1820 (EEB)(RAG), 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19631, at *24 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 16, 1996) (concluding that an employer was not required to accommodate an employee's back injury by eliminating the employee's commute to work); LaResca v. American Tel. & Tel., 161 F.Supp.2d 323, 334 (D.N.J. 2001) (holding that an employer is not required to provide transportation to work as a reasonable accommodation for an employee whose disability makes it difficult  [*29] for that employee to use public or private means of transportation, unless the employer provides such transportation for all employees). In other words, activities that fall outside the scope of the job, like commuting to and from the workplace, are not within the province of an employer's obligations under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o) (1) (ii) .
Furthermore, as discussed in Section (A)(1), the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not obligate an employer to meet the personal preferences of disabled employees: Accommodations need only be sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated. See e.g., Fink v. New York City Dept. Of Personnel, 855 F. Supp. 68, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ("There is no provision requiring the employer to take account of the disabled individual's preference in choosing the means of accommodation."), aff'd, Fink v. New York City Dept. Of Personnel, 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995) "As the Act [Section 504] has been interpreted, it requires the employer to make a reasonable accommodation of the plaintiff's disability. . . It does not require the employer to provide every accommodation the disabled employee may  [*30] request, so long as the accommodation provided is reasonable.") (citation omitted).
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Defendants denied her accommodation by failing to reduce her commuting time. Although it is clear that Plaintiff preferred working closer to home, Defendants were not required to accede to Plaintiff's requests; commuting falls outside the scope of Plaintiff's job, and is thereby not within the province of an employer's obligations under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. For this reason, Plaintiff's claim - to the extent that she claims she was denied a reasonable accommodation in the form of a less difficult commute - must be DISMISSED.
To the extent that Plaintiff's request to accommodate her commute to work implicates a request for a reassignment, this argument fails as well. While the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act may require an employer to reassign a disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation, the employee bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of a vacant position for which she is qualified and to which she could be reassigned. See Jackan v. New York State DOL, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000). In order  [*31] to be "qualified" for a new position, the employee must "(1) satisfy the legitimate prerequisites for that alternative position, and (2) be able to perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodations." See Dalton v. Subaru-Isuzu Auto., 141 F.3d 667, 678 (2d Cir. 1998). Moreover, "[n]othing in the ADA requires an employer to abandon its legitimate, nondiscriminatory company policies defining job qualifications, prerequisites, and entitlements to intra-company transfers." Id. In other words, a defendant does not have a duty to provide a disabled employee with a job for which she is qualified. Rather, the employer's only duty is to treat the disabled individual "in the same manner that it treat[s] other similarly qualified candidates." Wernick v. FRB, 91 F.3d 379, 384-85 (2d Cir. 1996). In this case, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy her burden of identifying an available position for which she was qualified.
In Plaintiff's first email in which she made reference to her medical conditions and requested a shorter commute to and from work, she requested to be transferred to the OHP Bureau. (See November 20, 2006 Email, Ex. AA.) However,  [*32] the record indicates that no vacant positions existed at OHP at the time, and for this reason, Plaintiff's request was denied. (See November 22, 2006 Email, Ex. BB; see also Cohen Dep., Ex. R, at 35-36, 157.) In fact, in a subsequent June 8, 2007 email to Aragon, Plaintiff acknowledged that she'd reviewed a printout of the available positions at the DOHMH offices in Queens and that none were appropriate for her "from a skill and background point of view." (Seacord Decl., Ex. OO.)
In a July 13, 2007 memorandum following up on a June 21, 2007 meeting with Plaintiff to discuss possible alternative job assignments, Deputy Commissioner Cohen advised Plaintiff that the only THCC offices in Queens were located on Rikers Island and at the Queensboro Correctional Facility, and, if Plaintiff wished to work at one of those locations, then her request would be considered. (See July 13, 2007 Memo, Exhibit TT.) Plaintiff never requested to be assigned either to Rikers Island or the Queensboro Correctional Facility. (See Pl.'s Dep. Part 5, Ex. G, at 136-41.) Similarly, there were no available positions in Queens in either the Division of Healthcare Access and Improvement ("HCAI") or the Bureau of  [*33] Pest Control. (See Aragon Dep. Part 2, Ex. V, at 28-29; Pl.'s Dep. Part 5, Ex. G, at 182.)
On the other hand, in or about August 2007, Plaintiff did apply for several positions within DOHMH, but only-three of those positions were for individuals holding Plaintiff's civil service title of Associate Staff Analyst. (See Application Materials, Ex. W.) Of those three positions, one would have required Plaintiff to work at 161 William Street in Manhattan, and one would have required Plaintiff to travel to various locations in the South Bronx, East and Central Harlem and Central Brooklyn. (See id.) Thus, those two positions would not have achieved Plaintiff's objective of working in Queens. As for the third position, the posting indicated that the preferred candidate would have "[a]t least one (1) year of clinic management experience," see id., and Plaintiff's resume does not indicate that she had this experience, nor has she presented evidence that she was qualified for this position. (See Pl.'s Resume, Ex. WW.)
Thus, the record indicates that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy her burden of identifying a vacant position for which she was qualified that would have achieved her objective of reducing  [*34] her travel time to and from work. For this additional reason, her claim fails.

(b) Additional Requests
Although the documentary evidence supports only a finding that Plaintiff requested an accommodation in the form of a transfer to a work location closer to her home in Queens, Plaintiff claims in her opposition papers that she made several additional requests - she requested a car, the use of a parking permit, and the ability to work from home for a few days - all of which were denied. (See Pl. Opp. Br. 13.)
With respect to Plaintiff's claim that she requested a car and the use of a parking permit, these claims fail for the same reason stated above with respect to Plaintiff's claim for a reasonable accommodation in the form of a reduced commute: they were not requests for a reasonable accommodation within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Defendants were not obligated to accommodate Plaintiff's commuting difficulties. Plaintiff does not allege that she requested a car and a parking permit to accommodate job-related activities. While these accommodations would have reduced her commute to work, they are not job-related as defined by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. For  [*35] this reason, these claims fail.
As to the claim that Plaintiff requested "to work from home a few days a week," see Pl.'s Opp. Br. 13, courts have generally held that it is not reasonable to require an employer to allow an employee to work without any direct supervision. See Smith-Henze v. Edwin Gould Servs. for Children & Families, 06-CV-3049 (LBS), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94081, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2008) ("Courts have generally held that it is generally not reasonable to require an employer to accommodate a request to work outside the workplace, where there is no supervision by superiors or interaction with coworkers."); see Lalla v. Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc., 00-CV-6260 (HB), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5312, at *14-*15 (S.D.N.Y. April 30, 2001); see also Keck v. New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse, 10 F. Supp. 2d 194, 201-202 (N.D.N.Y. 1998) (concluding that plaintiff's request to work after hours, unsupervised, was unreasonable). In this case, Plaintiff has come forward with no rationale that would justify a deviation from this general rule. Accordingly, the Court finds that this requested accommodation is not reasonable and that Plaintiff's claim, thereby,  [*36] fails.
In conclusion, all of Plaintiff's claims that she was denied a reasonable accommodation must be DISMISSED.

B. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff claims that she was retaliated against because of her disability and because she requested a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. (See Am. Compl., Ex. B ¶¶ 65, 70.) In her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the retaliatory acts taken against her were: (1) denial of a reasonable accommodation; (2) improper work assignments; (3) belittling her; and (4) refusing to find her suitable work. (See Am. Compl., Ex. B., at ¶ 58.)
To state a claim for retaliation, a plaintiff must establish:
(1) participation in a protected activity known to the defendant; (2) an employment action disadvantaging the plaintiff or action that would dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination; and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.
Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. V. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006); Holt v. KMI-Continental, 95 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1228, 117 S. Ct. 1819, 137 L. Ed. 2d 1027, 1997 WL 71191 (1997);  [*37] Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1308 (2nd Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). If the plaintiff sets out a prima facie case, then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory rationale for its actions. Johnson v. Palma, 931 F.2d 203, 207 (2d Cir. 1991); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the defendant proffers a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason, the burden of production then shifts back to the plaintiff to introduce evidence that the defendant's reason was a pretext for retaliation. Id. The burden of proof and persuasion remains at all times with the plaintiff. Milano v. Astrue, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74488, 2008 WL 4410131, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2008).
Here, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she either cannot demonstrate that the alleged actions were materially adverse or that a causal connection existed between the alleged protected conduct and the challenged actions. The Court agrees with Defendants' that Plaintiff's Retaliation Claims must be DISMISSED.

1. "Denial of a Reasonable Accommodation"
First,  [*38] Plaintiff alleges that DOHMH retaliated against her by denying her a reasonable accommodation in response to her having requested a reasonable accommodation.
The denial of a reasonable accommodation is an independent cause of action under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. As discussed in Section A, the Court has dismissed all of Plaintiff's claims that she was denied a reasonable accommodation. While it is conceivable that an employer may retaliate against an employee for having brought a reasonable accommodation claim by denying a subsequent request for a reasonable accommodation, these are not the facts here: Plaintiff has not asserted any facts to suggest that Defendants denied her a reasonable accommodation in retaliation for a prior request.

2. "Belittling her"
Plaintiff claims that she was "belittled" in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation. See Am. Compl., Ex. B, at ¶ 58; Pl.'s Dep. Part 6, Ex. H, at 64-72. (Pl.'s Dep., Part 6., Ex. H at 66.) Plaintiff primarily complains of being belittled by being given assignments not commensurate with her job qualifications. (Id. at 66)("the assignments in the Bronx and Brownsville were belittling.") These claims will be  [*39] addressed in Section (B)(3) addressing "improper work assignments."
To the extent that this belittling took the form of verbal threats or offensive comments, Plaintiff's claim fails because courts in this Circuit have held that such comments, alone, do not constitute "materially adverse" actions. See, e.g., Vazquez v. Southside United Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74480, at *37-*38 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2009) (collecting case law).
In Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Company v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006), the Supreme Court held that in the context of retaliation claims, "a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Id. at 68 (internal citations omitted). While the Court found that the prohibitions on retaliation expanded beyond "discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment," it also noted that an individual is protected "not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm." Id. at 64, 68.  [*40] Courts interpreting Burlington Northern have held that empty verbal threats do not cause an injury, and therefore are not materially adverse actions, where they are unsupported by any other actions. See Pugni v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc., No. 05-cv-8026 (CM), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26284, 2007 WL 1087183, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2007) (threats that plaintiff's days at company "were numbered" were not viewed as materially adverse action where threat was never executed); Vazquez v. Southside United Hous. Dev. Fund Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74480, at *37-38 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2009)(finding no material adverse action where supervisor allegedly called plaintiff a "traitor"); Harris v. South Huntington Sch. Dist., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27392, 2009 WL 875538, at *19 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2009) (finding no material adverse action where supervisor allegedly asked plaintiff to resign after he complained about other employees).
Here, Plaintiff testified that Deputy Commissioner Cohen called her "medically fragile", id. at 69, and that Jordan told another co-worker that Plaintiff was "crazy and difficult to get along with." Id. at 72. In the absence of any other actions by or on behalf of Defendants,  [*41] these empty verbal threats do not cause an injury as a matter of law, and therefore are not materially adverse actions. As such, Plaintiff's claim premised on being belittled must fail.

3. "Improper work assignments" and "refusing to find her suitable work"
Finally, Plaintiff's remaining retaliation claims fail because she cannot establish a causal connection between her alleged protected activity and the challenged actions. In a retaliation case, a plaintiff can demonstrate a causal connection between the alleged protected activity and the challenged adverse actions in one of two ways: "(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant." See Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000).
Here, Plaintiff does not attempt to establish a causal connection through direct evidence of retaliatory animus, but rather, relies solely on circumstantial evidence and the alleged temporal proximity  [*42] between the events. (See Pl.'s Dep. Part 6, Ex. H, at 63-74.) This attempt fails.
It is well settled that, "[w]here timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise." See Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance America Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001).
Here, Plaintiff claims that she was retaliated against by being given "inappropriate work assignments" and that Defendants "refus[ed] to find her suitable work." When asked what improper work assignments she was referring to, Plaintiff stated in her deposition that she "had been given assignments to clean store rooms, move boxes, answer phones," as well as to distribute flyers. (Seacord Decl., Ex. H: Pl.'s Dep. 63-64.) Plaintiff stated that these events occurred "in 2006 when [she] was first placed on loan" and was assigned to THCC, under the supervision of Galvin. (Id. at 64.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff was first assigned to THCC and reported to Galvin in January 2006. (Defs.' Rule 56.1 stmt. 26; Pl.'s Rule 56.1 stmt. 26.)
The first date on which Plaintiff made a request for a reasonable  [*43] accommodation was November 20, 2006, when she sent an email to Aragon requesting that she be transferred to the Oral Health offices in Queens because her medical conditions affected her ability to travel to and from work. (See November 20, 2006 Email, Ex. AA; See also Am. Compl. ¶ 18 ("[b]eginning in November 2006, Tinkelman requested that a reasonable accommodation be made.") Thus, by Plaintiff's own admissions, the alleged adverse conduct - receiving improper work assignments - began well before she engaged in any protected activity, and, therefore, by definition, cannot be retaliatory. Like Plaintiff's other retaliation claims, these claims must be DISMISSED.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED with respect to all of Plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Complaint is DISMISSED in its entirety. Because no further issues remain to be decided in this action, the Clerk of the Court is directed to close the case.
