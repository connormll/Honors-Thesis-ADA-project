ORDER
Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. #28)
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to FRCP 56 (Dkt. #28), filed August 7, 2009; Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. #30), filed August 25, 2009; and Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. #31), filed September 4, 2009. The Court conducted a hearing on the motion on September 10, 2009.

PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY
Plaintiff Carmen Melone filed his complaint in this case on July 3, 2008, in which he alleges that Defendant violated his rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA") of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §12101, et. seq. (Dkt. #1). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA by refusing to accommodate his disability arising from his prostate cancer surgery in December [*2]  2006, and his need and request thereafter to work a five day work week. (Id.) Instead of granting his requested accommodation, Plaintiff alleges Defendant fired him on March 16, 2007. (Id.)
Mr. Melone was hired as a salesman by Defendant Paul Evert's RV Country, Inc. in 2003 and was employed for most of the time thereafter until March 2007 at Defendant's Laughlin, Nevada business location. (Pl.'s Dep. at 8-9, attached as Ex. B to Def.'s Mtn for Summ. J., Dkt. #28). Mr. Melone testified that the employment with Defendant was somewhat seasonal in nature because of the extreme summer heat in Laughlin, Nevada. (Id. at 14, 17). During some years, he did not work for Defendant in the summer months. (Id.) In other years, however, he worked for Defendant year round. (Id.) Defendant required the sales personnel to work seven or six days a week during the busier fall and winter months. (Id. at 31-32).
Mr. Melone testified that he first became aware that the had prostate cancer in September 2006. (Pl.'s Dep. at 18). Plaintiff's cancer was sufficiently advanced that his urologist, Dr. Zapinsky, recommended a prostatectomy--surgical removal of the prostate gland. (Id. at 18-19). Mr. Melone underwent that surgery by Dr. Robert Reiter [*3]  at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, in December 2006. (Id. at 19). Plaintiff took an approved leave of absence from Paul Evert's RV Country related to the surgery from approximately December 11, 2006 until January 15, 2007 when he returned to work. (Id. at 29-31).
Upon returning to work, Mr. Melone was required to work seven days a week as were the other sales persons. (Pl.'s Dep. at 31-32). The work involved walking the RV lot looking for customers, speaking with customers to sell them an RV, assisting another salesman as a team in the selling of RVs, showing motor homes to customers and calling potential customers to discuss their interest in buying an RV. (Id. at 33-35). Mr. Melone stated that he returned to work two weeks early and, working a seven day schedule, he was in a lot of pain from the surgery and movement in and out of motor homes. (Id. at 34-35).
On or about February 1, 2007, Mr. Melone's work schedule was changed to six days a week. (Id. at 36). Mr. Melone testified that it was difficult for him to work the scheduled shifts. (Id. at 34-36). He had difficulty urinating and was in pain from the surgical incision. (Id.) Plaintiff testified that he needed to urinate frequently and experienced burning when he did urinate. (Id. at 34-35, 48-49). Initially, [*4]  he had to urinate 10-12 times a day. (Id. at 49). This increased to 16-20 times a day. (Id. at 49-50). Plaintiff testified that his problems with frequent urination and periodic pain continued to worsen during February and March of 2007. (Id. at 49-51).
Despite the limitations from his frequent need to urinate and the pain from the surgery, Plaintiff was able to perform his job. (Pl.'s Dep. at 34-35, 51). Mr. Melone testified, however, that he also experienced "tiredness" or fatigue. (Id. at 40-41). He stated that he was generally okay in the mornings, but by late afternoon, the fatigue would set in and he would try to take rest breaks at work. (Id.) In addition, Plaintiff states that he developed difficulty sleeping, experienced anxiety about his ability to perform at work and depression related to his impotence. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 9, Dkt. #30-3 at 2). He also had to remain out of the sun because of an antibiotic prescribed by his doctor. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 10, Dkt. #30-3 at 2). Mr. Melone stated that he thought that if he had an additional day off from work to rest, he could better deal with these physical issues. (Pl.'s Dep. at 51-52).
Mr. Melone testified that he spoke with his manager, Tom Schmidt, about the physical problems he was [*5]  experiencing, including urination. (Id. at 37-38). He told Mr. Schmidt that the six day schedule was too much for him and that he wanted to work four or five days a week. (Id. at 38). According to Plaintiff, Mr. Schmidt told him that he was not special and that everyone had to work the seven or six day schedule. (Id. at 38-39, 40, 42).
In early February 2007, Mr. Melone exchanged emails with his physician, Dr. Reiter, regarding his ability to work. (Dkt. #30-4 at 8). Dr. Reiter faxed a February 12, 2007 letter to Mr. Melone, addressed "To Whom It may Concern," which stated that Mr. Melone was under Dr. Reiter's care for prostate cancer and that the doctor had advised him not to exceed a 5 day work week until his next follow-up appointment in March. (Pl.'s Dep. at 42-43; Dkt. #30-4 at 6). Mr. Melone testified that the letter was received at Evert's RV on or about February 15. (Pl.'s Dep. at 42-45). He told Mr. Schmidt about the letter and Mr. Schmidt instructed Plaintiff to put the letter on Mr. Schmidt's desk, which he did. Plaintiff did not know whether Mr. Schmidt actually read the letter. (Id.) Plaintiff testified, however, that Mr. Schmidt avoided him after he placed the letter on his desk. When Plaintiff spoke with Mr. [*6]  Schmidt again, Mr. Schmidt told Plaintiff that all salespeople have to work a minimum of six days a week. (Id. at 45).
Mr. Melone continued to work six days a week up until March 13 or 14 when he again returned to UCLA for a medical appointment with Dr. Reiter. (Pl.'s Dep. at 50-51). During that visit, Dr. Reiter scheduled Mr. Melone for transurethral surgery on April 25, 2007 to rectify his urination problems. (Id.; Dkt. #30-4 at 10). Upon returning from UCLA, Plaintiff told Mr. Schmidt that he was scheduled to have surgery in April. He did not recall Mr. Schmidt saying anything in response to that information. (Pl.'s Dep. at 54-55). The next day, March 16, 2007, Plaintiff was fired from Paul Evert's RV Country, Inc. (Id. at 62).
On July 3, 2008, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging that Defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq. (the "ADA") when Defendant fired him without attempting to allow reasonable accommodation of his disability. (Dkt. #1).

DISCUSSION
Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff is unable to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. (Dkt. #28 at 8). Defendant contends that Plaintiff is unable to establish one of the [*7]  essential elements of his claim, that he was a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA. (Id.) Based on the alleged deficiency in Plaintiff's claim, Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not disabled under the ADA and Defendant was not obligated to reasonably accommodate Mr. Melone. (Id.) Plaintiff responds that based on the physical limitations resulting from his cancer and prostatectomy, he meets the standard for a "qualified individual with a disability". In addition to his deposition testimony, Mr. Melone submits a sworn declaration and medical evidence to support his claim. (Dkt. #30-3 at 1-4; Dkt. #30-4 at 6).

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine and disputed issues of material fact remain and when, viewing the evidence most favorably to the nonmoving party, the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); Eisenberg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 815 F.2d 1285, 1288-89 (9th Cir. 1987). The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no material factual dispute. The Court must regard as true the opposing party's evidence, if supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Eisenberg, 815 F.2d at 1289. In addition, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party against whom summary [*8]  judgment is sought. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Intel Corp. v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 952 F.2d 1551, 1558 (9th Cir. 1991).
Material facts which would preclude entry of summary judgment are those which, under applicable substantive law, may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Where the moving party does not bear the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact remains by demonstrating that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. The burden then shifts to the opposing party to produce specific evidence, through affidavits or admissible discovery material, to show that the dispute exists. Bhan v. NME Hosps., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1409 (9th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 994 (1991). A complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
In deciding whether to grant summary judgment, a court must (1) determine whether a fact is material; (2) whether there exists a genuine issue for the trier of fact, as determined by the documents submitted to the court; and (3) consider that evidence in light of the appropriate standard of proof. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Summary judgment is not proper if material factual issues exist for trial. B.C. v. Plumas Unified Sch. Dist., 192 F.3d 1260, 1264 (9th Cir. 1999). "As to materiality, only disputes over facts that might [*9]  affect the outcome of the suit governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputes over irrelevant or unnecessary facts should not be considered. Id. Where there is a complete failure of proof on an essential element of the nonmoving party's case, all other facts become immaterial, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Summary judgment is not a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather an integral part of the federal rules as a whole. Id.

II. Analysis of Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claim

A. Disability analyzed under the ADA or ADA Amendment Act of 2008
Defendant argues that in evaluating Plaintiff's disability claim to determine if summary judgment is appropriate, the Court should apply the legal standard for disability under the ADA established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 194-95 (2002). (Dkt. #28 at 9). Plaintiff responds that the Court should instead examine Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the ADA Amendment Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), which defined disability in broader terms. Pub.L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008). (Dkt. #30 at 7-8). Defendant replies that the ADAAA should not be applied in this case because it did not take effect until January 1, 2009 [*10]  and cannot not be applied retroactively. (Dkt. #31 at 6-7).
The Ninth Circuit has determined that the ADAAA amendments to the ADA do not apply retroactively. Becerril v. Pima County Assessor's Office, 587 F.3d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 2009). In Becerril, the Ninth Circuit noted that "absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result" statutes should not be applied retroactively. 587 F.3d at 1164 (citing Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994)). Reviewing the language of the ADAAA, the Ninth Circuit found that the amendment "does not show clear retroactive intent, providing instead that '[t]his Act and the amendments made by this Act shall become effective on January 1, 2009.'" Becerril, 587 F.3d at 1164 (citing ADAAA § 8, 122 Stat. at 3559). See also Lytes v. DC Water & Sewer Auth., 572 F.3d 936, 941 (D.C.Cir. 2009) (examining the ADAAAA and concluding that "the delayed effective date in the ADAAA ... admits of only one explanation: The Congress intended the statute to have prospective only effect"); Fredricksen v. United Parcel Serv. Co., 581 F.3d 516, 521 n. 1 (7th Cir. 2009); Milholland v. Sumner County Bd. of Educ., 569 F.3d 562, 565-67 (6th Cir. 2009); EEOC v. Agro Distrib., LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 469 n. 8 (5th Cir. 2009).
In this instance, both the events underlying Plaintiff's claim and the filing of the complaint preceded the effective date of the ADAAA, January 1, 2009. (See Dkt. #1). Accordingly, this Court must analyze Plaintiff's disability claim under the standards for determining disability under the ADA rather than the ADAAA.

B. Analysis of Plaintiff's Alleged Disability under the ADA
The ADA makes it unlawful for covered entities, [*11]  including private employers, to discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 477 (1999). The statute provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination, under the ADA, includes: "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
A disability under the ADA is: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). The inquiry into whether a person is disabled under the first part of this definition involves a three-part analysis: (1) does the individual [*12]  have a physical or mental impairment; (2) does such impairment limit one or more of the major life activities of the individual; and (3) is such limitation substantial? See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 194-95. The fact that a plaintiff suffers from a particular named condition is not sufficient in itself to render him eligible for relief under the ADA. Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555, 566 (1999). It is the effect of the condition on that person's life that matters. Id.

1. Impairment
EEOC regulations1 define a physical impairment under the ADA as "[a]ny physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine". 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h) (1991); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j) (2005). Courts have found that cancer and the side effects from the treatment of cancer constitute a physical impairment under the ADA. See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 632-33 (1998) (stating that impairments under the ADA include "such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments . . . cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and ... drug addiction and [*13]  alcoholism") (citing 42 Fed.Reg. 22685 (1977)); Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Associates, Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 912 (11th Cir. 1996) (finding a "physical impairment" in the weakness, dizziness, swelling of the ankles and hands, numbness of the hands, the loss of body hair, and vomiting resulting from chemotherapy); Ellison v. Software Spectrum, Inc., 85 F.3d 187, 190 (5th Cir. 1996); Bizelli v. Amchem, 981 F.Supp. 1254, 1257 (E.D.Mo. 1997) (stating "[t]here is no dispute that cancer can constitute a physical impairment under the ADA").
When Plaintiff returned to work following his prostatectomy, he had a physiological condition affecting several of his bodily systems, including the genito-urinary system. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was experiencing periodic pain, fatigue and the need to urinate frequently. (Dkt. #28 at 4; Dkt. #30 at 5). As a result of the prostatectomy and the resulting physical problems, Plaintiff needed to take frequent breaks at work. (Pl. Dep. at 35, 40). Based on the cancer, the prostatectomy and Plaintiff's resulting physical limitations, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden of showing an impairment.

2. Major Life Activities
Plaintiff alleges that his impairments substantially limit the major life activities of performing manual tasks, sleeping, standing, walking and working. (Pl.'s Compl. ¶ 10, Dkt. #1; Pl.'s Decl. in Supp. Of Opp. to Def.'s Mtn for Summ. [*14]  J. ¶¶ 8-11, Dkt. #30-3 at 2-3).
The ADA does not define "major life activity". McAlindin v. County of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1233-34 (9th Cir. 1999), opinion amended on denial of reh'g, 201 F.3d 1211 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 639 (1998)). The ADA phrase "major life activities" refers to "those activities that are of central importance to daily life". Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002). See also Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 639 (noting that the use of the word "major" suggests that "the touchstone for determining an activity's inclusion under the statutory rubric is its significance"). With this understanding, the Ninth Circuit has defined the term "major life activity" as very broad and including activities that are private in character. McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1233-34; see also Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 639 (rejecting an attempt to confine major life activities to "those with a public, economic, or daily aspect"). In addition, a major life activity also must be "a basic activity that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty." McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1233 (quoting Pack v. Kmart Corp., 166 F.3d 1300, 1305 (10th Cir. 1999)). Under this standard, the Court will examine whether Plaintiff's impairments impact a "major life activity".

a. Working
The EEOC and Department of Health and Human Services regulations suggest several functions that constitute a major life activity, including "caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, [*15]  breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (1991); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j) (2005). Based on the inclusion of working in the regulatory definition of "major life activities," Plaintiff's claim that working constitutes a major life activity under the ADA would appear to be self-evident.
However, the Supreme Court has declined to state that working is a major life activity under the ADA, noting that the argument is circular, "it seems to argue in a circle to say that if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of an impairment, from working with others then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question you're asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by reason of handicap". Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 492 (1999) (declining to rule on whether work constitutes a major life activity as the question was not raised by the parties) (quotation marks, brackets, ellipses and citation omitted). While the Supreme Court declined to rule on the question, courts have routinely assumed working constitutes a major life activity, and, as the parties have not raised this issue, this Court will make the same assumption. Id.; Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 261 F.3d 789, 795 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2001); Puckett v. Park Place Entertainment Corp., 332 F.Supp.2d 1349, 1353 (D.Nev. 2004); Niimi-Montalbo v. White, 243 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1122 n. 6 (D.Hawai'i 2003). This assumption is further supported by the central place work holds in most people's daily lives as the basis for earning [*16]  a living and supporting themselves. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has met his burden of showing working constitutes a major life activity.

b. Performing Manual Tasks
The Supreme Court has stated that "performing manual tasks" only constitutes a "major life activity" when the specific manual tasks in question are central to daily life. Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002) (emphasis added). Plaintiff states that his impairments have impacted his ability to perform manual tasks. (Dkt. #30 at 9; Dkt. #30-3 at 2). Upon examining Plaintiff's pleadings and exhibits filed in this matter, however, the Court is unable to find any evidence presented by Plaintiff supporting his allegation that he is impaired in his ability to perform manual tasks. (See Dkt. #s 1, 30). Similarly, Plaintiff has not provided any details regarding what manual tasks he might be limited in performing. (See Dkt. #s 1, 30).
Instead, Plaintiff's pleadings state in conclusory and general terms that he has limitations in performing manual tasks. (Dkt. #30 at 9; Dkt. #30-3 at 2). In his Declaration, he states "Upon returning to work on January 15, 2007, I quickly realized my limitations with and difficulty performing manual tasks. I became tired quite easily [*17]  and was unable to walk or stand for extended periods of time (greater than 30 minutes)." (Dkt. #30-3 at 2). Such a statement equates the inability to perform unnamed manual tasks as a limitation on "major life activities," similar to walking or standing. However, Plaintiff has provided no information to meet his burden of identifying specific manual tasks and showing that they constitute "activities that are of central importance to daily life". See Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 197. As a result, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show that he has an impairment preventing him from performing manual tasks.

c. Other Major Life Activities
In addition to working and performing manual tasks, Plaintiff alleges that sleeping, standing and walking constitute major life activities. (Pl.'s Compl. ¶ 10, Dkt. #1; Pl.'s Decl. in Supp. Of Opp. to Def.'s Mtn for Summ. J. ¶¶ 8-11, Dkt. #30-3 at 2-3). Courts have found that all of these activities constitute "major life activities" under the ADA as they are of central importance to the daily lives of most people. Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 197 (stating that walking fits into the category of major life activity as it is central to daily life); Talley v. Family Dollar Stores of Ohio, Inc., 542 F.3d 1099, 1107 (6th Cir. 2008) (walking and standing); Gretillat v. Care Initiatives, 481 F.3d 649, 652 (8th Cir. 2007) (walking and standing); McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1234 (sleeping); Pack, 166 F.3d at 1305 (sleeping); [*18]  Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Dept., 158 F.3d 635, 643 (2d Cir. 1998) (sleeping). See also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (1991); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j) (2005) (listing walking as a function constituting a major life activity). This authority is further supported by the central place that sleeping, standing and walking hold in most people's daily lives. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff has met his burden of showing that sleeping, standing and walking constitute a major life activity.
The next inquiry, then, is whether Plaintiff is substantially limited in the major life activities of sleeping, standing, walking and working.

3. Substantial Limitation

a. Working
Where a plaintiff claims that his impairments substantially limit the major life activity of working, the statutory phrase "substantially limits" requires, at a minimum, that plaintiff allege that he is unable to work in a broad class of jobs." Sutton, 527 U.S. at 491. The Court further explained as follows:
To be substantially limited in the major life activity of working ... one must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different [*19]  jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.
Id. at 492.
In the Ninth Circuit, a plaintiff attempting to defeat summary judgment on a claim of substantial limitation of "working," must present specific evidence about relevant labor markets to demonstrate that she is precluded from a broad range of jobs. Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 261 F.3d 789, 795-96 (9th Cir. 2001); Thompson v. Holy Family Hosp., 121 F.3d 537 (9th Cir. 1997). In Thompson, an employee brought suit under the ADA, contending that she was terminated from her position as a registered nurse on the basis of her disabling back and neck strain. 121 F.3d 537. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was disabled because the plaintiff presented "no evidence that the restrictions on her ability to perform total patient care preclude her from engaging in an entire class of jobs." Id. at 539-540. Similarly, in Broussard v. Univ. of Cal., 192 F.3d 1252 (9th Cir.1999), the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment, holding that to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff "needed to identify what requirements posed by the class of ... jobs ... were problematic in light of the limitations ... imposed on her." Id. at 1259 (finding an affidavit from a vocational [*20]  rehabilitation specialist that stated plaintiff was limited to working in the category of sedentary and light jobs was not sufficient evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact) (quoting Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., 133 F.3d 499, 507 (7th Cir.1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Duncan v. Washington Metro. Transit Auth., 240 F.3d 1110 (D.C.Cir. 2001) (en banc) (holding that "the ADA requires a plaintiff ... to produce some evidence of the number and types of jobs in the local employment market in order to show that he is disqualified from a substantial class or broad range of such jobs"). In Thornton, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment, stating that the plaintiff "failed to present evidence of the jobs from which she was precluded and of the relevant labor markets for that class of jobs." 261 F.3d at 796.
Mr. Melone's pleadings and exhibits include no information about the class of jobs from which he is allegedly precluded due to his impairments. (Dkt. #s 1, 30). In addition, Plaintiff has provided no evidence of the relevant labor market for that class of jobs to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact related to his claim of substantial limitation of "working". (Id.) Instead, Plaintiff argues that his impairments substantially limit his ability to work more than five (5) days [*21]  a week in his former position with Paul Evert's RV Country, Inc. (Dkt. #30 at 8-10). Therefore, the Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that a issue of material fact exists related to his claim of substantial limitation of "working".

b. Performing Manual Tasks
Assuming that Plaintiff was able to demonstrate that he was unable to perform manual tasks which constitute tasks of central importance to daily life, his pleadings also fail to demonstrate that his limitations "substantially limit" his ability to perform manual tasks. See Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 197. Under Toyota Motor Mfg., a party alleging disability due to an impairment substantially limiting his ability to perform manual tasks must demonstrate that he is significantly limited in his ability to do several activities of central importance to daily life. 534 U.S. at 201-02. Examples of some such activities include bathing, brushing one's teeth, doing household chores, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, reading, breathing, driving, learning, using tools, working, playing sports, and the like. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i); Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 201-02; Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 2003); see also EEOC v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 306 F.3d 794, 803 (9th Cir. 2002).
Plaintiff has failed to offer any details regarding how he is limited in [*22]  performing any specific manual tasks of central importance to daily life. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that his impairments substantially limit his ability to perform manual tasks.

c. Sleeping
To establish a substantial limitation of the major life activity of sleeping for the purpose of defeating summary judgment, all that is required is for plaintiff to submit a declaration alleging great difficulty sleeping at night. Granados v. J.R. Simplot Co., Inc., 266 Fed.Appx. 547, 548 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Head v. Glacier Northwest Inc., 413 F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2005)). However, a plaintiff's statement may not be merely self-serving and must contain sufficient detail to convey the existence of an impairment. See Head, 413 F.3d at 1059. In Head, the Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiff had submitted sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact on a claim of substantial limitation of the major life activity of sleeping by stating in his declaration that he "would pass out for a while immediately after getting home from work," but was unable to get a full night of sleep, and after he woke up he had "great difficulty going to sleep when it was time to go to bed for the night." Head, 413 F3d at 1060. The plaintiff in Head further testified that he commonly only got five to six hours of sleep a night compared to the seven [*23]  to nine before his diagnosis with depression or bipolar disorder and that on some nights, even with the help of medications, he could not get to sleep for hours or even all. Similarly, in McAlindin v. County of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1235 (9th Cir. 1999), a genuine issue of fact existed where the plaintiff stated that he had experienced great difficulty sleeping at night and his doctor had explained to the plaintiff's supervisor that this was a side effect of his many medications.
Mr. Melone's declaration does not meet this standard. (Dkt. #30-3 at 1-4). Plaintiff did not testify during his deposition to having any trouble sleeping and has not provided any medical records attesting to such a disability. (See Pl.'s Dep., Dkt. #28; Dkt. #30). Plaintiff merely states in his declaration that he "had difficulty sleeping". (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 9, Dkt. #30-3 at 2). Such a vague statement does not contain sufficient detail to demonstrate the existence of an impairment that substantively limits Plaintiff's ability to sleep.

d. Standing and Walking
When addressing a major life activity other than working, "the central inquiry must be whether the claimant is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to most people's daily lives, not whether the claimant is unable [*24]  to perform the tasks associated with her specific job." Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 200-01; E.E.O.C. v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 306 F.3d 794, 802 (9th Cir. 2002). The Ninth Circuit has held that for a plaintiff to demonstrate a substantial limitation of a major life activity, the impairment must prevent or severely restrict the life activity compared with how unimpaired individuals normally practice the activity in daily life. E.E.O.C., 306 F.3d at 797 (holding a claim for substantial limitation of sight must show "the impairment must prevent or severely restrict use of [the plaintiff's] eyesight compared with how unimpaired individuals normally use their eyesight in daily life"). Based on the standard for substantial limitation established by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Mfg., a court evaluating a claim of substantial limitation of standing or walking must examine the degree to which a plaintiff's impairments limit his ability to stand and walk in daily life. See 534 U.S. at 200-01; E.E.O.C., 306 F.3d at 802.
In determining whether the limits on a plaintiff's ability to walk and stand are substantial, the EEOC's regulations that implement the ADA are instructive. See Toyota, 534 U.S. at 195 (noting that the definitions provided by the EEOC's regulations are useful, but their persuasive authority is not absolute). Under the EEOC's definition, "substantially limit[ed]" [*25]  means "[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity." 29 CFR § 1630.2(j). Additional factors enumerated in the EEOC regulations that may also be considered include: "(i) [t]he nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) [t]he duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long term impact, or expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment." Id.
Plaintiff's declaration and deposition testimony document the manner in which his impairments limit his ability to stand and walk in his daily life. (Dkt. #28 at 16-39; Dkt. #30-3 at 1-4). Mobility and the ability to ambulate by walking and standing are central activities in the daily life of the average person, who is able to walk and stand for extended periods of time. In contrast, Plaintiff's cancer and fatigue severely restricts his mobility, leaving him "unable to walk or stand for extended periods of time (greater than 30 minutes)." (Pl. Decl. ¶ 8, Dkt. #30-3 [*26]  at 2). After walking or standing for 30 minutes, Plaintiff needs to sit and rest until the fatigue recedes and he can regain his strength. (Id. at 40-41). Plaintiff is further limited in his ability to walk because he experiences periodic pain when walking. (Pl.'s Dep. at 34-35, Dkt. #28). Based on these impairments, in February 2007, Dr. Reiter restricted Plaintiff to working no more than five days a week. (Id. at 42-43; Dkt. #30-4 at 6).
In addition, Plaintiff's testimony demonstrates that the cancer, fatigue and periodic pain that limit his ability to walk and stand are permanent conditions. Mr. Melone has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. (Pl. Decl. ¶ 20, Dkt. #30-3 at 3-4). As a result, Plaintiff's suffering of fatigue will continue throughout his life and, as the cancer progresses, he will experience a decrease in muscle mass and loss of bone density, which will further restrict his ability to walk and stand. (Pl. Decl. ¶¶ 16-20, Dkt. #30-3 at 3-4).
Based on the detailed nature of Mr. Melone's impairments in his declaration and deposition testimony, as well as the work restrictions imposed by Dr. Reiter, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated that his cancer, fatigue and periodic [*27]  pain substantially limit his ability to walk and stand in his daily life compared to an average person's ability.

III. Defendant's Obligation to Reasonably Accommodate Plaintiff
Defendant argues that if the Court finds Mr. Melone is not a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA, the Court should also find that the ADA requirements that employers make reasonable accommodation of a person with a disability do not apply to Mr. Melone. (Dkt. #28 at 9). Because the Court finds that Mr. Melone has raised a question of material fact as to whether his standing and walking limitations make him a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA, Defendant's argument regarding reasonable accommodation does not warrant summary judgment. Whether or not Defendant had a duty to provide reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's alleged disability is a question of fact for trial.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiff Carmen Melone has met his burden of showing a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA by demonstrating he meets the standard for a "qualified individual with a disability." Mr. Melone has made a sufficient factual showing that his physical impairments resulting from his [*28]  cancer and surgery substantially limited his ability to stand and walk. Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to FRCP 56 (Dkt. #28) is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties shall file their joint proposed pretrial order on or before March 27, 2010.
DATED this 25th day of February, 2010.
