REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE HONORABLE GEORGE B. DANIELS
FRANK MAAS, United States Magistrate Judge.
I. Introduction
In this employment discrimination case, pro se plaintiff  [*2] Dennis Shipman ("Shipman"), proceeding in forma pauperis, seeks monetary and injunctive relief from the New York State Office of Persons With Developmental Disabilities ("OPWDD"), the Metro Developmental Disabilities Services Office ("DDSO" and, together with OPWDD, the "Agency"), and four current or former Agency officials: former Acting Commissioner Max E. Chmura ("Chmura"); Associate Commissioner Jill Gentile ("Gentile"); Director of the Office of Affirmative Action, Delores Lark ("Lark"); and former Acting Director of the DDSO, Particia Schuckle ("Schuckle") ("Individual Defendants" and, together with the Agency, the "State Defendants"). Shipman also has sued his union, the New York State Public Employees Federation, AFL-CIO ("PEF"), mistakenly identified in his pleadings as the Professional Employees Federation, for failing to provide him with legal representation.
Shipman, who allegedly suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ("PTSD") as a result of his service as a volunteer emergency medical technician at Ground Zero on September 11, 2001, contends that the State Defendants failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his disability, in violation of the Americans  [*3] with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12181, et seq., and that this failure ultimately caused him to quit his job.
The State Defendants and PEF each have moved to dismiss Shipman's claims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons set forth below, their motions should be granted.
II. Background
A. Facts
The following facts are either undisputed or set forth in the light most favorable to Shipman for purposes of this motion:
In September 2002, Shipman began working at the DDSO (an OPWDD facility) as a "social worker assistant." (ECF No. 72 ("Pl.'s Opp'n") at 1).1 In July 2005, Shipman's PTSD caused him to take an unpaid leave of absence pursuant to New York Civil Service Law Section 73. (Id.). Although the unpaid leave lasted much longer than one year, the Agency "grudgingly reinstated" Shipman in August 2009.2 (Id.).
After his reinstatement, Shipman was subjected to "life threatening stress levels" caused by "vindictive managers" who "harass[ed] him daily." (Id. at 2). In particular, former DDSO Treatment Team Leader Paul Blackwell ("Blackwell"), with the "tacit consent" of Program Specialist Josie Astacio-Cancel ("Astacio-Cancel"), "badgered" Shipman about his weekly work schedule.  [*5] (ECF No. 24 ("Amended Complaint" or "Am. Compl.") ¶ 6(3)). Although other Agency employees were afforded wide latitude in selecting their schedules as long as they worked eight and one-half hours per day, Blackwell told Shipman that he could not begin work before 8:30 a.m. (Id.). Blackwell and Astacio-Cancel also directed Shipman to perform tasks that were redundant or unnecessary, which necessitated his taking a sick day as "a coping mechanism." (Id. ¶ 6(5)). Blackman subsequently caused an unwarranted "counseling memo" to be placed in Shipman's file. (Id.).
In either March or May 2010, Shipman reported his disability to Donald Odom ("Odom"), a DDSO Affirmative Action Counselor. Shipman requested that he be reassigned to a less stressful position within the Agency or another state agency, noting that his PTSD caused "an inability to effectively cope with stress or stressful situations." (Id. at ¶ 6(7); Pl.'s Opp'n at 3).3 His request for an accommodation was denied, however, "because his medical records were not updated and, more importantly, he was stable." (Am. Compl. ¶ 6(7)). Shipman concedes that he did not comply with the Agency's request for medical records, but contends that  [*6] any such submissions would have been unnecessarily duplicative because "[Agency] Personnel had already been provided with an application for accommodation despite their protestations to the contrary, which are frankly untrue." (Pl.'s Opp'n at 3).
Shipman "immediately reported this exchange" to Lark, the DDSO Director of Affirmative Action, who failed to respond. (Am. Compl. ¶ 6(8)). Shipman also wrote to Schuckle, who was serving as DDSO's Acting Director. Schuckle also did not respond. (Id. ¶ 6(9)).
On May 25, 2010, Shipman suffered what he describes as "a nervous breakdown" triggered by the "discriminatory conduct" of Blackwell and Astacio-Cancel. (Id. ¶¶ 6(1), 6(3)). Around that time, Shipman informed Astacio-Cancel and other Agency personnel that he was unable to perform his job and, therefore, "was taking a leave of absence because he could no longer tolerate the stress[,] and was experiencing strong or violent anger  [*7] while having flashbacks to a prior traumatic event[.]" (Id. ¶ 6(9)).
Shipman wrote to Schuckle again on June 1, 2010, "asking to not be removed from the payroll or to be accommodated." (Id. ¶ 6(10)). Schuckle failed to respond, and Shipman was removed from the state payroll on June 3, 2010. (Id. ¶¶ 6(10-11)).
On July 17, 2010, Shipman sent a letter to Schuckle's supervisor, Associate Commissioner Gentile, who responded on July 27, 2010, and apologized for her delayed response. Gentile promised to contact Shipman "once [she] ha[d] information for [him]." (Id. ¶ 6(14)). On July 27, Shipman also wrote a letter to then-Acting Commissioner Chmura. Chmura did not respond to that letter or a letter that Shipman sent to him on August 1. (Id.).
Shipman promptly communicated the foregoing facts to his union, PEF. (Id. ¶ 6(19)). Shipman's numerous attempts to discuss his situation with PEF personnel proved unsuccessful, however, until Field Representative Barry Markman ("Markman") "responded after an urgent call was placed to him on September 16, 2010, when [Shipman] was directed to leave the premises of . . . DDSO with no written notice as to why he was ordered to vacate the premises." (Id.). According  [*8] to Shipman, "PEF has done little or nothing . . . to redress what is a blatant violation of th[e] collective bargaining agreement, New York State Civil Service [Law, and New York] Worker Compensation Law." (Id.). Shipman further surmises that, by failing to advocate on his behalf, PEF is "acting in concert with . . . DDSO in furtherance of an illegal scheme to deny [Shipman] reasonable accommodation . . . [and] employment, and aggravate the hardship with which he has been confronted since being removed from the state payroll." (Id.).
On January 31, 2011, Shipman was "compelled to resign." (Pl.'s Opp'n at 4). As a result of being removed from the DDSO payroll, Shipman has suffered serious financial difficulties and emotional distress, and subsequently has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the District of Delaware, where he now lives. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6(17-18); Pl.'s Opp'n at 5). Shipman therefore seeks relief in the form of "reinstatement of pay with lost time; reasonable accommodation; re-assignment, and, an inter-agency transfer." (Am. Compl. ¶ 7). Shipman also renews a prior request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction requiring the State Defendants to  [*9] reinstate him pending the final resolution of this case. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 1).4 Shipman further seeks relief from PEF in the form of legal representation and sanctions. (Id. at 2).
B. Procedural History
Shipman commenced this action on July 30, 2010, by filing a complaint in the Northern District of New York. (See ECF No. 1 ("Original Complaint")). Shipman subsequently filed his Amended Complaint on October 20, 2010. (Am. Compl. at 1). On April 19, 2011, the parties stipulated to a transfer of venue to this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a). (ECF No. 52). Thereafter, on April 29, 2011, Your Honor referred this case to me for a Report and Recommendation with respect to any dispositive motions. (ECF No. 57). The State Defendants and PEF then filed their motions to dismiss on July 17, 2011. (ECF Nos. 65, 67). Those motions are fully submitted. (See ECF Nos. 65-76).
C. In Forma Pauperis Application
When he filed the Original Complaint, Shipman also filed a motion  [*10] for leave to proceed in forma pauperis ("IFP"). (ECF No. 3). Magistrate Judge Randolph F. Treece of the Northern District of New York granted that motion on August 30, 2010. (ECF No. 9). In his affidavit in support of the IFP motion, Shipman stated under oath that he earned no income from any "[b]usiness, profession or form of self-employment" in the twelve months preceding the filing of this lawsuit. (ECF No. 3). That statement is contradicted, however, by Shipman's admission that the Agency paid him through June 2010, one month before he filed his Original Complaint. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 4 ("The last check plaintiff had received from defendants is dated June 2010."); see also ECF No. 68 (Aff. of Herminia Torres, sworn to on July 12, 2011 ("Torres Aff.")), ¶ 3 ("[Shipman] was paid the sum of $41,323.80 . . . within the twelve months preceding the date of his affidavit)).
Shipman contends that "[a]ny error made on [the] affidavit relative to his income for the 12 months preceding his emergency ex parte application is a red herring; strictly innocuous and, by extension, unintentional." (Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. A at 16). In response to that assertion, the State Defendants have submitted evidence that  [*11] Shipman also provided false information in his IFP applications in other cases. For example, in Shipman v. Verizon Communications Corp., 10 Civ. 271 (D. Del.), Shipman's IFP affidavit, sworn to on March 30, 2010, stated that he was unemployed and had earned no income in the previous twelve months. If his allegations in this case are true, however, Shipman was employed by the Agency from August 2009 through March 2010. (See ECF No. 6 (Aff. of Barbara K. Hathaway, Esq., Ass't Att'y Gen., sworn to on July 15, 2011 ("Hathaway Aff."), Ex. B)). Similarly, in Shipman, a/k/a Shipman Holdings LLC v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 10 Civ. 130 (D. Del.), Shipman stated under penalties of perjury in his IFP application that he was unemployed and had earned no income in the twelve months prior to February 5, 2010. (See Hathaway Aff. Ex. C).
In yet another pro se case, Shipman v. TD Bank, 10 Civ. 2217 (D.N.J.), the district judge dismissed Shipman's complaint due to: (1) "significant inconsistencies between [Shipman's IFP] application and his civil suit," which alleged that Shipman had suffered substantial losses to his business, and (2) Shipman's failure to submit a timely response to the court's request  [*12] that he amend his IFP application to clarify his financial situation. (See Hathaway Aff. Ex. D).
III. Discussion
A. Standard of Review
1. Rule 12(b)(6)
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim tests the legal sufficiency of a plaintiff's claims for relief. Krasner v. HSH Nordbank AG, 680 F. Supp. 2d 502, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (Lynch, D.J.). In deciding the motion, the Court must accept as true all factual allegations made in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Allaire Corp. v. Okumus, 433 F.3d 248, 249-50 (2d Cir. 2006). The complaint need not contain "detailed factual allegations." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Nonetheless, "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint "must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).5 Determining whether the allegations of a complaint  [*13] nudge a plaintiff's claims across the line from merely "conceivable to plausible" requires the Court to "draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Id. at 1950-51.
In making its assessment, the Court may consider, in addition to the plaintiff's factual averments, any written instrument upon which the plaintiff necessarily relies, regardless of whether it is attached to the complaint or incorporated therein by reference. See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2002). When a plaintiff is proceeding pro se, the Court also may rely on any opposition papers in assessing the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims. See Crum v. Dodrill, 562 F. Supp. 2d 366, 373 n.13 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing Gadson v. Goord, No. 96 Civ. 7544 (SS), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18131, 1997 WL 714878, at *1 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 1997)).  [*14] Furthermore, the Court may take judicial notice of indisputable facts. See Fed. R. Evid. 201. Legal conclusions masquerading as factual averments, however, may not be taken into account. Smith v. Local 819 I.B.T. Pension Plan, 291 F.3d 236, 240 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing Gebhardt v. Allspect, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 2d 331, 333 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)).
Because Shipman is proceeding pro se, the Court must read his pleadings "liberally" and interpret them "to raise the strongest arguments" that they may suggest. Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162, 170 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Harris v. City of N.Y., 607 F.3d 18, 24 (2d Cir. 2010)). "Dismissal of a pro se complaint is nevertheless appropriate where a plaintiff has clearly failed to meet minimum pleading requirements." Carvel v. Ross, No. 09 Civ. 722 (LAK) (JCF), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25203, 2011 WL 856283, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2011).
2. Rule 12(b)(1)
Under Rule 12(b)(1), a complaint must be dismissed if a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court is not limited to the face of the complaint and may consider evidence outside the pleadings to resolve disputed factual issues. State Emp. Bargaining Agent Coal. v. Rowland, 494 F.3d 71, 77 n.4 (2d Cir. 2007);  [*15] Phifer v. City of N .Y., 289 F.3d 49, 55 (2d Cir. 2002). The plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Phifer, 289 F.3d at 55 (citing Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000)).
When a court is faced with a motion to dismiss pursuant to both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), it should "decide the 'jurisdictional question [under Rule 12(b)(1)] first because a disposition of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is a decision on the merits, and therefore, an exercise of jurisdiction.'" Tirone v. N.Y. Stock Exch., Inc., No. 05 Civ. 8703 (WHP), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54255, 2007 WL 2164064, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2007) (quoting Magee v. Nassau Cnty. Med. Ctr., 27 F. Supp. 2d 154, 158 (E.D.N.Y. 1998)). Accordingly, I will turn first to the State Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion seeking dismissal of Shipman's ADA claim on jurisdictional grounds.
B. ADA Claim Against the State Defendants
1. Eleventh Amendment
Under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, a State and its agencies generally are immune from suit in federal court. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54-56, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996). "For Eleventh Amendment purposes, [OPWDD] is  [*16] to be considered an arm of New York State." Komlosi v. N.Y. Office of Mental Retardation & Developmental Disabilities, 64 F.3d 810, 815 (2d Cir. 1995); see Komlosi v. Fudenberg, No. 88 Civ. 1792 (HBP), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114887, 2009 WL 4722758, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2009).
There are only two exceptions to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. These exceptions apply when there has been an explicit and unequivocal waiver of immunity by a State or a similarly clear abrogation of the immunity by Congress. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984). "A claim that is barred by a state's sovereign immunity must be dismissed pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction." Henny v. New York, No. 08 Civ. 10981 (KMK), 842 F. Supp. 2d 530, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15595, 2012 WL 335732, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2012) (citing Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1637, 179 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2011); Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 54).
Here, there is no suggestion that the State Defendants have waived their sovereign immunity. See Perciballi v. New York, No. 09 Civ. 6933 (WHP), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107835, 2010 WL 3958731, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2010). The Court must, however, consider several separate provisions of the ADA to determine whether  [*17] Congress has abrogated the State Agency's sovereign immunity.
2. ADA Claim Against the Agency
a. Title I
Title I of the ADA provides that, "no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) ("Title I").
In Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2011), the Supreme Court held that Title I did not validly abrogate state Eleventh Amendment immunity, despite the fact that Congress "unequivocally intend[ed] to do so." Id. at 363-64, 368-74 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12202 ("A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in [a] Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of [the ADA].")). The Court explained that "Congress may not . . . base its abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity upon the powers enumerated in Article I" of the Constitution. Id. at 364. Instead, "Congress may subject nonconsenting States to suit  [*18] in federal court" only pursuant to a valid exercise of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Because Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment only permits Congress to enact legislation enforcing the substantive guarantees contained in Section 1 of that amendment, Congress may not abrogate state Eleventh Amendment immunity "unless Congress' actions were congruent and proportional in enforcing the constitutional guarantees set forth in Section 1[.]"6 Castells v. Fisher, No. 05 CV 4866 (SJ), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30188, 2007 WL 1100850, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2007) (citing Garrett, 531 U.S. at 368; City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 512, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1997)).
In Garrett, the Court found that "States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational." Garrett, 531 U.S. at 367.  [*19] In doing so, the Court recognized that States "could quite hardheadedly - and perhaps hardheartedly - hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled" without violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 367-68. The Court further found that the legislative record of the ADA failed to demonstrate "a pattern of unconstitutional discrimination on which [Section] 5 legislation must be based," id. at 370, and that "the accommodation duty" created by Title I "far exceeds what is constitutionally required." Id. at 372. The Court therefore held that Title I did not validly abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. Id. at 374.
Applying Garrett here, Shipman's ADA claim must be dismissed to the extent that he seeks money damages or injunctive relief from the Agency under Title I. See also Fed. Mar. Comm'n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 765, 122 S. Ct. 1864, 152 L. Ed. 2d 962 (2002) ("[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of whether a private plaintiff's suit is for monetary damages or some other type of relief."); Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 58 (The Supreme Court has "often made it clear that the relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevant  [*20] to the question whether the suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.").
b. Title II
Apparently cognizant of his inability to bring a successful Title I claim against the Agency, Shipman seeks to characterize his claim as having been brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132 ("Title II"). Title II provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from the participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." Id.
Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has decided whether employment discrimination claims against public employers can be brought under Title II. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 360 n.1 (declining to decide "whether Title II of the ADA . . . is available for claims of employment discrimination when Title I of the ADA expressly deals with that subject"); Brown v. Connecticut, 08-CV-1478, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52871, 2010 WL 2220580, at *18 (D. Conn. May 27, 2010) ("[T]he Second Circuit has not yet decided whether claims of discrimination in employment are cognizable under Title II of the ADA."). The circuit courts that have  [*21] addressed the issue are split, as are district courts in this District. Compare Zimmerman v. Or. Dep't of Justice, 170 F.3d 1169, 1173 (9th Cir. 1999) (Title II not applicable to discrimination claims), and Henny, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15595, 2012 WL 335732, at *14 (same), with Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation Dist., 133 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir. 1998) (employment discrimination claims may be brought pursuant to Title II), and Transp. Workers Union of Am., Local 100 v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 342 F. Supp. 2d 160, 175 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (same).
The Court need not resolve whether the availability of Title I precludes an employment discrimination claim under Title II because, even if it does not, the same Eleventh Amendment bar that precludes Shipman's Title I claim also precludes any employment discrimination claim that might be brought under Title II.
In Garrett, the Supreme Court chose not to "decide the constitutional issue whether Title II, which has somewhat different remedial provisions from Title I, is appropriate legislation under [Section] 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." 531 U.S. at 360 n.1. Nevertheless, five years later, in United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006), the Court held that  [*22] Title II is a valid abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity, "insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against the States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. at 159 (emphasis in original). The Court declined to decide whether a State is immune to Title II claims "premised on conduct that does not independently violate the Fourteenth Amendment," because
lower courts will be best situated to determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.
Id.
Applying those factors here, Shipman's Title II claim is clearly barred by the Eleventh Amendment. At the outset, the State conduct that allegedly violated Title II in this case is the Agency's failure to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee's disability. As the Court made clear in Garrett, such conduct does not  [*23] violate the Fourteenth Amendment, as long as the State acts rationally. 531 U.S. at 367 ("States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational."). Shipman contends that the reason the Agency did not grant him an accommodation was "because his medical records were not updated and, more importantly, he was stable." (Am. Compl. ¶ 6(7)). Assuming that is true, the Agency, at a minimum, acted rationally by requiring Shipman to prove that he was disabled before it granted him an accommodation. The Agency therefore did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, even if its conduct amounts to a violation of Title II. See Castells, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30188, 2007 WL 1100850, at *5 (finding no Fourteenth Amendment violation on similar facts, and noting that "the ADA's legislative record fails to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of irrational employment discrimination by the States against the disabled").
Turning to the third Georgia factor, even if Congress validly abrogated the States' immunity with respect to certain Title II claims "premised on conduct that does not independently violate the Fourteenth Amendment,"  [*24] any such abrogation is clearly inapplicable to employment discrimination claims. See Garrett, 531 U.S. at 374; see also Castells, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30188, 2007 WL 1100850, at *5 ("it is well-settled that government employment is not a fundamental right") (citing United Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council v. Camden, 465 U.S. 208, 219, 104 S. Ct. 1020, 79 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1984); Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1967)).
In sum, the alleged Agency conduct in this case did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and Congress did not validly abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to such conduct. Shipman's Title II claim against the Agency therefore must be denied. See Castells, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30188, 2007 WL 1100850, at *5 ("Accordingly, specifically where there is no fundamental right at issue, Title II of the ADA does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.").
c. Title V
Construed liberally, the Amended Complain also alleges that Blackman and Astacio-Cancel assigned Shipman unnecessary and redundant work and improperly disciplined him in retaliation for complaining about discrimination. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6(3-5); see also Pl.'s Opp'n at 2 (the Agency "never, ever reprimanded, counseled, or disciplined [Shipman] for his conduct,  [*25] work performance, or any other alleged abuse . . . until after he filed a formal ADA disability discrimination complaint with the United States Equal Opportunity Commission") (emphasis in original)).
Title V of the ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203 ("Title V"). Although the Supreme Court and Second Circuit have not explicitly held that the Eleventh Amendment bars Title V claims against state agencies, "every district court in this Circuit to consider the issue has concluded that sovereign immunity bars Title V claims." Padilla v. N.Y.S. Dep't of Labor, No. 09 Civ. 5291 (CM) (RLE), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96608, 2010 WL 3835182, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2010) (collecting cases); see also Chiesa v. N.Y.S. Dep't of Labor, 638 F. Supp. 2d 316, 323 (N.D.N.Y. 2009) ("If a state  [*26] is immune from underlying discrimination, then it follows that the state must be immune from claims alleging retaliation for protesting against discrimination."); Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988-89 (9th Cir. 2001) ("nothing in the ADA's legislative findings demonstrat[es] a pattern of discrimination by states against employees who oppose unlawful employment discrimination against the disabled," and "[a]bsent a history of such evil by the states, Congress may not abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from Title V claims").
Consequently, to the extent Shipman alleges that the Agency retaliated against him in violation of Title V, his claim must be dismissed.
2. ADA Claims Against the Individual Defendants
To the extent Shipman seeks to sue any of the Individual Defendants for money damages under the ADA, his claims are barred because individuals cannot be held liable for money damages under the ADA in either their personal or official capacities. See Perciballi, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107835, 2010 WL 3958731, at *4; Candelaria v. Cunningham, No. 98 Civ. 6273 (LAP), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8669, 2000 WL 798636, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 20, 2000). This includes retaliation claims brought under Title V. See Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 79-80 (2d Cir. 2010).  [*27] Shipman's claims against the Individual Defendants for money damages therefore must be dismissed.
Certain individual defendants, however, may be held liable in their official capacity pursuant to Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908). Under the Ex parte Young exception, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar "suit against a state official when that suit seeks . . . prospective injunctive relief." Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. 44 at 73, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996); see also In re Dairy Mart Convenience Stores, Inc., 411 F.3d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 2005) ("Whether a litigant's claim falls under the Ex parte Young exception to the Eleventh Amendment's bar against suing a state is a 'straightforward inquiry' that asks 'whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective."') (quoting Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (2002)).
In the employment context, "claims for reinstatement to previous employment satisfy the Ex parte Young exception to the Eleventh Amendment's sovereign immunity bar." State Emps. Bargaining Agent, 494 F.3d at 96. Shipman, however, has failed to allege that either Chmura, Gentile, Lark, or Schuckle has the  [*28] authority to reinstate him. Indeed, Shipman has indicated that he became ineligible for reinstatement on January 31, 2012. (See Pl.'s Opp'n at 1, 5). When a plaintiff "fails to allege that any [i]ndividual [d]efendant has the authority to reinstate him," his "claim for injunctive relief against the [i]ndividual [d]efendants cannot proceed." Perciballi, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107835, 2010 WL 3958731, at *4. Accordingly, Shipman's claim for injunctive relief against the Individual Defendants must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Shipman, however, should be permitted to replead if he complies with Section III.D, infra.
C. Breach of the Duty of Fair Representation
Construing the Amended Complaint liberally, Shipman appears to allege that PEF breached its duty of fair representation. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 6(19)). This claim also must be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.
"It is well settled that [federal courts] lack subject matter jurisdiction over duty of fair representation claims brought by employees of political subdivisions." Gear v. Dep't of Ed., No. 07 Civ. 11102 (NRB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137153, 2010 WL 5297850, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2010) (citing Ford v. D.C. 37 Union Local 1549, 579 F.3d 187, 188 (2d Cir. 2009)  [*29] (per curiam) (holding as such and noting that "[w]e deem it appropriate to issue a published opinion and thereby make clear beyond peradventure that this is the law of our Circuit")). Consequently, because the Agency clearly is a political subdivision of the state, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Shipman's fair representation claim against PEF.7
D. IFP Application
The statute governing IFP applications provides that "the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines  [*30] that . . . the allegation of poverty is untrue[.]" 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(A). Courts disagree as to whether a case must be dismissed any time the allegations in the affidavit are discovered to be untrue, or only if the plaintiff was not actually impoverished. Compare McRoyal v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 263 Fed. App'x 500, 502 (7th Cir. 2008) ("Whether the false statements actually result in a grant of in forma pauperis status or other relief is irrelevant under § 1915(e)(2)(A)."), with Lee v. McDonald's Corp., 231 F.3d 456, 459 (8th Cir. 2000) (plaintiff's claim need not be dismissed unless the court finds that he "is not sufficiently poor to qualify for in forma pauperis status given the facts that are true").
Although Shipman clearly earned income during the twelve months preceding the filing of this suit, it is unclear whether he would have qualified for IFP status had his affidavit been truthful. In any event, assuming that a truthful application would have been granted, the only claim that Shipman potentially might have been able to pursue without the payment of fees would have been a claim for injunctive relief against the Individual Defendants. Here, because Shipman has knowingly  [*31] made false statements on several IFP applications, including his affidavit in this case, if he wishes to proceed with that narrow claim, he should be required to pay (1) the $350 filing fee to the Clerk of the Court and (2) a $112 sanction to reimburse the United States Marshals Service for the costs incurred in serving the defendants. (See ECF No. 45); see also Moorish Nat'l Republic v. City of Chicago, No. 10 C 1047, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42014, 2011 WL 1485574, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 18, 2011) (requiring, on similar facts, that the plaintiff "disgorge the benefits of in forma pauperis status" by paying the $350 filing fee and a $100 sanction for the costs of service).
IV. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, PEF's motion to dismiss Shipman's breach of the duty of fair representation claim should be granted with prejudice, as well as the State Defendants' motion to dismiss his ADA claims against the Agency and his ADA claim for money damages against the Individual Defendants. Additionally, the State Defendants' motion to dismiss Shipman's ADA claim against the Individual Defendants should be denied without prejudice to the extent he seeks injunctive relief. If Shipman wishes to proceed with that claim, he should  [*32] first be required to pay the Clerk of the Court the sum of $462.
Because all of Shipman's claims are subject to dismissal, his renewed application for a temporary restraining order or injunction should also be denied. Further, if the Court adopts this Report and Recommendation, it may wish to certify, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that in forma pauperis status is denied for purposes of an appeal because an appeal would not be taken in good faith.
V. Notice of Procedure for Filing of Objections to this Report and Recommendation
The parties shall have fourteen days from the service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See also Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) and (d). Any such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court, with courtesy copies delivered to the chambers of the Honorable George B. Daniels and to the chambers of the undersigned at the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, New York 10007, and to any opposing parties. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a), 6(d), 72(b). Any requests for an extension of time for filing objections must be directed  [*33] to Judge Daniels. The failure to file these timely objections will result in a waiver of those objections for purposes of appeal. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Feb. R. Civ. P. 6(a), 6(d), 72(b); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985).
