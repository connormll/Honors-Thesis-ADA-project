Opinion



MEMORANDUM
Pending before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment seeking judgment on Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq., and the Tennessee Disability Act, Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-50-103. (Doc. Nos. 26 and 30). The motions are fully briefed. (Doc. Nos. 27, 31, 38, 39, 43, 47). In addition, the parties each filed and responded to statements of undisputed material facts. (Doc. Nos. 29, 32, 38-1, 40, 44).
For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 26) will be DENIED. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 30) will be GRANTED in part, and DENIED in part.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked for United Parcel Service, Inc. ("UPS") at the UPS facility in Franklin, Tennessee (the "Franklin Center"), [*2]  from January 2013 until November 2018, when she went on leave due to a back condition. (Doc. No. 38-1, ¶ 2; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 15).
UPS is an international delivery and supply chain management company. UPS facilities differ greatly in terms of physical size, staffing, and operational capacity. (Doc. No. 44, ¶ 4). Compared to other UPS warehouses the Franklin Center location is small and leanly staffed. (Id., ¶ 5). UPS writes job descriptions on a company-wide basis, but the particular functions performed by a specific position vary depending on the facility. (Id., ¶ 4).
In 2018 and 2019, Plaintiff worked as a part-time Sorter on the evening shift. (Id., ¶ 6; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 60). The Sorter position at the Franklin Center encompasses a number of functions, including loading and unloading trucks, pick-off, and small sort. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 22, 26, 30).
The "loading and unloading" function involves lifting packages into a truck for delivery or lifting packages from a truck and placing them onto a conveyor belt to be sorted. (Grissom Decl., ¶ 10). Packages vary in weight from one to 150 pounds and loaders and unloaders must be able to lift up to 70 pounds. [*3]  (Id.; Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 25; Preloader Job Description, Doc. No. 33-6).
The "pick-off" function involves sorting packages of varying weight on a passing conveyor belt. (Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 11; Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 31). The weight of these packages varies from one to 70 pounds and employees working the pick-off function must be able to lift up to 70 pounds. (Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 11).
Although some larger facilities have a dedicated "small sort" position, the "small sort" function is part of the Sorter position at the Franklin Center. The "small sort" function involves scanning small parcels and sorting those parcels into bins. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 10). Plaintiff testified that she spent 90-95% of her time scanning parcels in small sort. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No 33-5 at 87, 94-96). Small parcels weigh less than ten pounds, although occasionally larger parcels up to 35 pounds are misdirected to small sort. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 13-14; White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 69-70).
Once sorted into bins, the small parcels are then consolidated into large bags and carried to a conveyor belt corresponding to the final destination. (Grissom Decl., [*4]  Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 8). The large bags usually weigh between 30 and 40 pounds, but each employee can determine how much to put in a bag. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 19-21; Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 9; White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 67-68; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 74). Plaintiff testified that she worked as a bagger about five or six times a year. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 87). During a bagging shift, she lifted approximately ten bags per hours. (Id. at 79). She stated that, while working as a bagger, she never had to lift bags over 30 pounds. (Id. at 73, 290-91).
In addition to scanning and bagging, employees working in small sort break up packages that jam in the chute on the way to the scanning station. (White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 70; Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 9). Package jams happen throughout the night and can require a great deal of force to unjam, sometimes requiring the efforts of several people. (White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 70-71).
Although the Franklin Center does not have a dedicated small sort position, the UPS job description for small sort states that employees in this position must be able to "lift / lower, push / pull manipulate and carry containers weighing [*5]  up to 70 pounds and packages weighing up to 10 pounds." (See Small Sort Job Description, Doc. No. 33-7). However, there is conflicting testimony regarding whether employees in small sort ever lift 70 pounds. (See e.g., Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 9 (small sort must lift up to 70 pounds); White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 39-40 (same); Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 28-9 at 21 (employees in small sort never lift 70 pounds)).
Defendant states that Sorters work at different sorting functions depending on staffing needs. If one function runs out of work during a shift — e.g., there are no more small packages, or the truck is completely unloaded — employees are reassigned to other functions. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 33). Accordingly, UPS requires all Sorters to be able to lift up to 70 pounds. (Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶¶ 5-7).
Plaintiff worked as a part-time Sorter at the Franklin Center. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 15). She has had several injuries to her back.1 In July 2018, Plaintiff injured her back while unloading containers from a truck. (Doc. No. 44, ¶ 29). Her physician, Dr. Bradley Rudge, authorized her to return to work with medical restrictions that included lifting no greater [*6]  than 15 pounds. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 144). Pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, Defendant placed Plaintiff on light-duty work for 29 business days. (Id. at 158-63, 177-78; Doc. No. 33-11). When this period expired, she took a medical leave of absence. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 177-78).
In November 2018, Plaintiff saw an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Stanley Hopp, who released her to return to work without restrictions. (Id. at 179, 191-92; Pl. Med. Records, Sealed Doc. No. 35-1 at 119, 123, 126); Hopp Dep., Doc. No. 33-12 at 27). Two days after Plaintiff returned to work, she aggravated her back injury while breaking a package jam in small sort. (Doc. No. 33-13; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 154-55, 182, 186-87; Pl. Med Records, Sealed Doc. No. 35-1). Dr. Hopp placed Plaintiff on medical restrictions that included lifting no more than 15 pounds. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 186-89; Pl. Med. Records, Sealed Doc. No. 35-1). Based on the medical restrictions, Plaintiff was given a leave of absence effective November 30, 2018. (Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 3).
Three weeks later, on December 21, 2018, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Hopp and received clearance to return [*7]  to work with permanent medical restrictions of lifting no more than 30 pounds, no frequent lifting more than 20 pounds, no pushing or pulling greater than 100 pounds, and no constant bending. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 195; Pl. Med. Records, Sealed Doc. No. 35-1). Dr. Hopp recommended a "plan" that included "change her job to a less physically demanding occupation." (Pl. Med. Records, Sealed Doc. No. 35-1; Hopp Dep., Doc. No. 33-12 at 39-40). Her medical restrictions have not changed since then.
On January 3, 2019, Plaintiff requested job-related accommodations. (Lorio Decl., Doc. No. 33-14, ¶ 3). On March 11, 2019, Plaintiff met with Human Resources personnel to discuss her accommodation request. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 214-17). Prior to the meeting, Plaintiff filled out the "Accommodation Checklist" form. (Doc. No. 33-16). Plaintiff requested to work exclusively as a scanner in the small sort area without accommodation and indicated that she would need a 30-pound weight restriction if she loaded or unloaded trucks.2 (Id.). Plaintiff also suggested that she could perform the bagging task by limiting her bag weight to less than 30 pounds. (Id.). Plaintiff indicated that she was [*8]  only willing to work at the Franklin Center and only during the evening shift due to her other job. (Id.).
UPS considered the official company-wide job descriptions for Sorter and Bagger, which stated that employees in these positions must have the ability to lift up to 70 pounds. Ultimately, UPS determined that there were no available positions at the Franklin Center for which Plaintiff is qualified and able to perform the essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodations. (Doc. No. 33-19; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 256). Human Resources personnel continued to review available positions that might fit Plaintiff's medical restrictions. In January 2020, Human Resources contacted Plaintiff to inquire if her restrictions were still in place. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 258-61). At that time, Plaintiff stated that she was willing to commute to the UPS facility in Columbia, Tennessee, but the Columbia facility only had available positions for loaders and unloaders. (Id.; Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 5). Plaintiff remains on medical leave of absence. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 114).

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is [*9]  no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party bringing the summary judgment motion has the initial burden of informing the Court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute over material facts. Rodgers v. Banks, 344 F.3d 587, 595 (6th Cir. 2003). The moving party may satisfy this burden by presenting affirmative evidence that negates an element of the non-moving party's claim or by demonstrating an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Id.
In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court views the facts in the light most favorable for the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Bible Believers v. Wayne Cty., Mich., 805 F.3d 228, 242 (6th Cir. 2015); Wexler v. White's Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir. 2003). The Court does not weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, or determine the truth of the matter. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Rather, the Court determines whether sufficient evidence has been presented to make the issue of material fact a proper jury question. Id. The mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party's position is insufficient to survive summary judgment; instead, there must be evidence of which the jury could reasonably find for [*10]  the nonmoving party. Rodgers 344 F.3d at 595.

III. ANALYSIS
Plaintiff asserts claims for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12112, and the Tennessee Disability Act ("TDA"), Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-50-103. (Compl., Doc. No. 1). A claim brought under the TDA is analyzed under the same principles as those utilized for the ADA, although the TDA does not require reasonable accommodation. See Cardenas-Meade v. Pfizer, Inc., 510 F. App'x 367, 370 (6th Cir. 2013); Berry v. Sage Dining Svcs., No. 3:19-cv-00830, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133876, 2021 WL 3037483, at * 14 (M.D. Tenn. Jul. 19, 2021), Lovell v. Champion Car Wash, LLC, 969 F. Supp. 2d 945, 950 (M.D. Tenn. 2013).
Under either statute, Plaintiff must establish that (a) she was disabled, (b) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (c) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Cardenas-Meade, 510 F. App'x at 369. Defendant contends Plaintiff cannot establish either of the first two elements.

A. Disability
To qualify as disabled, an individual must (1) have "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one of more major life activities"; (2) a record of being disabled; or (3) be "regarded" by the employer as being disabled." EEOC v. West Meade Place, LLP, 841 F. App'x 962, 966 (6th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff contends she is disabled under both the first and third prong.3
1. Substantially Limited in a Major Life Activity
The ADA defines "major life activities" to include: "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, [*11]  eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A).
Whether an individual is "substantially limited" in a major life activity is determined by considering: (1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment. Id. Congress has instructed that the "definition of disability ... shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals" and an impairment that "substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities in order to be considered a disability." Booth v. Nissan, 927 F.3d 387, 394 (6th Cir. 2019) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A) and (C)). Whether a plaintiff is "substantially limited" in a major life activity is ordinarily a question of fact. See Norwood v. Magneti Marelli of Tenn., No. 1:19-cv-00020, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27992, 2021 WL 602842, at * 16 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 12, 2021) (citing Quirin v. Abbott Labs, No. 1:08-cv-011, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52804, 2009 WL 1456478 (W.D. Mich. May 22, 2009)).
Plaintiff has identified two major life activities she contends are substantially limited by her medical restrictions: lifting and working.
a. Lifting
Plaintiff contends that her medical restrictions are a substantial limitation on the major life activity [*12]  of lifting. Plaintiff claims that due to her limitations she does not "lift ice, groceries, or [her] grandbabies who are over 30 pounds." (Brumley Aff., Doc. No. 41-2, ¶ 12). In addition, she "modifies exercise activities in line with the restrictions." (Id.). The Court notes that Plaintiff's affidavit was filed in response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and that this appears to be the first time she has claimed to be substantially limited in any area other than working.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot create an issue of fact regarding limitations in her daily life with a "last-minute, self-serving" affidavit. (Def. Reply, Doc. No. 43 at 1 (citing Young v. UPS, 992 F. Supp. 2d 817, 830 (M.D. Tenn. 2014)). Defendant also notes that Plaintiff is contradicted by her physician's statement that none of her medical conditions "limit [her] ability to perform any major life activities other than working." (Medical Certification, Sealed Doc. No. 35-2).
The Court acknowledges Defendant's concern that Plaintiff is attempting to create issues of fact. Were there no other evidence in the record, the Court agrees this might be more troublesome. However, unlike in Young, where the only evidence in plaintiff's favor on a particular issue was [*13]  the plaintiff's own testimony that was contradicted by other witnesses, here there is ample evidence and no factual dispute that Plaintiff was restricted from lifting more than thirty pounds. See Young, 992 F. Supp. 2d at 830. Plaintiff's affidavit testimony does little more than confirm that she complies with the doctor's recommendation in her daily life.
The fact that Plaintiff's physician does not consider the inability to lift more than 30 pounds to impact major life activities other than work is not dispositive of the issue. The ADA includes "lifting" as a major life activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). However, whether the inability to lift more than 30 pounds is "substantially limiting" in the context of Plaintiff's daily life is a question of fact. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate on this issue.
b. Working
Working is also a "major life activity." See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A).
When the "major life activity" alleged to be substantially limited is "working," a plaintiff must show that "her impairment limited her ability to 'perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.'" Booth, 927 F.3d at 394 (citing Tinsley v. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp., 766 F. App'x 337, 342 (6th Cir. 2019)). However, "simply having a work restriction does not automatically render one disabled, [] nor does being unable to perform a discrete task or a specific job. [*14]  Id. (citing McKay v. Toyota Motor Mfg., U.S.A., Inc., 110 F.3d 369, 373 (6th Cir. 1997)). "A plaintiff cannot claim a disability by simply '[d]emonstrating a substantial limitation in performing the unique aspects of a single specific job.'" Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. (2016)).
"A class of jobs may be determined by reference to the nature of the work that an individual is limited in performing (such as commercial truck driving...) or by reference to job-related requirements that an individual is limited in meeting (for example, jobs requiring repetitive bending ...)." Tinsley, 766 F. App'x at 343 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630, Appx.)). The appendix to the regulations provides the example of an employee, like Plaintiff, who has lifting restrictions:
For example, if a person whose job requires heavy lifting develops a disability that prevents him or her from lifting more than fifty pounds and, consequently, from performing not only his or her existing job but also other jobs that would similarly require heavy lifting, that person would be substantially limited in working because he or she is substantially limited in performing the class of jobs that require heavy lifting.
Id.
Defendant contends Plaintiff was not disabled because she was capable of performing a wide range of less strenuous manual labor jobs as demonstrated [*15]  by her working as a waitress and construction truck driver despite her medical restrictions. (Doc. No. 31 at 13 (citing Ex. J, Interrogatory 11; and Pl. Dep. at 22).
The argument is not well taken. While it may be the case that Plaintiff can perform a variety of less strenuous manual labor job, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is prevented from performing any jobs that require heavy lifting. Heaving lifting jobs are a "class of jobs" or "broad category of jobs" under the regulations. Accordingly, the Court finds there is no dispute of fact with regard to whether Plaintiff is substantially limited in performing the class of jobs that require heavy lifting. Therefore, Plaintiff has established that she is disabled because she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working.
2. Regarded As

Failure to Exhaust
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is barred from claiming disability under the third prong — that Defendant "regarded" her as disabled — because she did not raise that claim in the EEOC charge and has, therefore, failed to exhaust administrative remedies as to this claim.
Plaintiff's EEOC charge is succinct. (See Doc. No. 33-20). Plaintiff checked boxes for discrimination based [*16]  on "retaliation" and "disability." (Id.). She does not assert a retaliation claim in this case. In the section to describe the "particulars," Plaintiff stated: "On May 14, 2019, company failed to engage in the ADA interactive process and/or provide me with a reasonable accommodation due to my limitations. I believe I have been discriminated against because of my disability, and retaliated against for requesting reasonable accommodations, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, as amended." (Id.).
In the Sixth Circuit, a claim is properly exhausted when it is within the scope of the EEOC investigation reasonably expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination. Hawkins v. Center for Spinal Surgery, 34 F. Supp. 3d 822, 834 (M.D. Tenn. 2014); see also, Stinson v. Nissan N. Am., No. 3:18-cv-0145, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202195, 2019 WL 6174841 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 20, 2019) (finding the plaintiff's "regarded as" theory reasonably arose from the facts alleged in the EEOC charge).
Though Plaintiff did not provide much detail in her EEOC charge, she is not obligated to detail the legal theories under which she may pursue the discrimination claim. The Court finds that Plaintiff's charge of discrimination based on her "limitations" and "disability" is sufficient to put Defendant on notice as to the nature of her claim, whether it be based on a theory that Plaintiff [*17]  is disabled under prong one, or "regarded as" disabled under prong three.
b. Plaintiff established she was "regarded as" having an impairment
Even if not actually disabled, a plaintiff may seek relief under the ADA if her employer mistakenly believes she is disabled. Under the ADA, an employee:
[m]eets the requirements of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment is perceived to limit a major life activity.
42 U.S.C. § 10102(3)(A).
"A claim under the 'regarded as' prong requires no showing about the severity of the impairment." EEOC v. West Meade Place, LLP, 841 F. App'x at 967 (citing Babb v. Maryville Anesthesiologists P.C., 942 F.3d 309, 319 (6th Cir. 2019). Indeed, a claimant is not required to have an impairment at all to make a claim under the "regarded as" prong. Id. "Accordingly, to state the threshold condition of a 'regarded as' ADA claim, an employee need only show that their employer believed they had a 'physical or mental impairment,' as that term is defined in the federal regulations." Id.
Defendant contends that it did not regard Plaintiff as disabled and was merely complying with the medical restrictions provided by [*18]  her doctor. (Doc. No. 31 at 14 (citing Stinson v. Nissan N. Am., No. 3:18-cv-0145, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202195, 2019 WL 6174841 (M.D. Tenn. Nov. 20, 2019). Defendant believed Plaintiff would be able to resume work if her medical restrictions changed and contacted her as recently as May 2020 to ask if she was able to return to work.
Defendant's contention that an employee cannot be "regarded as" disabled when that employee has medical documentation of his or her limitations is uncompelling. The relevant definition encompasses persons who have an "actual or perceived physical [] impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 10102(3)(A). Plaintiff's "actual physical impairment" that was documented by her physician, and of which there is no dispute Defendant was aware, meets this standard. Accordingly, the Court finds there is no dispute of material fact that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as having a physical impairment.
In summary, the Court finds that there are no disputes of fact regarding whether Plaintiff is disabled under prong one because she is substantially limited in the major life activity of working with regard to the class of jobs that require the ability to lift over 30 pounds. The Court also finds there are no disputes of fact that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as disabled as that prong [*19]  is defined by the statute.

B. Otherwise Qualified for the Position
An employee is qualified for her position if she can perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation. A reasonable accommodation "does not include removing an 'essential function' from the position, for that is per se unreasonable." EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d 753, 761 (6th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up) (citing Brickers v. Cleveland Bd. of Educ., 145 F.3d 846, 850 (6th Cir. 1998). A reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position, but it does not require an employer "to create new jobs," to accommodate individuals by "shifting an essential job function onto others," or to "hire new employees to perform certain functions or duties of a disabled employee's job which the employee cannot perform by virtue of his disability." Meade v. AT&T Corp., 657 F. App'x 391, 396-97 (6th Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted).
"The determination of what responsibilities are essential functions is 'typically a question of fact and thus not suitable for resolution through a motion for judgment as a matter of law.'" Henschel v. Clare Cty Rd. Com'n, 737 F.3d 1017, 1022 (6th Cir. 2013). A job function is essential if its removal would fundamentally alter the position. EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d at 762.
Seven factors are considered to determine whether a job function is essential: (1) the employer's judgment; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent [*20]  on the job performing the function; (4) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (5) the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (6) the work of past incumbents on the job; and (7) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); Wagner v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 647 F. App'x 645, 648 (6th Cir. 2016).
Defendant argues that because Sorters must be able to work in every function, including those that regularly require heavy lifting, the ability to lift up to 70 pounds — certainly more than 30 pounds — is an essential function of the position. This assertion is supported by testimony from the managers at the Franklin Center. (See Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶ 7; White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 39-43; Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 29-30, 62-63 (stating that the ability to lift between 30-70 pounds is an essential function of the Sorter position)). The written job description for Sorter includes the ability to lift up to 70 pounds and assist in moving packages weighing up to 150 pounds as "required." (Sorter Job Description, Doc. No. 33-8 (assessing the physical demand level of the position as "heavy")).
Defendant claims it needs to be able to move Sorters to different functions depending on workload and staffing [*21]  needs, and Sorters, therefore, must be able to perform all of the functions of the Sorter position, some of which, such as loading and unloading, undisputedly require the ability to lift up to 70 pounds. For example, Plaintiff's supervisor, James Jackson, testified that when there was not as much work in Small Sort, he would assign Plaintiff to do other jobs. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 23-24). He explained, "[B]ecause all we have are limited amount of people to work every night ... it is not like saying this group of people are assigned to do Small Sorting, you do Smalls and go home ... People get moved around all night long. ... if we have nothing in Smalls that Melissa could go to Truck 4 and help James unload it..." (Id. at 29; see also, White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 62-65 ("especially when you are only working about 15 employees a night you are not going to be just solely dedicated to scanning packages")). Defendant contends that assigning Plaintiff exclusively to the small sort function would negatively impact the facility's production by requiring the company to shift Plaintiff's remaining job duties — those that require her to fill in for other functions — to other employees. [*22]  (Grissom Decl., Doc. No. 33-3, ¶¶ 5-7; White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 62-66; Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 29-30).
There is no dispute that Plaintiff cannot lift more than 30 pounds. Consequently, she cannot perform every position of the Sorter position. She argues, however, that the ability to lift up to 70 pounds and perform every function of the Sorter position is not an essential function of the position because she spent 90%-95% of her time performing a single task — scanning parcels in Small Sort, a job she claims to be able to perform without accommodation. Plaintiff argues that to determine whether she can perform the essential functions of her job, the Court should look only to the job description for "Small Sort" because that is where she spent 90-95% of her time. (Doc. No. 39 at 10-11). Plaintiff notes that the written job description for the Small Sort position requires that employees are able to lift packages weighing up to 10 pounds. (Small Sort Job Description, Doc. No. 33-7). Plaintiff claims that she has never had to lift more than 30 pounds while working in Small Sort. (Pl. Dep.. Doc. No. 33-5 at 73, 290-91). Plaintiff cites her supervisor's testimony that employees [*23]  in Small Sort never lift 70 pounds. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 28-9 at 21:7-10).
Defendant argues that even if the facility had a dedicated Small Sort position, which it does not, the Small Sort position nevertheless requires the ability to lift more than 30 pounds as an essential function of the position. The job description for small sort states that employees in this position must be able to "lift / lower, push / pull manipulate and carry containers weighing up to 70 pounds and packages weighing up to 10 pounds." (See Small Sort Job Description, Doc. No. 33-7). Defendant explains the lifting ability is essential even in Small Sort where packages should weigh 10 pounds or less because misdirected packages could weigh up to 35 pounds,4 employees must lift bags of small parcels that generally weigh between 30 and 40 pounds and up to 70 pounds, and they must break up packages that get jammed together in the chute, which can require a significant amount of force.
1. Misdirected Packages
Plaintiff claims she did not remove parcels weighing more than 10 pounds from the conveyor belt — if the weight label indicated a package was more than 10 pounds, "we just let it keep going on the belt. We didn't [*24]  stop it. We just let it keep going." (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 71-72). Her supervisor, James Jackson, acknowledged that heavy packages might be misdirected to Small Sort and testified that he instructed scanners to "put [heavy items] back on the belt." (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 14). Plaintiff notes that the job description for Small Sort states only that employees must lift packages weighing up to 10 pounds and says nothing about lifting 35-pound packages. (See Small Sort Job Description, Doc. No. 33-7). Terry White, who works in human resources and visits the Franklin Center only a few times a year, testified that "possibly, occasionally some of our smaller packages may make it [to Small Sort]" that could weigh 30 to 35 pounds and would need to be removed. (White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 69-70).
Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is disputed whether workers in Small Sort are required to remove heavy misdirected packages. Jackson's testimony that employees were instructed to "put it back on the belt" does not clearly contradict Plaintiff's testimony that they left heavy packages on the belt. Even if employees in Small Sort were required to lift [*25]  misdirected packages, there is insufficient evidence regarding the frequency of misdirected packages, how many of them weigh more than 30 pounds, or the consequences of failing to remove misdirected packages. On this record, the Court finds a dispute of fact regarding whether it was an essential job function for employees in Small Sort to lift misdirected packages weighing more than 30 pounds.
2. Bagging
Plaintiff claims the bagging task does not require her to lift more than 30 pounds because employees can decide how much to put in the bags and she has always loaded bags with less than 30 pounds. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 28-8 at 68-69, 73, 86-87). Although there is a certain logic to Defendant's argument that loading more bags with fewer packages decreases efficiency, Defendant does not dispute that it does not have a policy requiring employees to fill the bags to a specific level or weight. (Pl. SoF, Doc. No. 38-1, ¶ 18). Plaintiff claims she never had any complaints about her productivity. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 28-8 at 302). Her supervisor confirmed that there were no complaints about Plaintiff's performance. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 28-9 at 17-20).
Based on this evidence, there is a dispute [*26]  of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff was required to lift more than 30 pounds while performing the bagging task.
3. Breaking Jams
Plaintiff argues that breaking up jammed packages is not specifically listed as a job requirement for Small Sort. There is no dispute, however, that breaking up jammed packages is a task performed in Small Sort. Indeed, Plaintiff's most recent back injury occurred while she was attempting to break a jam of a box weighing approximately 20 pounds. (Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 187-89). Her physician agreed that she risked aggravating her injury if she returned to that position (referring to breaking jams, not the scanning function). (Hopp Dep., Doc. No. 33-12 at 36-37).
However, there is not enough evidence from which to conclude that it is undisputed that breaking package jams is an "essential job function." That the task is not specifically listed in the job descriptions is not dispositive. Nevertheless, the parties cite to scant evidence regarding the frequency with which unjamming must occur, how often Plaintiff might be called to perform this task, and whether jams always or only infrequently require significant force to remedy.
On this record, considering [*27]  the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, there are questions of fact regarding whether the ability to lift more than 30 pounds is an essential job function within the Small Sort area.
4. The Ability to Work in All Functions of the Sorter Position
This finding, however, does not end the inquiry. Defendant's primary contention is that, at the Franklin Center, a Sorter must be able to work in all functions of the position, which consequently requires the ability to lift more than 30 pounds as an essential job function.
As stated above, the factors the Court must consider to determine whether a job function is essential are: (1) the employer's judgment; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (4) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (5) the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (6) the work of past incumbents on the job; and (7) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); Wagner v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 647 F. App'x 645, 648 (6th Cir. 2016).
Here, almost all of the relevant factors indicate that the ability to perform the various Sorter functions, and consequently to be able to lift more than 30 pounds, is an essential function [*28]  of the position. Both the employer's judgment and the written job description indicate that the ability to lift up to 70 pounds is an essential job function. Defendant has also provided evidence that it needs to be able to move employees to different Sorter functions depending on staffing needs, which it states is particularly important at the Franklin Center because it is a small, leanly staffed facility. In addition, there is evidence that current and past incumbents in the Sorter position, including Plaintiff, are called to work in various Sorter functions as needed. On the other hand, it is undisputed that Plaintiff spent approximately 90%-95% of her time working in Small Sort.
While it presents an exceedingly close question, construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds there are questions of fact regarding whether the ability to lift more than 30 pounds is an essential job function.
Defendant argues that allowing Plaintiff a permanent position exclusively in Small Sort is effectively creating a permanent light-duty position which Defendant argues is neither a required nor a reasonable accommodation. Indeed, "[t]he ADA does not require employers [*29]  to accommodate individuals by shifting an essential job function onto others." Hoskins v. Oakland Cty. Sheriff's Dept., 227 F.3d 719, 729 (6th Cir. 2000). But this argument presupposes that the ability to perform all of the functions of the Sorter position is an essential job function. In light of the fact that Plaintiff has been working almost exclusively in Small Sort for years, the Court cannot find that this question is undisputed. At trial, Defendant may present evidence to convince the finder of fact that it is essential that every Sorter be able to perform every function. However, at this stage in the litigation, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could resolve this issue in Plaintiff's favor.
Defendant cites a number of cases in which courts have found similar lifting requirements to be an essential job function. These cases are distinguishable for several reasons, the most important of which is that determination of an essential function requires a case-by-case examination of the specific position. UPS acknowledges that the essential functions listed for each position "may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the UPS facility, including size and location. At some locations, employees may not perform all of the essential job functions [*30]  listed above." (Doc. No. 28-1 and 33-8; see also, White Dep., Doc. No. 28-10 at 24 ("Some [essential job functions] vary from facility to facility because of how our facilities differ.")). Accordingly, it would be improper for this Court to adopt the findings from other cases regarding different UPS facilities.
The Court also notes that in Mason v. UPS, 674 F. App'x 943 (11th Cir. 2017), the Court afforded "substantial weight" to UPS's determination that the lifting requirement was an essential function of various jobs. The Sixth Circuit, however, has declined to defer to the employer's assessment, and affords the employer's assessment only "consideration" as required by the statute. See Rorrer v. City of Stow, 743 F.3d 1025, 1042 (6th Cir. 2014) ("the court should give consideration to the employer's determination, not deference"); Keith v. Cty. of Oakland, 703 F.3d 918, 925-26 (6th Cir. 2013) (courts are not required to give deference to the employer's judgment regarding what the essential functions of a position are when the record suggests a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue).
In Walker v. UPS, No. 1:13-cv-00402, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20427, 2015 WL 735779, at *8 (S.D. Ind. Feb. 20, 2015), the court found the lifting requirement was an essential function after noting that Sorters assigned to Small Sort needed to lift canvas bags full of sorted packages that could weight up to 70 pounds. The evidence in this [*31]  case indicates that employees in Small Sort do not have to lift 70 pounds. (Jackson Dep., Doc. No. 33-4 at 21).
Henderson v. UPS, No. 3:03-cv-2135, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25309, 2007 WL 906151, at * 3 (D. Conn. Mar. 23, 2007) involved a claim brought under a Connecticut statue, not the ADA. The Connecticut statute did not require employees to make accommodations for disabled employees. Id. More importantly, at the time of the litigation, the plaintiff (who was deceased) presented no evidence that the ability to lift up to 70 pounds was not an essential function of the job in Small Sort. Id.
Finally, Miecznikowski v. UPS, No. 96-1847-CIV-T-25-B, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21581, 1998 WL 993625, * 4 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 1998), did not consider whether the requirement to work all functions of the Sorter positions was an essential job requirement.
In summary, there are questions of fact regarding the essential functions of Plaintiff's job. Accordingly, summary judgment on this issue will be denied to both parties.

C. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA
To establish a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the position; (3) UPS knew of her disability; (4) she requested an accommodation; and (5) UPS failed to provide a necessary accommodation. Cady v. Remington Arms Co., 665 F. App'x 413, 417 (6th Cir. 2016). The employee seeking accommodation bears the initial burden of proposing or requesting an accommodation [*32]  for her disability. Judge v. Landscape Forms, Inc. 592 F. App'x 403, 407 (6th Cir. 2014).
The employer then has the duty to engage in "an interactive process to identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Melange v. City of Ctr. Line, 482 F. App'x 81, 84 (6th Cir. 2012). When evaluating a requested accommodation, employers must consider: "(1) the particular job involved, its purpose, and its essential functions; (2) the employee's limitations and how those limitations can be overcome; (3) the effectiveness an accommodation would have in enabling the individual to perform the job; and (4) the preference of the employee." Tchankpa v. Ascena Retail Group, Inc., 951 F.3d 805, 812 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Keever v. City of Middletown, 145 F.3d 809, 812 (6th Cir. 1998). Evidence of a good faith effort to accommodate includes communicating directly with the employee to discuss medical limitations and potential opportunities for accommodation. Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 871 (6th Cir. 2007).
UPS argues that Plaintiff's claim fails because she cannot show the first two elements — that she is disabled and otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the position. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot show that UPS failed to provide a reasonable accommodation because her requested accommodation was not reasonable. Having already discussed the first two elements, the Court turns to the reasonableness [*33]  of Plaintiff's requested accommodation.
1. Reasonable Accommodation
"In failure-to-accommodate claims where the employee requests an 'accommodation that exempts her from an essential function,' 'the essential functions and reasonable accommodation analyses [] run together.' One conclusion (the function is essential) leads to the other (the accommodation is not reasonable)." EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d at 764 (quoting Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr., 675 F.3d 1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2012).
Because the resolution of this issue rests on whether the requested accommodation eliminates an essential function of the job, which, as stated above, presents a question of fact, summary judgment will not be granted to either party on this issue.
2. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
Plaintiff also seeks summary judgment on this claim on grounds that UPS failed to engage in an interactive process because in determining that the essential functions of the job required the ability to lift up to 70 pounds, Defendant relied on the company-wide list of essential job functions and did not undertake an individualized inquiry to find out what her actual job duties were. The Court notes that "failure to engage in the interactive process" is not an independent form of liability. EEOC v. Ford Motor Co., 782 F.3d at 766. Only when an employee presents [*34]  sufficient evidence to reach a jury on the question of whether she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with accommodation, will the Court consider this form of liability. Id. As discussed above, Plaintiff has done so.
Defendant argues that it engaged in good faith in an informal, interactive process with the employee. Human resources employees collected and reviewed Plaintiff's medical record and met with her to discuss her restrictions and proposed accommodations. (Doc. No. 33-14; Pl. Dep., Doc. No. 33-5 at 214-17). UPS reviewed Plaintiff's accommodations request and determined that she was not qualified for any of the available positions. (White Dep., Doc. No. 33-2 at 40-43). Human resources continued to search for available positions for the next year. (Doc. No. 33-19). Defendant notes that Plaintiff was not particularly flexible in her request for accommodations — she only wanted to work in the evening shift at the Franklin Center (Doc. No. 31 at 24; Accommodations Checklist, Doc. No. 33-16). Defendant states that this significantly limited the position to which Plaintiff could potentially be reassigned. When she indicated that she was willing to consider the [*35]  Columbia location, Defendant searched for available positions in that location that could meet her medical restrictions. (Pl. Dep. at 260-61).
In response to Plaintiff's argument that the Human Resources employees failed to conduct a specific inquiry into the requirements of her job working the evening shift at the Franklin Center location, Defendant states that Mr. White reviewed the essential functions of the Sorter position at the Franklin Center, relied on his personal experience supervising UPS operations, and his knowledge of the essential job functions at the Franklin Center facility based on the facility's size and scope of production. (Resp. to Pl. SoF, Doc. No. 38-1, ¶¶ 38-39).
There are disputes of fact regarding whether UPS conducted an independent inquiry into whether Plaintiff could continue to work at the Franklin Center facility with accommodations. UPS claims that Mr. White based the determinations that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of Sorter on his experience in UPS operations and his knowledge of the Franklin Center facility's size and scope of production. However, no one on the ADA committee met with Plaintiff's supervisor to discuss the specific [*36]  requirements of her position and whether the accommodations she proposed were reasonable. (Pl. SoF, Doc. No. 38-1, ¶¶ 40-43).
In summary, because there are disputes of fact regarding whether the proposed accommodation is reasonable and whether Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process, summary judgment will be denied as to both parties.

D. Failure to Accommodate Under the TDA
Failure to accommodate is not a recognized cause of action under the Tennessee Disability Act ("TDA"), Tenn. Code Ann., § 8-50-103. Hilliard v. Dolgencorp, LLC, 2019 Tenn. App. LEXIS 150, 2019 WL 1377263, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2019) ("Under the TDA, there is no obligation on an employer to provide an employee with reasonable accommodation."). Plaintiff does not dispute that her claim for failure to accommodate under the TDA should be dismissed. (See Doc. No. 39 (failing to address the TDA)).
Therefore, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the claim that it violated the TDA.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 26) is DENIED. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 30) is GRANTED as to the claim in Count Four, failure to accommodate under the Tennessee Disability Act, and DENIED as to the remaining claims.
An appropriate Order will enter.
