Opinion


FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION
PAPAK, Judge:
Plaintiff Mark Nelson brings this action pro se, alleging various claims under state and federal law against defendant Unified Grocers, Inc. ("Unified") arising from Unified's termination of Nelson's employment on March 12, 2009. Specifically, Nelson alleges disability discrimination and retaliation under both the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Oregon law, workers' compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy under Oregon law, and interference, retaliatory discharge, and failure to reinstate under both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA). This court has jurisdiction over Nelson's claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367.
Now before the court is Unified's motion (#29) for summary judgment on all  [*2] claims. I have considered the motion, evidentiary record, and all of the pleadings on file. For the reasons set forth below, I recommend that Unified's motion be granted in part and denied in part.

LEGAL STANDARDS
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Summary judgment is not proper if material factual issues exist for trial. See, e.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1171, 116 S. Ct. 1261, 134 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1996). When considering a motion for summary judgment, the district court's role is not to weigh the evidence, but merely to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249; Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997). In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the district courts of the United States must draw all reasonable inferences in  [*3] favor of the nonmoving party, and may neither make credibility determinations nor perform any weighing of the evidence. See, e.g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 554-55, 110 S. Ct. 1331, 108 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1990); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000).
A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Only after the moving party has made such a showing does the burden shift to the opposing party to show that a genuine issue of material fact remains. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).
To establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party must make an adequate showing as to each element of the claim on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23; see also Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989). The non-moving party may not rest on conclusory allegations or mere assertions, but must come forward with significant probative evidence. Taylor, 880 F.2d at 1045; Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 631 (9th Cir. 1988);  [*4] Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 249-50; Sanchez v. Vild, 891 F.2d 240, 242 (9th Cir. 1989). The evidence set forth by the non-moving party must be sufficient, viewing the record as a whole, to allow a rational jury to find for that party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Taylor, 880 F.2d at 1045.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Defendant Unified is a California corporation doing business in Oregon and consisting of a wholesale grocery cooperative with independent retailers in several western states. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶2; Pl.'s Compl., #2, ¶4; Def.'s Am. Answer, #28, ft.) Unified employed plaintiff Nelson from October 23, 1984 through March 12, 2009, (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶4), when it ostensibly terminated him due to absenteeism and failure to comply with medical certification and other requirements associated with medical leave taken due to his own health condition. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶19.)
Prior to his termination, Nelson worked at Unified's warehouse in Milwaukie, Oregon, holding a number of positions including order filler, shipping clerk, forklift driver, and receiving clerk. Id. at ¶3. For approximately one year, up to the date of his termination,  [*5] Nelson worked as a shipping clerk. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 8.) He reported to swing shift supervisors Cathy Manning and Shaun Ledford, both of whom reported to Jerry Tietz, manager of Unified's deli and produce warehouse. Id.; (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶2.)
Christopher Melonas became Unified's Human Resources Manager in May 2008, and held that position through Nelson's termination on March 12, 2009. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶¶2, 17-19.) Melonas, along with Tietz, was heavily involved in monitoring and making decisions regarding Nelson's absences, medical leave, and disciplinary situation, and ultimately in terminating his employment. Id. at ¶¶2-19; (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶2.)

I. Unified's Policies on Absenteeism
Unified's "Warehouse Working Rules," dated February 21, 2008, specify that "[e]mployees must notify their supervisor or designated alternate, prior to their shift if they are going to be absent or late." (Melonas Decl., #33, Ex. D, at 2.) The rules further provide that absent employees must keep their supervisors appraised of their probable dates of return to work unless specific alternate arrangements have been agreed to, and further note that employees absent as a result of illness  [*6] or injury "may be required to produce a physician's report." Id. Unified's "Absenteeism Disciplinary Guidelines" provide for a step-by-step disciplinary process whereby an employee may be terminated following 12 or more absences within a nine month period, following a written warning and suspension. Id., Ex. E. at 1-3. The guidelines additionally provide that "if nine (9) months have elapsed from the last written documentation, the progressive disciplinary process will revert back to a Verbal Warning." Id.
In early 2007, Unified retained Matrix Absence Management, Inc. ("Matrix") to administer employees' leaves of absence. (Melonas Decl., #33, at ¶4.) Employees were apparently notified, via both distributed cards and a brief meeting with human resources personnel and Matrix representatives, that they would need to contact Matrix "in the event of any absence lasting four or more calendar days." Id. at ¶4; (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 14.) Nelson, however, testified that the meeting he attended lasted five minutes, that he left without a clear understanding of the new requirements, and that he did not receive the informational card. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 14-15.) He did testify,  [*7] though with some apparent confusion, that he knew at that time that if he needed to be absent for four or more consecutive days, he was required to contact Matrix and his supervisor. Id.
Nelson also apparently received conflicting instructions from his supervisors, and asserts that "Ms. Manning [and] Mr. Ledford had conflicting call in procedures," where "Ms. Manning demanded a daily call in while Mr. Ledford required a weekly, (Sunday) [sic] call in. (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶4.) Nelson further declares that Ledford "often told [Nelson] to disregard [Manning's] requirements." Id.

II. Unified's Policies on Medical Leave
Unified utilizes a "12-month rolling backward leave year" as a basis for its policy on leaves of absence. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶21, Ex. B, at 1.) Accordingly, whether an employee has worked the requisite hours required by law in order to qualify for protected medical leave is determined by calculating the number of hours worked by the employee during the 12 months immediately preceding commencement of the leave of absence. Id. Ex. B, at 2, Ex. C, at 2. Two different versions of Unified's policy on leaves of absence apply to the period of time at issue here: The first was revised  [*8] on August 1, 2004 and remained in effect through January 16, 2009, when a substantially similar version of the policy took effect. Id. Ex. B, Ex. C. The primary difference between the two versions of Unified's policy on leaves of absence consists of the addition of Matrix as the administrator of leave requests and certification.1 Id. Ex C, at 3.
In addition to detailing the eligibility requirements imposed by law for FMLA and OFLA leave, each policy contains a section titled "Certification Requirements." (Melonas Decl., #33, Ex. B, at 2, Ex. C, at 3-4.) Prior to January 16, 2009, employees were required to notify Unified's Human Resources Department of the commencement date and expected duration of leave sought at least 30 days in advance  [*9] of the leave, or as soon as practical if the need for leave was not foreseeable. Id. Ex. B, at 2. In order to take leave due to a "serious health condition," employees were further required to submit "written medical certification from a health care provider of the serious health condition," including the following:
• The date on which the medical condition or need for treatment commenced.
• The probable duration of the medical condition or need for treatment.
• A statement that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform one or more essential functions of his/her job due to the condition and whether it is necessary for the employee to be absent from work; [sic]
• If applicable, the necessity for any intermittent leave or part-time work requirement.
Id. Although not set forth explicitly in Unified's policy, Melonas declares that certification was required via completion of a "Certification of Healthcare Provider" form (form WH-380), made available by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Id. at ¶6. Such certification was required within 15 days of the employee's request for leave if the leave was not foreseeable, and presumably within the 30-day notification period if the  [*10] leave was foreseeable.2 Id. The policy effective January 16, 2009 also notes that failure to provide Matrix with the certification detailed above upon request "may result in disciplinary action." Id. Ex. C, at 4.
Finally, both versions of the policy provide for an additional form of leave outside the scope of FMLA or OFLA leave. This is referred to as Other Medical Leave of Absence (OMLA). (Melonas Decl., #33, Ex. B, at 3-4, Ex. C, at 6-8). The more recent policy states:
OMLA is a Unified Policy designed to provide an additional leave benefit to regular full-time non-union employees who do not qualify for FMLA or other state-mandated leaves, or employees who have exhausted their federal and state-mandated leave entitlements. Leave is provided for the employee's own medical illness or injury.
Id. Ex C, at 6-7. For an employee whose  [*11] tenure with Unified exceeds one year, up to 12 total months of leave are available inclusive of any other leave taken, such as FMLA leave. Id. The policy notes that "[t]he OMLA approval process is the same as for FMLA for an employee's own medical illness or injury." Id. Ex. C, at 7.

III. Nelson's Gout, Intermittent Medical Leave, and Absences
Nelson was diagnosed with arthritic gout in 2001, a condition about which Unified was aware beginning sometime in 2001 following Nelson's initial "flare-ups" and diagnosis. (Nelson Decl., #43, at 3.) Nelson's gout then progressed over time "to the point that it was out of control" during the months leading up to his termination in March 2009, including "unpredictable" and "debilitating" flare-ups. Id.
Nelson initially received warnings for failure to abide by Unified's policies on absenteeism in 2006 and 2007. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶3.) Nelson declares that all of his absences in 2006 and 2007 were "backed up with written [d]octors['] reports," per Unified's above-mentioned policy potentially requiring physician's reports for absences due to illness or injury. (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶5.) It is unclear whether Unified requested or required physician's  [*12] reports pertaining to Nelson's absences in 2006 and 2007, as Unified's policies on absenteeism simply state that an employee "may" be required to produce physician's reports. (Melonas Decl., #33, Ex. D, at 2.)
In March 2008, Nelson willingly transferred from "deli day lift truck operator" to "deli swing shipping clerk." (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 67). The former position required that Nelson operate a forklift and move around on his feet substantially, causing him difficulty as a result of his gout. Id. at 67-68. Nelson described the shipping clerk position, which he held until his suspension and termination, as "lighter for the first four hours," consisting partly of preparing bills and paperwork. Id. at 68. The remainder of the day required working in the warehouse, driving a forklift, and wrapping and loading product. Id. However, Nelson found even the office work taxing, as it required "getting up and then . . . moving around on [his] feet." Id.
Nelson apparently first took medical leave due to his gout from March 2, 2008 through March 5, 2008,3 and provided Matrix with a Certification of Health Care Provider form from his physician indicating that this absence was necessary  [*13] due to a "serious health condition" as required by the FMLA and OFLA. (Buchanan Decl., #31., Ex. 1, at 99; Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 14.; Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 1.) This form was faxed to Matrix on March 10, 2008. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 17, Ex. 11; Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 1.) According to Unified's "time detail" records, during the 12 months preceding March 2, 2008 Nelson had worked a total of 1666.05 hours, and during the 180 days preceding this same date Nelson had worked an average of approximately 31.75 hours per week. (Melonas Supp. Decl., Ex. A, at 6-14.)
Nelson again took medical leave from March 9 through March 12, 2008, and then from April 16 through April 26. (Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 3; Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 15-16.)  [*14] He subsequently provided Matrix, pursuant to the new company policy instituting Matrix as leave administrator in lieu of the Human Resources Department, with an "Authorization for Kaiser Permanente to Use/Disclose Protected Health Information" and an updated Certification of Health Care Provider form. (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶5, Ex. 2, Ex. 3.) The updated Certification of Health Care Provider form was faxed to Matrix on April 16. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 17, Ex. 12.) The authorization for disclosure of protected health information was designed to allow Nelson's doctor to fax information regarding Nelson's condition and need for medical leave directly to Matrix, Id. ¶5, Ex. 2, though the parties dispute Matrix's actual receipt of this form. (Friar Decl., #42, ¶¶2-5; Nelson Decl., #38, ¶¶6, 11.) Nelson declares that he gave Matrix "full access to his medical records" and that Matrix subsequently lost his paperwork, while Jamie Friar, leave of absence supervisor and operations manager for Matrix since June 1, 2010, declares that "a thorough search" was conducted and "[t]he Exhibit was not found and nothing in Matrix's records indicates that Matrix ever received it." (Nelson Decl.,  [*15] #39, ¶¶5, 6-7 [sic], 12; Friar Decl., #42, ¶¶2-5.)
With regard to the probable duration of Nelson's absence, Nelson's doctor wrote, on the Certification of Health Care Provider form dated March 13, 2008, that Nelson's condition was "ongoing...[t]hese episodes are unpredictable in duration [and] frequency so cannot estimate." (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 99; Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 3.) According to Nelson's doctor, Nelson was incapacitated due to the "current episode" from April 16 through April 26, 2008, though Nelson did not return to work until May 14. Id.; (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 15-16.) While Tietz declares that Nelson failed to provide a Certification of Health Care Provider form pertaining to his absences during the second half of April, Nelson declares that an updated form was faxed to Carol Cross-Tolliver of Matrix. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶4; Nelson Decl., #39, ¶7. Ex. 3.)
Between April 26 and May 14, 2008, Unified's records indicate that Nelson continued on FMLA leave through May 4, was "Sick - Under Doctor Care" from May 4 through May 7, "Sick" on May 11, and then again utilizing FMLA leave on May 12 and 13.4 (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at ¶16.) After working  [*16] on May 14, Nelson was absent throughout the remainder of May. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶5.) Tietz declares that although Nelson "called in on most of his scheduled days in May to say he would not be coming in," on May 7 Nelson "failed to call in and failed to show up for work, in violation of Company policy." Id. Tietz additionally declares that, despite repeated requests, Nelson did not provide a Certification of Health Care Provider form in connection with his absences in May 2008. Id. Nelson, however, testified that he placed doctors' notes pertaining to his absences from late April through mid-May of 2008 in Tietz's office. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 27.) After being asked to do so, Nelson called Matrix on May 27 regarding these absences but did not provide Matrix with his doctors' notes, instead simply bringing his medical information into work. Id. He additionally testified that he called in to Unified on several occasions during May 2008 to appraise his supervisors of his condition and ability to appear for work. Id. at 30-32.
Further, Nelson's requests for leave from May 18 through May 21, 2008 were apparently denied according to Unified's records. The notation simply reads "FMLA - denied." (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 16.). Nelson's request for leave was also apparently denied on June 30, 2008, though the notation reads "FMLA - Refused." Id. at 18. Neither party has identified these dates, and Unified has not addressed the notations in its records nor the distinction between the numerous dates listed as "FMLA - Pending" for Nelson, and these two apparent denials of leave.
During June 2008, Nelson worked a total of six days and was absent for the remainder of the month. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶6.) Both Tietz and Melonas declare that Nelson received repeated requests for a Certification of Health Care Provider form pertaining to these absences but failed to provide one. Id.; (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶8.) On June 11, Nelson spoke with Manning to inform her that his feet hurt and he was going home at lunch. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 33.) He remained absent throughout the rest of the month, and subsequently received at least one message in late June  [*18] from Manning informing him that he needed to call Matrix regarding his absences. Id. at 34. Nelson called Tietz in response, and additionally testified that he spoke with Matrix at some point during this time period and was told that his request for FMLA leave was being denied. Id. at 34-35. During this period Nelson was having some difficulty receiving mail and telephone messages, as his only address was his ex-wife's home and they were apparently not getting along well. Id. at 35.
During July and August of 2008, Nelson worked nearly all workdays as scheduled. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶9.) Nelson then continued working through September 7, 2008, after which he was absent for the remainder of the month. Id. at ¶10. He did receive a letter from Matrix dated July 1, 2008 inquiring about medical certification for his absences; however, Nelson apparently relied on the authorization to disclose protected health information signed and ostensibly faxed to Matrix in April 2008, testifying as follows: "Well, when you sign over the release saying that you go and - and you give them rights to go ahead and go strictly to your doctor, and the doctor strictly to them, you figure that that's how it's being  [*19] taken care of." (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 35-36.) Nelson then remained absent from work through October 20, 2008. (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶¶11-12; Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 20.)

IV. Nelson's Suspensions and Termination
On October 20, 2008, Tietz apparently informed Nelson that "he was on indefinite suspension for attendance," and that he "needed to get all of his paperwork together and make an appointment with our HR Department to sort this out." (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 109.) According to Tietz, Nelson stated that he had all of the paperwork pertaining to April 2008, but due to lack of insurance had been unable to see his doctor until August. Id. Nelson additionally informed Tietz, apparently in reference to the aforementioned authorization to disclose protected health information, that he "watched the [d]octor's office fax his paperwork to Matrix." Id.
Nelson's union representative then filed a grievance on Nelson's behalf, which culminated in a "Settlement and Release" agreement between Unified, Teamsters Union Local #206, and Nelson. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 48-49, 111-12.) This agreement provided, in pertinent part, that Nelson's suspension would be limited  [*20] to October 20 through October 24, 2008, and that "[a]ny future violation of a Company attendance policy or procedure shall lead to the immediate termination of the Employee's employment." Id. at 111. The agreement further provided that Nelson agreed to "forbear from hereafter asserting any claims against the Employer for any alleged harm flowing from his employment with the Employer, to date."5 Id. Nelson testified that he signed this agreement without reading it and did not have his union representative present at the time he signed it, though Tietz declares that he read the agreement aloud "[t]o make sure that Nelson really understood what he was signing." Id. at 74; (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶13.)
Following the execution of this agreement, Nelson returned to work and continued working through December 7. (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 21-22.) Melonas declares that Nelson "stopped coming to work after December 7, 2008," failed to contact him despite repeated instructions to do so, and "failed to provide requested information  [*21] to Matrix to initiate any kind of leave request." (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶¶9-l 1.) Nonetheless, Unified's records again note Nelson's status, from December 7, 2008 through January 5, 2009 and intermittently thereafter, as "FMLA — Pending." (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 22-23.) In response, Nelson declares that he continued to provide doctors' notes—apparently through December—and attempted to contact Melonas by leaving messages in his office. (Nelson Decl., #38, ¶¶9-10.) Nelson further declares that he complied with Unified's absenteeism policy, and gave Matrix full access to his medical records, presumably via the authorization to disclose protected health information executed in April 2008. Id. at ¶¶7, 11.
Tietz acknowledges that "we received some very brief doctor's notes in January 2009 that related to some of [Nelson's] absences in 2008," though he declares that "these notes simply indicated that Mr. Nelson was authorized to be off work on certain dates due to an unspecified medical condition." (Tietz Decl., #32, ¶8.) He declares that the notes "did not provide information about the nature of the condition, its expected duration, or that Mr. Nelson was incapacitated from performing  [*22] his duties as a result of any specific condition." Id. In response, Nelson submits three forms marked "Clinician's Report of Work Ability" indicating that time loss was authorized, due to a medical condition, from September 7 through October 5, 2008, October 12 through October 19, 2008, and December 6, 2008 through January 26, 2009. (Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 5, Ex. 6, Ex. 7.) The first two forms indicate that Nelson was "[r]eleased for regular work duties" on October 5, 2008 and October 20, 2008, respectively. Id Ex. 5, Ex. 6.
Nelson, in declaring that he provided Unified with doctors' notes and medical records in connection with his absences and medical leave requests, submits an "Attending Physician's Supplementary Report" signed by his treating physician on March 31, 2009. (Nelson Decl., #38, Ex. 4.) Nelson's physician indicated on this form that Nelson was unable to work beginning December 6, 2008, with the expected duration of his disability "unknown/should resolve." Id. In addition, on January 23, 2009 it appears that Dr. Karyn L. Ofa, Nelson's primary physician, completed a disability report form indicating that Nelson was unable to work from December 6, 2008 through January 26,  [*23] 2009 due to gout (though the form submitted by Nelson is unsigned). Id., Ex. 6. Although the exhibit has not been made part of the record, Nelson testified that his physician also completed a disability application indicating that Nelson was unable to work from April 13, 2008 through June 19, 2008. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 61.) Neither party has provided evidence indicating whether the latter two forms, specifically, were submitted to Unified or Matrix.
Nelson did not work at all during January 2009, and in fact December 7, 2008 was the final day on which Nelson physically worked for Unified. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶12; Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 62.) Unified's records list Nelson's status during January as a combination of "FMLA - Pending" and "PTO - No Call - No Show." (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 23.) Melonas declares that Nelson failed to appear for work and failed to call in as required on January 26 and February 1 through 4, 2009. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶¶15-l6.) In response, Nelson declares that he did in fact call in as required on each of these dates, and submits telephone records indicating that he placed a call to Unified on January 26, 2009. (Nelson Decl.,  [*24] #38, ¶¶15-16, Ex. 5.)
On February 8, 2009, Nelson was "placed on suspension pending further investigation into his most recent absences and being in violation of Unified's policies and procedures." (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶17; Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 24.) In total, during the 12 months preceding Nelson's suspension on February 8, 2009, Unified's time detail records indicate that Nelson took a total of 66 days of FMLA leave, though again Unified's records list this leave, including those periods indisputably accompanied by medical certification, as "[p]ending" without explanation. (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 13-24.) Unified's records additionally list four days in Nelson's time detail, May 18 through May 21, 2008, as "FMLA - denied." Id. at 16.
Nelson was listed as "Suspended - Pending Investigation" in Unified's records through his termination on March 12, 2009. Id. at 24-25. However, on February 11, 2009, three days following Nelson's final suspension, Nelson's doctor signed an "Accident & Sickness Weekly Income Benefit" form indicating that Nelson was "continuously disabled (unable to work)" from December 6, 2008 through "ongoing (unknown)." (Nelson Decl., #39, Ex.  [*25] 4.) This form was signed by Tietz on February 17, 2009. Id. Unified's records list Nelson's status, from December 7, 2008 through January 5, 2009, as "FMLA - Pending." (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 22-23.) Thereafter, through his suspension on February 8, 2009, Nelson's status was listed as "PTO - No Call - No Show" for a total of eight workdays, "FMLA - Pending" for a total of eight workdays, and "FMLA - Intermittent Self on January 7, 2009. Id. at 23-24. Again, neither party offers any explanation for these distinctions.
On February 17, 2009, the same day Tietz signed the above-mentioned form from Nelson's doctor indicating that Nelson was disabled from December 6, 2008 through "ongoing (unknown)," Unified held a "due process meeting . . . in contemplation of termination of Mr. Nelson's employment." (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶18.) Present at this meeting were Nelson, his union representative, the director of human resources for the Milwaukie warehouse at which Nelson was employed, the plant manager, Tietz, and Melonas. Id. Melonas declares that "Mr. Nelson acknowledged that he had not contacted Matrix for his most recent absences," "admitted that he did not know why he did not contact  [*26] Matrix even after being repeatedly instructed to do so," and "acknowledged as well several instances when he had failed to call in and failed to show up for work during January 2009." Id.
In response, Nelson declares: "I never in 24 years 'no called - no showed' for my job. This information is based on faulty record [sic] of Ms. Manning." (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶18.) He further declares that he "[p]rovided United [sic] Grocers with every and all doctors [sic] reports in order to keep them abreast of my condition." Id. at ¶21. Finally, Nelson declares that much of his paperwork during the period of time at issue was lost or otherwise misplaced by Matrix, and that at least one form was improperly rejected on a minor technicality because his doctor "forgot to put n/a in an area that was completely non-applicable." (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶¶5-7, 21; Nelson Decl., #38, ¶6; Nelson Decl., #43, at 7.)
Unified terminated Nelson's employment on March 12, 2009. (Nelson Decl., #39, ¶4.) Following the due process meeting on February 17, Unified sent Nelson a letter dated March 13, 2009 notifying him that his employment was being terminated. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶19.) Melonas declares that Nelson was ultimately  [*27] terminated "[b]ased on his extremely lengthy pattern of non-responsiveness and non-compliance with Company policy." Id.

V. Nelson's Medical Condition Following His Termination
Following his termination, Nelson testified that his gout continued and worsened through 2010. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 80-81.) He testified that he "probably would have" had to miss "a lot" of work even if he had been employed throughout 2009 and into 2010. Id. Nelson further testified, due to the unpredictable flare-ups associated with gout, that through December 1, 2010 he would have continued to be unable to work at various times based on the unpredictable nature of his condition. Id. at 79-81. Finally, Nelson testified that he was unable to perform even the "office work" to which he was assigned after the transfer to partial light duty in March 2008. Id. at 68. Having experienced significant difficulty performing the light duty aspects of his job, Nelson testified that during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009 there was no job he knew of within Unified that he was physically capable of performing regularly. Id.

VI. Nelson's Prior Workers' Compensation Claims
Nelson filed a workers' compensation  [*28] claim after injuring his left knee on the job on November 16, 2006. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 85.) He was subsequently absent from work beginning on December 3, 2006. Id. His workers' compensation claim in connection with this workplace injury to his left knee was accepted, Id. at 9, and he returned to work on December 8, 2006. Id. at 85. Nelson does not dispute that he was reinstated to his former position at that time. Following the injury of November 2006, Nelson was informed by a doctor that he had a form of gout in his left knee at the time of the injury, and following the accident Nelson began to experience "a lot of flare-ups there." Id. at 10.
Soon after the workplace injury, Unified issued Nelson a Corrective Discipline Form and verbal warning on November 21, 2006 for "absenteeism" due to "absen[ces] on two separate occasions within a 60 calendar day period." Id. at 86. Nelson had apparently been absent on August 29 and 30, 2006, as well as November 16 following his injury. Id. at 11, 86.
Nelson subsequently filed a second workers' compensation claim in 2008 after purportedly sustaining injury to his hip due to prolonged periods spent riding on pallet jacks. This claim,  [*29] however, was denied. Id. at 9. Nelson testified that he and other Unified employees were encouraged to file workers' compensation claims if injured on the job. Id. at 10.

ANALYSIS
Nelson brings claims alleging disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA and Oregon law, workers compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy under Oregon law, and interference, retaliatory discharge, and failure to reinstate under both the FMLA and OFLA. First, I find that Nelson's federal and state disability claims and state workers' compensation claims do not survive summary judgment because he has apparently abandoned them by failing to respond to Unified's arguments, and thereby failing to identify specific facts in support of his allegations as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Additionally, notwithstanding Nelson's failure to respond to Unified's arguments and to identify specific facts in support of his allegations, I find that nothing in the record would permit a rational jury to find for Nelson on these claims.
Nelson has, on the other hand, responded to Unified's dispositive motion and complied with Rule 56(c) with respect to his  [*30] FMLA and OFLA claims. I find that genuine issues of material fact remain for trial on Nelson's claim for interference with and denial of substantive rights provided by the FMLA and OFLA, and on Nelson's claim for retaliatory discharge based on his exercise of or efforts to exercise rights provided by the FMLA and OFLA. However, I find that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to Nelson's claim that Unified failed to reinstate him following his medical leave.

I. Nelson's State and Federal Disability Discrimination/Retaliation and State Workers' Compensation Discrimination and Failure to Reinstate/Reemploy Claims
Unified argues that, because he did not address them at all in his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, Nelson has waived his claims for disability discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and Oregon law, and for workers' compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy under Oregon law (claims one through five in Nelson's Complaint, #2). Many courts have noted that it is "not the District Court's responsibility to sift through the record to see if, perhaps, there [is] an issue of fact." Satcher v. Univ. of Ark at Pine Bluff Bd. of Trs., 558 F.3d 731, 735 (8th Cir. 2009)  [*31] (holding that "[i]t was [the non-movant]'s responsibility to show that there were genuine issues of material fact in the record that precluded the summary judgment [movant] sought," and further holding that "failure to oppose a basis for summary judgment constitutes waiver of that argument."). A party opposing summary judgment must either "cit[e] to particular parts of materials in the record," or show that the materials cited by the adverse party do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute, in order to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
Here, Nelson has neither offered any argument, nor directed the court to any evidence whatsoever, pertaining to his claims for disability discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and Oregon law, and his claims for workers' compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy under Oregon law. Beyond the bare allegations in Nelson's complaint (#2), he has failed to "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial" as to these claims. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 256; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).
Although it appears that Nelson has abandoned the  [*32] above-mentioned claims and has failed to comply with the specificity requirement set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), I nevertheless briefly analyze each claim in turn based on the available evidence of record. For the reasons set forth below, I find that the record does not support these claims, and therefore recommend that Unified's dispositive motion be granted as to counts one through five set forth in Nelson's complaint.

A. Disability Discrimination
Nelson alleges disability discrimination under both the ADA and applicable Oregon law. He specifically alleges that Unified failed to reasonably accommodate his disability, that Unified failed to engage in the interactive process to identify a potential reasonable accommodation, and/or that Unified "terminated [him] in substantial part because of his disability, perceived disability, and/or record of disability, and/or because he required and/or requested accommodation." (Pl's Compl., #2, ¶9.) I will first analyze the former claims, and will separately analyze the final claim alleging retaliation.
O.R.S. 659A.139 provides as follows: "ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 shall be construed to the extent possible in a manner that is  [*33] consistent with any similar provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended." O.R.S. 659A.139 (amended 2010)6; see also Stamper v. Salem-Keizer Sch. Dist., 195 Or. App. 291, 296, 97 P.3d 680 (2004). Accordingly, I will evaluate Nelson's federal and state law disability discrimination claims together.
First, both the ADA and the Oregon disability discrimination statutes require that a disabled7 employee be otherwise "qualified" in order to invoke the protections provided by these laws. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Sanders v. Arneson Prods., 91 F.3d 1351, 1353 (9th Cir. 1996) ("To state a prima facie case under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove that he is a qualified individual with a disability who suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability." (emphasis added)); O.R.S. 659A.115 (amended 2010). Under both applicable statutes, an individual is "qualified" if he or she, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position the individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8);  [*34] see O.R.S. 659A.115 (amended 2010) ("For the purposes of O.R.S. 659A.112, a person with a disability is otherwise qualified for a position if the person, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position."). Accordingly, I must determine whether (1) Nelson could perform the "essential functions" of his job, and (2) if not, whether any reasonable accommodation existed that would have enabled Nelson to perform those essential functions. With regard to the second question, plaintiff Nelson bears the burden of showing that he could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation. See Lucero v. Hart, 915 F.2d 1367, 1371 (9th Cir. 1990). Nelson also bears the burden of identifying one or more reasonable accommodations that could have been made in order to allow him to perform those essential functions. See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 994 (9th Cir. 2007); McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009).
Courts construing the ADA have repeatedly held that the ability to maintain a regular work schedule and predictable attendance is an "essential function" of nearly all jobs. See, e.g., Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cal, 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that "an employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA"); Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 529, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 217 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that regular attendance is an "essential function"); Waggoner v. Olin Corp., 169 F.3d 481, 484 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting that "in most instances, the ADA does not protect persons who have erratic, unexplained absences, even when those absences are the result of a disability"); Cf. Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that "regular and predictable attendance" was an essential function of the plaintiff's medical transcriptionist position).
Based on Nelson's attendance record  [*36] detailed above, I find that he was unable to perform an "essential function" of his job, namely maintaining regular attendance.8 Accordingly, the existence of a material issue of fact as to whether Nelson was a "qualified," disabled employee entitled to the ADA and Oregon disability discrimination statutes' protection turns on the potential existence of one or more reasonable accommodations that would have allowed him to maintain regular attendance. I therefore turn to the second step in the "qualified" analysis.
In opposition to Unified's motion for summary judgment, as noted above, Nelson does not address his claims for disability discrimination. He makes no effort to contest Unified's  [*37] assertion that he was not a "qualified" employee entitled to the ADA and Oregon disability discrimination statutes' protection,9 and identifies no reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to maintain regular attendance. If anything, he offers only the vague implication that due to the unpredictability of his gout flare-ups he simply would have required the freedom to miss work as needed.10
Conversely, Unified points to Nelson's testimony that, after the transfer to partial light duty in March 2008, he was unable to regularly perform even the "office work" associated with this position. (Buchanan Decl., #31, Ex. 1, at 68.) Nelson additionally testified that, during the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, there was no job within Unified that he was physically capable of performing regularly. Id. Finally, though the relevant inquiry focuses on the time period during which a plaintiff was terminated, Nelson went on to testify that his gout continued and worsened through 2010 and he likely would have had to miss "a lot" of work even if he had been employed throughout 2009 and into 2010. Id. at 80-81. Based on the evidence of record, no material issue of fact appears to exist regarding  [*39] whether any reasonable accommodation could have allowed Nelson to maintain regular attendance.
Accordingly, Nelson has failed to carry his burden and raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was able to perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. Because Nelson was not "qualified" within the meaning of the ADA and O.R.S. 659A.115, the protections afforded by these statutes are inapplicable to him. Summary judgment should therefore be granted in favor of Unified with regard to Nelson's claims for disability discrimination under both the ADA and Oregon law.

B. Retaliation in Violation of the ADA and O.R.S. 659A.109
The ADA, notwithstanding whether an employee is "qualified," prohibits an employer from taking any adverse employment action against an employee who has engaged in an activity that the ADA protects. 42 U.S.C. § 12203; see Pardi v. Kaiser Permanente Hosp., Inc., 389 F.3d 840, 849 (9th Cir. 2004). Protected activity may include a request for accommodation if the employee reasonably believed in good faith that he or she was disabled and entitled to the accommodation. See Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004).  [*40] I therefore address Nelson's retaliation claim despite my finding that Nelson was not a "qualified" employee as required by the ADA for the preceding claims.
In order to prove retaliation, a plaintiff must show '"(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two."' Id. (quoting Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir. 2003)). If the plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, "the employer has the burden to 'present legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action.'" Id. (quoting Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir. 2000)). If the employer satisfies this burden, the plaintiff must then "demonstrate[] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reason advanced by the employer was a pretext" in order to proceed beyond the summary judgment stage. Id.
O.R.S. 659A.109 similarly prohibits employer retaliation against employees who invoke or utilize any rights under the Oregon statutes prohibiting disability discrimination. O.R.S. 659A.109 (amended 2010). To prevail on a claim for retaliation under Section 109, a plaintiff must establish (1) that he or she invoked one or more rights provided  [*41] by former O.R.S. 659A.100 to 659A.145, and (2) that he or she suffered an adverse employment action motivated in substantial part by the plaintiff's invocation of such rights. Id.; see, e.g., Herbert v. Altimeter, Inc., 230 Or. App. 715, 725-30, 218 P.3d 542 (2009). An employee who requests accommodation and is subsequently discharged for having done so need not meet the criteria required by Section 112 (here, the "qualified" requirement) to state a claim for violation of Section 109. Cf. Herbert, 230 Or. App. at 728-29.
Here the record indicates that Nelson was terminated due to a large number of purportedly unexcused absences from work. There is no evidence in the record that Nelson ever exercised any right to reasonable accommodation, or sought any accommodation other than intermittent medical leave.11 Nelson's efforts to avail himself of medical leave are protected under the FMLA and OFLA, the latter codified at O.R.S. 659A.150 to 659A.186, and are therefore outside the scope of the ADA and of Section 109, which covers only rights codified at former O.R.S. 659A.100 to 659A.145. Unified's motion for summary judgment should therefore be granted as to Nelson's claim for disability discrimination  [*42] to the extent premised on alleged retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12203 and O.R.S. 659A.109.

B. Workers' Compensation Discrimination, Failure to Reinstate, and Failure to Reemploy
Nelson's complaint alleges that his termination was motivated, at least in part, by his invocation of the workers' compensation system. To establish a prima facie case for workers' compensation discrimination under ORS 659A.040, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he or she invoked the workers' compensation system; (2) he or she was discriminated against in the tenure, terms, or conditions of employment; and (3) that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff with regard to the tenure, terms, or conditions of employment because he or she invoked the workers' compensation system. Kirkwood v. W. Hyway Oil Co., 204 Or. App. 287, 293, 129 P.3d 726 (2006), citing Hardie v. Legacy Health Sys., 167 Or. App. 425, 433, 6 P.3d 531 (2000). In order to establish the causal link of the prima facie case, the employee must show that his  [*43] or her workers' compensation claim was a "substantial factor," or "a factor that made a difference," in the employer's decision to terminate him or her. Lewis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99450, 2009 WL 3462056, *9 (D. Or. Oct. 21, 2009). Proof needed to defeat summary judgment at the prima facie level is "minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Id.; see Duke v. F.M.K. Constr. Servs., Inc., 739 F. Supp. 2d 1296, 1301-02 (D. Or. 2010).
Here, the record is entirely devoid of evidence that Nelson's termination was motivated even in part by his invocation of the workers' compensation system. The only facts in the record concerning Nelson's invocation of the workers' compensation system simply demonstrate that he did in fact successfully apply for workers' compensation in 2006 due to an injury to his left knee, and then unsuccessfully applied again in 2008 due to perceived injury to his hip. Nelson also vaguely referenced, in deposition testimony proffered by Unified, one to two earlier workers' compensation claims occurring at some point during his 24-year tenure. Despite the minimal proof of causation required to survive summary judgment, Nelson has  [*44] offered no evidence whatsoever and the record as a whole likewise contains no evidence raising even the slightest inference that Nelson's workers' compensation claims played a role in his termination.
As for Nelson's related claim for failure to reinstate, Oregon's provision on reinstatement of injured workers provides, in pertinent part:
A worker who has sustained a compensable injury shall be reinstated by the worker's employer to the worker's former position of employment upon demand for such reinstatement, if the position exists and is available and the worker is not disabled from performing the duties of such position. A worker's former position is available even if that position has been filled by a replacement while the injured worker was absent. If the former position is not available, the worker shall be reinstated in any other existing position that is vacant and suitable.
O.R.S. 659A.043(1). An employer's violation of this provision constitutes an unlawful employment practice. O.R.S. 659A.043(5).
Again, the record simply lacks any evidence indicating that Unified failed to reinstate Nelson after he sustained a compensable injury to his left knee in December 2006. Given the lack  [*45] of argument and evidence pertaining to this claim, it appears that these allegations in Nelson's complaint are intended to relate to his termination in March 2009 and Unified's failure to "reinstate" him thereafter. However, O.R.S. 659A.043 pertains solely to reinstatement following a compensable injury, and the record indicates that Nelson was in fact reinstated to his former position some three weeks following the compensable left knee injury he sustained on November 16, 2006.
Finally, Nelson's complaint alleges failure to reemploy in violation of O.R.S. 659A.046, which provides, in pertinent part:
A worker who has sustained a compensable injury and is disabled from performing the duties of the worker's former regular employment shall, upon demand, be reemployed by the worker's employer at employment which is available and suitable.
O.R.S. 659A.046(1). Again, the record clearly reflects that Nelson was reinstated to his former position following his compensable left knee injury in 2006. It is undisputed that Nelson's gout, the medical issue underlying his disability discrimination and FMLA/OFLA claims, was neither a work-related injury nor the subject of any form of workers' compensation  [*46] claim or action.
For the reasons set forth above, in addition to Nelson's failure to contest summary judgment and comply with Rule 56(c) on these claims, I recommend that Unified's motion for summary judgment be granted as to Nelson's claims for workers' compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy under Oregon law.

II. Nelson's FMLA and OFLA Claims
Enacted to balance the needs of employees and families with those of employers, the FMLA and OFLA12 both provide a right for eligible employees of covered employers13 to protected leave(s) of absence from work for specified medical reasons, including an employee's own serious health condition. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601(b), 2612(a)(1)(D); O.R.S. 659A.159(1)(c). Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of protected leave during any 12-month period. 29 U.S.C. § 2612; O.R.S. 659A.162. Leave taken for an employee's own serious health condition may be intermittent where medically necessary. See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(b); 29 C.F.R. § 825.20214; O.R.S. 659A.162(7).
Unlike the claims discussed above, with respect to his FMLA and OFLA claims Nelson has responded to Unified's arguments and has directed this court to specific facts in support of his position. In his complaint, Nelson alleges that Unified "interfered with, restrained and/or denied [p]laintiff's FMLA rights, refused to restore him to his original position or an equivalent position upon return from leave, and/or discharged [p]laintiff because he required, requested and/or took family medical leave." (Pl.'s Compl., #2, ¶29.)
For the reasons set forth below, after determining that Nelson was an eligible employee under both the FMLA and OFLA during much of the period of time material to his claims under these statutes,  [*48] I find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Unified interfered with Nelson's efforts to avail himself of protected leave, and as to whether such leave constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision to terminate him. I find no such issue of fact on Nelson's claim for failure to reinstate.

A. Nelson's Causes of Action Under the FMLA
As a preliminary matter, I first clarify Nelson's causes of action under the FMLA and OFLA. Nelson's complaint alleges "Family Medical Leave Discrimination/Retaliation" under the FMLA (plaintiff's sixth cause of action); however, in the Ninth Circuit such claims alleging adverse employment action in retaliation for use of, or efforts to use, FMLA-protected rights, are properly construed as "interference" claims under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1) as opposed to "retaliation" claims under Section 2615(a)(2). Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F.3d 1112, 1122-25 (9th Cir. 2001) ("By their plain meaning, the anti-retaliation or antidiscrimination provisions do not cover visiting negative consequences on an employee simply because he has used FMLA leave. Such action is, instead, covered under § 2615(a)(1), the provision governing 'Interference  [*49] [with the] Exercise of rights.'"); see also Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1133 n.7 (9th Cir. 2003); Mortensen v. Pacificorp, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7613, 2007 WL 405873, *15-16 (D. Or. Feb. 1, 2007).
In contrast, Section 2615(a)(2) is applied in the Ninth Circuit to claims alleging discrimination or retaliation against an employee for opposing practices made unlawful by the FMLA or for "instituting or participating in FMLA proceedings." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2); Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1125 n.11. Accordingly, based on Nelson's allegations, submissions, and the record as a whole, I construe his claim for retaliatory discharge motivated by his use of or efforts to use FMLA-protected leave as a claim for "interference" under Section 2615(a)(1). In doing so, I note that Nelson is proceeding pro se, and it is well established that courts hold pro se pleadings to a less stringent standard than those drafted by lawyers. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has stated under similar circumstances that "[t]his error of pleading is of little import . . . because we have previously applied the FMLA interference section where a plaintiff has mistakenly alleged retaliation." Rexwinkel v. Parsons, 162 Fed. Appx. 698, 700 (9th Cir. 2006),  [*50] citing Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1134 n.8.
Section 2615(a)(1) provides that it is an unlawful practice for any covered employer to "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). In addition to the right to be free from retaliatory adverse employment actions discussed above, this provision encompasses two substantive employee rights created by the FMLA: "first, the employee has a right to use a certain amount of leave for protected reasons, and second, the employee has a right to return to his or her job or an equivalent job after using protected leave." Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1122, citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a), 2614(a).
Consequently, all three of Nelson's claims under the FMLA fall within the purview of Section 2615(a)(1) and are thus technically claims for "interference." Because the nomenclature associated with the three pleaded claims is inherently duplicative while the applicable law and analysis differ substantially for each claim, I will distinguish Nelson's causes of action under the FMLA as follows: First, Nelson's claim that Unified "interfered with, restrained and/or denied Plaintiff's  [*51] FMLA rights" will be referred to as a claim for "interference." Second, Nelson's claim that Unified "discharged Plaintiff because he required, requested and/or took family medical leave" will be referred to as a claim for "retaliatory discharge," though as set forth above it constitutes a claim for interference within the Ninth Circuit. Finally, though it again constitutes a claim for interference under Section 2615(a)(1), Nelson's claim that Unified "refused to restore him to his original position or to an equivalent position upon return from leave" will be referred to as a claim for "failure to reinstate."
The language associated with Nelson's OFLA claims is more straightforward. Although, as discussed below, pursuant to O.R.S. 659A.186 the law parallels that governing application of the FMLA, the OFLA contains a separate provision more easily characterized as pertaining to "retaliation." See O.R.S. 659A.186(2) ("It is an unlawful practice for an employer to . . . [r]etaliate or in any way discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any other term or condition of employment because the individual has inquired about the provisions of ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186,  [*52] submitted a request for family leave or invoked any provision of ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186."). I will therefore use the same aforementioned nomenclature when differentiating between Nelson's three claims under both the FMLA and OFLA.

B. FMLA and OFLA Eligibility
Unified argues that each of Nelson's claims under the FMLA and OFLA fails because Nelson was not eligible for protected leave under either statutory scheme. Accordingly, before analyzing each claim, I must first determine whether Nelson was eligible for protected FMLA and/or OFLA leave during the various periods of time at issue in this action. Based on the evidence of record, I agree with Unified's argument that at the time of his suspension on February 8, 2009 Nelson was ineligible for protected leave under either statute, and in any case had taken leave in excess of his 12-week entitlement by that point. However, the record and applicable law indicate that Nelson was an eligible employee when he first availed himself of intermittent leave due to his gout on March 2, 2008, and that he remained eligible for, and entitled to, intermittent leave through January 12, 2009 when he exhausted his 12-week entitlement.15
Employees are eligible for protected leave under the FMLA if they have been employed by the covered employer for at least 12 months, and have worked at least 1,250 total hours during the previous 12 months. 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2)(A). Employees are eligible for protected leave under the OFLA if they have been employed by the covered employer for at least 180 days prior to the date leave would or does commence, and where leave is taken for the employee's own serious health condition if they have worked an average of at least 25 hours per week during this 180-day period. O.R.S. 659A.156. Whether an employee has worked the minimum hours required for eligibility is "determined according to the principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for determining compensable hours of work." 29 C.F.R. § 825.110(c)(1). An employee's eligibility also depends on the amount of leave taken during the "leave year," meaning that an employee becomes ineligible, or unprotected, once he or she has taken 60 days of leave within  [*54] the applicable leave year. 29 U.S.C. § 2612; O.R.S. 659A.162; see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.200.
As noted above, Unified uses a "12 month rolling backward leave year" for purposes of calculating an employee's eligibility for leave under the FMLA. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.200(b)(4), 825.200(c). Pursuant to this policy, whether an employee has worked the requisite hours to qualify for protected medical leave is determined by calculating the number of hours worked by the employee during the 12 months "immediately preceding commencement of the leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.110(a)(2); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.110(d) (noting that the eligibility determination "must be made as of the date the FMLA leave is to start."). Similarly, for purposes of the OFLA eligibility is calculated based on the employee's average hours worked during the 180-day period immediately preceding the commencement of leave. O.R.S. 659A.156(1)(b); O.A.R. 839-009-0210(6)(b).
Unified argues that Nelson's FMLA and OFLA claims fail because Nelson was neither an eligible employee at the time of his final suspension, nor at the time of his termination. At the time of his final suspension on February 8, 2009, Nelson had taken a total of 66  [*55] days of FMLA leave within the previous year, and therefore had exhausted his 12-week leave entitlement at that point. At the time of his termination on March 12, 2009, Nelson was indeed ineligible for FMLA and OFLA leave based on his hours worked during the previous year. During the 12 months immediately preceding March 12, 2009, according to Unified's records Nelson had worked a total of 779.95 hours.16 Nelson disputes his leave eligibility, declaring that his W-2 forms and hourly pay stubs indicate that he worked 1337 hours "in the proceeding [sic] 12 months." First, Nelson fails to identify the time frame associated with the "pr[e]ceding 12 months" to which he refers. More importantly, he does not produce the records to which he refers, and this assertion directly contradicts his deposition testimony and the remainder of evidence in the record regarding his ongoing medical condition and resultant absences from work.17 Based on the record as a whole, I find no issue of fact as to whether Nelson was an eligible employee on either February 8, 2009 or March 12, 2009.
However, Unified appears to erroneously assume that each of Nelson's claims under the FMLA and OFLA is predicated on this particular determination. Nelson's claims for interference and retaliatory discharge are not limited to the time of his termination. Rather, these claims encompass the entire period during which Nelson endeavored to take advantage of medical leave protected by the FMLA and OFLA, For purposes of Nelson's interference claim, the proper inquiry is simply whether Nelson was eligible for the rights allegedly denied to him or interfered with at the time of such denial or interference. See Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1135 ("A violation of the FMLA simply requires that the employer deny the employee's entitlement to FMLA leave."); Cf. Funkhouser v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 289 F.3d 1137, 1140 (9th Cir. 2002) ("An  [*58] employer complies with the FMLA so long as it meets or exceeds the statute's minimum requirements."). Nelson's retaliatory discharge claim, as discussed below, turns on an entirely different inquiry. Unified's arguments regarding Nelson's ineligibility in early 2009 apply primarily to Nelson's claim for failure to reinstate, though even that claim turns in part on issues outside the scope of FMLA or OFLA eligibility, namely Nelson's ability to return to work during the first half of 2009.
Because all of Nelson's intermittent leave18 subsequent to March 2, 2008 was taken due to his gout—a single serious health condition—his eligibility based on hour's worked during the preceding year or 180 days is computed only once as of the date his period of intermittent leave began. See, e.g., Roberts v. Ground Handling, Inc., 499 F. Supp. 2d 340, 352-54 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("[T]he 1,250-hour eligibility test is applied only once, on the commencement of a series of intermittent absences, if all involve the same FMLA-qualifying serious health condition during the same 12-month FMLA leave year." (emphasis omitted)), citing DOL Opinion Letter, 2000 DOL FMLA LEXIS 5, 2000 WL 33157366 (Sept. 11, 2000); Davis v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 543 F.3d 345, 350-51 (6th Cir. 2008);  [*59] Barron v. Runyon, 11 F. Supp. 2d 676, 680-81 (E.D. Va. 1998) (holding that where leave is intermittent, a "plaintiff must establish his eligibility only on the occasion of the first absence, and not on the occasion of every absence thereafter"); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(a) (amended 2009). Consequently, the pertinent question with regard to eligibility relates to the number of hours Nelson worked before he first began taking intermittent medical leave due to his gout on March 2, 2008.
According to Unified's own time detail records for Nelson, at the time intermittent leave expressly related to Nelson's gout first commenced on March 2, 2008, Nelson had been employed by Unified during the preceding 12 months and had worked a total of 1666.05 hours during that period. During the 180 days immediately preceding March 2, 2008, Nelson had been continuously employed by Unified and had worked an average of approximately 31.75 hours per week. Nelson was therefore eligible for protected, intermittent leave for his own serious health condition under both FMLA and OFLA beginning  [*60] on March 2, 2008. See 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2)(A); O.R.S. 659A.156.
Next, I turn to Nelson's entitlement to leave during the period in question. Where a "rolling" leave year is utilized, an employee's remaining leave entitlement is determined by calculating the amount of leave an employee has taken "measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.200(b)(4) (amended 2009). The DOL's current regulations further explain this calculation as follows:
[E]mployers using the rolling 12-month period may need to calculate whether the employee is entitled to take FMLA leave each time that leave is requested, and employees taking FMLA leave on such a basis may fall in and out of FMLA protection based on their FMLA usage in the prior 12 months.
29 C.F.R. § 825.200(c). This ongoing calculation is particularly important where, as here, intermittent leave is taken over an extended period of time.
As of March 2, 2008, Nelson had already used nine days of FMLA leave for an unspecified reason in September and November of 2007, and was thus eligible for only 51 days of leave. However, because Unified uses a rolling leave year, Nelson later became eligible for an additional five  [*61] days of leave as of September 20, 2008 and then an additional four days of leave as of November 8, 2008. Nelson therefore exhausted his 12-week entitlement on January 12, 2009, having used 60 days of intermittent medical leave related to his gout within the immediately preceding 12 months pursuant to Unified's rolling leave year policy. He would not become eligible for additional leave until March 2, 2009, at which time he was suspended from work and would soon be terminated.

C. Interference
Nelson alleges that Unified "interfered with, restrained and/or denied Plaintiff's FMLA [and OFLA] rights." (Pl's Compl., #2, ¶¶29, 31.) Specifically, Unified denied Nelson's request for protected medical leave from May 18, 2008 through May 21, 2008, and then apparently on June 30, 2008, though the record reflects that at that time he was both an eligible employee and entitled to additional leave on those dates. Unified contends that Nelson failed to comply with its customary medical certification requirements as well as those imposed by the FMLA and OFLA. I find that a material issue of fact exists as to whether Nelson complied with the applicable certification requirements pertaining to his requests  [*62] for leave from May 18 through May 21, 2008, and on that basis alone recommend that Nelson survive summary judgment on his claim for interference with substantive rights provided by the FMLA and OFLA.
The FMLA provision pertaining to interference provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. §2615(a)(1). Interference encompasses a broad range of conduct, including "denying leave, [or] discouraging an employee from using leave." Hoang v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A., 724 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1106 (D. Or. 2010), citing Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1133. In other words, to establish a prima facie case of interference under the FMLA an employee must simply demonstrate that the employer acted in accordance with the claim's title—that the employer "interfered" with the employee's efforts to avail him or herself of rights to which he or she was entitled under the FMLA. The employer's intent is irrelevant when analyzing claims for interference with, or denial of, such rights. See, e.g., Sanders v. City of Newport, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998, *5-6 (9th Cir. 2011); Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1135.  [*63] The same analysis applies to the OFLA, which provides that it is unlawful for a covered employer to "[d]eny family leave to which an eligible employee is entitled under ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186." O.R.S. 659A.183.
Having established that Nelson was an eligible employee through January 12, 2009, I turn to Unified's argument that Nelson failed to comply with the certification requirements necessary to ensure that his leave was protected. First, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Nelson, I construe his leave from March 2, 2008 forward as "intermittent" medical leave.
Intermittent medical leave is "leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason." 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(a) (amended 2009); see also Barron, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 681 (holding that "a single set of many separate, yet related, absences" constitutes intermittent leave within the meaning of the statutory scheme). The completed Certification of Health Care Provider form pertaining to Nelson's initial gout-related leave beginning March 2, 2008 lists the probable duration of his condition, as well as the probable duration of his incapacity, as "ongoing." (Nelson Decl., #39, Ex. 1.) Nelson's healthcare provider  [*64] further explained that "[t]hese episodes are unpredictable in duration and frequency so cannot estimate," and stated that Nelson's "regimen of continuing treatment" would include "time loss." Id. Perhaps most importantly, Nelson's healthcare provider certified that Nelson's gout qualified as a serious health condition under the FMLA on two grounds: First, Nelson's condition required "Absence Plus Treatment." Second, Nelson's condition qualified as a "Chronic Condition[] Requiring Treatments," which is defined in part as a condition that "[m]ay cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity." Id.
Nelson's use of intermittent medical leave—specifically recognized as a distinct form of leave by the FMLA, its accompanying regulations,19 and by the courts—is particularly significant in that each absence for which he sought leave due to his gout must be treated as part of a single period of leave. See 29 U.S.C. § 2612(b); O.R.S. 659A.162(7); 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.117, 825.203 (amended 2009); Roberts, 499 F. Supp. 2d at 353-355. As the Sixth Circuit stated,
When an employee has a chronic health condition for which intermittent FMLA leave has been approved, the leave commences upon  [*65] the occurrence of the first absence caused by that condition, and it extends to cover every other absence caused by that condition during the same twelve-month FMLA period. In other words, each absence subsequent to the first absence is not treated as a separate period of FMLA leave with its own commencement date. To hold otherwise would render the term "intermittent leave" meaningless and would effectively read it out of the FMLA since a period of intermittent leave "must, by definition, comprise periods . . . in which the employee is present at work." "Thus, a series of absences, separated by days during which the employee is at work, but all of which are taken for the same medical reason, subject to the same notice, and taken during the same twelve-month period, comprises one period of intermittent leave."
Davis, 543 F.3d at 350-51 (citations omitted). Consequently, Unified's almost singular focus on Nelson's failure to provide ongoing documentation of his reasons for taking leave is misplaced, and as set forth below a material issue of fact exists as to whether Unified interfered with Nelson's rights under the FMLA and OFLA by denying his requests for leave from May 18 through May  [*66] 21, 2008. Furthermore, because interference under the FMLA also includes any practice that discourages an employee from exercising rights to which he or she is entitled, Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1133, a material issue of fact exists as to whether Unified "engaged in conduct that tended to chill the exercise of [Nelson's] FMLA [and OFLA] rights." Picouto v. W. Star Truck Plant Portland LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95355, 2010 WL 3607956 (D. Or. May 27, 2010).
In making this determination, I turn to the FMLA's notice and certification requirements. First, as a preliminary matter, the FMLA provides that where the need for leave is not foreseeable, as is at least arguably the case here given Nelson's doctor's comments and the "flare ups" associated with his condition, "an employee must provide notice to the employer as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case." 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a) (amended 2009). Here, at minimum a material issue of fact exists as to whether Nelson complied with  [*67] this requirement. The initial Certification of Health Care Provider form pertaining to the beginning of his intermittent leave on March 2, 2008 was faxed to Matrix on March 10, 2008. Given a condition with the potential to flare up at any moment, notice given within 8 days potentially comports with 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a)'s mandate. Additionally, Unified does not appear to argue that Nelson failed to provide timely notice. While Unified cites the applicable notice requirements, it presents arguments pertaining only to Nelson's alleged general failure to abide by Unified's "notice and procedural requirements that employees call into their supervisor on any scheduled workday when they are going to be absent." (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J., #30, at 28.)
With regard to medical certification, covered employers are entitled under the FMLA to request certification of an eligible employee's medical condition(s) where leave is requested in connection with the employee's own serious health condition. See 29 U.S.C. § 2613(a). Under most circumstances, an employee must provide certification within 15 days of the employer's request. 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(b) (amended 2009). Such medical certification  [*68] is sufficient for FMLA purposes if it states the date on which the serious health condition commenced, its probable duration, "appropriate" medical facts regarding the condition, and a statement that the employee is unable to perform his or her job functions. 29 U.S.C. § 2613(b)(1) to (4). If, as here, leave is requested on an intermittent basis for the employee's serious health condition, medical certification is sufficient for FMLA purposes if it additionally states the medical necessity for and expected duration of the intermittent leave. See 29 U.S.C. § 2613(b)(6). The FMLA further provides that, "[i]n any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of [such medical] certification . . ., the employer may require, at the expense of the employer, that the eligible employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 2613(c). The FMLA further provides that employers may request subsequent recertifications of employee medical conditions "on a reasonable basis." 29 U.S.C. § 2613(e).
The OFLA provides covered employers with a similar right to request medical verification of an employee's serious health condition. See O.R.S. 659A.168(1). Again,  [*69] the employee generally has 15 calendar days to provide medical certification following the employer's request. O.R.S. 659A.168(1); O.A.R. 839-009-0260(4). Like the FMLA, the OFLA provides that employers may request subsequent reverifications "on a reasonable basis." Id.
First, no factual dispute exists regarding whether Matrix received Nelson's initial medical certification pertaining to the commencement of his intermittent leave on March 2, 2008. Second, Nelson's Certification of Health Care Provider form pertaining to this commencement of leave was faxed to Matrix on March 10, 2008 and was therefore provided within 15 days of the leave. Unified does not indicate that it requested such certification earlier than March 2, 2008. Finally, as detailed above, Nelson's doctor provided information regarding the condition's date of commencement, nature, expected duration, and effects on Nelson's ability to work. I therefore find that Nelson complied with the applicable certification requirements pertaining to commencement of his intermittent leave due to gout on March 2, 2008. Unified does not contend that it doubted the validity of this certification, and in any case it had the right to request  [*70] a second opinion, 29 U.S.C. § 2613(c), but did not do so.
Because Nelson was taking intermittent leave as discussed above, and given Nelson's doctor's certification that the condition was ongoing and likely to be episodic and unpredictable, it is reasonable to conclude that this certification sufficiently addressed Nelson's absences from May 18 through May 21, 2008 of its own accord. In addition, an updated Certification of Health Care Provider Form was faxed to Matrix on April 16, 2008, and a factual dispute exists regarding whether Matrix received an authorization for disclosure of protected health information designed to allow Matrix and/or Unified to communicate directly with Nelson's health care providers regarding his condition and need for medical leave. Further, though Unified alleges that it repeatedly requested updated information from Nelson regarding his absences in May, given the intermittent nature of Nelson's leave, Nelson's submission of medical certification as late as April 16, 2008 indicating that his condition was unpredictable and ongoing, and the aforementioned issue of fact as to whether Unified had been provided with direct access to Nelson's doctor, it would  [*71] be untenable to find that Unified's requests for recertification prior to May 21, 2008 were made on a "reasonable basis."
Ultimately, Nelson was an eligible employee, had not exhausted his 12-month entitlement, apparently complied with the FMLA's notice requirements, and arguably complied with the applicable medical certification requirements with respect to the leave he requested from May 18 through May 21, 2008. Accordingly, because Unified denied Nelson's requests for leave on these dates, I find a material issue of fact as to whether Unified denied Nelson a right to which he was entitled by law, and thus whether Unified "interfere[ed] with, restrain[ed], or den[ied] the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided [by the FMLA]," namely Nelson's right to protected medical leave from May 18 through May 21, 2008.20 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). Additionally, given Unified's ongoing requests for additional documentation during this period as detailed above, I find a material issue of fact as to whether Unified engaged in conduct that "'discourage[ed] [Nelson] from using such leave.'" Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1133 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b)). I therefore recommend that Unified's  [*72] motion for summary judgment be denied with respect to Nelson's claim for interference under the FMLA and OFLA.

D. Retaliatory Discharge
Nelson alleges that his termination was wrongful under both the FMLA and OFLA because he was terminated in retaliation for his use of protected medical leave and/or his efforts to exercise his right to protected medical leave. I find that a material issue of fact exists regarding whether Nelson's use of medical leave and efforts to avail himself of protected leave constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision to terminate him, and therefore recommend that Unified's motion for summary judgment be denied as to Nelson's claim for retaliatory discharge in violation of the FMLA and OFLA.
Again, while the circuits have applied varying standards in evaluating claims alleging adverse employment  [*73] actions motivated by employees' invocation of FMLA-protected rights, in the Ninth Circuit claims alleging retaliatory demotion or discharge motivated by an employee's invocation of rights protected by the FMLA are properly treated as "interference" claims under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1122-25; Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1133 n.7.
The FMLA's accompanying regulations provide that "employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions, or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under 'no fault' attendance policies." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c) (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit has adopted this language, and the relevant inquiry is thus whether an employee's FMLA-protected leave or efforts to take FMLA-protected leave21 "constituted a negative factor in the decision to terminate [him or her]." Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124-25. Additionally, unlike courts analyzing such claims under Section 2615(a)(2), the Ninth Circuit does not apply the burden shifting scheme established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), to this inquiry. Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124. To establish a prima facie  [*74] case under 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), Nelson need only prove by a preponderance of evidence that his invocation of rights protected by the FMLA ultimately constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision to terminate him. Id. at 1125; Peterson v. Tri-County Metro. Transp. Dist. of Or., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20881, 2008 WL 723521, *9 (D. Or. Mar. 14, 2008).
Nelson's parallel claim under the OFLA is subject to precisely the same analysis. Following a 2007 amendment, the OFLA now provides in pertinent part:
It is an unlawful practice for a covered employer to: . . .
(2) Retaliate or in any way discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any other term or condition of employment because the individual has inquired about the provisions of ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186, submitted a request for family leave or invoked any provision of ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186.
O.R.S. 659A.183(2) (codifying the substantive  [*75] rights set forth in O.A.R. 839-009-0320(3)). Pursuant to O.R.S. 659A.186(2)'s mandate that the OFLA be construed consistently with the FMLA, since the 2007 amendment courts in this district have applied the law regarding FMLA interference claims to similar claims under the OFLA. See, e.g., Phillips v. Pacificorp, 304 Fed. Appx. 527, 531 (9th Cir. 2008) (applying the same "negative factor" analysis to identical claims under both the FMLA and OFLA pursuant to O.R.S. 659A.186(2)); Davis v. Pac. Saw & Knife Co., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30346, 2009 WL 936471, *4 (D. Or. Apr. 6, 2009) ("I do not engage in a separate analysis of the OFLA claim; rather, the following discussion of the FMLA claim applies equally to the OFLA claim."); Mink v. Marion Cnty. Juvenile Dep't, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118690, 2009 WL 5173513, *6-7 (D. Or. Dec. 18, 2009).
Nelson's claim survives summary judgment under this standard. Stated differently, "[r]equiring proof of a 'negative factor' is another way of stating that there must be some causal connection between the FMLA right and the adverse employment decision." Peterson, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20881, 2008 WL 723521 at *12; cf Price v. Multnomah Cnty., 132 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1296 (D. Or. 2001) (holding, although decided prior to Bachelder, that in order  [*76] to establish a prima facie case for retaliatory discharge in violation of the FMLA or OFLA a plaintiff must "show that (1) he availed himself of a protected right; (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision; and (3) there is a causal connection between the two actions." (citations omitted) (emphasis added)).
Unified asserts that Nelson was terminated "due to his repeated failure to follow its leave policies and procedures and to provide requested information about his absences and his continued absence from work after multiple months with no end in sight." (Def.'s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J., #40, at 9.) The record reflects the same rationale for Nelson's termination. (Melonas Decl., #33, ¶19.) While Nelson has come forth with no direct evidence indicating that his invocation of the FMLA and OFLA constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision, his submissions and testimony, along with the record as a whole, contain enough circumstantial evidence to raise a genuine dispute for trial. As the Ninth Circuit stated in Bachelder, "[one] can prove this claim, as one might any ordinary statutory claim, by using either direct or circumstantial evidence, or both." 259 F.3d at 1125  [*77] (citations omitted).
First, while Nelson was undoubtedly frequently absent from work and admittedly did not contact Matrix as required on several occasions, issues of fact remain regarding both whether Nelson received the card detailing Unified's requirement that he call Matrix, and regarding whether Nelson complied with Unified's "call-in" procedures. Nelson declares that his supervisors communicated conflicting call-in requirements to him, and that in any event he was never a "no-call no-show" in violation of company policy. Nelson's attendance, notwithstanding his medical leave, appears to have been substandard. However, these factual disputes, coupled with the fact that Nelson's medical leave need only have constituted a negative factor in his termination, tend to establish that Nelson's attendance record is not the sole plausible basis for his termination.
Second, as noted above, Unified openly declares that Nelson was terminated in large part due to his failure to follow instructions communicated to him regarding medical certification and other company requirements in connection with his efforts to take medical leave. Because issues of fact exist as to whether these instructions  [*78] were reasonable, and as to whether Nelson complied with them at the very least in March, April, and May of 2008, it logically follows that Nelson's leave and efforts to secure leave potentially played a role in his termination. In fact, given that Nelson was absent from May 18, 2008 through May 21, 2008 despite Unified's denial of his requests for leave on those dates, it is entirely plausible that those absences were considered among the numerous absences that in part formed the basis for Nelson's termination. Because a material issue of fact exists as to whether those absences should have been protected by the FMLA and/or OFLA, and because Nelson's absences were considered by Unified in terminating him, a material issue of fact likewise exists as to whether Nelson's efforts to secure protected medical leave from May 18, 2008 through May 21, 2008 constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision to terminate him.
Finally, the temporal proximity between Nelson's medical leave and efforts to secure leave and his suspension on October 20, 2008 that resulted in a final warning culminating in his termination provides further circumstantial evidence to support Nelson's claim for retaliatory  [*79] discharge in violation of the FMLA and OFLA. The Supreme Court has noted that "[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be 'very close.'" Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, prior to October 20, 2008, Nelson had last taken medical leave on October 1, 2008. (Melonas Supp. Decl., #41, Ex. A, at 20.) A mere 20 days separated Nelson's use of medical leave and the first adverse employment action ultimately leading to his termination, and although this connection is tenuous it does provide further circumstantial evidence supporting Nelson's claim for retaliatory discharge.
Based on the totality of the evidence discussed above, and drawing all inferences in favor of Nelson, I find that based on the record as a whole a rational trier of fact could conclude that Nelson's protected medical leave and/or efforts to secure protected medical leave constituted a negative factor in Unified's decision to suspend him twice and ultimately  [*80] to terminate him. I therefore recommend that Unified's motion for summary judgment be denied as to Nelson's claim for retaliatory discharge in violation of the FMLA and OFLA.

E. Failure to Reinstate
Nelson alleges that Unified violated his substantive rights under the FMLA and OFLA by "refus[ing] to restore him to his original position or to an equivalent position upon return from leave." (Pl.'s Compl., #2, ¶29.) This claim fails to survive summary judgment on two grounds. First, Nelson was indisputably unable to return to work and perform the essential functions of his position at the time he claims a right to reinstatement. Second, Nelson simply did not "return from leave" after exhausting his 12-month entitlement.
Under the interference theory created by 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1), courts have firmly held that "the FMLA does not provide leave for leave's sake, but instead provides leave with an expectation that an employee will return to work after the leave ends."22 Throneberry v. McGehee Desha Cnty. Hosp., 403 F.3d 972, 978 (8th Cir. 2005); see 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); Sanders, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998 at *5-6. Where an employer fails to reinstate an employee following FMLA leave, to establish  [*81] a prima facie case for failure to reinstate under the FMLA, '"the employee must establish that: (1) he was eligible for the FMLA's protections, (2) his employer was covered by the FMLA, (3) he was entitled to leave under the FMLA, (4) he provided sufficient notice of his intent to take leave, and (5) his employer denied him the FMLA benefits to which he was entitled.'" Sanders, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998 at *5 (quoting Burnett v. LFW Inc., 472 F.3d 471, 477 (7th Cir. 2006)). Again, the employer's intent is irrelevant when analyzing claims for interference with, or denial of, rights guaranteed by the FMLA. See, e.g., 657 F.3d 772, Id. at *5-6; Xin Liu, 347 F.3d at 1135.
Nelson's claim fails on the fifth element of the prima facie case. The "FMLA benefit[] to which [Nelson] was entitled" consisted of the right to return to his original position or its equivalent upon return from leave. Sanders, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998 at *5. As discussed above in the context of Nelson's disability discrimination  [*82] claims, Nelson testified that during the first half of 2009—the period during which he ostensibly sought reinstatement—he was physically incapable of performing any job at Unified. Courts have repeatedly held that "[a]n employer does not violate the Family Medical Leave Act when it fires an employee who is indisputably unable to return to work at the conclusion of the 12-week period of statutory leave." Edgar v. JAC Prods., Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 506 (6th Cir. 2006); see also Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 161 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that an employer did not violate the plaintiff's right to reinstatement following 12 weeks of leave because it was undisputed that the plaintiff remained unable to perform the essential functions of his position at the end of that 12-week period); Franzen v. Ellis Corp.., 543 F.3d 420, 426 (7th Cir. 2008) (holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for his employer's failure to reinstate him following his 12 weeks of medical leave because he was not able to return to work at that time).
The burden of persuasion at trial rests with the employer "to show that he had a legitimate reason to deny an employee reinstatement,"  [*83] including the burden to establish whether the employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement was requested. Sanders, 657 F.3d 772, 2011 WL 905998 at *7, citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.216(a). Accordingly, Unified's "showing must be sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party." Calderone v. United States, 799 F.2d 254, 259 (6th Cir. 1986) (emphasis omitted). Such a showing has been made here, as Unified points directly to Nelson's testimony that he was unable to perform any job at Unified during the first half of 2009, and Nelson does not dispute this fact.23
Finally, Nelson simply did not return to work following the expiration of his 12-week leave entitlement on January 12, 2009, and was therefore not entitled to reinstatement. See, e.g., Farina v. Compuware Corp., 256 F. Supp. 2d 1033, 1057 (D. Ariz. 2003) (holding that, after she took 12 weeks of protected medical leave, "[b]ecause Plaintiff did not return to work, or provide evidence that she would have returned on that date absent Defendant's actions, there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff's rights under the FMLA were prejudiced by Defendant's actions").
For each of the reasons set forth above, I recommend that Unified's motion for summary judgment be granted with respect to Nelson's claim for failure to reinstate under the FMLA and OFLA.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, defendant Unified's motion for summary judgment should be granted as to plaintiff Nelson's claims for disability discrimination and retaliation under the ADA and Oregon law, workers' compensation discrimination, failure to reinstate, and failure to reemploy  [*85] under Oregon law, and failure to reinstate under the FMLA and OFLA. Unified's motion for summary judgment should be denied as to Nelson's claims for interference and retaliatory discharge under the FMLA and OFLA.
