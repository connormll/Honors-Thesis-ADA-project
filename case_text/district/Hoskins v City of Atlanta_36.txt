Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the Court on the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Michael Hoskins and Defendant City of Atlanta (the "City"). [Docs. 59, 62]. In this case, Plaintiff alleges that the City, his long-time employer, failed to accommodate his disability of dyslexia in connection with certain promotional testing. For the reasons discussed below, I recommend that the City's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 59] be granted and that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 62] be denied.

I. FACTS1
The City hired Plaintiff as a firefighter in 1998. [Deposition of Michael Hoskins ("Pl. Dep.") 26, 31-33]. Plaintiff made clear from the beginning that he suffered from dyslexia, and the City hired him with full knowledge of the condition. [Id. at 32-33; Deposition of Jerome Robinson ("Robinson Dep.") 11-12]. [*2]  At various times during his employment with the City, Plaintiff requested from Deputy Chief Wilmond Meadows certain accommodations for his dyslexia for promotional tests. [Deposition of Wilmond Meadows ("Meadows Dep.") 78; Declaration of Wilmond Meadows ("Meadows Decl.") ¶¶ 9-10, 18-24]. Between 2008 and 2010, the City provided Plaintiff with numerous requested accommodations, including allowing Plaintiff additional time on examinations, providing Plaintiff with a reader to read test questions to him, and giving him at least one book in an electronic format that was listed on a study list for a promotional examination for which Plaintiff was preparing. [Meadows Decl. ¶¶ 18-24]. In 2011, Plaintiff was provisionally promoted to the position of sergeant. [Pl. Dep. 56-57]. Although the record is not entirely clear as to Plaintiff's current employment status with the City, it is undisputed that Plaintiff last actively worked for the City in 2014. [Id. at 30-31, 42-43].
Between the time that he was promoted to sergeant and the time he stopped actively working for the City, Plaintiff did not pursue any promotions because no promotional examinations—which are required for further advancement—were administered [*3]  during that time period. [Pl. Dep. 58-59]. The City did not administer any promotional examinations in 2013, 2014, or 2015, which effectively resulted in a moratorium on all promotions that required testing for advancement. [Meadows Decl. ¶ 39; Declaration of Michael Simmons ("Simmons Decl.") ¶ 26].
On December 26, 2012, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to Deputy Chief Meadows requesting "that instructional materials being provided to all fire personnel for the purposes of preparation for promotional testing be provided to [Plaintiff] in an electronic format." [Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 3; Meadows Decl. ¶ 2]. Plaintiff explained that he sought "the same promotions that are available to all fire personnel and continue[s] to need the materials in alternative forms so that [he] can use [his] specialized software to prepare for these promotional exams." [Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 3]. The next day, Deputy Chief Meadows replied to Plaintiff's e-mail, advising Plaintiff that "[c]urrently we don't have a study list or an upcoming promotional examination." [Id. at 2]. Plaintiff did not respond to the e-mail or follow up on his request in any way at that time. [Meadows Decl. ¶¶ 16, 29; Simmons Decl. ¶ 12].
Six months later, [*4]  on June 11, 2013, Plaintiff sent another e-mail to Deputy Chief Meadows stating, in relevant part:
This correspondence is a [sic] yet another attempt to get instructional materials in an electronic format prior to courses starting for the purpose of preparing for the promotional testing. It is documented that I am a person with a specific disability, dyslexia. Now as a person with this particular disability certain accommodations should be made, to enable me to be successful in my endeavors as far advancing within the fire department.
One of these accommodations would be for me to use study aid materials, which I have purchased, that would be used in conjunction with the electronic text for the courses. The text would need to be provided prior to the course and in PDF format.
. . .
So once again, I ask please provide all of the available instructional materials to me as soon as possible. Providing these materials will afford me the same amount of time for studying as my peers.
[Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 1].
Deputy Chief Meadows replied to Plaintiff's e-mail that same day, stating that he was "unfamiliar with a study list or material that the department has distributed in regards to an upcoming promotional [*5]  examination." [Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 1]. Deputy Chief Meadows asked Plaintiff to forward any study list in Plaintiff's possession to Deputy Chief Michael Simmons. [Id.]. As with his previous e-mail request six months earlier, Plaintiff did not respond to Deputy Chief Meadows's e-mail, follow up on his request, or specify which materials he wanted. [Meadows Dep. 68-69; Meadows Decl. ¶ 29].
Deputy Chief Meadows provided undisputed testimony that the reason he asked Plaintiff to provide a study list was so that the City could order specific books from the list in an electronic format for Plaintiff. [Meadows Dep. 69-73; Meadows Decl. ¶ 26]. In the absence of any follow-up correspondence from Plaintiff, however, no one from the City provided Plaintiff with any materials in an electronic format at that time. [Meadows Dep. 76; Deposition of Michael Simmons ("Simmons Dep.") 35].
On February 19, 2015, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit against the City, alleging a single claim of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et. seq. ("ADA"). [Doc. 1 ("Compl.")]. After the close of the discovery period, the parties filed the instant [*6]  cross-motions for summary judgment. [Docs. 59, 62]. I held oral argument on October 12, 2017. [Doc. 92]. The motions are now fully briefed and ripe for consideration.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Ezell v. Wynn, 802 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir. 2015). The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the court "the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact[ ]" and "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); U.S. v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437-38 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). "[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If the moving party fails to discharge this initial burden, the motion must be denied. See Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir. 1993).
If the burden is met, however, the non-moving party must then "go beyond the pleadings and . . . designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324 (citation omitted). "A 'mere scintilla' of evidence is insufficient; the non-moving party must [*7]  produce substantial evidence to defeat a motion for summary judgment." See Garczynski v. Bradshaw, 573 F.3d 1158, 1165 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Mere conclusions and factual allegations unsupported by evidence are insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). "If reasonable minds could differ on the inferences arising from undisputed facts, then a court should deny summary judgment." Miranda v. B & B Cash Grocery Store, Inc., 975 F.2d 1518, 1534 (11th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).
The applicable Rule 56 standard is not affected by the filing of cross-motions for summary judgment. See United States v. Oakley, 744 F.2d 1553, 1555-56 (11th Cir. 1984). "[T]he filing of cross-motions for summary judgment does not give rise to any presumption that no genuine issues of material fact exist." Floyd v. SunTrust Banks, Inc., 878 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1321 (N.D. Ga. 2012). Rather, when parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, "each side must still establish the lack of genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Busby v. JRHBW Realty, Inc., 642 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1288 (N.D. Ala. 2009). The court must consider each motion independently, and in accordance with the Rule 56 standard. See Teal v. Gibbs, No. 4:10-CV-840-VEH, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165336, 2011 WL 13229629, at *2 (N.D. Ala. June 28, 2011).

B. Legal Framework for ADA Discrimination Claims
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, [*8]  job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a prima facie case for failure-to-accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a "qualified individual"; and (3) he was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Bagwell v. Morgan Cty. Comm'n, 676 F. App'x 863, 865 (11th Cir. 2017); Medearis v. CVS Pharmacy, 92 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1303-04 (N.D. Ga. 2015). "The ADA requires an employer to make reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified employee with a disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations and citations omitted).
An accommodation is reasonable only if it would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job or would allow the employee "to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment" as other non-disabled similarly-situated employees. See 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(o)(1); McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 F. App'x 897, 899 (11th Cir. 2014).2 "[T]he plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation." Bagwell, 676 F. App'x at 866; Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001). "Moreover, an employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1255-56 (citing Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999)); see also Bagwell, 676 F. App'x at 866. "A plaintiff does not satisfy her initial burden by simply naming a preferred accommodation—even one mentioned in the statute [*9]  or regulations; she must show that the accommodation is 'reasonable' given her situation." Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to his prima facie case. See Warren v. Volusia Cty., Fla., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006).
Only after the plaintiff has established that he is a qualified individual with a disability and has made a specific demand for an accommodation is the obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation triggered. See Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1364. The regulations state that an employer may, in some circumstances, need to "initiate an informal, interactive process" with a disabled employee to determine "the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). However, "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 448 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that the employer's failure to investigate did not relieve the plaintiff of his burden of producing probative evidence that reasonable accommodations were available).

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff alleges that the City failed to make a reasonable accommodation for his dyslexia when it did not honor his [*10]  June 11, 2013 request that "all instructional materials . . . be provided in an electronic format prior to any future promotional testing."3 [Compl. ¶¶ 32]. Plaintiff contends that no triable issue of fact exists as to the City's failure to provide him with his requested accommodation. [Doc. 62 at 14-23]. The City, on the other hand, argues that the record evidence establishes that Plaintiff's request for an accommodation was neither specific nor reasonable, and that as a result, the City was not required to provide Plaintiff with his requested accommodation or even engage in the interactive process. [Doc. 59 at 5-14].

A. The City's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 59]
In resolving the City's motion for summary judgment, I have drawn all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, because he is the non-moving party.
The City halfheartedly argues in a footnote that "Plaintiff has not shown that he is a qualified individual with a disability who is entitled to the protections of the ADA." [Doc. 59 at 5, n.1]. Other courts have found that dyslexia may qualify as a disability under the ADA. See, e.g., Lipscomb v. Techs., Servs., & Info., Inc., No. CIV.A. DKC-09-3344, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16692, 2011 WL 691605, at *13 (D. Md. Feb. 18, 2011) ("ADD, dyslexia, and learning disabilities have been recognized as impairments.");  [*11] Risteen v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. CIV. 09-6020-AA, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43255, 2010 WL 1838105, at *3 (D. Or. Apr. 30, 2010) ("The Ninth Circuit has recognized dyslexia and other learning disabilities as qualifying impairments under the ADA."). In this case, the City does not dispute that it previously treated Plaintiff as if he were a qualified individual. The City acknowledges that Plaintiff requested—and the City provided—several accommodations for Plaintiff's dyslexia between 2008 and 2010, including allowing him additional time to complete tests and providing a reader during examinations to read him test questions. [Pl. Dep. 65, 70; Meadows Decl. ¶¶ 18-20, 22-24]. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, I find that Plaintiff has established the first two prongs of his prima facie case, i.e., that he is a qualified individual with a disability.
The City next argues that even assuming that Plaintiff is disabled and otherwise qualified, Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for an ADA violation, because Plaintiff has not shown that the City was required to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 59 at 5-14]. The City argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because its duty to accommodate Plaintiff's dyslexia [*12]  was not triggered because Plaintiff never made a specific request for a reasonable accommodation. [Id.].
In response, Plaintiff argues that when he wrote "instructional materials" in his e-mail, what he really wanted was every book in every firehouse library throughout the City. [Doc. 80 at 8-11]. Plaintiff contends that he did not need to specify that he was asking for all such items, because "instructional materials" is a term of art that Deputy Chief Meadows should have understood to mean every book in every firehouse library in the City. [Id.]. The only evidence Plaintiff cites to in support of this argument, however, is a policy maintained by the City titled "AFD.SOP.02.40" regarding "Promotional and Training Material" (the "Policy"). [Id. at 7-8]. The Policy states, in relevant part: "It is the policy of the Atlanta Fire Department to provide promotional and training text books and ensure that each fire personnel has access to the books, and to maintain text books in all fire stations and in the Library of the Training Center." [Meadows Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. B-1]. Plaintiff argues that because the stated purpose of the Policy is to "establish a uniform procedure for maintaining promotional and [*13]  training study material textbooks[,]" there is no doubt that every book contained in every firehouse library in the City qualifies as "instructional materials" encompassed by his June 11, 2013 request. [Doc. 80 at 7-8]. This argument is problematic for several reasons.
First, Plaintiff's argument is not supported by the text of the parties' e-mail exchange. In his e-mail, Plaintiff did not ask for every book (textbook or otherwise) in every firehouse library in the City. Rather, Plaintiff requested "instructional materials in an electronic format . . . for the purpose of preparing for the promotional testing." [Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 1 (emphasis added)]. This is a qualified request, does not reference the Policy, does not request any specific books, nor does it mention anything about firehouse libraries. [Id.]. Moreover, Plaintiff's references to "promotional testing" and "time for studying" reflect that his request related to a desire to prepare for an upcoming promotional test and that he was seeking only those materials related to that purpose. [Id.]. Because no such tests were scheduled, it is not clear what Plaintiff wanted, and it certainly is not clear that Plaintiff wanted every [*14]  book in every firehouse library in the City.
Moreover, Plaintiff's request for "all of the available instructional materials" was not specific enough to constitute a demand for a reasonable accommodation. While Plaintiff's e-mail's mention of disability accommodation was specific enough to put the City on notice that Plaintiff was attempting to assert his rights under the ADA, the scope of Plaintiff's request was vague. In the absence of any upcoming promotional testing, Deputy Chief Meadows was left wondering why Plaintiff was making such a request and exactly what Plaintiff meant by his request. Deputy Chief Meadows provided undisputed testimony that he did not believe there were any materials to provide to Plaintiff in response to Plaintiff's e-mail, because no promotional testing was scheduled. [Meadows Dep. 25-26, 69-70, 72-74, 79-80; Meadows Decl. ¶¶ 17, 26]. And when Deputy Chief Meadows in his e-mail response asked Plaintiff to be more specific and identify what materials he wanted, Plaintiff did not reply. [Meadows Dep. 68-69; Meadows Decl. ¶ 29]. Plaintiff argues that it was disingenuous for Deputy Chief Meadows to request a study list (because Deputy Chief Meadows knew there [*15]  was no upcoming test, and therefore that there was no study list), but that does not change the fact that Plaintiff's request was still vague, and that Plaintiff failed to clarify what he wanted when given the opportunity to do so.
At oral argument, Plaintiff argued that his request was sufficiently specific because Deputy Chief Meadows should have known what Plaintiff really meant—i.e., every single book in every single firehouse library in the City. This position, however, simply is not supported by the evidence. In his e-mail, Plaintiff requested only a subset of those materials—instructional materials to assist in upcoming promotional examinations. It is undisputed that there were no upcoming promotional examinations scheduled at the time of either of Plaintiff's two e-mail inquiries [Meadows Decl. ¶ 39; Simmons Decl. ¶ 26], and Plaintiff has come forward with no evidence to support his theory that Deputy Chief Meadows should have known what Plaintiff really meant when he used the term "instructional materials." Because Plaintiff's request was not a specific request for a reasonable accommodation, Deputy Chief Meadows was under no obligation to investigate what Plaintiff might be [*16]  referring to, especially when Plaintiff failed to respond or clarify in response to a direct request to do so. See Willis, 108 F.3d at 285 ("[T]he ADA provides no cause of action for 'failure to investigate' possible accommodations.").
Plaintiff argues that even if his request was not as precise as it could have been, the City nevertheless was required engage in an interactive process with him to determine an appropriate accommodation, but that the City failed to do so, thereby precluding summary judgment. [Doc. 62-1 at 2, 8, 19-23]. While it is true that under certain circumstances, an employer may be required to initiate an interactive process with the employee to identify his limitations and possible accommodations, when an employee fails to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer has no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012). "[I]t is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an 'interactive process[.]'" Pierre v. City of Atlanta, No. 1:14-CV-04043-SCJ-JFK, 2016 WL 10567634, at *10 (N.D. Ga. June 3, 2016). As discussed above, I conclude that Plaintiff did not make a specific request for a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the City had no obligation [*17]  to engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff. See Willis, 108 F.3d at 285 (stating that the employer's actions do not affect the plaintiff's initial burden of establishing that reasonable accommodations were available).
But even assuming that Plaintiff did make a sufficiently specific request for a reasonable accommodation, and the City was obligated to interact with Plaintiff to try to find a reasonable accommodation, the City satisfied any such obligation by asking for clarification, which Plaintiff failed to provide. "Because the interactive process imposes mutual obligations on employers and employees, an employer cannot be liable for failure to accommodate if a breakdown in that process is attributable to the employee." Williamson v. Clarke Cty. Dep't of Human Res., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1319 (S.D. Ala. 2011). "Liability simply cannot arise under the ADA when an employer does not obstruct an informal interactive process; makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possesses; and the employee's actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997).
Here, it is undisputed that Deputy Chief Meadows asked Plaintiff to specify the materials he wanted, and that Plaintiff failed to respond to Deputy Chief Meadows or otherwise [*18]  engage in discussions with the City about his requested accommodation. [Meadows Dep. 68-69; Meadows Decl. ¶ 29; Pl. Dep. Ex. 3 at 1]. If Plaintiff knew that there was no study list and was instead requesting that all the books in every firehouse library in the City be provided to him in an electronic format (as he argues in his summary judgment filings), he could have informed Deputy Chief Meadows of this fact and clarified his request; Plaintiff, however, did not do so. The undisputed evidence reveals that it was Plaintiff, not Deputy Chief Meadows, who caused the breakdown in the interactive process. As such, there is no basis for imposing liability on the City for failing to engage in an interactive process to identify accommodations.4 See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287.
Because Plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case for his failure-to-accommodate claim, I recommend that the City's motion for summary judgment be granted. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 ("Appellant's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation is fatal to her ADA claim."); Walker v. Putnam Cty., Ga., No. 5:08-CV-00452 CAR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95593, 2010 WL 3732111, at *7 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 14, 2010) ("Plaintiff cannot challenge Defendants' actions on a failure to accommodate theory because he never identified and requested a specific, reasonable [*19]  accommodation.").

B. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 62]
In resolving Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, I have viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the City as the non-moving party.
"The law imposes a much higher standard on [the plaintiff] when he is attempting to show that he is entitled to summary judgment in his favor, rather than merely attempting to defeat the Defendant's motion for summary judgment." Williams v. Alabama Dep't of Corr., No. 4:12-CV-4043-KOB, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19712, 2014 WL 636977, at *16 (N.D. Ala. Feb. 18, 2014), aff'd, 649 F. App'x 925 (11th Cir. 2016). To prevail, Plaintiff must show no genuine issue of material fact as to all elements of the cause of action and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.
Here, as discussed above, even when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim fails. When all reasonable inferences are drawn in the City's favor, Plaintiff's claim necessarily also fails. Because the undisputed facts viewed in the light most favorable to the City do not establish all of the elements of Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim—specifically, that Plaintiff made a specific request for a reasonable accommodation—I recommend that his motion for summary [*20]  judgment be denied.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, I RECOMMEND that the City's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 59] be GRANTED, and that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 62] be DENIED.
SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 26th day of January, 2018.
