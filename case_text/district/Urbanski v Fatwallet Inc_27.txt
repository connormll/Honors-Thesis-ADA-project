STATEMENT
Plaintiff, Michael C. Urbanski, a former employee of defendant, Fatwallet, Inc., filed a pro se complaint alleging defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), § 102(b)(5)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A), and he was constructively discharged as a result. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons that follow, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice.
I. BACKGROUND
In his complaint, plaintiff generally alleges that defendant failed to reasonably accommodate his disability [*2]  after plaintiff made a reasonable request for such an accommodation. Plaintiff states that defendant requested that plaintiff "see a specialist before discussing possible accommodations." However, after plaintiff provided defendant with his "diagnosis and associated medical documents," defendant told plaintiff that it would not accommodate him. Plaintiff subsequently left his employment with defendant.
II. ANALYSIS
To state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a compliant must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must provide sufficient details about the claim such that defendant has "fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (alteration and quotation marks omitted). Although plaintiff need not plead detailed factual allegations, a simple "recitation of the elements of a cause of action" is insufficient without "further factual enhancement." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff's well-pleaded facts are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences are drawn in his favor. Pugel v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., 378 F.3d 659, 662 (7th Cir. 2004). Although "less stringent standards" apply to a pro se [*3]  plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007)(quotation marks omitted), his complaint still must contain sufficient facts to support its conclusions such that a reasonable inference can be made that the plaintiff's rights had been violated, see Smith-Bey v. Hosp. Adm'r, 841 F.2d 751, 758 (7th Cir. 1988).
A. ADA Failure to Accommodate Claim
According to the ADA, a disabled employee is discriminated against when his employer does not make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations" of a qualified employee. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). In order to bring a claim against an employer for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) his employer was aware of the disability; and (3) his employer failed to reasonably accommodate plaintiff. Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc., 256 F.3d 568, 572 (7th Cir. 2001). Further, the employer is required to engage in an interactive process to determine whether reasonable accommodation is possible. If the employer is responsible for a break down in the process, it may be held liable. E.E.O.C. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 417 F.3d 789, 805-06 (7th Cir. 2005).
In this case, plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to support the first and third elements of a failure to accommodate claim. First, plaintiff fails to allege that he was a "qualified individual" under Section 101(8) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). In light of the requirements enumerated in Iqbal [*4] , plaintiff must "plead with adequate specificity that the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation." E.E.O.C. v. Supervalu, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 2d 1007, 1014 (N.D. Ill. 2009). Plaintiff's complaint does not assert that he has the requisite skill, experience or education to satisfy the job requirements despite his disability. See Ross v. Ind. State Teacher's Ass'n Ins. Trust, 159 F.3d 1001, 1013 (7th Cir. 1998).
Further, plaintiff's simple assertion that he has a disability is insufficient to state a claim under the ADA. A disability is defined by the ADA as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Plaintiff's complaint contains no additional facts that would support his bare assertion that he has a disability as defined by the ADA.
As to the third element of the failure to accommodate claim, while plaintiff properly alleges that his employer was aware of plaintiff's disability, the complaint is still deficient in that it does not identify the accommodation requested by the plaintiff. To satisfy this element, plaintiff must propose an accommodation that is "reasonable in the sense of both efficaciousness [*5]  and proportionality of costs." Lynch v. Pomper, No. 97 C 1388, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15328, 1998 WL 673648, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 16, 1998). Here, plaintiff simply states that he requested a "reasonable accommodation for [his] disability," but was "informed that [he] would not be accommodated." Such general statements made without additional factual support do not state a claim for which relief may be granted.
B. ADA Constructive Discharge Claim
Although it is extremely difficult to discern whether plaintiff is doing so, to the extent that plaintiff is also attempting to allege a claim for constructive discharge under the ADA, plaintiff must show that (1) the employer made working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to leave, and (2) that he was constructively discharged because of his disability. See E.E.O.C. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 233 F.3d 432, 440-41 (7th Cir. 2000). Plaintiff has failed to make any allegations in his complaint that would suggest an intolerable work environment such that he would have felt compelled to leave. Therefore, this claim must also be dismissed.
III. CONCLUSION
Since plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a claim under the ADA, defendant's motion to dismiss is granted. However, the dismissal shall be without prejudice. In this case, plaintiff attempted to file a response [*6]  to defendant's motion to dismiss, but it was never properly docketed until the court found the one-page document in its paper file.1 In the response, plaintiff requests leave to amend his complaint which the court construes as a request for leave to amend pursuant to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) which provides that leave to amend is to be freely given "when justice so requires." Therefore, plaintiff is granted leave to file an amended complaint within 30 days of this order if he can cure the deficiencies noted above. Failure to file an amended complaint will result in dismissal of this cause with prejudice.2
