Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff worked as a Service Technician ("ST") for Defendant, in which position he repaired and installed telephone, internet and other telecommunications services. The job occasionally involved climbing ladders and poles, and Defendant unfortunately fell and injured himself while climbing a pole in 2011. While Plaintiff's injury was considered temporary, Defendant allowed him to work as a Service Technician restricted to light duty, excusing him from jobs that required climbing or medium lifting. After approximately three months, however, Plaintiff's doctors concluded that Plaintiff's restrictions were permanent, and Defendant refused to extend the temporary light-duty accommodations permanently. Defendant allowed Plaintiff to transfer or apply to transfer to light-duty jobs, although with only a temporary  [*2] protection in his wage level. Plaintiff did not so apply. Thus, Plaintiff's employment with Defendant ceased.
Plaintiff sues under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. He alleges in Count I that Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of a disability in violation of the ADA by refusing to allow him to continue working as a Service Technician despite his restrictions. He alleges in Count II that Defendant retaliated against him in violation of the ADA by terminating him on the basis of his requests for reasonable accommodation.
Defendant now moves for summary judgment [42]. As explained below, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion [42] be GRANTED. In the end, there is no legitimately-disputed fact as to the dispositive issue in this case, namely, that Plaintiff could not continue to perform all essential tasks of a Service Technician, even with an accommodation. Plaintiff's proposal that he simply be excused from performing the heavy-duty parts of the Service Technician job was not the sort of accommodation the ADA required Defendant to make. For these and other reasons discussed below, Defendant's failure to maintain Plaintiff in a job  [*3] he could not perform was neither unlawful discrimination, nor retaliation.1

I. FACTS
Unless otherwise noted, the undersigned draws the following facts from Defendant's "Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [42-6] ("Def. SOMF") and Plaintiff's "Statement of Material Facts" [53] ("Pl. SOMF").
The Court has excluded all facts asserted by either party that are immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to evidence in the record or asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B), NDGa ("The court will not consider any  [*4] fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."). The Court has, however, reviewed the underlying evidence cited in the statements of fact and may cite to that underlying evidence especially where the parties disagree as to what a witness stated or what a document says or what inferences can be drawn from such evidence. The Court has also viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff Daryel Jernigan ("Jernigan" or "Plaintiff") began his employment with BellSouth as a Services Technician ("Technician" or "ST") on October 26, 1998. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 1; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 1. He held the ST position throughout the duration of his employment with Defendant. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 2. Jernigan was subject to a collective bargaining agreement between BellSouth and the  [*5] Communications Workers of America (the "CBA"). Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 11. The Services Technician title was a Wage Scale 30 under the CBA. Id. ¶ 12.

The Work Of A Service Technician
Service Technicians such as Plaintiff repaired and installed telephone, internet and fax services. Id. ¶ 2; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 5. Plaintiff completed between three to nine jobs in the field on a typical day. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 3. Plaintiff performed his work at residential and business locations. Id. ¶ 4. Certain jobs, such as aerial connections across roadways, required two STs. Id. ¶ 10.
The majority of Plaintiff's time was spent driving to a location, going to a cross-box to test the dial tone or DSL signal, making connections at the cross-box, and then going to the residence or business to make the connections and testing to make sure the phone or DSL service was working properly. Id. ¶ 18. Jernigan worked in attics and basements less than 15 or 20 percent of the time. Id. ¶ 15.
To install a service, Service Technicians receive a location from dispatch, then either contact the customer and make a connection at a cross-box to get service to the customer or go to the cross-box to check if there is trouble  [*6] at the cross-box itself. Id. ¶ 19. Then, in an installation, after making connections at the cross-box, Service Technicians proceed to the residence to make various connections before confirming the customer had all the services wanted. Id.
To perform his duties, Plaintiff carried standard hand tools like a screwdriver, Phillips head, wire cutters, pliers, electrical tape, voltage tester, tones, probes, ohm meter, various screws, twist ties, and tags. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 6. Plaintiff does not know the weight of the ladder or any of the tools or equipment that he lifted. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 7. The ladder utilized by the Technicians weighed approximately 40 pounds. Id. ¶ 8. The power belt Technicians utilize adds an additional 15 to 20 lbs. Id. ¶ 9.
The Service Technician job description, entitled Job Briefs and Qualifications Sheet, refers to lifting and climbing in several places. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶¶ 4-6; Mann Dep., Ex. C [43-6]. First, under the header "Job Responsibilities," the document states that "responsibilities may include but are not limited to the following," then lists 20 specific tasks including "17. Climbs poles, ladders, and works aloft with small tools . . ." and "19. Lifts  [*7] and moves loads up to 120 pounds." Mann Dep., Ex. C [43-6] at 2. Second, under "Basic Qualifications," the document lists two training classes that "must be satisfactorily completed for title retention," one of which is "SF401, Safe Ladder Handling and Pole Climbing." Id. Third, under the header "General Working Conditions/Physical Requirements," the document states that "successful candidates require the ability to" do four separate categories of activities, two of which are "Climb poles, ladders, and work aloft with small tools," and "Lift and move loads up to 120 pounds." Id. at 3.
The majority of ST jobs, however, do not require lifting or climbing. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 9. Prior to his injury, Jernigan lifted items, climbed poles, and climbed ladders less than 10 percent of the time. Id. ¶ 8. On average, STs may lift perhaps 40 to 50 pounds approximately 10 to 15 minutes out of their 40 hour work week. Id. ¶ 16. STs could go multiple weeks without ever having to use a ladder. Id. ¶ 12. The ladder lifting, ladder climbing, and pole climbing, however, are some of the most physically-demanding parts of the ST job. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 52. STs must lift 120 pounds infrequently (less than five  [*8] percent of the time), and in those circumstances, devices such as levers or come-alongs are used to assist the STs. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 17.
Nevertheless, while the "majority" of jobs do not require lifting or climbing, there are some jobs that do, including jobs that require lifting up to 120 pounds. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 87. The reason for the "up to" 120 pound lifting requirement is that the need for lifting in this range can arise at any time, and if a Technician is alone on a Saturday, or other Technicians are busy, the Technician is required to be able to perform the function without having to wait for assistance. Id. ¶ 88.
Technicians are dispatched to jobs randomly via computer. Id. ¶ 48. When an ST cannot climb poles due to injury or disability, BellSouth managers can override the dispatch system to assign those STs to a subset of jobs that will not require climbing a pole or engaging in heavy lifting. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 65.
After returning to work, Jernigan was dispatched to residences and businesses to perform installs or repairs. Id. ¶ 52. He continued to perform certain jobs within his job description, albeit ones that would not require lifting or climbing. Id. ¶¶ 53, 55. In addition,  [*9] Jernigan performed other light duties, including cleanup of outside wiring of apartment complexes. Id. ¶ 54. He would clean up the wiring, and make small repairs to refurbish the equipment. Id. While on light duty, Mr. Jernigan completed his assignments. Id. ¶ 55.2 STs who are accommodated for an injury still work a full day. Id. ¶ 58. Even with his light duty restrictions, the department was running and work was getting done that needed to get done. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 59.
Sometimes as a part of their job duties, Technicians are dispatched on "helping  [*10] tickets" to assist other Technicians. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 66. Helping (or "helper") tickets were common for men and women. Id. ¶ 67. If an ST needed help on a particular job, they would request a "Helper Ticket," and another ST would come to assist. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 25. Supervisor Mann would assign the helper ST to assist the ST in need. Id. ¶ 62. The approval process for a Helper Ticket took less than five minutes. Id. ¶ 28. Mann could not recall an occasion when he had ever not approved a Helper Ticket. Id. ¶ 33. On average, STs call for Helper Tickets about three times per week. Id. ¶ 63.
Before his injury and disability, Jernigan assisted other Service Technicians by helping them make aerial connections, which involved putting a ladder on the pole or climbing the pole using hooks. Id. ¶ 26. He was dispatched on approximately 20 Helper Tickets each month. Id. ¶ 34. Mainly, Jernigan was dispatched on Helper Tickets to place aerial terminals, help locate buried drops, troubleshoot problems, and make electronic cross-connects. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 35.

Jernigan's Injury and Defendant's Temporary Accommodation
While dispatched on a job on December 14, 2010, Plaintiff had to climb a pole to make  [*11] a connection and, at some point during the task, he and the ladder fell. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 14; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 37. Plaintiff injured his back. Id. ¶ 79; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 38. Plaintiff's back injury does not prevent him from working. Id. ¶ 80. But Plaintiff's back injury interferes with lifting (including his ladder) and standing or sitting for long periods of time, and it is difficult for him to sit for a long period of time because his leg will go numb. Id. ¶ 81.
Plaintiff was released to work on April 7, 2011 with temporary restrictions of no bending, lifting or twisting through May 1, 2011. Id. ¶ 17. Plaintiff's supervisor Jimmy Mann, and Mann's supervisor J. Michael Carter, conferred and decided they could accommodate Plaintiff's disability during that period. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 48. This position followed Article 8.06 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement governing Plaintiff's rights and Defendant's obligations, which stated that "an employee who has been determined to be permanently medically restricted is one who due to primary and physical or mental limitations is no longer able to perform the essential functions of his/her job with or without reasonable accommodations."  [*12] Id. ¶ 85.
When considering Jernigan's accommodation, Mann considered Plaintiff's good employee record. Id. ¶ 47. Indeed, so long as the restrictions remained temporary, Carter was willing to accommodate Plaintiff for up to 365 days from the date of Plaintiff's accident. Id. ¶ 95. Mann testified that there was no particular time limit to the temporary accommodation so long as the monthly report from Plaintiff's doctors continued to report that he was not permanently injured. Mann Dep. [46] at 82-83.
Mr. Carter did not know why the decision was made to accommodate temporary restrictions but not permanent ones. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 76. If Mann had been advised to continue accommodating Plaintiff, Mann would have followed such direction. Id. ¶ 90. When asked in his deposition whether Plaintiff was able to perform all of the essential tasks of the ST job while on his temporary restriction, Mann stated, "Yes. Light duty. Yes." Mann Dep. [46] at 93. When asked whether Defendant could have kept Plaintiff on under the same restrictions permanently, Mann testified, "We could have kept some work for him, yes, sir." Id. at 89-90. In other words, Mann agreed that Defendant "could" have kept accommodating  [*13] Plaintiff as it had done on a temporary basis, and Mann agreed that he viewed the temporary accommodation provided to Plaintiff as "reasonable." Id. at 58.3

Defendant's Refusal To Allow An ST To Remain On Permanent Light Duty
On May 4, 2011, the IDSC informed Mr. Mann that Plaintiff's restrictions of no lifting over 15 pounds and no overhead lifting over three pounds had become permanent. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 19. On June 1, 2011, after discussions with Carter and others, Mann met with Plaintiff to explore  [*14] Plaintiff's options given that Plaintiff's restrictions had been deemed permanent. Id. ¶ 21; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 79. Mann informed Plaintiff that the Department could not accommodate his restrictions in the ST position on a permanent basis. Id. ¶ 22.
According to Mann, Defendant would not create a permanent light duty-only version of the ST job because that would mean manually overriding the assignment system on a daily basis to ensure the Plaintiff was only dispatched to jobs he could perform. Id. ¶ 53. This was seen as unfair to the other STs, who would receive a disproportionally-higher percentage of heavy-duty, injury-prone jobs, such as the one in which Plaintiff suffered his injury. Id. at ¶ 54. It was also seen as a burden to assign jobs to Plaintiff at random, only to dispatch a second ST every time Mr. Jernigan had a job that required climbing a ladder, lifting a ladder, or climbing a pole. Id. ¶ 56. Particularly because the Union was involved, Mann felt he had to distribute the work fairly. Id. ¶ 89. In his view it was not a fair distribution of work to have other Technicians performing all the jobs requiring lifting, climbing and ladders on a permanent basis. Def. SOMF  [*15] [42-6] ¶ 90.

Defendant's Alternative Offer To Consider Plaintiff For Transfer To Vacancies In Light Duty Positions
Mann advised Jernigan that he would be processed under the Permanent Medical Restrictions ("PMR") process negotiated pursuant to Articles 8.06 and 7.01C of the CBA. Id. ¶ 24. Mann advised Jernigan that the Company would continue to accommodate him until he had met with human resources and been fully informed of all of his options. Id. ¶ 25.
BellSouth offers several options under the PMR process, some of which permit the employee to remain on payroll, and some of which permit the employee to exit payroll. Id. ¶ 27. Under the CBA, Plaintiff was permitted to rank positions from the Vacancy List, and he would have received priority consideration for vacancies at or below his current wage scale. Id. ¶ 30. Another option to remain on payroll under Article 7.01C of the CBA was the "Ready Taker" list. Id. ¶ 31. The "Ready Taker" list consists of employees, by title and wage scale equal to or lower than Mr. Jernigan's title, who had committed to take alternate pay to create a vacancy for employees who had either been surplused or received PMR notification, such as Mr. Jernigan. Id.  [*16] ¶ 32.
In advance of the July 1 meeting (described below), Plaintiff received a "Vacancy List" listing numerous vacancies in 12 separate positions. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 29. Of those 12 positions, only four were at or below his wage scale. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 106. Plaintiff also received a "Ready Taker List" in advance of the July 1, 2011 meeting that listed several positions in eight separate job categories at a Wage Scale 30 or below. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 33. Plaintiff relied upon the document listing jobs in the PMR package he received. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 120. BellSouth also provided Plaintiff with a Master Ranking Sheet, by which he could rank jobs he desired from either the Vacancy List or the Ready Taker List, as well as two optional job requests, which were offered independently of the Vacancy or Ready Taker List. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 41.
On July 1, 2011, Plaintiff participated in a conference call with Staffing Manager Sylvia Thomas, which Defendant states was for the purpose of explaining the PMR process. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff, however, disputes that Defendant explained the PMR process to him, and in particular disputes that Defendant explained the "Ready Taker" list, how to use it, and how  [*17] to place it on his Master Ranking Sheet. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 108.4
On July 5, 2011, Plaintiff submitted his Master Ranking Sheet, in which he ranked Electronic Technician and Multimedia Technician, which were on the Vacancy List, as his job preferences. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 42. Both the Electronic Technician and Multimedia Technician titles were, however, above Plaintiff's Wage Scale level and therefore he was not eligible under the PMR provisions of the CBA to transfer to those positions. Id. ¶ 43. Plaintiff did not list any of the jobs on the Ready Taker List or any of the jobs on the Vacancy List that were beneath his wage scale. Id. ¶ 44. There were four jobs on the Vacancy List at or below Plaintiff's wage scale for which he was eligible to apply, but he did not apply to those positions. Id; see also Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 106.
Plaintiff also elected on the Master Ranking List to participate in the Partnership  [*19] Job Bank, which was a program that allowed him to receive his full pay and benefits for 12 weeks while he applied for other jobs. Id. ¶ 47. Pursuant to the terms of the CBA, Plaintiff had to exhaust all accrued paid time off before being placed in the Job Bank. Id. ¶ 60. Plaintiff utilized his accrued time off between July 15, 2011 and July 30, 2011. Id. ¶ 61. Plaintiff was in the Job Bank from July 31, 2011 to October 22, 2011. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 62. During the time Plaintiff was in the Job Bank, he received the equivalent of his regular pay. Id. ¶ 63.

Alleged Female ST Comparators
Before his injury, Plaintiff assisted a female ST, Ms. Noah, in locating buried service wires, or making aerial connections. Id. ¶ 68. Plaintiff was asked to help Noah with buried service wires because he had more experience, not because of the physical requirements of the job. Id. ¶ 73. On two occasions when Plaintiff was dispatched on a "helping ticket" to help Ms. Noah on an aerial service, he used the ladder off of his truck. Id. ¶ 74. Plaintiff does not know about Ms. Noah's lifting capacities. Id. ¶ 75. Ms. Noah never complained to Carter or Mann that she needed help lifting. Id. ¶ 77. Ms. Noah is able  [*20] to lift her ladder without assistance. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 76.
Plaintiff assisted another female ST, Ms. Dixon, with aerial service tickets and buried service locations. Id. ¶ 69. Plaintiff also assisted Ms. Dixon with aerial drops. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 36. Plaintiff does not know if Ms. Dixon could lift a ladder. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 70. Ms. Dixon never complained to Carter or Mann that she needed help lifting. Id. ¶ 78. Neither Noah nor Dixon had permanent medical restrictions. Id. ¶ 65.
Plaintiff also provided assistance to male STs, Reggie, Dale and Bob, in locating buried service wires. Id. ¶ 71. Plaintiff was dispatched on helping tickets to provide assistance to make aerial connections for male Technicians. Id. ¶ 72.

II. DISCUSSION
A. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is warranted when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Burger King Corp. v. E-Z Eating, 41 Corp., 572 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir. 2009). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any  [*21] material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). Defendant carries this burden by showing the Court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In making its determination, the Court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must show specific facts demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
When considering motions for summary judgment, courts do not make decisions regarding the  [*22] merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are not. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. See id.
If a fact is material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. See id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 242. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead  [*23] a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
B. COUNT I: ADA DISCRIMINATION
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The statute forbids employers from discriminating against a "qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and  [*24] other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). Refusing to offer a reasonable accommodation to allow a disabled worker to perform the essential tasks of the job is a form of illegal discrimination under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5).
It is not disputed that Defendant refused to allow Plaintiff to remain in his ST position because of Plaintiff's medical restrictions. Nevertheless, to prevail on a failure-to-accommodate claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that he has a disability within the meaning of the statute and relevant regulations; (2) that he is an otherwise qualified individual, that is, that he could perform the essential tasks of his job with a reasonable accommodation; and (3) that he was discriminated against because of his disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow him to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226; Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996).
1.  [*25] Disability
Plaintiff must first demonstrate that he has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. Under the ADA, an individual with a "disability" is any person who: (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(g)(1); see also Harris, 102 F.3d at 519; Gordon, 100 F.3d at 911; Pritchard v. S. Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 1996). The regulations further define physical or mental impairment as including: (1) any physiological disorder or condition affecting one or more of several body systems, or (2) any mental or psychological disorder. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h); see also Gordon, 100 F.3d at 911.
Major life activities are defined as those basic activities that the average person in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty. See 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(i); McCollough, 929 F. Supp at 1496. They include activities such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2);  [*26] 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i); see also Chanda, 234 F.3d at 1222; McCollough, 929 F. Supp at 1496; Frix v. Fla. Tile Indus., Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1027, 1033 (N.D. Ga. 1997). Major life activities may also include sitting, standing, lifting, and reaching. See 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(i); Frix, 970 F. Supp at 1033.
The ADA was amended in 2008 pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act ("ADAAA"), Pub L. No. 110-325, to broaden the definition of disability. See McElwee v. Cnty. of Orange, 700 F.3d 635, 642 (2d Cir. 2012) (noting that Congress amended the ADA to provide that the definition of "disability" shall be construed broadly "to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter" and "[t]he term 'substantially limits' shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the [ADAAA].") (internal citations and quotations omitted); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i) ("The term 'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard.").
Plaintiff's lifting restrictions alone qualify under this broad definition of disability. Indeed, the  [*27] ADAAA regulations specifically include lifting as a major life activity for purposes of assessing coverage. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i). Moreover, even prior to the enactment of the ADAAA, many courts found lifting to be a major life activity. See Lowe's v. Angelo Italian Foods, Inc., 87 F.3d 1170, 1174 (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that a reasonable jury could conclude that a 15 pound lifting restriction constitutes a disability under the ADA and reversing grant of summary judgment based on District Court's contrary finding); Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2002) (lifting is a major life activity); Haysman v. Food Lion, Inc., 893 F. Supp. 1092, 1100 (S.D. Ga. 1995) (material issue of fact existed precluding summary judgment as to whether plaintiff was substantially limited where plaintiff could not lift more than 10-15 pounds); Martin v. Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space, No. C96-4620 FMS, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4258, 1998 WL 303089, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. April 1, 1998) (same for 10 pound restriction).
Defendant primarily cites Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220 (11th Cir. 1999), but that case pre-dated the ADAAA and is also inapposite. See Def. Brf. [42-1] at 13.  [*28] In Hilburn, the Eleventh Circuit assumed arguendo that the lifting restriction was a substantial limitation, then affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment because there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's "argument that she was subjected to unlawful discriminatory conduct . . . because of" that limitation. Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1228. This case does not bear on the question here.
Plaintiff has thus presented evidence that demonstrates that he is substantially limited in a major life activity, that is, at a minimum, lifting. Indeed, Plaintiff cannot lift more than 15 pounds at all and cannot engage in overhead lifting over three pounds. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 19. This limitation alone is sufficient to survive summary judgment as to the existence of a disability.5
2. Qualified Individual
A "qualified individual" is a disabled individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question during the relevant time period. See Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255; Chanda v. Engelhard/ICC, 234 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir. 2000); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994). Thus, employees must be able to meet all of a job's requirements in spite of any disability in order to establish a valid ADA claim. See Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979).
The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach to determining when a disabled person is otherwise qualified. See Jackson, 22 F.3d at 281 (Birch, J., dissenting); see also Sidaris v. Runyon, 967 F. Supp. 1260, 1266 (M.D. Ala. 1997). In the first step, the court determines if the plaintiff can perform the essential functions of the job in question. See Jackson, 22 F.3d at 281; Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266. If so, the plaintiff is  [*30] considered otherwise qualified for the position. See Jackson, 22 F.3d at 281; Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266. If not, the court must determine whether any reasonable accommodation by the employer would enable the employee to perform those functions so as to be considered qualified for the position. See Jackson, 22 F.3d at 281; Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266 (citations omitted); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 n.17.
a. Can Plaintiff Perform the Essential Functions of the Job?
Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Frix v. Fla. Tile Indus., Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1027, 1034 (N.D. Ga. 1997); Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266. Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: (1) the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000);  [*31] Frix, 970 F. Supp. at 1034.
In determining what functions of a given job are deemed to be essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment . . . and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citation omitted); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The regulations also state three factors that make it more likely that a specific duty is an essential function of the job: (1) the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed, and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the person holding the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular function. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii)).
It is not enough for an employer to merely label a function essential; the employer must instead actually require employees in the position at issue to perform those functions that the employer claims  [*32] are essential to the position. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266. Performing essential functions means that an employee is "able to perform those functions without risk of serious physical harm to oneself or others." Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266 (citing Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1126 (11th Cir. 1993)).
b. Is a Reasonable Accommodation Available?
If Plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of his position without a reasonable accommodation, he must make a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible, and that such an accommodation would enable him to perform those essential functions. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-1256; Jackson, 22 F.3d at 281 (citations omitted); see also Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3rd Cir. 1996).
If Plaintiff is able to meet this burden, Defendant must produce evidence of an affirmative defense that the accommodation requested is unreasonable or that it would cause an undue hardship on the employer. See Shiring, 90 F.3d at 831. Plaintiff, however, retains the burden at all times of identifying a reasonable accommodation that is available and demonstrating that the accommodation would  [*33] allow him to perform the essential functions of the job. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-1256; Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1527 (11th Cir. 1997); Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F.3d 446, 447 (11th Cir. 1996).
Determining what is reasonable for each individual employer is a highly fact-specific inquiry that will vary depending on the circumstances and necessities of each employment situation. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527. The regulations provide that an employer may restructure a job by reallocating or redistributing non-essential, marginal job functions, but is not required to reallocate essential functions. The essential functions are by definition those that the individual who holds the job would have to perform, with or without accommodation, in order to be considered qualified for the position. See 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(n); Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1527; Milton v. Scrivner, Inc., 53 F.3d 1118, 1124 (10th Cir. 1995) (an employer is not required to reallocate job duties in order to change the essential functions of a job); Larkins v. CIBA Vision Corp., 858 F. Supp. 1572, 1583 (N.D. Ga. 1994) (Evans, J.) (a reasonable accommodation does not require an employer to eliminate  [*34] the essential functions of a position). Thus, if the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the position with reasonable accommodations, the employer has no duty to eliminate the essential functions of the position or to hire someone else who can perform those functions for the employee.
c. Analysis
Plaintiff does not argue that any reasonable accommodation exists that would allow him to climb or lift. Nevertheless, he argues that he is a "qualified individual" because, he asserts, these tasks are non-essential parts of the job. See Pl. Resp. [51] at 15. Plaintiff thus argues that he would have been able to perform his duties as an ST with the reasonable accommodation that he be permanently excused from all climbing and lifting over 15 pounds.
In other words, as Plaintiff explained, he could continue his Service Technician duties as limited to: "basically light duty without having to lift any ladders or climbing. Everything I could pretty much do." Jernigan Dep. [45] at 46. He stated that Defendant could have accommodated this because "A majority of the jobs don't require lifting or climbing. And through the dispatch, the work management center, they could simply just  [*35] not put lifting or climbing in my dispatch, and I can pretty much do mostly all the jobs I would be dispatched on, which I did do during the period of time before this." Id.
Generally, it is not reasonable to require an employer to permanently excuse an employee from performing aspects of the job, redefining the job to exclude the functions he cannot perform, or reassigning those tasks to other employees. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260 ("[E]mployers are not required to transform the position into another one by eliminating functions that are essential to the nature of the job as it exists."); Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 819 (7th Cir. 2004) (employer need not alter employee's job such that he would be performing functions he could do, omitting other essential functions."). More specifically, employers are not required to modify an employee's existing medium- or heavy-duty position into exclusively light-duty work because of a lifting restriction. See, e.g., Richardson v. Friendly Ice Cream, 594 F.3d 69, 80-81 (1st Cir. 2010) (employer need not excuse a restaurant manager from necessary lifting on the basis of a shoulder injury and lifting restrictions); Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 620-21 (5th Cir. 1999).
On  [*36] the other hand, an employer may be required to excuse an employee's performance of marginal tasks not essential to the job function. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1260. The key question, therefore, is whether lifting and climbing are essential or marginal tasks for a Service Technician.
Here, the published qualifications of the Service Technician job include the requirement that Technicians be able to climb poles and ladders and lift up to 120 pounds. See Service Technician Job Description [43-6] at 2-3. This evidence weighs strongly in favor of a finding that these tasks are essential, though it must be viewed along with all of the other evidence in the record.
Plaintiff principally relies on the testimony of his supervisors, Mann and Carter. According to Plaintiff, supervisor Mann testified that Plaintiff was performing all essential tasks of the job during his light duty temporary period. See Pl. Resp. [51] at 8 ("Mann testified that Jernigan was able to perform the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodations."). Plaintiff argues that Defendant's failure to accommodate in the face of this admission is "direct" evidence of discrimination. Id.
What Mann said, however, was  [*37] different, and does not show lifting and climbing to be non-essential. When asked whether Plaintiff could perform all required tasks while on his temporary accommodation, Mann stated "Yes. Light duty, yes." Mann Dep. [46] at 93. In other words, under his light duty restriction, Plaintiff performed the subset of jobs specially selected for him during that period. Plaintiff himself stated "I can pretty much do mostly all the jobs I would be dispatched [for]," while on his light duty restriction, because Defendant did "not put lifting or climbing in my dispatch . . ." Jernigan Dep. [45] at 112 (emphasis added).
That Plaintiff could perform all tasks assigned to him under his light duty restriction—which is what the cited testimony from Mann states—does not mean that lifting and climbing are non-essential parts of the job. It simply means that Defendant chose to temporarily excuse Plaintiff from lifting and climbing while his injury was potentially recoverable and that Plaintiff performed the light duty tasks assigned. Similarly, when asked whether Defendant could have extended the light duty restriction permanently, Mann stated "[w]e could have kept some work for him, yes, sir." Mann Dep.  [*38] [46] at 90-91. In other words, Plaintiff could do "some work," and could have been kept busy doing just that work specially kept for him. This does not, however, suggest that Plaintiff could perform the full range of tasks expected of a ST. If anything, the need to specially set aside "some work" for Plaintiff shows just the opposite.
Carter and Mann also stated that so long as the injury remained temporary, they were willing to accommodate Plaintiff for up to 365 days from the date of his accident, if not indefinitely. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 95. But that Defendant was willing to "keep some work" for Plaintiff while his condition was potentially recoverable, even for an extended period, is no admission that this restriction would be reasonable permanently, or that lifting and climbing are non-essential. It simply shows that Defendant made a decision to accommodate Plaintiff with light duty while he might recover, and to cease that accommodation and offer other options when it was clear he would not.
Plaintiff's reliance on Defendant's willingness and ability to provide temporary light-duty restrictions has been clearly rejected by the Eleventh Circuit. See Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003)  [*39] ("prior accommodations do not make an accommodation reasonable."); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997) ("In this case there appears to be little doubt that, for quite some time and perhaps with relatively minor disruption or inconvenience, the City of Alpharetta was able to accommodate Holbrook with respect to those essential functions he concedes he cannot perform without assistance. It is equally apparent, however, that the City of Alpharetta's previous accommodation may have exceeded that which the law requires. We do not seek to discourage other employers from undertaking the kinds of accommodations of a disabled employee as those performed by the City of Alpharetta in Holbrook's case; indeed, it seems likely that the City retained a productive and highly competent employee based partly on its willingness to make such accommodations. However, we cannot say that the City's decision to cease making those accommodations that pertained to the essential functions of Holbrook's job was violative of the ADA."); McCullough v. Atlanta Beverage Co., 929 F. Supp. 1489, 1503 (N.D. Ga. 1996) ("To the extent that plaintiff may be arguing that because defendant  [*40] once allowed plaintiff to perform light duties it is forever bound to allow plaintiff to perform such functions, neither the law nor sound policy considerations favor such a construction.").6
Plaintiff finds stronger footing by focusing on the frequency with which lifting and climbing are required. Plainly, there is a factual dispute on this question. Plaintiff states that, before his injury, he lifted items, and climbed poles or ladders less than 10 percent of the time. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 8. He cites testimony that service technicians would need to lift a 40-50 pound item on average  [*41] approximately once a week for about 10-15 minutes. Id. ¶ 16. Generally, as noted above, the lack of frequency of a task may be considered as evidence that it is non-essential. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(iii) (evidence of whether a function is essential includes amount of time spent on the job performing the function).
However, in this case, it is undisputed that although lifting and climbing are not required on most jobs, some jobs require these tasks. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 87. Moreover, the need for lifting can arise "at any time." Id. ¶ 88; Mann Decl. [43-12] ¶ 19. Thus, a major reason why STs are expected to be able to lift "up to" 120 pounds is so that they can perform jobs without delay even when a need arises unexpectedly and when assistance is unavailable. See id. While a technician could request assistance through a "helper ticket," other technicians may be busy, thereby necessitating a wait for assistance. Id.7
Plaintiff's proposed accommodation would therefore have forced Defendant to do one of three things: (1) send a helper along with him on every job in case the need arose; (2)  [*43] send Plaintiff alone, and risk delay of customer jobs; or (3) continue to manually override the assignment system to send him out on the subset of light-only jobs he performed while on temporary accommodation, including pulling dead wires from boxes. The ADA does not require employers to be put in such a position. See Bryant v. Caritas Norwood Hosp., 345 F. Supp. 2d 155, 170 (D. Mass. 2004) ("Pursuant to the accommodation sought by Bryant, either Bryant would have been excused entirely from one of the essential components of the Staff Nurse position (i.e., 'heavy lifting') or Caritas would have been placed in the untenable position of having to assign another staff member to stand by Bryant's side, ready, willing, and able to assist her with heavy lifting should the need arise. Neither solution is a reasonable one and, singly or together, they fail [to establish a triable issue of fact as to the denial of a reasonable accommodation]."); Gratzl v. Office of Chief Judges of 12th, 18th, 19th, and 22nd Judicial Circuits, 601 F.3d 674, 680 (7th Cir. 2010) (ADA does not require an employer to create a new job or strip a current job of essential duties to accommodate a disabled employee,  [*44] nor is there any duty to reassign an employee to a permanent light duty position); Buskirk v. Apollo Metals, 307 F.3d 160, 169 (3rd Cir. 2002) (employer not required to transform a temporary light-duty position into a permanent position); Allen v. Ga. Power Co., 980 F. Supp. 470, 478 (N.D. Ga. 1997) ("numerous courts have held that where an employer does not have a permanent 'light duty' position, it is not required to create one or convert a temporary 'light duty' position into a permanent one" to accommodate an employee's disability).
Moreover, the ADA also does not require, as Plaintiff demands, that Defendant disproportionally shift Plaintiff's share of the more physically-strenuous and/or dangerous parts of the job to others. See Dropinski v. Douglas Cnty., 298 F.3d 704, 710 (8th Cir. 2002); Buskirk, 307 F.3d at 169; Allen, 980 F. Supp. at 478. Although climbing and heavy lifting may not be constantly required, it is significant that Plaintiff himself suffered his injury while climbing. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 14. Defendant is not required to create two classes of STs, that is, those able to perform these more dangerous tasks and those who are not. Indeed, Defendant cites testimony  [*45] that no other STs are in a permanent light duty position. See Def. Brf. [42-1] at 21.8 Plaintiff's accommodation, therefore, would essentially result in a newly-created position filled only by himself. This, again, is not what the ADA demands.
Thus, that lifting and climbing may not arise in the "majority" of jobs, Jernigan Dep. [45] at 112, does not refute Defendant's business decision reflected in the written job description that these tasks are nevertheless essential. The essential nature arises not from the frequency of lifting and climbing, but from the fact  [*46] that the need for either activity can arise "at any time," involves more danger, and can cause a delay if a Technician cannot perform it. Plaintiff does not rebut these key facts.
Defendant aptly cites to Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1522, which binds this Court. In Holbrook, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment for an employer police department, and in doing so found that a visually-impaired police officer could not perform certain essential functions such as collecting certain kinds of evidence from a crime scene. See id. at 1527. The officer argued that these functions were not essential, as evidence showed that his limitations would only rarely impact an investigation, and in such an event other officers could handle that aspect of the investigation. See id. Thus, like Plaintiff here, the officer argued that he should be permitted to remain on the job excused from these infrequent responsibilities. See id.
The Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument as a matter of law. It was undisputed that Officer Holbrook could not perform a full investigation as expected of Alpharetta police officers, and the Court found that it was unreasonable to demand that the City either excuse  [*47] him from certain types of crime scene investigations, or task other officers to always be on call to help. See id. The Court noted that the problem might arise infrequently, but also found, as Defendant establishes here, that the need to collect evidence might arise at any time. See id.; see also Scott-Bolton v. Ala. Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, No. 7:12-cv-0800-LSC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40942, 2013 WL 1282344, at *6-9 (N.D. Ala. March 25, 2013) (granting summary judgment in ADA case where probation officer could not make arrests because, even though officer made just 20 such arrests in four years, it was impossible to know when such situations would arise, and the ability to make such arrests was an essential function of the job).9
Plaintiff cites instead to Skerski v. Time Warner Cable, 257 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 2001). See Pl. Resp. [51] at 19. In Skerski, the plaintiff was a cable installer who suffered from a diagnosed fear of heights and therefore could not climb poles. See id. at 275. For three and a half years after his diagnosis, his employer shifted his responsibilities to only cover below-ground repair work. See id. at 276. At some point, Plaintiff was transferred to another supervisor, who decided not to keep this accommodative restriction. See id. The Third Circuit found that issues of fact precluded summary judgment on the question of whether climbing was an "essential" part of plaintiff's job, based primarily on the fact that the employer accommodated him with underground work for  [*49] three and half years after diagnosis. See id. at 281-283.
Clearly, there are factual similarities with this case, as both plaintiffs are telecommunications technicians who are supposed to, but cannot, climb. On the whole, however, the undersigned finds Skerki to be of limited assistance. First, the Third Circuit in that case placed major reliance on the employer's three and half years of accommodating the plaintiff's restrictions post-diagnosis. See id. at 283. Based on those facts, the court seemed to conclude that the employer may have effectively created a new, restricted position for the plaintiff, knowing plaintiff's condition, and then rescinded it. Those facts do not remotely compare to the instant case. Defendant restricted Plaintiff to light duty for three months before shifting him out of Service Technician work. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 44. It had always been explained that this accommodation would be temporary.
Second, applying Skerki's logic in this case, based on only three months' worth of temporary accommodations, would run afoul of controlling Eleventh Circuit guidance. The Eleventh Circuit in Wood, Holbrook and elsewhere has made clear that "prior accommodations do not make  [*50] an accommodation reasonable." Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314.
Third, other facts distinguish Skerski from this case. In Skerski, the plaintiff offered evidence that the employer knew when assigning tasks which jobs would require climbing and which would not. See Skerski, 257 F.3d at 277. Here, by contrast, Defendant has offered an undisputed fact that the need for climbing poles and ladders, while perhaps infrequent, could arise "at any time." Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 88.10
Thus, for all of these reasons, Plaintiff cannot establish that he is a qualified individual. In other words, he cannot perform the essential tasks of his job even with an accommodation. For these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment [42] be GRANTED as to Count I and that this Count be DISMISSED.
3. Failure to Accommodate
If, as the undersigned finds, lifting and climbing are essential tasks for a ST, then the ADA requires no accommodation. Assuming, arguendo, that this finding were not adopted, the question would remain whether Defendant unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff on account of his disability. Plaintiff argues that Defendant did so by failing to offer him a reasonable accommodation. See Pl. Resp. [51] at 16-22; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5) (prohibiting discrimination on  [*52] the basis of disability, including "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.").
It is undisputed that Defendant failed to accommodate Plaintiff in the way that Plaintiff requested, that is, by offering him a permanent, light-duty modified Service Technician position. However, Defendant argues that it satisfied any obligation it had to accommodate by offering opportunities to transfer to other positions. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) ("'reasonable accommodation' may include . . . reassignment to a vacant position."). Indeed, "an employer is not required to give an employee the best accommodation or the accommodation requested by the employee, so long as the accommodation made is reasonable." Zimmerman v. Gen. Motors, Delphi Energy & Engine Mgmt. Sys., 959 F. Supp. 1393, 1398 (D. Kan. 1997); see also Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., 661 F.3d 216, 224 (5th Cir. 2011) (ADA provides a right to a reasonable accommodation,  [*53] not a right to the employee's preferred accommodation); Zamudio v. Patla, 956 F. Supp. 803, 809 (N.D. Ill. 1997) ("An employee is not entitled to a particular reasonable accommodation.").
Specifically, Defendant offered Plaintiff the opportunity to transfer to other positions within the company already designated as light duty. First, it is undisputed that, under the Collective Bargaining Agreement to which he was a party, Plaintiff had the right to choose any positions at or below his current pay scale listed on a "Ready Taker List," which consisted of jobs for which he could "bump" the existing employees. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶¶ 31-32. Second, Defendant was also entitled under the CBA to priority consideration in applying for vacancies of any positions at or below his current pay scale. Id. ¶¶ 29-30; Thomas Decl. [43-15], Ex. A [43-16]. Both the Ready Taker and Vacancy Lists Plaintiff was provided included several positions for which he was eligible to apply for, or transfer to, on a priority basis. Id. at ¶¶ 29-32; Thomas Decl. [43-15], Ex. B [43-17]. It is undisputed that Plaintiff failed to apply for transfer to any of the eligible positions. Id. at ¶ 44.
Although Plaintiff acknowledges  [*54] that he received these lists and possessed the rights described by Defendant under his CBA, he asserts that Defendant never specifically explained these options and procedures to him. See Pl. Resp. [51] at 7. Moreover, of the four positions on the Vacancy List below his wage scale, "none were located in an area to which I could have commuted because of my medical restrictions." Jernigan Decl. [51-1] ¶ 7.
A review of the Vacancy List and Ready Taker List provided to Plaintiff shows that the only available non-ST positions were below Plaintiff's then-current pay grade of 30. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 12; Thomas Decl. [43-15], Exs. A [43-16] & B [43-17]. To the extent Plaintiff chose a position that otherwise paid a lower wage than he currently received, his then-current salary would be protected pursuant to the CBA, but only for 30 weeks. Thomas Decl. [43-15] ¶¶ 5, 6. This reduction in salary alone creates a material issue of fact as to whether the opportunities to transfer were reasonable. A transfer to a vacant position satisfies a duty to accommodate as a matter of law if it does not require a significant reduction in pay and benefits. See Shannon v. Verizon New York, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 2d 304, 309 (N.D.N.Y. 2007)  [*55] (to be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, the alternative positions must be equivalent in salary, status and benefits to the employee's regular job); cf. Robert v. Carter, 819 F. Supp. 2d 832, 848 (S.D. Ind. 2011) (generally, offering an employee a different position with substantially the same salary and benefits is a reasonable accommodation under the ADA).
Here, the logical inference is that, within just 30 weeks after transfer, Plaintiff would face a reduction in pay. Defendant cites no legal authority for how such a limited offer of salary protection qualifies as a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual as a matter of law. Put another way, this is a subject on which a reasonable jury could disagree, thereby making summary judgment inappropriate. Thus, to the extent the District Court declines to adopt the undersigned's findings on the threshold question of whether Plaintiff is "qualified" under the ADA, Defendant's Motion [42] should be denied as to Count I because triable issues of fact exist as to all other elements of the claim.
C. COUNT II
Plaintiff in Count II alleges that Defendant retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity under the ADA. Specifically,  [*56] Plaintiff alleges that he "engaged in protected activity . . . by (1) requesting a reasonable accommodation for his disabilities and by (2) continuing to request that accommodation." Complaint [1] ¶ 58. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated by terminating Plaintiff for that protected activity. Id. ¶ 59.
"In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, . . . [Plaintiff] must show (1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). Once an employee does so, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. See de la Cruz v. Children's Trust of Miami-Dade Cnty., 843 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1281 (S.D. Fla. 2012). "If the defendant employer offers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer's alleged nondiscriminatory reason was pretext for retaliation." Id.
1. Prima Facie case
a. Protected Activity
A plaintiff engages  [*57] in statutorily protected activity in requesting an ADA accommodation if he "had a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he was entitled to those accommodations under the ADA." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328. Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff received a temporary accommodation upon his return to work in April 2011. He also requested that he be allowed to remain "light duty without having to lift any ladders or climbing." Jernigan Dep. [45] at 46. Defendant makes no argument that this request fails to qualify as "protected activity" under the ADA, and the Court finds that it does. Plaintiff has thus satisfied the first element.
b. Adverse Employment Action
To establish an adverse employment action under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable person in his position would view the employment action as materially adverse. See Doe v. Dekalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1452-1453 (11th Cir. 1998).
Plainly, termination is an adverse action. Plaintiff argues that he was effectively terminated when Defendant decided not to extend his light-duty accommodations permanently. See Pl. Resp. [51] at 17. Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not terminated, and in fact remained  [*58] on the payroll pursuant to the voluntary Job Bank program through October 2011. See Def. Reply [54] at 8-9. In the meantime, Plaintiff was offered opportunities to transfer to other positions, but declined. Thus, according to Defendant, Plaintiff voluntarily ended his employment with Defendant and thus was not terminated.
The Court must view the facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. The prima facie factors in employment actions are also not to be applied strictly. In that regard, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that a reasonable jury could find that he suffered an adverse employment action. As noted above, Plaintiff was not permitted to remain as a Service Technician on light duty. This change effectively terminated Plaintiff's ability to remain at the company in this position.
Of course, Plaintiff was not terminated in the traditional sense because Defendant offered him other options to remain on payroll and opportunities to transfer to other positions. However, as explained above, none of the options Defendant offered provided an equivalent wage, and the CBA only protected Plaintiff's existing wage for 30 weeks. Thus, a reasonable jury could see  [*59] any of the transfer options as demotions because, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, they all involved lower salary after the 30 week protection period. In other words, while it may not have been put this way at the time, a jury could see Plaintiff as being offered the choice of either termination or demotion. That Plaintiff took advantage of the Job Bank program under the CBA to mitigate the financial impact of what was effectively his termination did not make his exit voluntary. On this basis, the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfies the adverse employment action element.
c. Causal Link
To prove the causal connection required to state a claim for ADA retaliation, Plaintiff need only show "that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated." Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal citation and quotations omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has "held that a plaintiff satisfies this element if he provides sufficient evidence that the decision-maker became aware of the protected conduct, and that there was close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse employment action." Id.; see also Davidson v. Midelfort Clinic, Ltd., 133 F.3d 499, 511 (7th Cir. 1998)  [*60] (five-month gap between protected activity and termination insufficient to establish causal connection as required for ADA retaliation claim); Moore v. Hillsborough Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, 544 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 1309 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (same for four-month gap); Kimbrough v. Cincinnati Ass'n for Blind and Visually Impaired, No. 1:12-CV-342, 986 F. Supp. 2d 904, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173295, 2013 WL 6493533, at *14 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 10, 2013); cf. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (three- to four-month disparity between protected expression and adverse action not enough to establish causation element of Title VII retaliation claim).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to fulfill this requirement because of the roughly four-month interval between Plaintiff making his requested accommodation in May or June 2011 and his removal from Defendant's payroll in October 2011. See Def. Brf. [42-1] at 24-25. That gap, Defendant argues, "severs any causal connection." Id. at 25. Plaintiff responds that "Within days of being notified that Jernigan requested a permanent accommodation, BellSouth stated it could no longer accommodate Jernigan's restrictions." Pl. Resp. [51] at 24. Plaintiff thus argues that "[t]he  [*61] temporal proximity between Jernigan's requested accommodation and the actual adverse employment action he experienced supports the causal connection between his protected activity and his termination." Id.
Again, the Court finds that Defendant applies the prima facie factors too restrictively. While Plaintiff did not ultimately leave the payroll until October 2011, he was effectively terminated as a ST—and presented with the leave-or-be-demoted option—when his request for a permanent accommodation was denied. While not an immediate termination, that was the point at which Plaintiff was effectively told that his employment was ending unless he chose a demotion. His continuation on the payroll for a few months longer came by operation of defined, short-term remedies under the CBA. But the adverse action that led to the need to depart (or chose a demotion) was made when his request was denied—or at least a jury could so find. Thus, a prima facie inference of causation exists.
2. Defendant's Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Although Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, that does not end the Court's inquiry. Defendant argues that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory  [*62] reason for acting as it did, namely, Plaintiff's inability to perform the essential functions of his job. See Def. Brf. [42-1] at 25. For the reasons stated at length above, the Court agrees. Here, the Court has already found that Plaintiff's lifting and climbing restrictions prevented him from performing all essential tasks as a Service Technician. These duties were stated in the ST job description long before Plaintiff became injured and requested an accommodation. Defendant also points to evidence that its refusal to permanently excuse Plaintiff from these functions flowed from the CBA, which also was in place prior to Plaintiff's injury. Defendant, in other words, shows evidence that it treated Plaintiff consistently with the employment contract and job description and because of the fundamental reason that Plaintiff could not perform all required tasks. These are legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for refusing the permanent accommodation and effectively telling Plaintiff he must either leave or accept less pay in a job he could perform.
Plaintiff argues that he may prevail on a retaliation claim even if his underlying ADA claim fails, see Pl. Resp. [51] at 23. This is, of course,  [*63] true as a legal proposition. But to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must point to evidence showing that Defendant's proffered reasons were a pretext for retaliation. Plaintiff does not attempt to do so. Plaintiff's argument appears to be that Defendant's application of the CBA and job description here resulted in a failure-to-reasonably-accommodate, because while Plaintiff could not perform duties articulated in the job description, a jury should declare those tasks non-essential. Even if Plaintiff were to prevail on this theory under Count I, this does not establish that Defendant's reliance on its established job qualifications and requirements was pretext. Even if the requested accommodation should have been given, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that Plaintiff was retaliated against for the request. Simply denying a requested accommodation is not itself retaliation, at least without additional facts. Plaintiff offers no evidence on this question and summary judgment in Defendants favor should be entered on Count II. The undersigned therefore RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion[42] be GRANTED as to Count II and that this Count be DISMISSED.
D. COUNT III
Plaintiff in  [*64] Count III alleges that Defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., by "routinely" allowing assistance to female STs with regard to lifting while not allowing Plaintiff a similar accommodation. Complaint [1] ¶¶ 61-62. Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [42] as to this Count. Plaintiff's silence means that Plaintiff concedes this issue and thereby abandons his claim in Count III. See LR 7.1(B) (failure to file a response to a motion "shall indicate that there is no opposition to the motion"); see also Tucker v. City of Florence, Ala., 765 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1333 (N.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Norelus v. Denny's, Inc., 628 F.3d 1270, 1296-1297 (11th Cir. 2010)) (summary judgment due to be granted on Plaintiff's abuse of process claims because Plaintiff "marshaled no argument whatsoever to counter defendants' arguments" in that regard); Welch v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 978 F. Supp. 1133, 1137 (N.D. Ga. 1997) (Defendant entitled to summary judgment on Title VII hostile work environment claim because Plaintiff's response brief failed to address Defendant's statute of limitations argument); cf. Bancoult v. McNamara, 227 F. Supp. 2d 144, 149 (D.D.C. 2002)  [*65] (if party opposing motion to dismiss files a responsive memorandum, but fails to address arguments the movant makes, court may treat those arguments as conceded, even where the result is dismissal of the entire case).
Nevertheless, the Court will outline the legal standards and briefly discuss the evidence established by Defendant's motion.
1. Legal Standard
Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).
To prevail on a Title VII discrimination claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. See Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 980-981 (11th Cir. 1989); Clark v. Huntsville City Bd. of Educ., 717 F.2d 525, 529 (11th Cir. 1983). Such discriminatory intent may be established either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence meeting the four-pronged test set out for Title VII cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 792. See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561-62 (11th Cir. 1997); Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comm., 738 F.2d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1984).
Evidence  [*66] that merely "suggests discrimination, leaving the trier of fact to infer discrimination based on the evidence" is, by definition, circumstantial. Earley, 907 F.2d at 1081-82. Because direct evidence of discrimination is seldom available, Title VII plaintiffs typically rely on circumstantial evidence to prove discriminatory intent using the framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 792, and Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1561-62 (11th Cir. 1997); Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1527-1528 (11th Cir. 1997). Under that framework, a plaintiff must prove that (1) they belong to a protected class; (2) they were subjected to an adverse job action; (3) their employer treated similarly-situated, non-protected employees more favorably; and (4) they were qualified for their job. See Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562.
A plaintiff who fulfills these elements creates an inference of discriminatory intent and thus carries their initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see also Jones v. Bessemer Carraway Med. Ctr., 137 F.3d 1306, 1310, reh'g  [*67] denied and opinion superseded in part, 151 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir. 1998); Combs, 106 F.3d at 1527. Demonstrating a prima facie case is not onerous; it requires only that the plaintiff establish facts adequate to permit an inference of discrimination. See Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310-1311; Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54.
Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must "articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Jones, 137 F.3d at 1310. If the defendant is able to carry this burden and explain its rationale, the plaintiff, as with the retaliation analysis, must then show that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54; Perryman v. Johnson Prods. Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983).
A prima facie case along with sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation is generally all that is needed to permit a finding of intentional discrimination. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); see also St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); Combs, 106 F.3d at 1529. However,  [*68] summary judgment for the employer may still be appropriate in some circumstances, even if plaintiff produced evidence refuting the employer's proffered explanation if the record "conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason" motivated the decision. Alvarez v. Royal Atl., Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148).
2. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
a. Protected Class
Plaintiff's male gender places him a protected class. See Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U.S. 669, 682, 103 S. Ct. 2622, 77 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1983) ("Male as well as female employees are protected against discrimination" under Title VII.); Brill v. Lante Corp., 119 F.3d 1266, 1270 (all men and women are members of a protected class, as required to support sex discrimination claims under Title VII); Williams v. Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., 947 F. Supp. 2d 1234, 2013 WL 2249078, at *12 (N.D. Ala. 2013) ("In this case Mr. Williams was a member of a protected class because he was male . . .") (citing Newport News, 462 U.S. at 682).
b. Adverse Job Action
To rise to the level of an actionable Title VII claim, employment decisions must work a material alteration on the terms of employment, as opposed  [*69] to being merely trivial annoyances. See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001) ("Whatever the benchmark, it is clear that to support a claim under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause the employer's action must impact the 'terms, conditions, or privileges' of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way"); accord Gawley v. Indiana Univ., 276 F.3d 301, 314 (7th Cir. 2001). Defendant's motion does not argue that Plaintiff failed to suffer an adverse job action. As discussed above, the Court has already found that Plaintiff has suffered an adverse job action in the form of being terminated from his ST position and being forced to choose leaving the company or accepting a demotion.
c. Disparate Treatment
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot identify any similarly-situated individuals outside of his class—namely, women—whom Defendant treated better than it did Plaintiff. Plaintiff does not respond. The undersigned agrees that summary judgment is warranted on this ground.
Plaintiff's Complaint [1] alleges that two female STs, Ms. Noah and Ms. Dixon, are similarly-situated persons outside of his protected class whom Defendant treated better than it did Plaintiff  [*70] with regard to lifting. See Cmplt. [1] ¶¶ 61-62. "When evaluating an allegation of disparate treatment," courts "require that a comparator be similarly-situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects." Stone & Webster Constr. v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, 684 F.3d 1127, 1135 (11th Cir. 2012) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Indeed, the comparator employee "must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004).
Plaintiff assisted Ms. Noah in locating buried service wires, or making aerial connections. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 68. Defendant has submitted facts that Plaintiff was asked to help Noah with buried service wires because he had more experience, not because of the physical requirements of the job. Id. ¶ 73. On two occasions when Plaintiff was dispatched on a "helper ticket" to help Ms. Noah on an aerial service, he used the ladder off of his truck. Id. ¶ 74. The ladder STs utilize weighed approximately 40 pounds. Id. ¶ 8. Ms. Noah is able to lift her ladder without assistance. Id. ¶ 76. Moreover, Noah never complained to Supervisors Carter or  [*71] Mann that she needed help lifting. Id. ¶ 77.
Plaintiff assisted Ms. Dixon with aerial service tickets and buried service locations. Id. ¶ 69. Plaintiff also assisted Ms. Dixon with aerial drops. Pl. SOMF [53] ¶ 36. Plaintiff does not know if Ms. Dixon could lift a ladder. Def. SOMF [42-6] ¶ 70. Ms. Dixon never complained to Carter or Mann that she needed help lifting. Id. ¶ 78.
As noted, Plaintiff does not respond with any facts or legal argument on the question of whether Ms. Noah or Ms. Dixon are proper comparators. The Court finds based on the undisputed facts Defendant submitted that they are not. There is no indication that these women were permanently restricted from lifting more than 15 pounds, or suffered any of Plaintiff's other restrictions and were allowed to work a modified light duty Service Technician position.
d. Qualified for Job
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that he was qualified for his job because Plaintiff cannot fulfill the "objective qualifications for the Technician position . . ." Def. Brf. [42-1] at 5. Again, Plaintiff fails to address this argument, thus conceding the issue. Regardless, the undersigned agrees with Defendant for all the reasons explained  [*72] above. As explained at length above, Plaintiff cannot perform all tasks expected of a ST. Therefore, he is not qualified. For these reasons, then, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment [42] be GRANTED as to Count IIII and that this Count be DISMISSED.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons stated above, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion [42] be GRANTED as to Counts I, II and III.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 31st day of January, 2014.
