Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Aiesha Callahan originally filed this action pro se on October 19, 2018. After counsel entered an appearance on her behalf, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint [15] on January 27, 2019.1 Plaintiff claims that her employer, Emory Healthcare, Inc. ("Defendant" or "EHC"), discriminated against her on the basis of a disability, and retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. Plaintiff also claims that EHC violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq., and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq.
The action is before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [71], Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78], and Plaintiff's [*2]  "Objections to Defendant's Reply Brief in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment" [87] ("Objection"). For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [71] be DENIED, that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims. The undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Objection [87] be OVERRULED.

I. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT2
A. Facts
1. Legal Standards for Identifying Issues of Fact
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from "Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment" [78-26] ("Def. SMF"), Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment [84-3] ("Pl. Resp. SMF"), and their associated exhibits. As indicated and as needed for clarity, the Court may also draw some facts directly from other material in the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
In this District, Local Rule 56.1B explains the requirements imposed [*3]  on each party in asserting and opposing motions for summary judgment. Local Rule 56.1B(1) first explains that to present a proper motion for summary judgment, the moving party must include a statement of the material facts that it contends are undisputed:
A movant for summary judgment shall include with the motion and brief a separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried. Each material fact must be numbered separately and supported by a citation to evidence proving such fact. The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (b) supported by a citation to a pleading rather than to evidence; (c) stated as an issue or legal conclusion; or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's statement of undisputed facts.
LR 56.1B(1), NDGa.
Local Rule 56.1B(2)(a)(2) then makes clear that the non-movant must respond to these facts or they will be deemed admitted:
This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states [*4]  a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set out in LR 56.1B.(1).
LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa.
The respondent to a summary judgment motion must include such responses on an individually numbered basis, with a separate and precise response individually addressed to every one of the movant's statements of fact that the respondent intends to dispute. LR 56.1B(2)(a)(1), NDGa. The Local Rules are clear, moreover, that when the respondent intends to refute the movant's fact, the respondent must support such refutations with "specific citations to evidence." LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2)(i), NDGa.
The Eleventh Circuit has held that a failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1 is not a "mere technicality," because "[t]he rule is designed to help the court identify and organize the issues in the case." Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008)). "Local Rule 56.1 protects judicial resources by 'mak[ing] the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge.'" Reese, 527 F.3d at 1268 (internal quotes and citation omitted); see also Libel v. Adventure Lands of America, Inc., 482 F.3d 1028, 1032 (8th Cir. 2007) ("Courts have neither the duty nor the time to investigate the record in search of an unidentified genuine [*5]  issue of material fact to support a claim or defense.").
Thus, it is each party's obligation to cite to evidence in the record that establishes a triable issue of fact, and the Court cannot cull through the entire record in an effort to search for evidence that creates a disputed issue. See United States v. Adkinson, 135 F.3d 1363, 1378-1380 (11th Cir. 1998); Johnson v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 126 F.3d 1372, 1373 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Dickson v. Amoco Performance Products, Inc., 845 F.Supp. 1565, 1570 (N.D. Ga. 1994) ("It should be the party's responsibility to direct the court's attention separately to each portion of the record which supports each of the party's distinct arguments.").
Although Plaintiff is proceeding in this case without the benefit of counsel, her pro se status3 does not excuse her from the obligation to follow the same procedural rules as other litigants. See Moon v. Newsome, 863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir. 1989) (a pro se litigant "is subject to the relevant law and rules of court, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure"); see also Aning v. Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass'n, 663 F. App'x 773, 776 (11th Cir. 2016) (pro se parties are required to follow Local Rule 56.1 because it is an "ordinary procedural rule of civil litigation"). The Local Rules are clear that the Court must deem the movant's facts to be admitted unless the respondent files a proper response or objection disputing each fact. LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa.
Plaintiff has not complied with these rules and has generally failed to provide a proper response to Defendant's [*6]  assertions of fact. Although Plaintiff filed a Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts [84-3], many of Plaintiff's purported responses to Defendant's facts do not clearly state whether Plaintiff is disputing or admitting Defendant's fact, and also do not include citations to evidence in the record reflecting a genuine dispute of Defendant's facts.
In nearly every instance, Plaintiff has also only conclusorily stated that Defendant's citations do not support the asserted fact. Nearly all of Plaintiff's responses also include similar, boilerplate arguments, which label essentially the entirety of Defendant's assertions as "hearsay," and repeat the following nonsensical and legally meritless statement:
Plaintiff also objects, because her deposition citation does not support this fact and she did not make this exact statement (25) times at all on each of the (25) lines, from each page of the deposition transcript, which is comprised of (25) lines per page. The court may consider this fact and Plaintiff's response for ruling on parties cross-motions.
See, e.g., Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 1. Plaintiff also objects to several asserted facts with the shotgun statement, "this fact together [*7]  with the following facts at No: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 18; 20; 21; 26; 27; 30; 32; 35; 48; 87; 88 and 89, are all contradictory." Id.
As an illustration of the careful analysis undertaken by the Court as to each of the asserted facts material to these motions, the Court will discuss in detail Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's fact No. 1, below. Much of Plaintiff's objections and arguments asserted in response to this fact are verbatim duplicative of or highly similar to the majority of the other responses.
Defendant's very first assertion of fact is that "Defendant's employees who take FMLA leave for their own serious health condition are required to provide a letter from their physician indicating that they are fit for duty in their prior position with no restrictions." Def. SMF at ¶ 1; De Gennaro Dec. [78-13] at ¶ 10; Pl. Dep. [82] at 36. In Plaintiff's response to this fact, she states:
OBJECTION, because this fact together with the following facts at No: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 18; 20; 21; 26; 27; 30; 32; 35; 48; 87; 88 and 89, are all contradictory. Plaintiff also objects because the citation DeGennaro Dec. ¶ 10, does not support this fact, because this fact implies that all employees are [*8]  not allowed to return if they provide a letter from their physician indicating that they have restrictions. Plaintiff also objects, because this fact is a hearsay summary conclusion and inadmissible evidence in accordance with Fed. R. Evid. 802, because Defendant is testifying on behalf of all EHC employees who take FMLA leaves for their own serious health condition (not their own and/or their families serious health conditions, which is the premise of FMLA LAW). Plaintiff also objects, because her deposition citation does not support this fact and she did not make this exact statement (25) times at all on each of the (25) lines, from each page of the deposition transcript, which is comprised of (25) lines per page. The court may consider this fact and Plaintiff's response for ruling on parties cross-motions.
Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 1.
This response does not properly dispute the asserted fact pursuant to the standards of Local Rule 56.1B(2)(a)(2). First, although Plaintiff may object to a fact on the ground that Defendant's citation does not support the fact, Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant's cited evidence fails to support this fact. Defendant has cited to the Declaration of Melanie De Gennaro,4 which states that, under EHC's [*9]  FMLA Policy: "Employees who take FMLA leave for their own serious health condition are required to provide a letter from their physician indicating that they are fit for duty in their prior position with no restrictions." De Gennaro Dec. at ¶ 10. Plaintiff contends that the cited paragraph of De Gennaro's Declaration fails to support the fact "because this fact implies that all employees are not allowed to return if they provide a letter from their physician indicating that they have restrictions." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 1. Putting aside that this is not what the statement implies—because a need for ongoing restrictions or accommodations is not generally the province of the FMLA and the short-term leave that it allows—Plaintiff's argument about what this fact "implies" is simply insufficient to dispute the purported fact.5 Also, in Plaintiff's deposition, she was asked whether it was the Leave office who approves an employee's request for FMLA leave, and she responded: "They also approve it. And then when you are scheduled to come back to work, you have to submit documentation demonstrating your fitness to work." Pl. Dep. at 36.
Thus, the undersigned has considered but rejects Plaintiff's [*10]  objection to Defendant's fact on the ground that Defendant's cited evidence fails to support the fact. Although the Court cannot address Plaintiff's repetitious disputes to every one of Defendant's other asserted facts, the Court has carefully assessed Defendant's citations for its asserted facts and only relies upon facts that are properly supported. In other words, as to the facts relied on below, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant's citations fail to support the fact.
Plaintiff also objects to Defendant's fact No. 1 on the ground that it "is a hearsay summary conclusion and inadmissible evidence in accordance with Fed. R. Evid. 802, because Defendant is testifying on behalf of all EHC employees who take FMLA leaves for their own serious health condition (not their own and/or their families serious health conditions, which is the premise of FMLA LAW)." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 1. Plaintiff has lodged highly similar "hearsay" objections to nearly every one of Defendant's assertions, which according to Plaintiff generally all constitute "Defendant ... testifying on behalf of" others.
The undersigned finds that Plaintiff's objection on hearsay grounds clearly lacks merit. Nothing about [*11]  De Gennaro's statement in her Declaration suggests that she "is testifying on behalf of all EHC employees who take FMLA leaves." Instead, De Gennaro's statement simply reflects the substance of EHC's FMLA Policy. See De Gennaro Dec. at ¶ 10; Def. Ex. 8 [78-21]. Plaintiff does not cite any evidence disputing De Gennaro's statement regarding EHC's FMLA Policy, and the Policy itself states that employees are required to provide "[w]ritten medical certification of fitness for duty before returning to work, if the leave was due to the employee's serious health condition." Def. Ex. 8, at 3. Again, while the Court cannot devote the additional pages necessary to discuss Plaintiff's generally meritless and conclusory hearsay objections lodged in nearly every response, the Court has carefully reviewed the record and only relies on assertions that are admissible.
Plaintiff further objects to this and most other facts "because this fact together with the following facts at No: 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 18; 20; 21; 26; 27; 30; 32; 35; 48; 87; 88 and 89, are all contradictory." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 1. Plaintiff fails to explain how this fact is "contradictory" with any other specific fact, however, and the [*12]  Court finds that Plaintiff's blanket statement that the fact is "contradictory" with numerous other facts submitted by Defendant, without any explanation as to how they are "contradictory," is insufficient to meet her burden under the Local Rules.
As discussed, in order to dispute a particular fact submitted by Defendant, Plaintiff is required to "directly refute[] the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number)." LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa. Because Plaintiff has failed to cite to any specific evidence disputing Defendant's purported fact, the Court must deem it admitted under Local Rule 56.1. Furthermore, because most of Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's facts similarly state "objection" but fail to dispute Defendant's facts with citations to specific evidence, the Court will not discuss each and every objection made by Plaintiff but will simply deem Defendant's facts to be admitted.
The Court has engaged in this analysis with regard to the various assertions of fact presented in this case. For those facts submitted by Defendant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which Plaintiff has not expressly disputed with citations [*13]  to record evidence, the Court must deem those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa. The Court must generally accept those admitted facts as true, so long as the facts are supported by citations to record evidence, do not make credibility determinations, and do not involve legal conclusions. See E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11312, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007).
Unless otherwise noted, the Court has also excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The facts relied upon by the Court are set forth below. While Plaintiff's generally improper responses compel the Court in most instances to accept Defendant's asserted facts, the Court has also considered Plaintiff's legal and factual arguments made throughout her papers, as explained further in the substantive [*14]  discussion of each individual claim.
2. Facts
Defendant's employees who take FMLA leave for their own serious health condition are required to provide a letter from their physician indicating that they are fit for duty in their prior position with no restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 1; De Gennaro Dec. [78-13] at ¶ 10; Pl. Dep. [82] at 36. Defendant's employees whose physician indicates that they are unable to return to their position at the end of their FMLA leave are provided with any remaining FMLA leave and/or unpaid leave (which is not job-protected) and referred to Human Resources and Recruiting for help identifying and applying for other positions. Def. SMF at ¶ 2. Although HR and Recruiting staff are made available to answer questions and guide employees through the application process, they are not charged with reassigning the employee to another position and there is no guarantee as to when, if ever, an employee will be selected for a transfer. Def. SMF at ¶ 3.
Employees returning from leaves of absences must compete with other internal applicants for each job for which they apply. Def. SMF at ¶ 4. Internal applicants, even those returning from leave, are not placed in the general [*15]  pool of external job applicants and their application is given a priority review by the recruiter screening applications. Def. SMF at ¶ 5. The Recruiting and HR staff do not know the reason why an employee took leave and do not know whether the employee has a medical condition. Def. SMF at ¶ 6.
In February of 2013, Defendant hired Plaintiff as an Anesthesia Tech, which is an entry-level clinical position which consists mostly of sterilizing equipment and operating rooms, and handing surgical instruments to the surgeon. Def. SMF at ¶ 7. Plaintiff worked as an Anesthesia Tech for a little more than a year before voluntarily transferring to a part-time customer service-based role receiving and processing patient complaints. Def. SMF at ¶ 8. Plaintiff worked in two more customer service-oriented, clerical roles, including a Patient Administrative Liaison ("PAL") position at Emory University Hospital's ("EUH") Emergency Department ("ED"), which began in June of 2015. Def. SMF at ¶ 9. Plaintiff's ED Manager observed behavioral deficiencies in Plaintiff's performance, including conflicts with her co-workers and her inability to work as part of a team which were documented in Plaintiff's 2016 [*16]  annual review. Def. SMF at ¶ 10; Read Dec., Ex. D [78-10].
Plaintiff applied for and was approved for FMLA leave from March 19, 2017 through May 28, 2017. Def. SMF at ¶ 11; Pl. Dep. at 14, Ex. 2. At the time she began her FMLA leave, Plaintiff was working in the ED as a PAL earning $19.55 per hour. Def. SMF at ¶ 12; Pl. Dep. at 14, Ex. 2. While Plaintiff was on FMLA leave, Plaintiff and her physician informed Defendant's Leave Department that Plaintiff could not return to her position in the ED due to an unidentified condition and indicated that Plaintiff needed to be moved to a "less stressful department, other than the ED, due to 'triggers' in the ED." Def. SMF at ¶ 13; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 8. Plaintiff was permitted to take the remaining two weeks of her 12-week FMLA leave and directed to register with the Office of Accessibility Services ("OAS"). Def. SMF at ¶ 14; Pl. Dep. at 35, 62.
On May 23, 2017, Plaintiff's physician completed OAS's medical questionnaire and indicated that Plaintiff had two impairments (anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder) which did not substantially limit a major life activity. Def. SMF at ¶ 15; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 5. Plaintiff's physician recommended that [*17]  Plaintiff work in a "less stressful environment" which would allow her to be "more effective in her job performance" because her symptoms were aggravated by dealing with difficult and emotional situations with patients in the ED. Def. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 6-7. Plaintiff agreed with her physician's conclusions and recommendations. Def. SMF at ¶ 17; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 3.
After Defendant received Plaintiff's request for accommodation, Plaintiff was assigned a recruiter to help her locate and apply for other positions. Def. SMF at ¶ 18; Pl. Dep. at 62. Defendant did not terminate Plaintiff's employment at the expiration of her FMLA leave even though she was unable to work in the ED. Def. SMF at ¶ 19; De Gennaro Dec., Ex. 9. Defendant placed Plaintiff on non-FMLA leave while she continued to search for jobs for several more weeks. Def. SMF at ¶ 20; De Gennaro Dec., Ex. 9. While on non-FMLA leave, Plaintiff retained her employee status with Defendant which meant that she could continue to apply for jobs and receive priority review like all current employees, as well as use her accrued paid time off. Def. SMF at ¶ 21; Read Dec., Ex. F.; De Gennaro Dec. ¶ 15.
Plaintiff applied for [*18]  many positions for which she did not meet the minimum qualifications and which were not similar to the PAL position in the ED or any position she had held with EHC. Def. SMF at ¶ 22. Plaintiff applied for the positions of HR Director (even though she had no HR experience and had never held a director-level position of any kind), Clinical Data and Regulatory Manager, Project Manager, Data Analyst (even though she had no information technology or management experience with the company), Dermatology Clinic Manager, Senior Manager of Patient Experience, Senior Business Manager, and Business Operations Manager and Security Specialist (even though she had no background in security). Def. SMF at ¶ 23.
Plaintiff applied for a handful of jobs similar to her previous roles with EHC and was selected to interview for an Anesthesia Tech position and a Patient Services Coordinator role but these jobs were never filled because the job requisition was cancelled. Def. SMF at ¶ 24. Plaintiff interviewed for a second Anesthesia Tech position but she was not hired for that position because she was perceived by the hiring manager as arrogant and overconfident. Def. SMF at ¶ 25.
Melanie De Gennaro, EUH's [*19]  HR VP, contacted managers in her own personal network to find out if they had any positions suitable for Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 26. In late June of 2017, De Gennaro found a patient services role similar to Plaintiff's ED position (including paying the same hourly wage) at Emory University Orthopedic and Spine Hospital ("EUOSH"). Def. SMF at ¶ 27. Plaintiff did not want to interview for the job because of the cost of gas so De Gennaro offered Plaintiff free gift cards to pay for gas if she agreed to attend the interview. Def. SMF at ¶ 28. Plaintiff interviewed for the job but told De Gennaro that it was not a good fit due to her fear of "commutes." Def. SMF at ¶ 29.
De Gennaro found Plaintiff a second position at EUH-Wesley Woods ("Wesley Woods") hospital after speaking with EUH VP of Operations, Jen Schuck. Def. SMF at ¶ 30. In late June of 2017, Wesley Woods's Nursing Department had a Patient Administrative Liaison ("PAL") who interacted extensively with the psychiatric patients in a patient services capacity, and Schuck was looking for a PAL for the Administrative Department that would interact mostly with visitors and outpatients. Def. SMF at ¶ 31. De Gennaro recommended Plaintiff [*20]  for the position and told Schuck that Plaintiff had previously worked as a PAL in the ED and was seeking a lateral transfer following a leave of absence from the ED because she needed a less stressful work environment. Def. SMF at ¶ 32. Plaintiff accepted the position, writing in an email she would "love" to report to Schuck who she called "fantastic." Def. SMF at ¶ 33; De Gennaro Dec., Ex.10. Plaintiff and Schuck discussed the position and its requirements. Def. SMF at ¶ 34. They agreed that Wesley Woods was a less stressful location than EUH's ED since there is less foot traffic and it is a much smaller hospital. Def. SMF at ¶ 35.
Plaintiff began working at Wesley Woods on July 10, 2017 and was scheduled for Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 36; Schuck Dec. ¶ 6; Pl. Dep. at 81., Ex. 12. Plaintiff was given a desk located in the hospital lobby since her main duty was interacting with visitors. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Schuck Dec. ¶ 6; Pl. Dep. at 81, 96; Lawrence Dec. [78-4] ¶ 7. Like her PAL job in the ED, Plaintiff's desk was located inside the hospital's Public Safety Office. Def. SMF at ¶ 38; Pl. Dep., Ex. 8 at 2; Schuck Dec. ¶ 6. Plaintiff was also given a [*21]  locker to store her belongings but the locker was not to her liking so Ed Lawrence6 let her store her belongings in his office. Def. SMF at ¶ 39. The Public Safety officers did not supervise Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 40.
Approximately a month after starting her job at Wesley Woods, Ms. De Gennaro asked Plaintiff if she liked her new job and Plaintiff responded that she was "enjoying the location and Jen [Schuck] is fantastic." Def. SMF at ¶ 41; Read Dec., Ex. B. Plaintiff's supervisors believed that Plaintiff adequately performed her job duties, however, they also believed that she was a source of conflict with her co-workers. Def. SMF at ¶ 42. Schuck and Lawrence believed that Plaintiff demanded resources that no one else had, such as a permanent office in the administrative suite where Lawrence and Schuck had offices. Def. SMF at ¶ 43. Schuck and Lawrence also observed Plaintiff behave in ways that caused disruption to her co-workers, such as making threats to clinical staff of charges of illegal conduct concerning patient care. Def. SMF at ¶ 44. Schuck found this behavior quite odd since Plaintiff had no clinical training or licensing in mental health and knew nothing about the [*22]  proper standards of care. Def. SMF at ¶ 45; Schuck Dec. ¶ 7.
Plaintiff initiated an altercation with a clinician in which she told the clinician that if someone did not come talk to the patient or a family member "immediately," that it would constitute a violation of federal law. Def. SMF at ¶ 46. Plaintiff's speculation about the matter was not true and even if it had been, her job would not encompass making such determinations and ordering any clinician to do anything "immediately." Def. SMF at ¶ 47; Schuck Dec. ¶ 7.
During Plaintiff's initial months working at Wesley Woods, Schuck and Lawrence also received reports from multiple employees in multiple departments that Plaintiff was continuously talking about a Public Safety Officer named Tyrone Pickett and making inappropriate comments about his personal life and emotional health. Def. SMF at ¶ 47. Schuck asked Ed Lawrence, one of her reports, for his help managing Plaintiff and asked him to serve as a resource for her when Schuck was out of the office. Def. SMF at ¶ 48. They also discussed Schuck's concerns about Plaintiff's interpersonal skills as well as the complaints that Shuck and Lawrence had received about her from her co-workers. [*23]  Def. SMF at ¶ 49. Because Wesley Woods' Administrative Department had never utilized the PAL position (although a PAL worked in the Nursing Department), Schuck and Lawrence encouraged Plaintiff to find ways to develop the role beyond a strictly customer service-clerical role and offered to help her find ways to do that during her 2017 review. Def. SMF at ¶ 50. Schuck also apprised Plaintiff of the deficits observed in her interpersonal skills during their meeting to discuss her 2017 review. Def. SMF at ¶ 51.
On November 7, 2017, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to HR alleging that an unidentified member of the Public Safety staff told her that Officer Pickett told his staff to be mindful of what they said around her because she had been moved to Wesley Woods after she "caused a bunch of mess up the street." Def. SMF at ¶ 52; De Gennaro Dec., Ex. 11; Pl. Dep. at 107-08. HR conducted an investigation and was unable to corroborate Plaintiff's allegations and informed Plaintiff of the same. Def. SMF at ¶ 53. On November 8, 2017, Plaintiff sent management an unsolicited "agenda" for the meeting that Schuck organized which was perceived by Schuck and Lawrence as rehashing alleged petty slights and [*24]  annoyances allegedly involving Officer Pickett, as well as insensitive and inappropriate comments about Officer Pickett, including Plaintiff's assessment that Pickett was mentally unstable because he was going through a divorce and was crying at work. Def. SMF at ¶ 54.
On November 10, 2017, De Gennaro, Schuck, and Lawrence met with Plaintiff to work on a plan for helping her interpersonal relationships and to clarify her job duties. Def. SMF at ¶ 55. Plaintiff interrupted her managers on several occasions in order to reiterate things that were in her "agenda" about Officer Pickett's personal and marital life, none of which even hinted that he was engaging in any inappropriate behavior towards her. Def. SMF at ¶ 56; Pl. Dep. at 112-14, 118-19, 121-23; Schuck Dec. ¶ 12; Lawrence Dec. ¶¶ 17-18. Plaintiff's actions during the meeting with her managers and the reports they had already received from Plaintiff's co-workers about her comments about Officer Pickett led them to believe that Plaintiff was engaging in harassing behavior towards Officer Pickett by making demeaning comments to anyone who would listen about his marital status and mental state. Def. SMF at ¶ 57; Schuck Dec. ¶ 12; Lawrence [*25]  Dec. ¶ 18; De Gennaro Dec. ¶ 25.
Schuck, Lawrence and De Gennaro instructed Plaintiff to refrain from initiating discussions about Officer Pickett's personal life, emotional state or making any derogatory comments about him. Def. SMF at ¶ 58. Plaintiff was also told that the information discussed in the meeting was confidential and that any further issues she wanted to discuss about Officer Pickett should be directed to HR or her managers. Def. SMF at ¶ 59. As part of Plaintiff's personal development plan, she and her managers agreed to meet bi-weekly to continue working on the plan and so Plaintiff could receive feedback. Def. SMF at ¶ 60; Pl. Dep., Ex. 9. Schuck also suggested that Plaintiff take two online courses for improving communication skills and resolving conflict and Plaintiff agreed. Def. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Dep., Ex. 9.
Plaintiff and her managers scheduled a meeting on November 28, 2017 to start the first of their bi-weekly meetings but Plaintiff did not attend. Def. SMF at ¶ 62. Plaintiff's managers continued to offer their support and guidance to Plaintiff even after she inexplicably failed to attend her first mentoring session. Def. SMF at ¶ 63. Beginning in December of [*26]  2017, Plaintiff and Lawrence met approximately every two weeks so that she could discuss any questions she had about her job and so she could receive feedback regarding her efforts to improve her interactions with co-workers. Def. SMF at ¶ 64. Plaintiff eventually stopped meeting with Lawrence because she believed that the meetings were a requirement of disciplinary action arising from the November 10th meeting. Def. SMF at ¶ 65.
Plaintiff's managers also tried to help Plaintiff expand her job beyond its purely clerical functions by offering her opportunities to interact and network with other employees at Wesley Woods to identify ways in which she could serve as an administrative resource for them and their patients. Def. SMF at ¶ 66. Plaintiff attended "Daily Huddle Meetings" designed to expose her to her co-workers, and her managers observed her repeatedly interrupting the individuals running the meeting and attempting to dictate how the meeting should be run, which was inappropriate behavior in her managers' opinion given that these were clinical meetings and Plaintiff had no clinical experience. Def. SMF at ¶ 67. Plaintiff was also observed by her managers interrupting clinicians [*27]  in order to give them advice on how to care for their patients even though she has no experience in mental health counseling. Def. SMF at ¶ 68.
Plaintiff's managers believed Plaintiff's actions at the meetings they invited her to were in line with other negative interactions she had with employees in other departments, many of which involved overstepping her boundaries and attempting to tell people how to do their jobs even when it was well outside of her area or expertise. Def. SMF at ¶ 69. Plaintiff also continued to focus on Officer Pickett's divorce and mental health after the November 10th meeting and her managers continued to receive reports that Plaintiff was initiating the same kinds of inappropriate discussions about him that she had been warned to stop. Def. SMF at ¶ 70.
In February of 2018, EHC's Office of Compliance received several anonymous calls via the Trust Line about Officer Pickett. Def. SMF at ¶ 71. Schuck and Lawrence believed the substance of the calls was nearly identical to the things Plaintiff told them about Pickett during the November 2017 meeting and which were in her "agenda." Def. SMF at ¶ 72. The caller to the Trust Line also gave details about HR's investigation [*28]  of Plaintiff's complaints about Officer Pickett and other issues discussed during the November 10th meeting which Plaintiff's supervisors believed only could have been known by Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 73.
Based on the information contained in the Trust Line calls and the reports Schuck and Lawrence received from Plaintiff's co-workers regarding Plaintiff's continued inappropriate comments about Officer Pickett, Schuck and Lawrence concluded that Plaintiff had ignored their directive from their November 10th meeting. Def. SMF at ¶ 74. Lawrence and Shuck consulted with De Gennaro who agreed and they decided to give Plaintiff a written reprimand since the verbal counseling in November did not remedy the problem. Def. SMF at ¶ 75.
Emory's Corrective Disciplinary policy gives discretion to managers to use any level of discipline necessary to alleviate misconduct, regardless of whether previous discipline has been given. Def. SMF at ¶ 76; De Gennaro Dec. ¶ 9, Ex. 6, 7; Lawrence Dec. ¶ 3. EHC's Trust Line policy contains an anti-retaliation provision and provides that employees who make good-faith complaints via the Trust Line will not be retaliated against. Def. SMF at ¶ 77; De Gennaro Dec. [*29]  ¶ 8, Ex. 5.
Lawrence prepared the Written Warning and presented it to Plaintiff on February 23, 2018. Def. SMF at ¶ 78. The written reprimand did not result in a change to Plaintiff's pay, benefits, or employee status. Def. SMF at ¶ 79. The written reprimand was removed from Plaintiff's personnel file upon the recommendation of an in-house investigator who believed that the discipline was issued in violation of the anti-retaliation provision of EHC's Trust Line Policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 80. On March 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging that the written discipline she received constituted disability discrimination and retaliation. Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. Dep., Ex. 28 [82-2].
Plaintiff's supervisors believed that Plaintiff was able to perform her job duties and that the deficits in her performance were behavior-based and caused by her poor interpersonal skills. Def. SMF at ¶ 82. Plaintiff's supervisors never told her they did not think she could perform her job, and Schuck and Lawrence were her mentors. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 99, 101; Pl. Dep. at 141-44, 158. Plaintiff's impairments did not cause her inability to get [*30]  along with her co-workers. Def. SMF at ¶ 83; Pl. Dep. at 155, 158. Plaintiff was also allowed to take rest breaks as needed. Def. SMF at ¶ 97; Pl. Dep. at 132-34.
Plaintiff believes that that she was disciplined on February 23, 2018 for her "agenda" sent on November 8, 2017 and her attempts to repeat her prior allegations of Officer Pickett's alleged scrutiny of her during the November 10, 2017 meeting with her managers. Def. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. Dep. at 149. Plaintiff believes her managers decided to issue her the Written Warning for multiple reasons, including that her managers thought that she called the Trust Line, Officer Pickett's alleged direction to his staff to be careful of what they say in front of Plaintiff, and that her managers "blamed her for things." Def. SMF at ¶ 85; Pl. Dep. at 147-52. Plaintiff's evidence that discriminatory or retaliatory animus was the reason for her discipline is her opinion and her beliefs. Def. SMF at ¶ 86; Pl. Dep. at 140, 151-52.
De Gennaro did not know that Plaintiff had any type of physical or mental impairment or that she had a disability. Def. SMF at ¶ 87; De Gennaro Dec. ¶ 38; Pl. Dep. at 41, 43, 152. Schuck did not know that Plaintiff had [*31]  any type of physical or mental impairment or that she had a disability. Def. SMF at ¶ 88; Schuck Dec. ¶ 22; Pl. Dep. at 41, 43, 152. Lawrence did not know that Plaintiff had any type of physical or mental impairment or that she had a disability. Def. SMF at ¶ 89; Lawrence Dec. ¶ 28; Pl. Dep. at 41, 43, 152.
Lisa Dukes was a Patient Administrative Liaison that worked in the Nursing Department at Wesley Woods under a different reporting structure than Plaintiff and who worked at Wesley Woods prior to Plaintiff's arrival. Def. SMF at ¶ 90. Prior to Plaintiff's arrival at Wesley Woods, the Administrative Department needed a clerical, customer service-oriented employee to enhance the lobby experience for visitors, vendors and outpatients. Def. SMF at ¶ 91. Plaintiff worked in the Administrative Department at Wesley Woods and reported to Lawrence and Schuck. Def. SMF at ¶ 92. The Administrative Department at Wesley Woods had never had a PAL role before. Def. SMF at ¶ 93.
Plaintiff believes that Officer Pickett was interested in her romantically. Def. SMF at ¶ 94; Pl. Dep. at 98. Officer Pickett was not Plaintiff's supervisor and could not discipline her. Def. SMF at ¶ 98; Pl. Dep. at 135, [*32]  137, 148. Plaintiff believed Officer Pickett scrutinized her because she rejected his alleged romantic advances or possibly because her managers had asked him to monitor her. Def. SMF at ¶ 102; Pl. Dep. at 179-81. Plaintiff does not think her conflict with Officer Pickett was caused by her impairments of PTSD or anxiety. Def. SMF at ¶ 101; Pl. Dep. at 153-155. Plaintiff did not complain to her supervisors, Lawrence and Schuck, about sexual harassment but only "harassment in general" which consisted only of his scrutiny of her. Def. SMF at ¶ 95; Pl. Dep. at 113. Schuck counseled Plaintiff repeatedly about her communication skills and told her to interact more professionally with Officer Pickett. Def. SMF at ¶ 96.
B. Discussion
1. Plaintiff's Objection
After Defendant filed its Reply Brief in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment [86], Plaintiff filed "Plaintiff's Objections to Defendant's Reply Brief in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment" [87] ("Objection"). In her Objection, Plaintiff states that she "OBJECTS" to certain arguments made by Defendant in its Reply. See Obj. [87] at 1. Specifically, Plaintiff objects to the following arguments made in Defendant's Reply: that [*33]  all of her responses to Defendant's material facts should be deemed admitted; that she allegedly abandoned her claims; that her claims were allegedly belated; and that she has no evidence to support her claims. Id.
The Court finds that Plaintiff's "Objection" is essentially a sur-reply brief responding to the arguments made by Defendant in its Reply. In general, the Local Rules of this Court do not permit parties to file sur-reply briefs as a matter of course. See LR 7.1, NDGa. Because Plaintiff failed to file a motion requesting leave of the Court to file a sur-reply brief, the Court cannot her consider her "objections" to the arguments made by Defendant in its Reply.
Moreover, even if the Court were to consider Plaintiff's arguments in her Objection, they are without merit. Plaintiff first objects to Defendant's argument that all her responses to Defendant's material facts should be deemed admitted because Plaintiff failed to dispute Defendant's facts with citations to evidence in the record. See Obj. at 1-2. But as discussed above, the Local Rules require a respondent to a summary judgment motion to admit or dispute the movant's facts, and if the respondent intends to refute the movant's fact, the [*34]  respondent must support such refutations with "specific citations to evidence." LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2)(i), NDGa. In this case, because Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's facts do not dispute the facts with citations to specific evidence in the record reflecting a genuine dispute, or otherwise properly respond, the Court must deem the Defendant's facts as admitted. See LR 56.1B(2)(a)(2), NDGa.
Plaintiff also objects to Defendant's arguments that she abandoned some of her claims; that her claims were allegedly belated; and that she has no evidence to support her claims. See Obj. at 1. But as discussed in detail below, Plaintiff's failure to respond to some of Defendant's arguments in its primary brief constitutes abandonment of certain claims asserted in her Amended Complaint, and other claims are untimely or not supported by evidence.
Plaintiff objects further to the Declarations submitted by Defendant in connection with its Motion for Summary Judgment, that is, the Declarations of Kristyne Seidenberg, Melanie De Gennaro, Jennifer Shuck, Ed Lawrence, Toni Read. Id. at 4, 6-9. Plaintiff objects to these Declarations pursuant to the "Sham Affidavit Doctrine," which prohibits a party from submitting an affidavit that disputes prior sworn testimony [*35]  of the affiant. Id. at 4.
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that "[a]n affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be based on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). In creating an issue of fact, a party may not rely on an affidavit from an individual that directly contradicts his or her own deposition testimony. An affidavit may be considered a "sham" affidavit "when a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact . . . [and that party attempts] thereafter [to] create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony." Tippens v. Celotex Corp., 805 F.2d 949, 954 (11th Cir. 1986); see also Dotson v. Delta Consol. Indus., Inc., 251 F.3d 780, 781 (8th Cir. 2001) ("a party may not create a question of material fact, and thus forestall summary judgment, by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own sworn statements in a deposition"). A court presented with such an inconsistency in a party's testimony may disregard the later "sham affidavit" in favor of the earlier deposition testimony. Tippens, 805 F.2d at 949; see also Van T. Junkins & Assoc. v. U.S. Indus., Inc., 736 F.2d 656, 658 (11th Cir. 1984); Anderson v. Radisson Hotel Corp., 834 F. Supp. 1364, 1373 (S.D. Ga. 1993).
This "sham affidavit" rule, however, as set forth in this Circuit and elsewhere, [*36]  operates to nullify only unexplained variations in testimony. See Van T. Junkins & Assoc., 736 F.2d at 656 ("a district court may find an affidavit which contradicts testimony on deposition a sham when the party merely contradicts its prior testimony without giving any valid explanation.") (emphasis added); accord S.W.S. Erectors, Inc. v. Infax, Inc., 72 F.3d 489, 495-96 (5th Cir. 1996); Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni & Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994). When the witness furnishes a credible explanation for his reversal, courts are properly unwilling to discard the revised testimony as a sham. See, e.g., Pries v. Honda Motor Co., 31 F.3d 543 (7th Cir. 1994) (declining to discard affidavit as sham because plaintiff credibly explained variation in testimony based on later understanding of events); Waitek v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, 908 F. Supp. 672 (N.D. Iowa 1995) (finding no sham because medical expert witness gave reasonable explanation for revised opinion presented in affidavit).
Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit has cautioned courts that, in reviewing affidavits submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment, an affidavit may not be simply disregarded as a "sham" because it contains information contradictory to other evidence in the record.
[E]very discrepancy contained in an affidavit does not justify a district court's refusal to give credence to such evidence. In light of the jury's role in resolving questions of credibility, a district court should not reject [*37]  the content of an affidavit even if it is at odds with statements made in an early deposition.
Kennett-Murray Corp. v. Bone, 622 F.2d 887, 894 (5th Cir. 1980) (quoted in Tippens, 805 F.2d at 954).7
Plaintiff argues that the Declarations submitted by Defendant in connection with its Motion for Summary Judgment must be excluded as "Sham Affidavits," but Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that any of the Declarations relied upon by the Defendant is a "sham" because she has not shown that any of the declarants' testimony directly contradicted any previous sworn testimony, such as deposition testimony.8 Plaintiff argues further that "all of Defendant's affidavits, including that of its counsel were created with intent to contradict objective evidence with hearsay statements, when Defendant refused to provide the supportive objective evidence in question during discovery." Obj. at 5. But Plaintiff fails to cite to any particular statement in any of the Declarations that is allegedly inconsistent with any "objective evidence." Further, Plaintiff has not shown that she requested a specific document material to her claims that Defendant refused to provide during discovery.
Plaintiff also contends that the Declarations contain "hearsay statements." Obj. at 5, 10. Plaintiff is correct that evidence which [*38]  would be inadmissible hearsay at trial may not be considered by the Court on a motion for summary judgment. Macuba v. DeBoer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Fed.R.Evid. 801 ("'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted."). But Plaintiff has failed to cite to any particular statement from any of Defendant's Declarations that would be considered inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiff's vague objection that the Declarations contain "hearsay statements" is insufficient to make a valid evidentiary objection to any particular statement.
Plaintiff also objects to the Defendant's alleged untimely filing of her deposition errata sheet. Obj. at 12-13. The docket reflects that Defendant filed Plaintiff's deposition [79] at the time it originally filed its Motion for Summary Judgment [78] on May 8, 2020, and filed Plaintiff's deposition with exhibits [82] a week later on May 15, 2020. Defendant did not file Plaintiff's errata sheet, however, until it filed its Reply [86] on June 10, 2020. See Def. Reply, Ex. 1 [86-1]. According to Defendant, it received Plaintiff's errata sheet on the evening of May 14, 2020, but "inadvertently neglected to include [*39]  it in Plaintiff's deposition transcript which was filed the next morning on May 15." Def. Reply at 4 n.4. Although Plaintiff states that this is "false," she has failed to submit any evidence to dispute Defendant's contention that it received Plaintiff's errata sheet on May 14. See Obj. at 12. But more importantly, Plaintiff has failed to explain how she was prejudiced by Defendant's failure to file the errata sheet until it filed its Reply on June 10.
Plaintiff also objects to Defendant's citation of her own deposition testimony on the ground that Defendant failed to "quote" her testimony directly, and makes various other arguments in her Objection regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, but her arguments are without merit. See Obj. at 10-12. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Objection [87] be OVERRULED.
2. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to [*40]  any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 249. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 248. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, [*41]  they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions as to the merits of disputed facts. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First Am. Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are not. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
3. Plaintiff's Claims
a. ADA Claims
In the Amended Complaint [15], Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of a disability, and retaliated against her for requesting [*42]  a reasonable accommodation for her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.
(1) Standards of Proof under the ADA
The ADA was enacted "to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities" and "to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101(b)(1), (b)(2). Title I of the ADA, which covers disability discrimination in employment, prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). This section of the ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (Carnes, J.) (quoting Harding v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F.Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to [*43]  the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based on the framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), for employment discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 50 n.3, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (reviewing disparate treatment disability claim under McDonnell Douglas framework and noting that courts of appeals use this framework in disparate treatment ADA cases); Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007), Bennett v. Dominguez, 196 F. App'x 785, 791 (11th Cir. 2006).
Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial [*44]  evidence of discrimination under the same burden-shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).
If, however, the employer successfully articulates a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must then establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the employer's action. Roberts v. Gadsden Mem'l Hosp., 835 F.2d 793, 796 (11th Cir.), opinion amended on reh'g, 850 F.2d 1549 (11th Cir. 1988) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804; Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)). A plaintiff may carry this burden either indirectly, by showing that the defendant's proffered explanation is pretextual, or directly, by showing that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the defendant's action. Id. (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; Perryman, 698 F.2d at 1142). "By successfully meeting this burden, the plaintiff creates a presumption that the adverse employment action was the product of discriminatory intent." Id.
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, [*45]  the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does not apply because a plaintiff is not required to prove intentional discrimination in those cases. See Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, No. 1:07-cv-1228, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D.Ga. March 18, 2008) (Vining, J.) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims").
(2) Disability Discrimination under the ADA
In Count III of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "Discrimination," which appears to be a claim of disability [*46]  discrimination under the ADA. See Am. Compl. [15] at ¶¶ 149-51. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability "when it repeatedly delayed her return to work after requesting a reasonable accommodation because of an actual or apparent disability," and when it "effectively denied her request for an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Id. at ¶ 150. She also claims that "it intentionally placed her into a position where she was disparately treated, illegally harassed and retaliated against for requesting an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability."

In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must generally demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Rossbach v. City of Miami, 371 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (11th Cir. 2004); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir. 1998). In addition, a plaintiff must also establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447-48 (11th Cir. 1996).
The first prima facie [*47]  element requires the plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The ADA defines "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . ; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). Thus, a person has a "disability" under the ADA if the person has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).9
The second element of the prima facie case requires a plaintiff to establish that he or she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The [*48]  term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty., Fla. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
Thus, an employee must show that she is able to meet all of a job's requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish a valid ADA claim. See Southeastern Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual [*49]  to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007)). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
The third and final element of a plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability or perceived disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007).
Defendant does not argue that Plaintiff cannot show that she was a "qualified individual" under the ADA. Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to show the first element of a prima facie case of disability discrimination, which is that she has a disability under the ADA. Def. Br. [78-1] at 21. Defendant further argues that, for the purpose of her claim of failure to accommodate, her claim fails because the undisputed evidence indicates that Defendant provided every accommodation that she requested. Id. at 22-23. Finally, Defendant [*50]  argues, even assuming that Plaintiff had shown that she was disabled under the ADA, she cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she has failed to show that she was subjected to an adverse action because of her alleged disability, and that the individuals who made the decision to issue a reprimand to her were aware of any alleged disability. Id. at 23-24.

(a) Does Plaintiff Have a Disability?
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff has failed to meet the first element of a prima facie case of disability discrimination, which is that she has a disability under the ADA. Def. Br. [78-1] at 21. According to Defendant, "Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence that creates an issue of fact with regard to whether her PTSD or anxiety diagnoses substantially limited a major life activity. In fact, she and her physician both affirmed that her impairments did not substantially limit a major life activity upon her return from FMLA leave." Def. Br. at 21 (citing Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 5). Defendant argues further that Plaintiff provided no evidence during her deposition that her anxiety or PTSD substantially limited a major life activity and it is undisputed that Plaintiff's disability [*51]  did not substantially limit her ability to work. Id. (citing Pl. Dep. 139-41). For that reason, Defendant argues, it is entitled to summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's ADA claims.
As set forth in the facts above, on May 23, 2017, Plaintiff's physician completed OAS's medical questionnaire and indicated that Plaintiff had two impairments (anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder) which did not substantially limit a major life activity. Def. SMF at ¶ 15; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 5 (stamped "Emory 00183). Plaintiff's physician recommended that Plaintiff work in a "less stressful environment" which would allow her to be "more effective in her job performance" because her symptoms were aggravated by dealing with difficult and emotional situations with patients in the ED. Def. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. Dep., Ex. 4 at 6-7.
As discussed, the first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she has a disability under the ADA, which is defined as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . ; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C). The ADAAA amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, [*52]  for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).
The ADAAA also provides that "[t]he definition of disability in this Act shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). Thus, it is clear that a major purpose of the ADAAA was to amend the ADA to make it easier for plaintiffs to establish that a serious medical condition is covered as a disability under the ADA. "[B]y enacting the ADAAA in 2008, Congress eased in part the evidentiary burden on ADA plaintiffs," and "announced that 'the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.'" Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. l:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 16, 2014) (Totenberg, J.) (quoting Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014)); see also Coker v. Enhanced Senior Living, Inc., 897 F.Supp.2d 1366, 1374 (N.D.Ga.2012) (Story, J.) ("The ADAAA amended the ADA to, among other things, promulgate a more liberal standard of the term [*53]  'disabled,' making it significantly easier for a plaintiff to show disability." (internal quotation omitted)).
Indeed, the regulations implementing the ADAAA state that:
The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. "Substantially limits" is not meant to be a demanding standard. . . .
The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i) and (iii).
Furthermore, the regulations also recognize that, in light of those principles, certain types of mental and physical impairments will be considered to be disabilities under the ADA as a general rule. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii). The regulations explain that, "[g]iven their inherent nature, these types of impairments will, as a factual matter, virtually always be found to impose a substantial limitation on a major life activity. Therefore, [*54]  with respect to these types of impairments, the necessary individualized assessment should be particularly simple and straightforward." Id. For example, the regulations state that it "should easily be concluded" that "major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia substantially limit brain function." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(iii) (emphasis added).
It is undisputed in this case that Plaintiff's physician indicated that she had been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety. Thus, consistent with the regulations, the Court finds that Plaintiff's PTSD should be considered a disability under the ADAAA, without requiring Plaintiff to submit additional evidence that her PTSD substantially limited her in a major life activity. While Defendant cites to a form completed by Plaintiff's physician in which he checked a box stating that her impairments did not limit her in a major life activity, the determination of whether Plaintiff's impairments would be considered a disability under the ADA is a legal conclusion. The Court cannot presume that Plaintiff's physician would be familiar with the requirements of the ADAAA, or the regulations providing clarification [*55]  as to what impairments should be considered a disability under the statute.
Thus, the Court finds that, at a minimum, the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether her anxiety and PTSD constituted disabilities under the ADA, as amended by the ADAAA.

(b) Did Defendant Fail to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation?
As part of Plaintiff's claim of "discrimination" in Count III of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant "intentionally and unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff" because of her disability "when it effectively denied her request for an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Am. Compl. [15] at ¶ 150. Thus, although Plaintiff asserts only one count of disability discrimination under the ADA, it appears that her claim encompasses both a claim of disparate treatment and a claim based on an alleged failure to accommodate. Defendant argues that, for the purpose of Plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate, her claim fails because the undisputed evidence indicates that Defendant provided every accommodation that she requested. Def. Br. at 22-23.
The third and final element of a plaintiff's prima facie [*56]  case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). The ADA expressly provides that an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010) ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1997)). Furthermore, although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that [*57]  a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001). "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, it is the plaintiff who "bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86). Moreover, an employer's "duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand [*58]  for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363-64 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]he initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. Only after the employee has satisfied this burden and the employer fails to provide that accommodation can the employee prevail on a claim that her employer has discriminated against her."); see also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his or her limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id. at 1367; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that Defendant discriminated against her "when it repeatedly [*59]  delayed her return to work after requesting a reasonable accommodation because of an actual or apparent disability," and when it "effectively denied her request for an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Am. Compl. [15] at ¶ 150. Plaintiff alleges that, on May 23, 2017, her physician Dr. Conley completed a "Medical Inquiry Form in Response to an Accommodation Request" which stated that "Patient needs to be in a more controlled environment than her current position." Id. at ¶ 29. Plaintiff does not allege or provide evidence that she made any other accommodations request other than transfer to a "less stressful environment," to avoid dealing with difficult and emotional situations with patients in the ED.
Defendant argues that it complied with the ADA by providing Plaintiff with every accommodation she requested, allowing Plaintiff to compete equally with other internal applicants for jobs for approximately six weeks, and ultimately facilitating her transfer to a mutually agreeable alternative position that accommodated Plaintiff's medical needs. See Def. Br. at 22 (citing EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding that "the ADA only requires an employer allow a disabled person to compete equally with [*60]  the rest of the world for a vacant position" and allowing an employee only 30 days to locate another position prior to termination does not violate the ADA)).
Specifically, Defendant argues that, although it "could have easily terminated her employment at that time without violating the ADA, Ms. De Gennaro personally found two equivalent positions for Plaintiff because she wanted to help her." Id. Further, Defendant notes, it is undisputed that Plaintiff accepted one of these positions and began working as a PAL at Wesley Woods on July 10, 2017, earning the same wage she earned in the ED while working in a less stressful environment. Id. at 22-23. Defendant argues that it also accommodated Plaintiff's request for a mentor, clarified her job duties on multiple occasions, and provided her with rest breaks as needed. Id. at 23. Based on this undisputed evidence, Defendant argues, it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim.
Plaintiff has not disputed Defendant's evidence that, in response to her request for a reasonable accommodation for her disability, EHC allowed her to transfer to a PAL position at Wesley Woods hospital in June of 2017. In her response brief, Plaintiff [*61]  contends that she also requested other accommodations for her disability that were recommended by her physician, such as "assistance with clarifying her job function/mentor," and "may require breaks." Pl. Br. [84] at 5-6. But Plaintiff has not cited to any record evidence disputing Defendant's evidence that these accommodations were also provided.
Plaintiff also refers generally in her brief to "forty-two counts of failure to hire." Id. at 3. It is not entirely clear whether Plaintiff is alleging that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation when it failed to hire her for the other positions for which she applied but was rejected. Significantly, however, Plaintiff has not cited to evidence in the record of a single vacant position for which she was qualified, and for which she applied, but was not hired.
In any event, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that "[t]he use of the word 'reasonable' as an adjective for the word 'accommodate' connotes that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation omitted); see also Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). The ADA does not require an employer to create a new job for an employee as a reasonable [*62]  accommodation, or to fire one employee to give her job to another employee with a disability. Although a transfer to a vacant position may be a reasonable accommodation in certain circumstances, the employer does not need "to bump another employee from a position in order to accommodate a disabled employee." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 284-86 (11th Cir. 1997) (a reassignment to a new position is required as a reasonable accommodation only if there is an available, vacant position and concluding that the plaintiff presented no evidence of the existence of any vacant positions).
The Court in applying these standards agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support her claim that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. The ADA did not require Defendant to grant all of Plaintiff's requested transfers, or even her preferred transfers. The undisputed evidence indicates that Plaintiff requested that she be allowed to work in a "less stressful environment," and Defendant accommodated that request when it hired her to work in the PAL position at Wesley Woods. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to [*63]  Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate.

(c) Did Plaintiff Suffer an Adverse Action Because of her Disability?
Finally, Defendant argues that, even assuming that Plaintiff had shown that she was disabled under the ADA, she cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination based on disparate treatment because she has failed to demonstrate that she was subjected to an adverse action because of her alleged disability, and she has also failed to show that the individuals who made the decision to issue a reprimand to her were aware of any alleged disability. Def. Br. at 23-24.
The third and final element of Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007)); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). To establish this element, Plaintiff must show that she suffered an adverse employment action and that her disability was a determining factor in that adverse action. See Haines v. Cherokee Cty., No. 1:08-CV-2916-JOFAJB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71544, 2010 WL 2821853, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010) (citing Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007)), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:08-CV-02916-JOF, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71524, 2010 WL 2821780 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2010). The ADA requires that Plaintiff show that her disability was a "but for" cause of [*64]  the adverse action. McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir. 1996). Further, if Defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for any adverse action, Plaintiff must show that the reason is pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. See Cusick v. Yellowbook, Inc., No. 1:12-CV-3466-WSD, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30896, 2014 WL 949947, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 11, 2014), aff'd, 607 F. App'x 953 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1243 (11th Cir. 2001)).
In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability "when it repeatedly delayed her return to work after requesting a reasonable accommodation because of an actual or apparent disability," and "when it intentionally placed her into a position where she was disparately treated, illegally harassed and retaliated against for requesting an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Am. Compl. at ¶ 150.
Plaintiff's allegation that Defendant "repeatedly delayed her return to work after requesting a reasonable accommodation" appears to be a restatement of her claim above that Defendant failed to accommodate her by placing her into a position immediately after she requested that she be placed in a "less stressful environment." As discussed above, Defendant has shown that, after Plaintiff made her request, she applied for several positions for which she [*65]  was not qualified, but Plaintiff was eventually placed in an equivalent PAL position at Wesley Woods that was less stressful than her previous position in the ED. Significantly, Plaintiff has not cited to any evidence that there was another specific position for which she was qualified but for which Defendant failed to hire her during the period after she requested to be moved to a less stressful environment, but before she was hired in the PAL position at Wesley Woods.
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability "when it intentionally placed her into a position where she was disparately treated, illegally harassed and retaliated against for requesting an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Am. Compl. at ¶ 150. Although it is not entirely clear, the Court assumes that Plaintiff is alleging that EHC discriminated against her when it placed her into the PAL position at Wesley Woods. But it is undisputed that Plaintiff voluntarily accepted the PAL position at Wesley Woods, and approximately one month after starting her job at Wesley Woods, Ms. De Gennaro asked Plaintiff if she liked her new job and Plaintiff responded that [*66]  she was "enjoying the location and Jen [Schuck] is fantastic." Def. SMF at ¶ 41; Read Dec., Ex. B.
Plaintiff does not specifically explain—much less cite to record evidence to substantiate—how she was "disparately treated" in the PAL position, nor does she explain how she was "illegally harassed" in that position.10 In Plaintiff's EEOC Charge filed on March 19, 2018, however, Plaintiff alleged that the written discipline she received on or about February 23, 2018, constituted both disability discrimination and retaliation. Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. Dep., Ex. 28 [82-2] at 71. Thus, the Court assumes that Plaintiff is alleging that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability when it issued her a written reprimand in February of 2018.
An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee. Minnifield v. City of Birmingham Dep't of Police, 791 F. App'x 86, 90 (11th Cir. 2019). In general, for an employment action to be considered an "adverse action" that triggers liability under Title VII or the ADA, [*67]  the law is clear that the decision must result in a material alteration on the terms of employment. See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001) (in the context of a Title VII claim, "Whatever the benchmark, it is clear that to support a claim under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause the employer's action must impact the 'terms, conditions, or privileges' of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way"), overruled on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006); see also Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1016-17 (8th Cir. 1999) ("Minor changes in duties or working conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage do not meet the standard of an adverse employment action"). Proof of "direct economic consequences" is not required, but a plaintiff must show "a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Minnifield, 791 F. App'x at 90 (quoting Davis, 245 F.3d at 1239 (emphasis in original)).
Thus, Defendant argues, Plaintiff cannot base her claim of disability discrimination on her written reprimand because "Plaintiff's written reprimand is not a legally cognizable adverse action because it did not result in a loss of pay or benefit; therefore it was not 'a serious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.'" Def. Br. at 23 (citing Davis, 245 F.3d at 1242 (holding that negative job performance [*68]  evaluations were not adverse employment actions because they had no "tangible impact" on terms of employment); Hooks v. Bank of Am., 183 F. App'x 833, 836 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding written reprimands are not adverse employment actions)).
As discussed, it is undisputed that the written reprimand that Plaintiff received in February of 2018 did not result in a change to Plaintiff's pay, benefits, or employee status. Def. SMF at ¶ 79. It is also undisputed that the written reprimand was later removed from Plaintiff's personnel file. Def. SMF at ¶ 80. Thus, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to show that the reprimand had a "serious and material" effect on her pay or benefits, or any other terms or conditions of her employment. For that reason, Plaintiff cannot establish a claim of disability discrimination based on the written reprimand.
Further, the undersigned agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff also cannot establish a claim of disability discrimination based on the written reprimand because she has failed to cite to any record evidence that the decisionmakers were even aware of her disability at the time they issued her the reprimand. In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, a plaintiff [*69]  must establish that her employer had actual knowledge of her alleged disability or regarded her as disabled. See Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1186 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assoc., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447-48 (11th Cir. 1996).
In this case, it is undisputed that De Gennaro, Schuck, nor Lawrence were not aware that Plaintiff had any type of physical or mental impairment or that she had a disability. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 87-89. Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that EHC discriminated against her because of her disability when the decisionmakers were not even aware of her disability at the time they issued the written reprimand. See Sneed v. Ken Edwards Enterprises, Inc., No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV-LTW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135287, 2009 WL 10668429, at *13-14 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 18, 2009) ("[T]he employer's mere awareness of some symptoms of an employee's alleged disability does not put the employer on notice that the employee is suffering from a disability."), report and recommendation adopted as modified, No. 1:07-CV-1088-RLV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135187, 2009 WL 10672371 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 17, 2009) (employer's awareness that plaintiff injured his back and was "in a lot of pain" was insufficient to establish that employer had actual knowledge of disability); Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 950 (N.D. Ga. 1995) (knowledge that employee suffered from "stress" did not put employer on sufficient notice of employee's disability)).
In Plaintiff's response brief, she also refers generally in her brief to "forty-two counts of failure [*70]  to hire." Pl. Br. at 3. It is not entirely clear, but it appears that Plaintiff is arguing that Defendant's failure to hire her for certain positions were individual acts of disability discrimination. See id. at 14 ("EHC committed forty-two counts of intentional discrimination against Plaintiff by failure to hire Ms. Callahan into a 'vacant' position and failure to allow Ms. Callahan to transfer to a non-discriminatory position at EUHM."). Plaintiff's argument fails for several reasons. First, as noted above, Plaintiff has failed to present evidence of a single position for which she was qualified, and for which she applied, but she was not hired.
Defendant has shown, and Plaintiff has failed to dispute, that Plaintiff applied for many positions for which she did not meet the minimum qualifications and which were not similar to the PAL position in the ED or any position she had held with EHC. Def. SMF at ¶ 22. Plaintiff applied for the positions of HR Director (even though she had no HR experience and had never held a director-level position of any kind), Clinical Data and Regulatory Manager, Project Manager, Data Analyst (even though she had no information technology or management experience [*71]  with the company), Dermatology Clinic Manager, Senior Manager of Patient Experience, Senior Business Manager, and Business Operations Manager and Security Specialist (even though she had no background in security). Def. SMF at ¶ 23. Plaintiff also applied for a handful of jobs similar to her previous roles with EHC and was selected to interview for an Anesthesia Tech position and a Patient Services Coordinator role but these jobs were never filled because the job requisition was cancelled. Def. SMF at ¶ 24.
Plaintiff also interviewed for a second Anesthesia Tech position but she was not hired for that position because she was perceived by the hiring manager as arrogant and overconfident. Def. SMF at ¶ 25. Significantly, however, Plaintiff has failed to cite to any record evidence that she was qualified for that position, or that the decision not to hire her for that position was at all related to her disability. Indeed, she has not cited to any evidence that the individual who made the decision not to hire her was even aware of her disability at the time of that decision.
Second, even if Plaintiff had cited to specific evidence that EHC had failed to hire her for a particular position [*72]  for which she was qualified, a review of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint indicates that she has not based her claim of disability discrimination on EHC's alleged "failure to hire" her for any particular position. See Am. Compl. at ¶ 150. While Plaintiff vaguely alleges that Defendant discriminated against her "when it repeatedly delayed her return to work after requesting a reasonable accommodation," and "when it effectively denied her request for an accommodation," she does not allege that EHC discriminated against her by failing to hire her for any particular position. See id.
"[T]he Court can only consider the claims and theories of liability that Plaintiff actually pled in her complaint." Wilcox v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, No. 8:14-CV-1681-T-24 TGW, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5866, 2015 WL 2092671, at *1 (M.D. Fla. May 5, 2015) (collecting authorities). A plaintiff may not fundamentally change the scope of her claims beyond what is alleged in the pleadings. See Flanigan's Enters., Inc. of Ga. v. Fulton Cty., 242 F.3d 976, 988 (11th Cir. 2001), superseded on other grounds, Buehrle v. City of Key West, 813 F.3d 973, 980 n.3 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that plaintiffs could not bring a constitutional challenge to an entire licensing scheme at the summary judgment stage when the pleadings challenged only one section of it).
Thus, a plaintiff is not permitted to amend [*73]  a complaint in a brief, nor is she permitted to change the basis of her claim at summary judgment. See Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 362 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); Soloski v. Adams, 600 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1365 (N.D. Ga. 2009) (holding that a plaintiff could not pursue a Title VII retaliation claim based on a complaint to a supervisor when his complaint based the claim on his filing of a complaint with the EEOC); see also Tindol v. Ala. Dep't of Revenue, No. 2:13-CV-92-WKW, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7612, 2015 WL 350623, at *24-25 (M.D. Ala. Jan. 23, 2015) ("[plaintiff] is bound to the complaint that he pleaded and which he chose not to amend, and he may not change the theories upon which he seeks relief through summary judgment briefing"); Schambeau Props., LP v. Waffle House, Inc., No. 11-0029-WS-B, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149607, 2011 WL 6934817, at *4-5 (S.D. Ala. Dec. 30, 2011) (rejecting a plaintiff's attempt to claim a new and materially different factual theory for liability at summary judgment than the claim noticed in the complaint).
Third, as Defendant notes, to the extent that Plaintiff is now arguing that EHC discriminated against her when it failed to hire her for any particular position, Defendant argues that any such claim would be barred because Plaintiff failed to raise such a claim in her EEOC Charge. See Def. Reply [86] at 8 ("Plaintiff's belatedly asserted ADA failure-to-hire and failure-to-transfer claims must also be dismissed because they [*74]  were not raised in the EEOC Charge which forms the basis of the instant lawsuit. . . . Noticeably absent from Plaintiff's EEOC charge are any claims relating to the denial of a promotion or transfer, or a failure-to-hire her for a position."). In Plaintiff's EEOC Charge, she alleged solely that EHC discriminated against her when it issued her an "Employee Corrective Disciplinary Notice" on or about February 22, 2018. Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. Dep., Ex. 28 [82-2] at 71.
Before a plaintiff may pursue a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII, she first must exhaust the required administrative remedies. Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001). As a general rule, a plaintiff asserting a claim of employment discrimination under Title VII cannot bring any claim in a lawsuit that was not included in his or her EEOC charge. See Zellars v. Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co., 907 F. Supp. 355, 358 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974). In determining the permissible scope of an employment discrimination complaint brought under Title VII, the district court must first look to the EEOC charge and investigation. Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 696 F.2d 925, 929 (11th Cir. 1983). A plaintiff asserting a claim under Title VII is precluded from pursuing any claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in her EEOC charge, or that could [*75]  not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. Coon v. Georgia Pacific Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1569 (11th Cir. 1987); Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985). Therefore, additional charges in the civil complaint which do not arise naturally and logically from the facts presented to the EEOC are not related to the original charge, and can not be pursued in a civil action under Title VII.
This exhaustion requirement found in Title VII also applies to claims brought under the ADA. See Zillyette v. Capital One Financial Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) ("It is settled law that, under the ADA, plaintiffs must comply with the same procedural requirements to sue as exist under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a))). Thus, plaintiffs bringing claims of employment discrimination under the ADA must file a charge of discrimination before they may pursue their claims in federal court. See Maynard v. Pneumatic Prods. Corp., 256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001). The administrative charge requirement serves the important purpose of giving the charged party notice of the claim and narrowing the issues for prompt adjudication. See Wade v. Sec'y of Army, 796 F.2d 1369, 1377 (11th Cir. 1986) ("The court must keep in mind that the purpose of exhaustion is to give the agency the information it needs to investigate and resolve the dispute between the employee and the employer. Good faith effort by the employee to cooperate with the agency and [*76]  EEOC to provide all relevant, available information is all that exhaustion requires.") (citations omitted). A plaintiff cannot bring a claim in court before first complaining to the EEOC about the alleged act of discrimination. See Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 963 F.2d 1543, 1547 (11th Cir. 1989)).
Consequently, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to any claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure-to-hire because those claims were not included in her EEOC Charge. See, e.g., Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 926 (11th Cir. 2010) (affirming dismissal of claims that were not timely raised in an EEOC Charge).
Accordingly, for all these reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to Count III, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA.
(3) Retaliation under the ADA
In Count IV of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "Title VII ADA Retaliation." Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 152-54. She alleges that "Defendant intentionally and unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff when it retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Id. at ¶ 153.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate [*77]  against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because this provision creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to the prohibition on retaliation found in Title VII, courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997); see also McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1075-77 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Title VII jurisprudence to interpret meaning of ADA provisions in a retaliation case).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is some causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. The third element of a plaintiff's prima facie case of disability retaliation requires the plaintiff to present evidence suggesting a causal link [*78]  between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. In the Title VII context, the Supreme Court has ruled that "retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation." Univ. of Tex. S.W. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). This standard "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Id. This standard is equally applicable to ADA retaliation claims. See Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016).
"Once a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to come forward with legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for its actions that negate the inference of retaliation." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. If the defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff must then present evidence demonstrating that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons are merely a "pretextual ruse designed to mask retaliation." Id.; see also Isenbergh v. Knight-Ridder Newspaper Sales, Inc., 97 F.3d 436, 440 (11th Cir. 1996).
The first prima facie element requires the Plaintiff to show that she engaged in a protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. This element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016). A plaintiff is not required to show that she has an actual disability, but merely that she "had a good faith, objectively [*79]  reasonable belief that [s]he was entitled to [the requested] accommodations under the ADA." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). Defendant does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff engaged in a protected expression under the ADA when she requested a reasonable accommodation for her disability, and the Court finds that her request for an accommodation was a protected activity under the ADA.
The second prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that Defendant subjected her to an adverse employment action after she engaged in a protected activity. As discussed, claims of retaliation under the ADA are generally analyzed under the same standards applicable to claims of retaliation under Title VII. The Eleventh Circuit held in Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453 (11th Cir. 1998), that, as used in the context of a claim of retaliation under Title VII, adverse employment actions are not limited strictly to ultimate employment decisions such as a termination or a failure to promote. Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998) ("Title VII's protection against retaliatory discrimination extends to adverse actions which fall short of ultimate employment decisions."). In Wideman, the court found that a series of incidents involving reprimands and other negative treatment of an employee who had filed an EEOC charge could, [*80]  when taken together, constitute adverse employment actions for the purposes of presenting a prima facie case of retaliation. Id. Nevertheless, although actions falling short of ultimate decisions may still constitute adverse employment actions, "there is some threshold level of substantiality that must be met for unlawful discrimination to be cognizable." Id.
The Supreme Court has held that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII covers a broader scope of conduct than does the anti-discrimination provision. See Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) ("[W]e conclude that Title VII's substantive provision and its anti-retaliation provision are not coterminous. The scope of the anti-retaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm."); see also Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 973 (11th Cir. 2008) ("Under the holding of Burlington, the type of employer conduct considered actionable has been broadened from that which adversely affects the plaintiff's conditions of employment or employment status to that which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related.").
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court reiterated the requirement that the adverse action cannot be merely [*81]  a trivial annoyance but must be significant in order to be actionable as unlawful retaliation.
The anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm. . . . In our view, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. . . . We speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms. Title VII, we have said, does not set forth a general civility code for the American workplace. An employee's decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.
Burlington, 548 U.S. at 67-68 (internal quotes and citations omitted).
Thus, even under this more lenient standard, an allegedly retaliatory act must be more than "trivial" and it must still "produce some injury or harm" to be considered materially adverse. See AuBuchon v. Geithner, 743 F.3d 638, 644 (8th Cir. 2014). For example, in Jarvis v. Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., 460 F. App'x 851, 854, 858-59 (11th Cir. 2012), an employee claimed that the denial of requested training, [*82]  as well as placement on a Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP"), were retaliatory acts. See id. at 858. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's retaliation claim, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that nothing in the record showed how the denial of training or placement on the PIP adversely affected the plaintiff. See id. at 859. The Eleventh Circuit stated that the mere fact that the plaintiff's supervisor believed the training would be useful to the plaintiff did not establish that denial of the training would have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. See id.
In Plaintiff's EEOC Charge filed on March 19, 2018, Plaintiff alleged that the written discipline she received on or about February 23, 2018, constituted both disability discrimination and retaliation. Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. Dep., Ex. 28 [82-2] at 71. As discussed above, it is undisputed that this reprimand resulted in no change to Plaintiff's pay, benefits, or employee status, and the reprimand was later removed from Plaintiff's personnel file. Thus, under the specific facts and circumstances presented in this case, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff [*83]  has failed to show that this reprimand was an adverse employment action for the purpose of either her discrimination claim or her retaliation claim because she has not shown that the reprimand resulted in a material change in her pay or other job conditions.
Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to show that her transfer to the PAL position at Wesley Woods was an adverse action. Indeed, the undisputed evidence indicates that she was offered that position because she had requested a transfer to a "less stressful" environment.
In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA because she has failed to present any evidence that she suffered an adverse employment action after she requested a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Furthermore, even if her reprimand in February of 2018 could be viewed as an adverse action, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence suggesting that her request for an accommodation was a "but for" cause of the reprimand. See Univ. of Tex. S.W. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013).
The evidence presented by Defendant, and undisputed by Plaintiff, indicates that Plaintiff's supervisors made the decision to give her a written reprimand in February of 2018 [*84]  based on the information contained in the Trust Line calls and the reports that Schuck and Lawrence had received from Plaintiff's co-workers regarding Plaintiff's continued inappropriate comments about Officer Pickett. Plaintiff has not cited to any record evidence suggesting that the written reprimand she received on or about February 23, 2018, was at all related to her request for an accommodation made in May of 2017, approximately nine months earlier.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim that Defendant retaliated against her under the ADA, asserted in Count IV.
b. FMLA Claims
In addition to her claims under the ADA, Plaintiff also claims that EHC violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. See Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 142-48.
(1) Standards of Proof under the FMLA
The FMLA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). It is also "unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made [*85]  unlawful by this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). Thus, an employee may assert two types of FMLA claims: interference claims, in which the employee asserts that her employer refused to provide her with the rights granted under the FMLA, and retaliation claims, in which the employee alleges that her employer retaliated against her for exercising her rights under the FMLA or for opposing any activity made unlawful under the FMLA. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1305-08 (11th Cir. 2006); O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2000).
(2) Interference under the FMLA
In Count I of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "FMLA Interference." Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 142-44. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendants [sic] intentionally interfered with Plaintiff's right to exercise his [sic] FMLA rights in violation of the FMLA by failing to reinstate Plaintiff as an employee in any position in a timely fashion when Plaintiff requested to come back to work with a reasonable accommodation." Id. at ¶ 143.
Under the FMLA, it is unlawful "for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided" by the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). "Interfere" is not defined in the FMLA, but regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor explain that "interference" with an employee's [*86]  FMLA rights "would include, for example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but discouraging an employee from using such leave." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(b).
For an employee to establish a claim based on alleged interference with her rights under the FMLA, the employee must demonstrate that she was denied a benefit to which she was entitled under the FMLA, and that she "has been prejudiced by the violation in some way." Evans v. Books-a-Million, 762 F.3d 1288, 1295 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002)); Martin v. Brevard Cty. Pub. Schs., 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008); see also McFadden v. Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP, 611 F.3d 1, 7, 391 U.S. App. D.C. 371 (D.C. Cir. 2010) ("[Plaintiff's] burden is to show both that her employer interfered with . . . the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided by the FMLA . . . and that she was prejudiced thereby." (internal citation and punctuation omitted)). "[A]n employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that [she] was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206-07 (11th Cir. 2001). The employee need not allege that her employer intended to deny the benefit because "the employer's motives are irrelevant." Id. at 1208.
Under the FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to up to 12 weeks of leave each year because of the birth of the employee's child or because of a "serious health condition" that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of her position. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(A), (D). Following such leave, an employee [*87]  is entitled to return to her position or its equivalent unless she "is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition." 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.214, 825.216(c). An essential function is a "fundamental job dut[y] of the [plaintiff's] employment position," as evidenced by the employer's judgment, written job descriptions, the amount of time spent performing the function, and the consequences of allowing the plaintiff not to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1), (3); see also Grace v. Adtran, Inc., 470 F. App'x 812, 815-16 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam).
Plaintiff alleges that "Defendants [sic] intentionally interfered with Plaintiff's right to exercise his [sic] FMLA rights in violation of the FMLA by failing to reinstate Plaintiff as an employee in any position in a timely fashion when Plaintiff requested to come back to work with a reasonable accommodation." Am. Compl. at ¶ 143. This argument fails, as Defendant explains, because Plaintiff was provided all of the FMLA that she had requested and to which she was entitled (along with additional non-FMLA leave), and because any failure to reinstate Plaintiff to the ED after expiration of her leave was at Plaintiff's and her physician's own request. [*88]  Indeed, Plaintiff's physician stated that Plaintiff was unable to work in the ED environment. Plaintiff was not entitled under the FMLA to reinstatement to a position that she was unable to perform. See Grace, 470 F. App'x. at 815-16 (affirming summary grant of summary judgment to employer when employee was unable to perform essential functions of job after FMLA leave).
In Plaintiff's response brief, she focuses on her ADA claims and does not respond to Defendant's arguments regarding her claim of FMLA interference. See Pl. Br. Indeed, it appears that Plaintiff contends that she is not even asserting a claim for interference under the FMLA. See id. at 1 ("Defendant's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is based on an FMLA interference claim that Plaintiff is not claiming"). Accordingly, by failing to respond to Defendant's argument that EHC provided her all of the benefits she was entitled to under the FMLA, Plaintiff has abandoned any claim of FMLA interference. See Resolution Tr. Co. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (explaining that "grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned").
If Plaintiff intended to argue that she was entitled under the FMLA to transfer or be reinstated to a different position, that position is meritless. [*89]  The FMLA provides a right of reinstatement to an existing job, not a transfer to a new job that an employee may prefer. Defendant did not deny Plaintiff her existing job. Rather, it was Plaintiff and her doctor who stated that Plaintiff needed a different job. Although the FMLA did not require more, Defendant nevertheless allowed Plaintiff to apply for transfers and ultimately granted her a transfer that Plaintiff agreed to. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim of interference under the FMLA in Count I.
(3) Retaliation under the FMLA
In Count II of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "FMLA Discrimination/Retaliation." Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 145-48. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendants [sic] intentionally discriminated and/or retaliated against Plaintiff because she exercised and/or attempted to exercise her rights under the FMLA in violation of the FMLA by refusing to reinstate Plaintiff as an employee in any position in a timely fashion when Plaintiff requested to come back to work with a reasonable accommodation." Id. at ¶ 146. She also alleges that "Defendants [sic] intentionally discriminated [*90]  and/or retaliated against Plaintiff because she exercised and/or attempted to exercise her rights under the FMLA in violation of the FMLA by only offering her 2 options to return to work—one of which was not reasonable because of driving distance—and the other was such that it apparently was designed to force Plaintiff to quit—while not selecting her for a number of positions similar to her previous position and suitable to her education and skills and her mental health needs." Id. at ¶ 147.
To establish a claim of retaliation under the FMLA, a plaintiff must present evidence that her employer subjected her to an adverse employment action and intended to discriminate against her for having exercised her rights under the FMLA. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing King v. Preferred Tech. Grp., 166 F.3d 887, 891 (7th Cir. 1999)). Unlike a plaintiff asserting a claim of interference, a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim under the FMLA faces the increased burden of showing that the adverse employment action was "motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus." Id. In the absence of direct evidence, a claim that an employee has been retaliated against for attempting to exercise her rights under the FMLA is analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas framework applied [*91]  to Title VII retaliation claims. Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000).
To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal link between the exercise of her rights under the FMLA and the adverse employment action. Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798; Parris v. Miami Herald Pub. Co., 216 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2000). If Plaintiff meets this burden, Defendant must come forward with a legitimate non discriminatory reason for its action. The burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to demonstrate that the asserted reason is pretextual. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
Plaintiff's FMLA claims fare no better whether categorized as "retaliation" versus "interference." It remains that Defendant did not deny reinstatement to Plaintiff's existing position, did not terminate her when she announced she could not return to that position, and instead facilitated her transfer to a comparable position. Plaintiff adduces no evidence to suggest that the troubles she encountered months later in her new position, with supervisors and co-workers uninvolved in her earlier FMLA leave, had anything at all to do with that earlier leave.
As with her claim of FMLA interference, Plaintiff does not appear to respond to [*92]  Defendant's arguments regarding her claim of FMLA retaliation. See Pl. Br. Accordingly, by failing to respond to Defendant's arguments, Plaintiff has abandoned any claim of FMLA retaliation. See Resolution Tr. Co. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (explaining that "grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned"). Furthermore, for all of the reasons explained at length above, the evidence fails to support any claim of FMLA retaliation.
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under the FMLA in Count II. c. Title VII Claim
In Count IV of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for "Title VII ADA Retaliation." Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 152-54. She alleges that "Defendant intentionally and unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff when it retaliated against her for requesting an accommodation for her actual or apparent disability." Id. at ¶ 153. Thus, although it is not clear, Plaintiff may be asserting a claim of retaliation under Title VII, as well as the ADA.
Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, [*93]  or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Title VII also shields employees from retaliation for certain protected practices, and provides, in relevant part:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because [the employee or applicant] has opposed any practice made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).
To establish a prima facie case of illegal retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must generally show that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity or expression; (2) she received an adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. See, e.g., Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1454 (11th Cir. 1998); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1991); Simmons v. Camden Cty. Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985).
In this case, although Plaintiff cites to Title VII in her Amended Complaint, she has failed to cite to any evidence that she ever engaged in a protected activity under Title VII, which would necessarily involve some opposition to discrimination based on an individual's [*94]  race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Plaintiff's allegations focus entirely on her alleged disability and request for accommodation for her disability, and do not mention any discrimination based on her race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Although Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that she was "sexually harassed" by Lt. Pickett, Plaintiff does not assert any claim of sex discrimination or sexual harassment. See Am. Compl. at ¶ 107 ("[a]lthough not a specific part of this claim, plaintiff was sexually harassed by Lt. Pickett"). Plaintiff also does not allege, nor has she presented any evidence, that she ever complained to anyone at EHC that Lt. Pickett was sexually harassing her, nor does she allege that EHC retaliated against her as a result of that complaint. Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff intended to assert any claim under Title VII, that claim appears to be abandoned.
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under Title VII in Count IV.

II. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
A. Facts
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from [*95]  "Plaintiff's Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of her Motion for Summary Judgment" [71-3] ("Pl. SMF"), "Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts" [80-1] ("Def. Resp. SMF"), and their associated exhibits. As indicated and as needed for clarity, the Court may also draw some facts directly from other material in the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").
As with Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court has excluded assertions of fact by either party that are clearly immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in a party's brief and not in its statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Defendant, as the non-movant. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
Plaintiff was on FMLA leave from March 19, 2017 through May 15, 2017. Pl. SMF at ¶ 1. On May 16, 2017, Plaintiff's treating psychiatrist, Michael S. Conley, M.D., provided a letter to EHC stating that Plaintiff needed [*96]  to be provided a reasonable accommodation to a less stressful department, other than the emergency room, due to "triggers" in the Emergency Room. Pl. SMF at ¶ 1. Plaintiff registered with Emory University Office of Accessibility Services ("OAS") as recommended by EHC employee Teresa Thompson, Case Manager of Occupational Health Services. Pl. SMF at ¶ 2. OAS employee, Toni Sellers Pitts, Associate Director for Faculty and Staff with Disabilities, requested Plaintiff's provider to complete Defendant's Medical Inquiry form, and on May 23, 2017, Dr. Conley completed Defendant's form stating in part that "Patient's anxiety and PTSD cause flareups in her symptoms when dealing with emotional or disturbing situations in the ER, and "Patient needs to be in a more controlled environment than her current position." Pl. SMF at ¶ 3.
Teresa Thompson informed Plaintiff that she received an email from Sharon Barrett, EUH Human Resources Manager, confirming that her employment would not be terminated and that she could receive reassignment for accommodation and referred her to Tausha Harris, Talent Acquisition Specialist. Pl. SMF at ¶ 4; Pl. Dec., Ex. E at 5 [71-4] at 65. Defendant objects to this fact [*97]  on "the grounds that the evidence cited by Plaintiff for the fact that she would 'receive' a reassignment, as opposed to competing with other candidates, does not support this fact." Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 4. In support of this fact, Plaintiff has cited to Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's First Set of Request for Admissions, in which Plaintiff states: "Admit that Aiesha Callahan communicated to Tanya Shockley to the effect that Teresa Thompson informed her that she received an email from Sharon Barrett confirming that her employment would not be terminated and that she could receive reassignment for accommodation and referred her to Tausha Harris, Talent Acquisition Specialist," and Defendant's response is "Admitted." Pl. Dec., Ex. E at 5 [71-4] at 65 (Request No. 12).
Toni Sellers Pitts sent Plaintiff in an email dated May 26, 2017 that stated in part: "The leave office stated that you will remain on leave until such time that you are able to locate another position as your current work location in the Emergency Room is unable to meet you work restrictions and limitations." Pl. SMF at ¶ 5. On June 8, 2017, Melanie De Gennaro informed Plaintiff that she could apply for positions at [*98]  both Emory Healthcare and Emory University. Pl. SMF at ¶ 6.
On May 9, 2019, a discovery dispute call was held in the Judge's chambers regarding three issues. Pl. SMF at ¶ 7. With regards to issue two, Defendant objected based on relevance to responding to certain interrogatories regarding the identities of individuals who were selected for positions for which Plaintiff had applied between May 15, 2017 and July 2017, but the Court overruled Defendant's objections and held that Defendant must, at a minimum, provide the names of the persons. Pl. SMF at ¶ 7.
On January 16, 2020, Plaintiff emailed a letter in an attempt to confer with Defendant regarding discovery responses not received. Pl. SMF at ¶ 8. On January 20, 2020, Plaintiff emailed an amended attempt to confer stating in part, "if all discovery request [sic] are not received by the deadlines, then I will file motions to compel," and that "if the Defendants [sic] will not meet the deadlines, then, I ask to be notified one week prior to the deadline dates." Pl. SMF at ¶ 8. On January 24, 2020, a list of fifty-one positions that Plaintiff applied for between May 15, 2017 and July 31, 2017 were accounted for by Defendant. Pl. SMF at [*99]  ¶ 9. Ten of those positions were not filled by any applicants, the status of three additional positions is unknown, and the list and status of all positions that Plaintiff applied for between May 15, 2017 and July 31, 2017, for Emory University is unknown. Pl. SMF at ¶ 9.
On March 5, 2020, Plaintiff sent an email to Defendant's counsel Toni J. Read and John S. Snelling in which she objected to Defendant's Motion to Extend Discovery for Defendant to depose Plaintiff on March 17, 2020, and also objected to Defendant's request to extend the deadline for filing summary judgment motions to May 8, 2020, based in part on the fact that Plaintiff was not served, or aware of its motion until March 5, 2020, after the Judge's ruling. Pl. SMF at ¶ 10.
On November 28, 2017, Jen Schuck, stated in part, in an email to Toni Sellers Pitts, Sharon Barrett and Cynthia Hall, "She asked about creating a separate work space for her outside of the current information desk area," and "This is not the first time this has occurred as she was moved to EWWH after similar interpersonal challenges at EUH. I do hope we have the opportunity to discuss any 'accommodations' we are asked to make as see this as more of [*100]  a personality issue rather than a medical challenge." Pl. SMF at ¶ 11. On December 1, 2017, in an email to Toni Sellers Pitts, Melanie De Gennaro, and Cynthia Hall, Jen Schuck stated in part, "Her inability to interact with others may be more related to her poor interpersonal skills and what feels like 'splitting behavior,'" and that Plaintiff had an "inability to interact with others," "Poor interpersonal skills," and was "passive aggressive" and was regarded as demonstrating "splitting behavior." Pl. SMF at ¶ 12.
Plaintiff's remaining "facts" are largely comprised of Plaintiff's contention that Defendant made various "false" statements in its EEOC Position Statement in response to Plaintiff's EEOC Charge. See Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 13-20, 22-40. Defendant has objected to Plaintiff's contention that Defendant made "false" statements in its EEOC Position Statement "on the grounds that Plaintiff's summary conclusion that factual assertions and legal arguments presented in Defendant's position statement are 'false' with no explanation as to why, does not comport with Local Rule 56.1B(1)," and "the evidence cited by Plaintiff does not support her conclusion." See, e.g., Def. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 13-20, 22-40. The Court [*101]  sustains Defendant's objection on the ground that Plaintiff merely states Defendant's statements in its EEOC Position Statement are "false" without any explanation as to how or why the alleged statements are "false," nor does Plaintiff provide any citations to evidence to support her allegation that certain statements made by Defendant are "false." To the extent that Plaintiff has identified any dispute regarding any of the statements in Defendant's EEOC Position statement, the dispute is related to issues that are immaterial to Plaintiff's claims in this case.
B. Discussion
As discussed above, in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff claims that EHC discriminated against her on the basis of a disability, and retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability, in violation of the ADA. Plaintiff also claims that EHC violated the FMLA and Title VII. In her brief in support of her Motion for Summary Judgment,11 however, Plaintiff addresses only her ADA claims and fails to discuss her claims under the FMLA and Title VII. See Pl. Br. [71-1] at 13-15 (discussing legal standards under the ADA). Accordingly, the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks only partial [*102]  summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims under the ADA. See Pl. Reply Br. [85] at 4 (Plaintiff states that Defendant has moved for summary judgment "on an FMLA Interference claim that Plaintiff is not claiming").
The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish that she is entitled to summary judgment on her ADA claims. Plaintiff contends in her brief that she has brought "forty-two counts of failure to hire," and "one count of discriminatory retaliation." Pl. Br. at 3, 8. With respect to her claim that she has brought "forty-two counts of failure to hire," as discussed above in connection with Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff did not include any claim based on an alleged "failure to hire" in her EEOC Charge or her Amended Complaint. More importantly, Plaintiff has not cited to any evidence in the record of a single vacant position for which she was qualified, and for which she applied, but was not hired, nor has she presented any evidence that Defendant's failure to hire her for any particular position was at all related to her alleged disability.
As discussed, the Eleventh Circuit has made clear that "[t]he use of the word 'reasonable' as an adjective [*103]  for the word 'accommodate' connotes that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation omitted); see also Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). Thus, as explained at length above, EHC was not required to transfer Plaintiff to a position for which there was no vacancy, create a new position just for her, or agree to Plaintiff's preferred transfer. This in itself disposes of Plaintiff's meritless reference to "forty-two" counts of failure to hire, which appears to assume that Defendant was required to place her into any position for which she applied.
As for Plaintiff's complaint that Defendant denied her the discovery to which she was entitled as to these forty-two positions, the time for Plaintiff to seek a remedy for any such violation (assuming there was one) has long since passed. The docket reflects that, on May 9, 2019, the undersigned held a telephone conference with the parties to resolve a discovery dispute. See Minute Order [39]. The undersigned noted that Defendant had objected on the basis of relevance to responding to certain interrogatories regarding the identities of individuals who were selected for positions for which Plaintiff [*104]  had applied between May 15, 2017, and July of 2017, but the Court "over-ruled the Defendant's objections on relevance grounds and held that Defendant must, at a minimum, provide the names of the persons." Id.
Significantly, at the time of that telephone conference on May 9, 2019, Plaintiff was represented by counsel, who did not withdraw as her counsel in this case until November 4, 2019. See Order [58]. But even assuming that Plaintiff is correct that Defendant violated that order and failed to provide the requested names of the individuals, there is no indication in the record that Plaintiff's counsel ever brought that dispute to the attention of the Court or made any other attempt to seek to compel Defendant to provide the information before the discovery period expired. The time to challenge the sufficiency of Defendant's discovery responses was during the discovery period, using the specific procedures set forth in the Scheduling Order. See Scheduling Order [26] dated March 26, 2019. Thus, Plaintiff's argument in her Motion for Summary Judgment that Defendant committed a "willful violation" of a discovery order is untimely.
Plaintiff also argues that she has brought "one count of [*105]  discriminatory retaliation." Pl. Br. at 8. Plaintiff argues that Melanie De Gennaro "further interfered" with her request for a reasonable accommodation when she offered Plaintiff "a created position at Emory University Hospital at Wesley Woods," but Plaintiff only accepted the PAL position at Wesley Woods "under duress with the assumption that she was receiving a reasonable accommodation in the same city of which she lived, per her May 2015 accommodation request." Id. Plaintiff argues that, after she was assigned to work at Wesley Woods, she "experienced disparate treatment, harassment and retaliation for engaging in protected activities." Id. But as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to cite to any record evidence to support her claim that she suffered disparate treatment, harassment, or retaliation when she worked at Wesley Woods.
In sum, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has failed to cite to record evidence to support her claim that EHC violated the ADA by discriminating against her on the basis of her alleged disability, or retaliating against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion [*106]  for Summary Judgment [71] be DENIED.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [78] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [71] be DENIED and Plaintiff's Objection [87] be OVERRULED.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 7th day of January, 2021.
