Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant KLS Martin, L.P.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 73). Having considered the motion, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines the motion should be granted.

I. BACKGROUND
This is an employment discrimination dispute. Plaintiff Lauren Versaggi ("Versaggi") worked as a cardiothoracic sales specialist for Defendant KLS Martin L.P. ("KLS"), a surgical medical supplies company, from 2012 to 2018. Beginning in early 2016, Versaggi was harassed and cyberstalked1 by an unknown person. In November of 2016, she learned the perpetrator was Cynthia Mendoza ("Mendoza"), the girlfriend of her co-worker, Royal Smith ("Smith"). Versaggi developed [*2]  an anxiety disorder as a result of the months of cyberstalking and harassment. On March 15, 2018, Versaggi resigned. On December 6, 2018, Versaggi filed a charge of discrimination (the "Charge") with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the "EEOC") and the Texas Workforce Commission Civil Rights Division, alleging discrimination based on her sex and disability by her former employer KLS. Versaggi alleges KLS failed to reasonably accommodate her disability by requiring her to work with Smith whose girlfriend cyberstalked and harassed her. Versaggi also alleges KLS created a hostile work environment based on her sex and disability by failing to remediate or properly investigate the harassment and Smith's potential involvement in it.
Based on the foregoing, on June 25, 2019, Versaggi commenced this lawsuit in the Harris County District Court for the 113th Judicial District against KLS asserting claims for: (1) failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"); and (2) hostile work environment under the ADA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII").2 On August 9, 2019, KLS removed the action on the basis of both federal question and diversity [*3]  jurisdiction. On July 30, 2021, KLS moved for summary judgment on all Versaggi's claims.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant. Coleman v. Hous. Indep. Sch. Dist., 113 F.3d 528, 533 (5th Cir. 1997). Initially, the movant bears the burden of presenting the basis for the motion and the elements of the causes of action upon which the nonmovant will be unable to establish a genuine dispute of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine dispute for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586-87, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "A dispute about a material fact is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Bodenheimer v. PPG Indus., Inc., 5 F.3d 955, 956 (5th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).
But the nonmoving party's bare allegations, standing alone, are insufficient to create a material dispute of fact and defeat a motion for summary. If a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmoving party, then summary judgment is appropriate. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 248. The nonmovant's burden cannot be satisfied by "conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or [*4]  'only a scintilla of evidence.'" Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)).
Furthermore, it is not the function of the Court to search the record on the nonmovant's behalf for evidence which may raise a fact issue. Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1137 n.30 (5th Cir. 1992). Therefore, "[a]lthough we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings, but must respond by setting forth specific facts indicating a genuine issue for trial." Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, 202 F.3d 730, 735 (5th Cir. 2000).

III. LAW & ANALYSIS
KLS moves for summary judgment, contending Versaggi cannot establish any of her claims. Versaggi contends: (1) she was denied reasonable accommodation for her disability; (2) she was subject to retaliation and a hostile work environment as a result of requesting accommodations for her disability; and (3) she was subject to a hostile work environment based on her gender. The Court addresses each claim in turn.

1. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA
Versaggi contends KLS failed to accommodate her request of being separated from Smith, a fellow sales employee, after she learned he was associated with the woman who stalked her from January to November of 2016.3 KLS contends: [*5]  (1) Versaggi did not alert KLS of her disability until January of 2018, nearly two years after her request for accommodation; and (2) her requested accommodation was not reasonable. "To succeed on a failure-to-accommodate claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) [she] is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by the covered entity; and (3) the entity failed to make reasonable accommodations." Smith v. Harris Cnty., 956 F.3d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 2020). Under the ADA, a "qualified individual with a disability" is "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Whether an impairment is substantially limiting depends on "its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact." Dupre v. Charter Behav. Health Sys. of Lafayette Inc., 242 F.3d 610, 614 (5th Cir. 2001). Under the ADA, an employer must "make 'reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual.'" Delaval v. PTech Drilling Tubulars, LLC, 824 F.3d 476, 479 (5th Cir. 2016) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). Generally, if the "disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, the [*6]  initial burden rests primarily upon the employee . . . to specifically identity the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216, 224 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)). While the ADA does afford the right to a reasonable accommodation, it does not require a plaintiff be given her preferred accommodation. E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distrib., LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009).
Versaggi contends KLS denied her requests for accommodation made on November 21, 2016 and December 5, 2016.4 Versaggi also concedes she did not inform KLS of her alleged disability until January 8, 2018, nearly thirteen months after she first requested accommodations.5 On January 8, 2018, Versaggi requested that she be excused from attending a national sales meeting, which Smith planned to attend. After Versaggi presented proof of her alleged disability to Moe, she was not required to attend the meeting.6 The ADA only requires employers accommodate impairments known to the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Versaggi's alleged disability was not obvious or apparent, thus KLS was not on notice of Versaggi's alleged disability. Versaggi made the November 21, 2016 and December 5, 2016 requests because of safety concerns, which was the reason she gave to Gardner,7 but these concerns were not sufficient [*7]  to put KLS on notice of Versaggi's alleged disability. Further, Versaggi was not diagnosed with her alleged disability until April of 2017.8 KLS did not know of Versaggi's alleged disability until after she requested accommodations when she provided proof of that alleged disability on January 8, 2018. The Court finds Versaggi failed to meet her burden as to her requested accommodations prior to January 8, 2018.9 As for her January 8, 2018 request, the Court finds KLS accommodated her by excusing her from attending the meeting. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted as to Versaggi's failure to accommodate claim.

2. Hostile Work Environment Claims
KLS contends Versaggi's hostile work environment claims fail because: (1) she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; and (2) even if exhausted, [*8]  the alleged incidents are insufficient to support her hostile work environment claims. Versaggi contends she exhausted her administrative remedies and raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether KLS's alleged behavior created a hostile work environment.
A plaintiff suing under the ADA or Title VII must exhaust all administrative remedies before filing a civil lawsuit. Thomas v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 627 F. App'x 332, 336 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (requiring exhaustion of remedies in the ADA context); Castro v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Just., 541 F. App'x 374, 379 (5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (requiring exhaustion of remedies for Title VII claims). "Private sector employees must satisfy this requirement by filing an administrative charge with the EEOC." McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 519 F.3d 264, 273 (5th Cir. 2008). When determining if a charge properly exhausts a claim, a court should construe the charge broadly but also "only find a claim exhausted if it could have been 'reasonably . . . expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.'" Richardson v. Porter Hedges, LLC, 22 F. Supp. 3d 661, 665 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (Hittner, J.) (quoting McClain, 519 F.3d at 273). This assessment involves "a fact-intensive analysis of the plaintiffs statement in the charge that looks slightly beyond the four-corners of the charge to the substance." Id. (citing Pacheco v. Mineta, 448 F.3d 783, 789 (5th Cir. 2010)).
"To establish a hostile-work-environment claim, [the plaintiff] must show that: (1) [she] belongs to a protected group, (2) was subject [*9]  to unwelcome harassment (3) based on [her] [protected status], (4) which affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment, and (5) [the employer] knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial action." Thompson v. Microsoft Corp., 2 F.4th 460, 470-71 (5th Cir. 2021). "Harassment affects a 'term, condition, or privilege of employment' if it is 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment.'" Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 670 F.3d 644, 651 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Ramsey v. Henderson, 286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir. 2002)). However, "simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious)" are not sufficient to alter the terms or conditions of employment. Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998). In determining if a work environment is hostile, the court should examine the "totality of circumstances, including 'the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Patton v. Jacobs Eng'g Grp., Inc., 874 F.3d 437, 445 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Ramsey, 286 F.3d at 268).

a. Hostile Work Environment Claim Under the ADA
KLS contends Versaggi's hostile work environment claim fails because: (1) she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; and (2) she concedes the hostile work environment was [*10]  caused by Mendoza's cyberstalking, and not by any actions by KLS. Versaggi contends the Charge contains sufficient facts to support her hostile work environment claim, and the cyberstalking coupled with KLS's failure to investigate Smith's involvement the cyberstalking constitutes hostile work environment. The Court first analyzes the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement before analyzing the elements of the claim.
In the Charge, Versaggi contends rude comments made by Moe during a phone call where Versaggi requested an accommodation were also harassment, creating a hostile work environment.10 For example, Moe allegedly told Versaggi she "need[s] to act like an adult" and "move on" from the cyberstalking when Versaggi said she did not want to attend a sales meeting where Smith was expected to attend.11 Versaggi also alleges Moe told her "Smith may be a victim too" which she deemed to be offensive and insensitive.12 Versaggi also contends she was retaliated against for requesting an accommodation by receiving a written warning, and discriminated against due to KLS's refusal to investigate Smith's involvement in Mendoza's harassment. Giving these facts the broadest reading, Versaggi's [*11]  allegations are likely sufficient to show an investigation would reasonably grow from the Charge. Thus, the Court finds Versaggi exhausted her administrative remedies as to the hostile work environment claim under the ADA. The Court proceeds to the analysis of the elements of the claim.
In her response, Versaggi argues her hostile work environment claims are "predicated on [the] continuous harassment, stalking, and cyberbullying by Smith's girlfriend and, by implication, Smith."13 She further alleges KLS did not conduct an investigation reasonably calculated to "end the harassment or take prompt remedial action."14 As a threshold matter, this contention does not allege she was subject to unwelcome harassment based on a disability. Rather, Versaggi contends that the cyberstalking and harassment caused her disability.15 Versaggi also contends KLS should not have accepted Smith's "blanket denial" of any involvement and should have investigated him more thoroughly. However, Smith was never charged in connection with Mendoza's cyberstalking.16 While [*12]  it appears Mendoza got Versaggi's contact information from Smith's work phone, Versaggi concedes the cyberstalking and harassment stopped following her arrest.17 Further, Versaggi concedes she never had any contact with Smith after her request to be kept away from him.18 Since the harassment had stopped by the time Versaggi notified KLS of it, there was no further remedial action KLS could have taken (notwithstanding the fact Mendoza was not a KLS employee). The Court finds KLS's actions following Versaggi's reporting of the harassment are not sufficient to establish a hostile work environment based on her disability. The Court further finds Moe's alleged statements are not sufficient to establish a hostile work environment based on Versaggi's disability, either. Moe's statements were made during one phone call, and Versaggi does not allege multiple incidents of similar comments. Offhand remarks and isolated incidents are insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim. See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788. Thus, the Court finds Versaggi's hostile work environment claim under the ADA fails. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted as to her hostile work environment claim under the ADA.

b. Hostile Work Environment Under Title VII
KLS contends Versaggi's gender-based hostile work environment claim under Title VII fails because Versaggi failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to that claim. Versaggi contends she raised sufficient facts in the Charge to support her hostile work environment claim. When broadly read, the facts in support of Versaggi's hostile work environment claim all relate to her requests for accommodation and KLS's alleged denial of those accommodations for her disability, and not any discriminatory actions based on her gender.19 A claim is exhausted only if an investigation could have reasonably expected to grow out of the charge. Richardson, LLC, 22 F. Supp. 3d at 665. Even under the broadest reading of the Charge, Versaggi failed to allege any facts that might reasonably have led to an investigation of her gender-based hostile work environment claim. The Court finds Versaggi failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. [*14]  Accordingly, summary judgment is granted as to her hostile work environment claim under Title VII.

3. Retaliation Claim
KLS contends Versaggi raises new retaliation claim in her response to the motion for summary judgment. Versaggi contends her claim was properly pleaded in the original petition. "A claim which is not raised in the complaint, but rather, is raised only in response to a motion for summary judgment is not properly before the court." Cutrera v. Bd. of Supervisors of La. State Univ., 429 F.3d 108, 113 (5th Cir. 2005). To meet the pleading standard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a Plaintiff must set out a "plain statement of the of the claims showing that the [plaintiff] is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).
Versaggi contends "her Petition contains 'retaliation' language to support her retaliation claim."20 This "retaliation language" in Versaggi's original petition consists of a handful of references to alleged retaliatory behavior by KLS.21 Versaggi alleges KLS "retaliat[ed] against her" for "reporting her diagnosed disability and insisting that [KLS] adequately investigate her situation."22 The alleged retaliatory behavior consisted of a written warning based on a laboratory session Versaggi conducted with [*15]  a client, on February 22, 2018.23 Versaggi did not include a separate retaliation cause of action in her original petition, but referenced this alleged retaliatory incident in her hostile work environment claims. Versaggi failed to include a retaliation cause of action in her original petition or otherwise meet the pleading standard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Instead, Versaggi does not assert a retaliation cause of action until her response to the motion for summary judgment. A claim raised in response to a motion for summary judgment is not properly before the court. Cutrera, 429 F.3d at 113. Thus, the Court finds Versaggi's newly raised retaliation claim is not properly before the Court.

4. Constructive Discharge Claim
KLS contends Versaggi raises a new constructive discharge claim in her response to the motion for summary judgment. Versaggi contends her constructive discharge claim was properly pleaded in the original petition. "A claim which is not raised in the complaint, [*16]  but rather, is raised only in response to a motion for summary judgment is not properly before the court." Cutrera, 429 F.3d at 113. To meet the pleading standard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a Plaintiff must set out a "plain statement of the of the claims showing that the [plaintiff] is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A plaintiff who advances a constructive discharge claim stemming from a hostile work environment claim "must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign," beyond what is necessary for a hostile work environment claim. Pa. State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 147, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004); see Manjudano v. City of Pharr, 786 F. App'x 434, 437 (5th Cir. 2019) (per curiam).
The phrase "constructive discharge" does not appear in her original petition. Versaggi states her original petition contains "language to infer a 'constructive discharge' claim."24 While Versaggi did mention she was constructively discharged once in the Charge, she did not link it to any specific facts alleged in the Charge.25 Versaggi's original petition states in the hostile work environment causes of action the conduct described therein "was so severe or pervasive that reasonable persons in Plaintiff's positions [sic] would find their work environment to be hostile or abusive."26 However, this statement [*17]  is not sufficient to put a defendant on notice of a constructive discharge claim deriving from a hostile work environment claim. See Suders, 542 U.S. at 147. The language in the original petition does not meet the pleading standard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Court finds Versaggi's constructive discharge claim was not properly pleaded. Versaggi's newly raised constructive discharge claim thus is not properly before the Court. Accordingly, the motion is granted as to the failure to accommodate and hostile work environment claims.
