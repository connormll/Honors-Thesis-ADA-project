Opinion


REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
The court submits this Report and Recommendation [*2]  to the Honorable Fred W. Slaughter, United States District Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636 and General Order No. 05-07 of the United States District Court for the Central District of California. For the reasons set forth below, the court recommends the disposition set forth below in the recommendation.

I.

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT PROCEEDINGS
On April 20, 2021, Plaintiff Beatrice Essah filed a First Amended Complaint ("FAC").1 (Dkt. No. 37.) The FAC names as defendants the Los Angeles Unified School District ("LAUSD"), the Governing Board of LAUSD ("Board"), and the following individuals, who are described by the positions they held at relevant times: LAUSD Superintendent John Deasy; LAUSD Superintendent Austin Buetner; LAUSD operations officer David Holmquist; Board members Steve Zimmer, Monica Garcia, George McKenna III, Monica Ratliff, Ref Rodriguez, Scott Schmerelson, and Richard Vladovic; San Fernando Middle School Principal Freddy Ortiz and Assistant Principal Michael Harrington; Chief Human Resources Officer Vivian Ekchian; and Chief Human Resources Director Justo Avila. (FAC ¶¶ 10-23.) Plaintiff sued Defendant Buetner solely in his official capacity and all other defendants solely in their individual [*3]  capacities. (Id.) The FAC also refers to Defendant Chait, who was named as a defendant in the original complaint and has appeared in this action, but he is not listed in the "Parties" section.
On July 1, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 43.) Plaintiff filed an opposition. (Dkt. No. 47.) Defendants did not file a reply. The motion was taken under submission.

II.

ALLEGATIONS IN FAC
At relevant times, Plaintiff was "a permanent, certificated special education teacher" employed by LAUSD and "approaching the age of 55 when she would have vested in her right to fully paid medical insurance benefits for the rest of her life." (FAC ¶ 4.) She is an African-American born in Ghana. (Id. ¶ 37.)
Plaintiff suffers from corn allergy, a disability under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940 et seq., that could potentially result in anaphylactic shock. (Id. ¶ 38.) Plaintiff's disability was "informally accommodated for approximately four years," but after Defendant Ortiz exposed her to corn products, she was compelled to file a formal request for reasonable accommodation. (Id. ¶¶ 39-40.)
Plaintiff does not know the reason she was "targeted for dismissal," but believes the primary motivation was that she [*4]  was close to qualifying for lifetime medical benefits under the "Rule of 80." (Id. ¶¶ 41-42.) "Defendant Deasy instituted a "zero tolerance" policy that resulted in hundreds of teachers being removed from their classrooms without being informed of the reasons, most of them experienced teachers over 40. (Id. ¶¶ 44-45.) Under this policy, "Defendants attempted to save money by 'persuading' senior teachers who had not yet reached age 55 and attained the 'Rule of 80' to resign by compiling a file of 'charges' and threatening them with dismissal if they refused." (Id. ¶ 53.) "LAUSD makes it known" that a teacher who challenges a dismissal will suffer financially because LAUSD's practice is to charge every teacher with immorality and/or wilful refusal to perform regular assignments, resulting in immediate suspension. (Id. ¶ 55.)
Defendants Ortiz and Harrington increased the number of observations of Plaintiff, took detailed notes, and held conferences with her but refused to listen to her explanations of her teaching practices. (Id. ¶ 57.) Plaintiff sought another position with LAUSD and was offered a similar position in 2013, but Defendant Ortiz issued her an unsatisfactory evaluation, preventing [*5]  her transfer. (Id. ¶ 58.) Plaintiff grieved the unsatisfactory evaluation and the observations increased, ultimately resulting in a 153-paragraph statement of charges. (Id. ¶ 59.)
Plaintiff was removed from her classroom without warning and was presented with a "collection of charges," none of which involved the health and welfare of her students. (Id. ¶¶ 48-49.) She was charged with immorality and wilful refusal to perform regular assignments, based on entries in observation logs that included allegations such as sitting next to a student, walking around the classroom, and failing to have the daily agenda posted. (Id. ¶ 56.)
Defendants ignored Plaintiff's rights under Skelly v. State Personnel Bd., 15 Cal. 3d 194, 124 Cal. Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d 774 (1975). (Id. ¶ 28.) Plaintiff was never provided a Skelly hearing because the conferences she attended did not comply with Skelly requirements. (Id. ¶ 64.) Plaintiff sets forth at length why LAUSD's procedures do not comply with Skelly. (Id. ¶¶ 65-79.)
Plaintiff alleges that this action arises under 42 U.S.C §§ 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988. (Id. ¶ 1.) The title of the FAC states that the complaint is for constitutional violations, failure to accommodate disability, Bane Act violations, and declaratory and injunctive relief (id. at 1), but the body of the complaint does not [*6]  contain a cause of action labeled constitutional violations. The FAC contains the following causes of action: (1) the second cause of action for failure to accommodate disability under the FEHA (id. at ¶¶ 80-107); (2) the third cause of action for Bane Act violations (id. at ¶¶ 108-119); and (3) the fourth cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief (id. at ¶¶ 120-23). There is no first cause of action. In her prayer for relief, Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. (id. at 17.)

III.

LEGAL STANDARDS
"To survive a motion to dismiss [under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)], a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it 'stops short of the line [*7]  between possibility and plausibility of "entitlement to relief."''" Id. (citations omitted).
The tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. Id. at 678; Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "In sum, for a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory 'factual content,' and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief." Moss v. U.S. Secret Service, 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).
A pro se complaint is to be liberally construed. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam). Before dismissing a pro se civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff should be given a statement of the complaint's deficiencies and an opportunity to cure them unless it is clear the deficiencies cannot be cured by amendment. Eldridge v. Block, 832 F.2d 1132, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 1987). Nevertheless, "[u]nder Ninth Circuit case law, district courts are only required to grant leave to amend if a complaint can possibly be saved. Courts are not required to grant leave to amend if a complaint lacks merit entirely." Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1129 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).

IV.

DISCUSSION
Defendants have moved for dismissal on the following [*8]  grounds: (1) the Board is not a properly named party; (2) Plaintiff cannot maintain a § 1983 claim against LAUSD and its employees; (3) Plaintiff fails to state a claim under § 1985 and § 1981; (4) there is no separate cause of action under § 1988; (5) Plaintiff fails to state a claim under the Bane Act; (6) Plaintiff cannot state a FEHA claim against the individual defendants, has not exhausted her administrative remedies as to them, and has not alleged sufficient facts to support a FEHA claim; (7) the cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief is improper; and (8) Plaintiff cannot obtain punitive damages against LAUSD and has not alleged facts supporting punitive damages against the individual defendants.

A. Claims against Board
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot sue the Board but only LAUSD, and that the Board should be dismissed as a defendant. (Dkt. No. 43 at 16.) The California Education Code provides: "In the name by which the district is designated the governing board may sue and be sued, and hold and convey property for the use and benefit of the school district." Cal. Educ. Code § 35162.
"California law makes clear that the Board is the District for the purposes of litigation." Roe v. San Jose Unified Sch. Dist. Bd., No. 20-CV-02798-LHK, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16633, 2021 WL 292035, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2021). Section 35162 authorizes suit on the governing [*9]  board of the school district, albeit in the name of the school district, and at least some courts have permitted suit to proceed against school boards in their own name. See Trustees of the S. Cal. IBEW-NECA Pension Plan v. Mega Lighting, Inc., No. 08-03781 MMM (Ex), 2008 WL 11336187, at *10 & n. 33 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 27, 2008) (discussing case law); A.M. v. Westside Union Sch. Dist., No. CV 08-893 CAS (MANx), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72633, 2008 WL 2915339, at *3 (C.D. Cal. July 25, 2008) (declining to dismiss school board as redundant defendant). The court declines to recommend dismissal of the Board as a redundant defendant at this time.2

B. Section 1983
The FAC mentions § 1983 but does not contain a cause of action labeled as arising under § 1983. Defendants treat the FAC as asserting §1983 claims and move to dismiss them.

1. Claims against LAUSD and Official Capacity Claim
Defendants move for dismissal on the grounds that LAUSD and its employees are not "persons" for purposes of § 1983.
The Supreme Court has held that a state is not a "person" within the meaning of § 1983 and cannot be sued under its provisions. Will v. Michigan v. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 64-65, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989). California school districts are state agencies. Belanger v. Madera Unified Sch. Dist., 963 F.2d 248, 253-54 (9th Cir. 1992) (affirming dismissal of § 1983 suit against school district on grounds it is state agency immune from suit in federal court under Eleventh Amendment). Thus, they are not subject to suit under § 1983. Kirchman v. Lake Elsinore Unified Sch. Dist., 83 Cal. App. 4th 1098, 1115 (2000) (agreeing with Belanger that California school districts are state agencies and dismissing § 1983 claim because school district was not "person").
Whether a defendant is a "person" under § 1983 is intertwined [*10]  with whether the Eleventh Amendment shields it from suit in federal court, but they are distinct concepts. Will, 491 U.S. at 66-57. Defendant LAUSD has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by removing this action from state court to federal court. See Walden v. Nev., 945 F.3d 1088, 1094 (9th Cir. 2019) ("a State defendant that removes a case to federal court waives its immunity from suit on all federal-law claims in the case"), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 871 (2020). Its waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, however, does not affect the issue of whether it is a "person" under § 1983. See Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 616-17, 624, 122 S. Ct. 1640, 152 L. Ed. 2d 806 (2002) (determining state's removal to federal court waived Eleventh Amendment immunity, but noting no viable § 1983 claim existed because state is not "person" under § 1983); see also, e.g., Strong v. Wash., No. 2:20-CV-0461-TOR, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26650, 2021 WL 510621, at *2 (E.D. Wash. Feb. 11, 2021) ("[T]he defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity is separate and distinct from the issue of whether Defendants are 'persons' within the definition of § 1983."); Rapley v. Oregon Dep't of Human Servs., No. 3:17-cv-00294-YY, 2017 WL 2927164, at *8 (D. Or. June 19, 2017) ("While it is true that removal waives 11th Amendment immunity, this waiver does not change the requirement that Section 1983 claims must be brought against persons, not states and their agencies.") Defendant LAUSD, therefore, is not a "person" subject to suit under § 1983.
State officials sued in their official capacity for damages are also not persons for purposes of § 1983. Will, 491 U.S. at 71. However, "a state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because [*11]  'official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.'" Id. at 71 n.10 (citing Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167 n. 14, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985), and Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-160, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1980)).
It is therefore recommended that Plaintiff's §1983 claims against LAUSD and her § 1983 claims for damages against Defendant Buetner in his official capacity be dismissed without leave to amend because this defect is incurable.

2. Individual Capacity Claims
To state a claim under § 1983, Plaintiff must allege that a specific defendant, while acting under color of state law, deprived her of a right guaranteed under the Constitution or a federal statute. West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1988).
Plaintiff contends that Defendants violated her due process rights by dismissing her without complying with the pre-termination procedures set forth by the California Supreme Court in Skelly. (FAC ¶¶ 28, 60-79.) Defendants do not challenge the adequacy of Plaintiff's allegations to state a violation of federal due process, and the court expresses no view regarding whether Plaintiff has alleged a due process violation. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985) (setting forth elements of pre-deprivation due process for public employees with protectible property interest in employment); see also Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 929, 117 S. Ct. 1807, 138 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1997). Defendants argue only that Plaintiff seeks to hold them vicariously liable for the purported [*12]  due process violations by virtue of their positions as "LAUSD's current and former Superintendents, current and former Board Members, current General Counsel, and former Chief Human Resources Officer" because they have "ultimate authority under color of state law to make and execute personnel policy for LAUSD." (Dkt. 43 at 18.)
As an initial matter, Defendants' argument regarding vicarious liability pertains only to Defendants Deasy, Holmquist, Zimmer, Garcia, McKenna, Ratliff, Rodriguez, Schmerelson, Vladovic, and Ekchian, whom Defendants identify by their past or present positions, and does not apply to Defendant Buetner, who is not sued in his individual capacity, or to Defendants Ortiz, Harrington, Avila, and Chait, whom Defendants do not mention. Indeed, the FAC alleges that Defendants Ortiz, Harrington, Avila, and Chait were personally involved in Plaintiff's dismissal. (See FAC ¶¶ 24, 36, 57, 58, 72.)
Section 1983 suits cannot be based on vicarious liability. OSU Student Alliance v. Ray, 699 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2012). "[E]ach government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to . . . § 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, [*13]  through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution." Id. at 676. A defendant may be held liable as a supervisor under § 1983 if there exists either (1) personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection between the supervisor's wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation. Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011).
Plaintiff's allegations against Defendants Deasy, Holmquist, Zimmer, Garcia, McKenna, Ratliff, Rodriguez, Schmerelson, Vladovic, and Ekchian appear to be premised on an alleged scheme to dismiss senior teachers nearing the vesting of lifetime medical benefits. Plaintiff, however, has not adequately linked each of these defendants to alleged due process violations in connection with her own dismissal. For instance, Plaintiff alleges that "the individual board members were served with notice of the misconduct alleged herein by letter dated December 8, 2011." (FAC ¶ 9.) According to the FAC, Plaintiff was not "targeted for dismissal" until after 2012, and her dismissal proceedings commenced in 2015. (Id. ¶¶ 48, 58, 101.) Plaintiff's allegations attempting to link these defendants to the purported denial of her Skelly rights are purely conclusory.3 (Id. ¶ 28.) "Vague [*14]  and conclusory allegations of official participation in civil rights violations are not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss." Ivy v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Alaska, 673 F.2d 266, 267 (9th Cir. 1982).
While Plaintiff purports to act "on behalf of herself and all other similarly situated permanent certificated LAUSD employees who have been targeted for dismissal because they would soon have vested lifetime, fully paid medical benefits" (FAC ¶ 4), she is a pro se litigant and cannot assert the rights of others. See Johns v. Cty. of San Diego, 114 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir. 1997); United States v. Mitchell, 915 F.2d 521, 526 n.8 (9th Cir. 1990) (pro se litigant does not have standing to raise claims of other persons whose rights may have been violated). Plaintiff must base a due process claim against each individual defendant on that defendant's role in her own dismissal.
It is therefore recommended that Plaintiff's § 1983 claims be dismissed as against Defendants Deasy, Holmquist, Zimmer, Garcia, McKenna, Ratliff, Rodriguez, Schmerelson, Vladovic, and Ekchian with leave to amend. If Plaintiff elects to re-allege these claims, she must do so in a separately labeled cause of action with adequate supporting allegations. Although the dismissal does not encompass Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against Defendants Ortiz, Harrington, Avila, and Chait, Plaintiff must re-allege those claims in her amended [*15]  complaint in order to pursue them.

C. Section 1985
As with § 1983, the FAC mentions § 1985 but does not contain a cause of action for conspiracy in violation of its provisions.
Section 1985 proscribes conspiracies to interfere with civil rights. Sanchez v. City of Santa Ana, 936 F.2d 1027, 1039 (9th Cir. 1990). Plaintiff does not allege the portion of the statute under which she is proceeding, but the portion that is arguably relevant is the first clause of § 1985(3), which concerns conspiracies to deprive a person of equal protection of the laws. See Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719, 724-25, 103 S. Ct. 1483, 75 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1983) (discussing clauses of § 1985); Bretz v. Kelman, 773 F.2d 1026, 1027-28 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc) (same). To state a claim under § 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege (1) a conspiracy, (2) to deprive a person or class of persons of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities, (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) resulting injury. Gillespie v. Civiletti, 629 F.2d 637, 641 (9th Cir. 1980); see also Sever v. Alaska Pulp Corp., 978 F.2d 1529, 1536 (9th Cir. 1992). In addition, the plaintiff must allege that the deprivation was caused by a racial or otherwise class-based discriminatory animus. See Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S. Ct. 1790, 29 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1971); Bretz, 773 F.2d at 1028.
A mere allegation of conspiracy without specific facts is insufficient. Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 839 F.2d 621, 626 (1988). A complaint must also contain facts showing a discriminatory animus. See, e.g., Turner v. Larsen, 536 Fed. Appx. 748, 748 (9th Cir. 2013) ("The district court properly dismissed Turner's § 1985(3) claim because Turner failed to allege facts showing that a discriminatory animus motivated the alleged [*16]  conspiracy to deprive him of his rights.").
Plaintiff does not allege a racial or otherwise class-based discriminatory animus. She alleges that she is African-American and born in Ghana (FAC ¶ 37), but she does not contend that the alleged conspiracy to dismiss her was based on her race or national origin. Rather, she contends that Defendants conspired to dismiss teachers before they vested a right to lifetime medical benefits so as to "evade payment" and reduce LAUSD's unfunded liabilities. (Id. ¶¶ 14, 17, 21; see also id. ¶ 118.) This is not the type of animus proscribed by § 1985.
Moreover, Plaintiff's conspiracy allegations are largely conclusory. Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing a wrongful agreement between Defendants. See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Medicine, 363 F.3d 916, 929 (9th Cir. 2004) (dismissing § 1985 claim when complaint was "devoid of any discussion of an agreement amongst [defendants] to violate [plaintiff's] constitutional rights").
Defendants further argue that under the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, Plaintiff cannot base a § 1985 claim on allegations of conspiracy among LAUSD officials. Under the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, "an agreement between or among agents of the same legal entity, when the agents act in their official capacities, [*17]  is not an unlawful conspiracy." Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1867, 198 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2017). Neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has decided whether the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine applies to § 1985 claims, and both have noted a split among the circuits. See id. at 1868 ("There is a division in the courts of appeals . . . respecting the validity or correctness of the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine with reference to § 1985 conspiracies. . . . Nothing in this opinion should be interpreted as either approving or disapproving the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine's application in the context of an alleged § 1985(3) violation."); Fazaga v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 965 F.3d 1015, 1059-60 (9th Cir. 2020) (defendants entitled to qualified immunity from liability under § 1985(3) because intracorporate liability was not clearly established at time of events in case), rev'd on other grounds by Fed. Bureau of Investigation v. Fazaga, 142 S. Ct. 1051, 212 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2022). Given the other deficiencies of Plaintiff's §1985 claim, it is unnecessary to address the applicability of the intracorporate liability doctrine at this stage of the proceedings.
It is recommended that Plaintiff's §1985 claim be dismissed with leave to amend. If Plaintiff elects to re-allege this claim, she must do so in a separately labeled cause of action with adequate supporting allegations.

D. Section 1981
As with §§ 1983 and 1985, the FAC mentions § 1981 but does not contain a cause [*18]  of action under that statute.
Section 1981 provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens." 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). A claim under Section 1981 requires a plaintiff to show intentional discrimination on account of race. Evans v. McKay, 869 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare System, LP, 534 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir. 2008) ("§ 1981 creates a cause of action only for those discriminated against on account of their race or ethnicity"). In addition, a § 1981 claim must be based upon a contractual relationship. Domino's Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U.S. 470, 479-80, 126 S. Ct. 1246, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (2006).
Although Plaintiff alleges she is an African-American born in Ghana (FAC ¶ 37), she does not allege that Defendants discriminated against her because of her race or national origin. Rather, she alleges Defendants acted for financial motives. (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 14, 17, 21.) The absence of a racial motivation is fatal to her § 1981 claim. See Evans, 869 F.2d at 1344.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff cannot bring a § 1981 claim based on her dismissal because, in California, the terms and conditions of public employment are not determined by contract but by statute. [*19]  See Kim v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 80 Cal. App. 4th 160, 164, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 10 (2000) ("In California public employment is held not by contract, but by statute."); Miller v. State of Cal., 18 Cal.3d 808, 813, 135 Cal. Rptr. 386, 557 P.2d 970 (1977) ("it is well settled in California that public employment is not held by contract but by statute"). Whether the statutory nature of California public employees' employment precludes a § 1981 claim is an unresolved issue and federal courts have reached different conclusions. See Van Hook v. W. Contra Costa Cnty. Unified Sch. Dist., No. 21-CV-02945-JCS, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63433, 2022 WL 1016576, at *4-*5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 5, 2022) (discussing caselaw). Because Plaintiff's claim is subject to dismissal for failure to allege racial animus, the court will not analyze at this time whether it is also subject to dismissal for this additional reason.
It is recommended that Plaintiff's § 1981 claim be dismissed with leave to amend. If Plaintiff elects to re-allege this claim, she must do so in a separately labeled cause of action with adequate supporting allegations.

E. Section 1988
Section 1988 explains the source of the law to be applied in actions under the Civil Rights Act and authorizes attorney's fees. 42 U.S. C. § 1988. Section 1988 does not create an independent cause of action. Moor v. Cty. of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 703-04, 93 S. Ct. 1785, 36 L. Ed. 2d 596 & n.17 (1973); see also Brower v. Inyo Cty., 817 F.2d 540, 456 (9th Cir. 1987) ("Section 1988 does not support an independent cause of action."), rev'd on other grounds, 489 U.S. 592 (1989). Although the FAC refers to § 1988, it does not contain a cause of action under § 1988 and Plaintiff disclaims any intent to assert an independent claim on this basis. (Dkt. No. 47 [*20]  at 7.) Defendants' motion to dismiss this claim, therefore, is superfluous and should be denied as such.

F. Second Cause of Action: FEHA
Plaintiff asserts a claim for failure to accommodate disability under FEHA. (FAC at 12.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot maintain a failure to accommodate claim against individual defendants, has failed to exhaust FEHA administrative remedies as to any individual defendants except Ortiz and Avila, and has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a failure to accommodate claim.

1. Relevant Allegations
Plaintiff alleges that before Defendant Ortiz became principal in 2012, she enjoyed a corn-free workplace because teachers and administrators avoided exposing her to corn products. (FAC ¶ 82.) Plaintiff's life-threatening corn allergy was documented in a March 8, 2008 memorandum by physician Dr. Chu that was in Plaintiff's personnel folder in the school office. (Id. ¶¶ 81, 84.) Defendant Ortiz had access to that information, and Plaintiff also told him about her corn allergy. (Id. ¶¶ 40, 84.) Defendant Ortiz nevertheless repeatedly exposed Plaintiff to the odor of corn products, including popcorn. (Id. ¶ 84.) He continued to open corn products [*21]  in her presence, actions that Plaintiff construes as a modification of her existing reasonable accommodation without appropriate process. (Id. ¶¶ 89-95.) The "modified [reasonable accommodation]" caused Plaintiff to suffer anaphylactic shocks and triggered asthma attacks. (Id. ¶ 96.) After the fourth incident, Plaintiff filed a request for a reasonable accommodation consisting of not having corn products near her, and was issued a notice of reasonable accommodation that adopted Dr. Chu's recommendations. (Id. ¶¶ 84, 88, 90.)
Shortly after making a a formal request for reasonable accommodation in September 2015, Plaintiff began to experience an increase in the number of classroom observations. (Id. ¶¶ 91, 97.) In November 2015, Plaintiff was granted a formal reasonable accommodation, and "[b]y December 2015," Defendant Ortiz contacted the Local School District Office to initiate proceedings for her dismissal. (Id. at ¶ 101.)

1. Claims against Individual Defendants
Section 12940(m) of FEHA provides that it is unlawful "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1). The California Supreme [*22]  Court has held that individual supervisory employees may not be sued personally under Cal. Gov't Code §12940(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminating on the basis of disability. Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 643, 663, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333 (1998). Section 12940(m) similarly limits liability to the employer and the same reasoning applies. Minor v. Fedex Office & Print Servs., Inc., No. 16-CV-00532-LHK, 2016 WL 1623760, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2016) (concluding "the reasoning of Reno applies equally to FEHA § 12940(m)" and dismissing § 12940(m) claim against individual defendant). Plaintiff can only bring a failure to accommodate claim against her employer, LAUSD.
To the extent Plaintiff may be asserting a claim for failure to prevent discrimination under § 12940(k), this claim can also only be asserted against an employer, not against individual defendants. See Ames v. City of Novato, No. 16-cv-02590-JST, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142713, 2016 WL 6024587, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 14, 2016) (individual supervisory employees cannot be held liable for failure to prevent discrimination because reasoning of Reno applies to claims under § 12940(k)).
It is recommended that Plaintiff's FEHA claims against the individual defendants be dismissed without leave to amend because the defect is incurable.4

2. FEHA Claims against LAUSD

a. Failure to Accommodate under § 12940(m)
The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate [*23]  the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "'Reasonable accommodation' means a 'modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.'" Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781, 798 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (citations omitted).
Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff has alleged the first two elements or that LAUSD was aware of her corn allergy. They contend Plaintiff fails to state a failure to accommodate claim because (1) her allegations show she was accommodated; and (2) she does not allege that she suffered any reaction due to exposure to corn products, that she was unable to perform her essential job duties due to exposure to corn products, or that she was dismissed on account of her corn allergy.
The FAC alleges that Plaintiff's corn allergy was accommodated prior to Defendant Ortiz's arrival at the school in 2012 but was not accommodated subsequently, at least not until a formal reasonable accommodation was granted in November 2015 shortly before commencement of dismissal proceedings against her. (FAC ¶¶ 40, 84, 89, 101.) See Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 799 ("Regardless of whether [employer] accommodated [plaintiff]'s disability at any one point, [employer] had a continuous duty to make these accommodations [*24]  so long as [plaintiff]'s disability required them."); Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 969, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014) ("A single failure to reasonably accommodate an employee may give rise to liability, despite other efforts at accommodation.") Although the FAC leaves vague the times, places, and extent of her exposure to corn products, it contains an allegation that Plaintiff's exposure to corn products at school caused her anaphylactic shocks and triggered asthma attacks. (FAC ¶ 96.) A reasonable inference is that these conditions impacted Plaintiff's ability to teach.
Defendants' argument that Plaintiff has not linked her dismissal to her corn allergy is irrelevant to a failure to accommodate claim under § 12940(m). See Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). "Under the express provisions of the FEHA, the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual is a violation of the statute in and of itself." Id.; Furtado v. State Pers. Bd., 212 Cal. App. 4th 729, 745, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 292 (2013); see also Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 798-99 (§ 12940(m) claim differs from § 12940(a) discrimination claim "in that an adverse employment action need not be shown, nor is any showing of a causal nexus between one's disability and an adverse employment action required").
At this stage of the litigation and giving Plaintiff the benefit of every reasonable inference, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Defendant LAUSD failed [*25]  to reasonably accommodate her disability.

b. Failure to Prevent Discrimination under Section 12940(k)
Although the FAC characterizes Plaintiff's FEHA claim as "failure to accommodate disability," it contains an allegation that Defendants violated Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k) by failing to prevent discrimination against Plaintiff. (FAC ¶ 103.) Defendants' motion expressly discusses only Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim but their arguments regarding Plaintiff's failure to allege a causal link between her dismissal and her disability are relevant to a § 12940(k) claim, not a failure to accommodate claim.
"A plaintiff seeking to recover on a failure to prevent discrimination claim under FEHA must show that (1) [s]he was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 804. "No liability can arise for failing to take necessary steps to prevent discrimination, however, except where discriminatory conduct actually took place and was not prevented." Id. (citing Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998)). In other words, "a failure to prevent discrimination claim is essentially derivative of a discrimination claim." Id. (internal quotation marks and [*26]  citation omitted).
To allege discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that (1) she suffers from a disability; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability. Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Ent., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1095 (E.D. Cal. 2017) (citing Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 254). While Plaintiff has alleged she was subjected to an adverse employment action, namely, her dismissal, she has not sufficiently alleged a causal link to her corn allergy. Indeed, the gravamen of the FAC is that the primary motivation for Plaintiff's termination was to prevent her from vesting a right to lifetime medical benefits. (FAC ¶¶ 42-45.) Because a § 12940(k) claim for failure to prevent discrimination is derivative of a discrimination claim under § 12940(a), Plaintiff's failure to allege a causal link between her disability and her termination requires the dismissal of her § 12940(k) claim.
It is recommended that Plaintiff's claim for failure to prevent discrimination under § 12940(k) be dismissed with leave to amend.

c. Other
As noted above, the FAC characterizes Plaintiff's FEHA claim as a failure to accommodate claim, and Defendants' motion to dismiss treats it as such. The FAC also cites Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) and refers to FEHA retaliation. (FAC ¶¶ 86, 104.)
Section 12940(n) provides that an employer's [*27]  failure "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition" is an unlawful employment practice. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). ""Under FEHA, an employer must engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." Villalobos v. TWC Admin. LLC, 720 Fed. Appx. 839, 843 (9th Cir. 2017) (citing Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015)); see also Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 983, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (explaining difference between § 12940(m) and § 12940(n)). Plaintiff alleges she had a reasonable accommodation that met her needs — her coworkers refrained from exposing her to corn products — prior to Defendant Ortiz's arrival at the school; sought to continue the same reasonable accommodation; and eventually was formally granted the reasonable accommodation she sought. (FAC ¶¶ 82, 90, 92, 101.) Her allegations regarding Defendant Ortiz's unilateral "modification" of her existing reasonable accommodation and his failure to give her a chance to discuss the matter are vague. (Id. ¶¶ 93-96.) If Plaintiff intended to include a claim against LAUSD for failure to engage in an interactive [*28]  process, her factual allegations in the FAC are insufficient to state a plausible § 12940(n) claim.
The FAC also alleges that "Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff for seeking accommodation and unpaid leave for her disabilities, in violation of FEHA through numerous illegal acts."5 (FAC ¶ 104.) Given the absence of supporting allegations or any reference to the FEHA retaliation provisions, the court does not construe the FAC as asserting a claim for FEHA retaliation. See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 380-81 (2015) (plaintiff alleging FEHA retaliation "must show (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the proposed activity and the employer's action" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
If Plaintiff intended to assert § 12940(n) and retaliation claims against LAUSD, she may do so in an amended pleading with adequate supporting allegations.

G. Third Cause of Action: Bane Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1)
"The California Bane Act creates a cause of action against a person if that person 'interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion . . . with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States."' Sandoval v. Cty. of Sonoma, 912 F.3d 509, 519 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting [*29]  Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1(a)). "The essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper means (i.e., 'threats, intimidation or coercion'), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required to do under the law." Austin B. v. Escondido Union Sch. Dist., 149 Cal. App. 4th 860, 883, 57 Cal. Rptr. 3d 454 (2007). "The plaintiff must show the defendant interfered with or attempted to interfere with the plaintiff's legal right by threatening or committing violent acts." Julian v. Mission Cmty. Hosp., 11 Cal. App. 5th 360, 395, 218 Cal. Rptr. 3d 38 (2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "Speech is insufficient to establish the requisite threat unless it includes threat of violence." Id. (citations omitted).
The FAC is devoid of facts supporting Plaintiff's Bane Act claim. Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendants threatened violence against her, or that they engaged in any acts that rose to the level of intimidation and coercion within the meaning of the Bane Act.
In her opposition, Plaintiff contends she was "threatened with loss of her income if she did not cave in and demanded her right to a hearing." (Dkt. No. 47 at 7.) This is not the type of threat contemplated by the Bane Act. See Baldwin Park Free Speech Coalition v. City of Baldwin Park, No. 2:19-cv-08864-CAS (Ex), 2021 WL 616288, at *8-*9 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 17, 2021) (citations for violation of sign ordinance [*30]  and threatened tax lien did not constitute threats or coercion sufficient to support Bane Act claim); Schulte v. City of Sacramento, No. Civ. S-0501812-FCD JFM, 2006 WL 8458892, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 9. 2006) (allegations that "defendants decreased assignments, excluded her from meetings, solicited negative reviews of her and demoted her" did not support Bane Act claim because plaintiff did not allege "defendants made any threats, express or implied, subjected her to any physical confrontations, or used any actual force").
Because it is apparent that Plaintiff cannot allege a Bane Act claim based on the factual scenario of the FAC, it is recommended that this claim be dismissed without leave to amend.

H. Fourth Cause of Action for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
The fourth cause of action is denominated "declaratory and injunctive relief." (FAC at 16.) Plaintiff requests the court "to craft appropriate orders declaring unlawful acts to be unlawful and to enjoin such acts in the future." (FAC ¶ 122.) "Among the orders requested" is an order that LAUSD "immediately adopt and implement procedures reflecting the [California] Supreme Court's decision in Skelly."6 (Id.) Defendants have moved to dismiss the fourth cause of action on the grounds that it does not set forth an independent claim and is duplicative [*31]  and unnecessary.
"Declaratory and injunctive relief are remedies, not causes of action." Ajetunmobi v. Clarion Mortg. Capital, Inc, 595 Fed. Appx. 680, 684 (9th Cir. 2014); see also Neerman v. Cates, No. CV 22-2751 PA (PVCx), 2022 WL 18278377, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 28, 2022) ("The Declaratory Judgment Act creates a remedy for litigants but does not create an independent cause of action."); Huynh v. NorthBay Med. Ctr., No. 2:17-cv-2039-EFB PS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164654, 2018 WL 4583393, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Sep. 25, 2018) ("Injunctive relief is a remedy derived from the underlying claims and not an independent claim in itself."); Lane v. Vitek Real Estate Indus. Grp., 713 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1104 (E.D. Cal. 2010) ("Declaratory and injunctive relief are not independent claims, rather they are forms of relief.")
Moreover, the declaration Plaintiff seeks is subsumed by her damages claims. See Rhodes v. Robinson, 408 F.3d 559, 566 n. 8 (9th Cir. 2005) (because claim for damages necessarily entailed determination regarding whether defendants' alleged conduct violated plaintiff's rights, plaintiff's separate request for declaratory relief was subsumed by damages action); Fitzpatrick v. Gates, No. CV 00-4101-GAF (AJWx), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13774, 2001 WL 630534, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2001) ("Where a plaintiff seeks damages or relief for an alleged constitutional injury that has already occurred[,] declaratory relief generally is inappropriate"). "A claim for declaratory relief is unnecessary where an adequate remedy exists under some other cause of action." Mangindin v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 637 F. Supp. 2d 700, 707 (N.D. Cal. June 18, 2009).
It is recommended that the fourth cause of action be dismissed without leave to amend. Plaintiff may still pursue injunctive and declaratory relief, where appropriate, through her prayer for relief.

I. Punitive [*32]  Damages
Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot seek punitive damages from LAUSD and has not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages from the individual defendants.
Punitive damages are not available under § 1983 against a governmental entity. City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 69 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1981) ("municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983"). With respect to the state law claims, public entities are exempt from punitive damages under California law. See Cal. Gov't Code § 818 ("Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public entity is not liable for ... damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant."). The California Supreme Court has interpreted § 818 to prohibit awards of punitive damages against public entities in cases involving FEHA claims. State Personnel Bd. v. Fair Employment and Housing Comm'n, 39 Cal.3d 422, 434, 217 Cal. Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354 (1985). Plaintiff, therefore, cannot seek punitive damages against LAUSD.
Defendants further argue that "there are zero facts pled to support a claim of punitive damages against the Individual Defendants." (Dkt. No. 43 at 29.) Courts have found that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim is not a proper vehicle for attacking a request for punitive damages when the defendant does not argue that punitive damages are precluded as a matter of law, but only [*33]  that the request lacks factual support.7 See, e.g., Townsend v. McDonell, No. 2:18-cv-10011-R-JC, 2019 WL 7882085, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2019); Sturm v. Rasmussen, No. 18-cv-01689-W-BLM, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24504, 2019 WL 626167, at *3-*4 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2019); Andrawes v. Flora Media, Inc., No. CV 18-0431-FMO (PLAx), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221451, 2018 WL 1942197, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2018). In any event, Plaintiff has not yet succeeded in stating a claim against most of the individual defendants.
It is recommended that Plaintiff's request for punitive damages against LAUSD be dismissed without leave to amend because the defect is incurable. It is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's request for punitive damages against the individual defendants be denied.

V.
