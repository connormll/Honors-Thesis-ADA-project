MEMORANDUM
YOUNGE, J.
DECEMBER 21, 2021
Plaintiff Tina Schueller brought this action under the Fair Housing Amendments Act ("FHAA"), 42 U.S.C. §3601 et seq. against Defendant Pennypack Woods Home Ownership Association ("Pennypack") alleging that Pennypack discriminated against her due to her disability when it failed to make an exception to Pennypack's minimum income requirements. Now before this Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7.1(f). For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the Defendant's Motion.

I. BACKGROUND1

A. Factual Background
Pennypack is a non-profit Pennsylvania corporation which owns and manages a community of approximately 1,000 housing units of one, two, and three-bedrooms in northeast Philadelphia. (ECF No. 2; ECF No. 22, ECF. No. 39-1). Plaintiff's [*2]  father, Frank Lippincott, became a member of Pennypack on February 4, 2010 for the unit located at 8839 Holme Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19136 (the "Unit") and paid $4,385.50 to acquire an equity interest in the Unit. (ECF No. 39-1; ECF No. 39-4.) As a member, Mr. Lippencott owned a one-thousandth undivided interest in the Association while Pennypack held title. (Id.) All members of Pennypack enjoy perpetual use of their units pursuant to a "Home Security Policy" so long as they comply with Pennypack's rules and regulations. (ECF No. 39-4.) A member may transfer their unit to certain close relatives, such as a parent or child, either by testamentary or inter vivos instrument, but membership in Pennypack is still subject to approval by the Board in accordance with the association's bylaws. (Id.). While Pennypack's bylaws permit "members" to transfer an interest to certain closely related family members or sell an interest in their units upon Pennypack's right of first refusal, this proposed transfer is not binding unless the purchaser or transferee becomes a member in Pennypack in their own right.2 (Id. at 15-18.)
In particular, according to Pennypack's bylaws, residents of Pennypack are [*3]  required to be "members," unless they are "trial members" seeking full membership or a part of a member's "composite family." (Id. at 7, 10, 51.) A member of a "composite family" consists of: 1) "all persons listed on members [sic] original application to become a member of the Association"; 2) [a]ll persons born to or adopted by member and spouse while residing in unit; or 3) persons added to a member's family by request and approval by Pennypack. (Id. at 51.) Further, "[o]nly the head of the household and his or her spouse shall be eligible for, or admitted to, membership in the Association, provided they otherwise qualify." (Id. at 6.) Thus, only applicants who list themselves as the "head of a household" may be considered for membership in Pennypack.
The bylaws contain certain restrictions on who is eligible for membership. In particular, the bylaws provide that "[a] person shall not qualify for membership in the Association if he, or those living with him as part of his household, are not of good reputation; use, distribute, or sell drugs whose possession, use or sale is a violation of the law, engage in activities prohibited by the law, or if such person makes a material misrepresentation [*4]  in his application for membership, or if he is not financially responsible." (Id. at 7.) Financial responsibility is established by meeting Pennypack's minimum income threshold which differs based on the size of the unit. In this case, the minimum threshold for the Unit was a weekly income of $578.75, a monthly income of $2,507.92, and an annual income of $30,095.00. (Id. at 75.) The income threshold was raised in 2007 to include a percentage over monthly charges on each unit to account for a concern that some applicants "can't make ends meet" and that Pennypack was "always last to be paid." (ECF No. 40-2 at 50.)
On or around December 17, 2016, Mr. Lippincott passed away. (ECF N. 39-4 at 163.) As part of his will, he left a document titled "Will As To Specific Property Interest" (the "Will") dated February 4 2010 giving his "rights to the perpetual use" of his Unit to his daughters "Francis Dougherty(sic) or Tina Schueller." (emphasis added). (Id. at 159.) The Will, however, provided no guarantee that either of Mr. Lippincott's daughters would be entitled to live in the Unit. (Id.) Rather, the ability to reside in the Unit was subject to Pennypack's rules and acceptance into their membership [*5]  with the caveat that if membership was denied, that one or both of Mr. Lippincott's daughters would be entitled to the equity interest in the Unit. (Id. at 15, 59.)
Originally, Plaintiff's sister, Ms. Frances Dougherty, who was also a beneficiary under the Will, intended to occupy the unit, but ultimately abandoned the process to obtain membership in Pennypack. (ECF No. 40 at 11; ECF No. 39-4 at 97.) Plaintiff then sought to occupy the Unit. When Plaintiff was unable to meet Pennypack's income threshold, she was advised by the Manager of Pennypack, Gail Fluharty, at Plaintiff's suggestion, that she could have her son Robert Schueller apply and that assuming membership was approved, they could both live in the Unit. (ECF No. 40 at 12; ECF No. 39-4 at 112.) Mr. Schueller was not a beneficiary of the Will and had no equity interest in the Unit, but the parties, in essence, had discussed a plan whereby Mr. Schueller would be given the opportunity to apply so that Plaintiff could meet the basic income requirements to live at Pennypack. On or around August 14, 2017, Mr. Schueller filled out an application to become a trial member of Pennypack so that Plaintiff could reside in the Unit. (ECF [*6]  No. 39-5 at 22.) Plaintiff also filled out an application dated August 21, 2017 but she listed Mr. Schueller as "Head of Household" instead of herself, which normally would be required for Plaintiff to apply for membership not as "composite" family. (ECF No. 39-5 at 34; ECF N. 39-4 at 6.)3 Plaintiff's application stated that she was "disabled" under the "occupation" and "employment record" sections, and that she was "out of work since 2010" but did not provide additional information as to her disability. (ECF No. 39-5 at 30-32.) Both applications were submitted at the same time. (ECF No. 39-4 at 212.) On November 21, 2017, Pennypack sent Mr. Schueller a letter stating that his application was rejected because of his "criminal record as indicated by the investigator." (ECF No. 39-5 at 94.) Internal records likewise stated that Mr. Schueller's application was rejected because "[n]o applicant shall be accepted if he or any member of his Composite family has been convicted of a crime in which the judgment of the Membership Committee suggests that there exists a substantial likelihood that the applicant or any member of his Composite Family would engage in criminal activity while residing [*7]  at Pennypack Woods." (ECF No. 39-6 at 40.)
On December 6, 2017, Plaintiff sent a handwritten letter to Pennypack asking for Pennypack to reconsider Mr. Schueller's trial membership application, or in the alternative, to consider her as an individual applicant (i.e., Head of Household) for trial membership. (ECF No. 39-5 at 96-100.) Pennypack responded on December 15, 2017 stating that the Board of Directors reviewed Plaintiff's letter and "The decision of the Board of Directors stands." (ECF No. 39-6 at 2.) On January 18, 2018, Plaintiff requested a membership application so she could apply individually. (ECF No. 39-6 at 4.) Pennypack responded in a letter dated January 24, 2018 stating, "[t]he Board of Directors have determined that you may pick up an application from the Association office" but Plaintiff never submitted a separate application for review. (Id. at 6-8.) Plaintiff was also given numerous opportunities to find a suitable guarantor or "Head of Household" so that she could become eligible to reside at Pennypack. (ECF No. 39-6 at 28-32; 40-2 at 38.)
In particular, Pennypack gave Plaintiff the opportunity for her mother, son or sister to "sign on to be members for the year." [*8]  (ECF No. 39-6 at 32, 37.) While Plaintiff's mother, Anna Walker, offered to co-sign, Plaintiff's counsel stated that Mrs. Walker's income was $2,319 per month, which similar to Plaintiff, was also below Pennypack's required monthly threshold of $2,507.92 for the Unit and Mrs. Walker had her own monthly rent of $620. (ECF No. 40-2 at 32.) Plaintiff also requested that her son co-sign for the Unit after Pennypack's November 21, 2017 rejection letter, but Plaintiff's son refused to co-sign for Plaintiff or live in the Unit. (ECF No. 40-2 at 3.)
Instead, Plaintiff moved into the unit in 2018 without notice and without being approved for membership in Pennypack (ECF No. 39-1 at 9; ECF No. 40 at 6; ECF No. 56-2 at 30-31.) Upon learning of Plaintiff's occupancy, on April 5, 2018, Pennypack advised Plaintiff that she was trespassing. (ECF No. 39-1 at 9; ECF No. 39-6 at 14.) Plaintiff refused to vacate the unit, claiming that Pennypack discriminated against her on the account of her disability. This lawsuit followed.

B. Procedural History
Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a Complaint on January 14, 2019. (ECF No. 2.) The Complaint sets forth one count for violation of the FHAA. On March [*9]  29, 2019 Plaintiff moved for a Preliminary Injunction to enjoin Defendant's ejectment action in Pennsylvania state court, which the Court denied on April 16th, 2019. (ECF No. 6; ECF No. 11.) On April 9, 2019, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, which the Court denied on July 10, 2019. (ECF No. 10; ECF No. 20.) On July 24, 2019, Defendant filed its Answer to Complaint with Affirmative Defenses with Counterclaim for Ejectment. (ECF No. 22.) Plaintiff filed its Answer to Defendant's Counterclaim with Affirmative Defenses on August 20, 2019. (ECF No. 23.)
On March 6, 2020, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 39.) Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment on April 2, 2020 (ECF No. 40) which Defendant filed a Reply to on April 9, 2020 (ECF No. 41.) Defendant filed a Motion to Correct Exhibits in its Motion for Summary Judgment on December 14, 2021 which was granted by the Court on December 15, 2021 (ECF No. 56; ECF No. 57.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A court's role is not to evaluate the weight of the evidence, to judge the credibility of witnesses, or to determine the truth of the matter, but instead to determine whether [*10]  there is a genuine issue of triable fact. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). To determine whether any genuine issue of fact exists, the court must pierce the pleadings and assess the proof as presented in depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits that are part of the record. Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c), Advisory Committee Notes, 1963 Amendments.
Summary judgment is proper "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is to be granted cautiously, with due respect for a party's right to have its factually grounded claims and defenses tried to a jury. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.
The movant bears the initial responsibility for informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145 (3d Cir. 2004). An issue is "genuine" if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. Kaucher v. Cty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). A factual dispute is "material" if it might well affect the outcome of the case under governing law. Id. (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).
A court must view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences [*11]  in the non-moving party's favor. See In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 357 (3d Cir. 2004); see also Curley v. Klem, 298 F.3d 271, 276-77 (3d Cir. 2002) ("In evaluating the evidence, we are required to view the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nonetheless, a court need not credit "[u]nsupported assertions, conclusory allegations, or mere suspicions." Betts v. New Castle Youth Dev. Ctr., 621 F.3d 249, 252 (3d Cir. 2010).

II. DISCUSSION
The Court concludes that summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's FHAA claim. In particular, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence of a nexus between Plaintiff's alleged disability and the financial accommodations sought such that no reasonable jury could return a verdict in Plaintiff's favor. Plaintiff has sought an accommodation on account of the economic hardships she faces. While the Court is sympathetic to her plight, the law does not require accommodations for economic hardships unrelated to Plaintiff's disability - it simply requires reasonable accommodations causally linked to an individual's disability to ensure an equal opportunity to housing.
Plaintiff devotes her brief entirely to arguing that Pennypack should be required to waive its income requirements. But all the [*12]  case law cited does not come remotely close to requiring property owners to expose themselves to this type of financial risk. Further, after two years of litigation, Plaintiff has failed to propose another solution other than her request to waive Pennypack's income requirements, has failed to find a suitable guarantor, and has rejected every accommodation that Defendant has offered. Therefore, Defendant has sustained its burden of showing it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
The FHAA makes it unlawful "to discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap." 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1); Cmty. Servs. v. Wind Gap Mun. Auth., 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005). Discrimination covered by the FHAA includes "a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B). "To determine whether an accommodation is 'reasonable,' we consider 'whether the requested accommodation is (1) reasonable and (2) necessary to (3) afford handicapped persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing.'" Revock v. Cowpet Bay W. Condo. Ass'n., 853 F.3d 96, 110, 66 V.I. 905 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of the Twp. of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 457 (3d Cir. 2002)). "Necessary" suggests "something that 'cannot be done without'" [*13]  Cinnamon Hills Youth Crisis Ctr., Inc. v. Saint George City, 685 F.3d 917, 923 (10th Cir. 2012), and thus is treated as requiring a causal link that examines whether the accommodation sought will redress injuries that otherwise would have prevented disabled individuals from the same enjoyment or access to the property as non-disabled persons. See Howard v. HMK Holdings, LLC, 988 F.3d 1185, 1190 (9th Cir. 2021).
Plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing the reasonableness and necessity of the accommodation, at which point the burden shifts to the defendant show that the proposed accommodation poses an undue burden. Lapid-Laurel, LLC, 284 F.3d at 446 ("We think that under § 3604(f)(3)(B) the plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that the requested accommodation is necessary to afford handicapped persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, at which point the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the requested accommodation is unreasonable"). An accommodation is "reasonable if it imposes no fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or undue financial and administrative burdens." Hollis v. Chestnut Bend Homeowners Ass'n, 760 F.3d 531, 542 (6th Cir. 2014).
Plaintiff has alleged that her disability impairs her ability to generate an income, which in turn, requires that Pennypack accommodate her disability by waiving its income thresholds in favor of "financial stability" as applied to her. Plaintiff is receiving SSDI but has refused [*14]  to produce her medical records so Defendants argue that she cannot met the definition of "disabled." As a general matter, in most cases, individuals who meet the definition of disability for purposes of receiving SSI or SSDI benefits also qualify as disabled under the federal disability statutes. See Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 797, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966(1999); see also Wiesner v. 321 W. 16th St. Assocs., No. 00-CV1423, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12000, 2000 WL 1191075, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2000) ("[Tenant], who suffers from a psychological illness and is entitled to Social Security Disability Income payments, is deemed to be a disabled individual within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act"). But just because a plaintiff is disabled, does not mean that there is a duty to provide any accommodation requested. Rather, the accommodation sought must not only be reasonable, but related to the plaintiff's actual disability and afford the plaintiff an equal opportunity to housing.4Sporn v. Ocean Colony Condo Ass'n, 173 F. Supp. 2d 244, 249 (D.N.J. 2001). In other words, the accommodation must be particularized to address the plaintiff's disability and not be an unrelated, generalized grievance shared with many other non-disabled persons, such as a limited amount of money to spend on housing. Lapid-Laurel L.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp. of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 460 (3d Cir. 2002). Without a causal link between a defendants' policy and the plaintiff's injury, no obligation arises to make a reasonable accommodation. Bell v. Tower Management, L.P et al., No. 07-cv-5305, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53514, 2008 WL 278334 * 4-5 (D.N.J Jul. 15, 2008) (the court dismissed the plaintiff's [*15]  reasonable accommodation claim because she failed to sufficiently allege that she met defendants' minimum income requirement prior to her disability).
While there may be a connection between a plaintiff's finances and the economic hardships they face, there is no causal nexus between Plaintiff's disability and the accommodation requested, because she did not make sufficient income to meet Pennypack's requirements prior to her disability. See Bell, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53514, 2008 WL 2783343 at *4-5 (Noting that "if Plaintiff was incapable of meeting the minimum income requirement prior to her disability, then her disability did not cause her need for a waiver of that requirement, and granting her an exception to that requirement could not ameliorate an effect of her disability"). In 2010, in Plaintiff's final year of employment at Premier Pork, she made $24,195; in 2011, Plaintiff made $22,540.00; and, in 2012, Plaintiff made $16,170.00. Plaintiff's income, both before and after her disability, was below Pennypack's income threshold of $30,095.00. (ECF No. 39-6 at 16, 24, 26.) Plaintiff's counsel argues that Plaintiff may have made more in 2010 than the $24,195 salary reflected on her W-2 because she made $38,425 in 2009 and [*16]  testified that she made approximately $1,000 a week in her final year of employment. (ECF No. 40-1 at 54; ECF 40-2 at 40.) Specifically, Plaintiff's counsel argues "while the record is silent as to the reason the 2010 W-2 reflects $24,195.00, a plausible explanation is that Tina Schuller (sic) did not work for a full year" yet fails to any cite evidence whatsoever to substantiate this explanation. (ECF No. 40 at 24-25.) That Plaintiff earned more in 2009, does not negate that in 2010, her last year of employment on record, she did not meet Pennypack's income requirement, particularly given that Plaintiff has refused to provide medical records to date her disability or evidence as to why in 2010 she made less.5 Plaintiff, having put her disability at issue, has a discovery obligation to provide relevant medical records, yet now uses her lack of records as a sword and shield by asking the Court to accept her "plausible" explanation. Sharawi v. WWR Premier Holdings, Civ. Act. No. 19-5133, April 21, 2020 Order on Defendant's Motion to Compel (holding that when a plaintiff has put their "earnings and medical history at issue" then they "bear [] responsibility for making a reasonable effort [*17]  to ensure that documents and information relevant to those issues are available to the defendant"). While this Court on summary judgment is required to draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, it is not required to credit Plaintiff's unsupported assertation or suspicion of what could or could not be an explanation. See Betts, 621 F.3d at 252.
In Bell v. Tower Management, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53514, 2008 WL 278334 * 8, the District Court for New Jersey addressed a similar issue to one before the Court. In that case, the plaintiff's complaint failed to allege her pre-disability income. Id. The court dismissed the plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim because she failed to sufficiently allege that she met defendants' minimum income requirement prior to her disability. Id. Similar to this case, in Bell, the defendant refused to waive their minimum income requirement for a disabled plaintiff receiving income from federal benefits. Id. The Bell court, in dismissing plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim, noted that "if Plaintiff's pre-disability income would have been insufficient to meet the Defendants' minimum income requirement, then her disability cannot have caused her inability to do so." Id. If the Bell plaintiff's failure to allege pre-disability income was fatal [*18]  to her claims on a motion to dismiss, then certainly, in this case, counsel's "plausible" suggestion that Plaintiff worked less than a year, without citation to any evidence whatsoever, warrants summary judgment.
Even if Plaintiff provided sufficient evidence of a causal connection, the requested accommodation poses an undue burden on Pennypack. A request that poses an undue financial burden on the entity making an accommodation, is not a "reasonable accommodation." Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 410, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979); see also Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d 1368, 1384 (3d Cir. 1991); Oxford House, Inc. v. Township of Cherry Hill, 799 F. Supp. 450, 461 (D.N.J 1991). Plaintiff requests a purely economic exemption from an otherwise rational Pennypack policy meant to protect the financial viability of its community. Plaintiff has requested that Pennypack, accommodate her disability, by waiving its income threshold requirement in favor of "financial stability." She argues that that this accommodation is reasonable because while her annual income from SSDI does not meet Pennypack's threshold, it is enough to pay the monthly charges on the Unit.
According to Plaintiff, Pennypack has a policy that in the event a member passes away, a "composite" family previously residing with Pennypack members may meet a lower, undefined "financial stability" requirement to have that member's [*19]  Home Security Policy transferred to them. Plaintiff argues that since Pennypack can waive its requirements for "composite" family, it should waive its higher income standards for her even though she was never listed as "composite" family or resided with any approved memher.6 In essence, Plaintiff claims that because Pennypack can waive its income thresholds for "composite" family in favor of "financial stability" it should be able to waive its income requirements for her. The policy that Plaintiff refers to only says that the basic income requirement for "composite" family may be waived for "financial stability," not that Pennypack must or has to waive these requirements.7 (ECF No. 40-2 at 37.)
While there is case law that holds that a reasonable accommodation may entail certain financial accommodations, such as permitting a guarantor so a disabled individual can meet income requirements to rent or altering the rental due date for government benefit recipients to the date they receive benefits, none of these cases require that a property owner make an exception to their income requirements. See, e.g. Giebeler v. M & B Associates, 343 F.3d 1143, 1155 (9th Cir. 2003) (reasonable accommodation could entail permitting the plaintiff's [*20]  mother to serve as guarantor); Fair Housing Rights Center in Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Morgan Properties Management Company, LLC, No. 16-4677, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108900, 2018 WL 3208159 at * 7 ( a reasonable accommodation could entail offering an alternative to the defendant's inflexible rental payment due date for SSI recipients - such as accepting payments later in the month to coincide with receipt of SSI income—when the plaintiff could meet the three to one ratio requirement to rent); Edwards v. Gene Salter Properties, 671 Fed. Appx. 407 (8th Cir. 2016) (upholding reasonable accommodation claim by would-be tenants whose prospective landlord required job-income evidence such as pay stubs, which plaintiffs could not supply because their only source of income was government disability benefits).
In Giebeler v. M&B Assocs., 343 F.3d 1143, 1155 (9th Cir. 2003) the plaintiff, who applied to rent an apartment, was told by the defendant that his income, which exceeded the rental amount, was insufficient because prospective tenants were required to have an income of three times the monthly rent in order to qualify. Id. Although the plaintiff's pre-disability income would have satisfied that requirement, his disability benefits income could not. Id. The plaintiff offered to have his mother co-sign the lease and thus satisfy the income-to-rent requirement, but the defendant had a policy against permitting co-signers on lease agreements and rejected the plaintiff's application. [*21]  Id. The plaintiff requested that the co-signor policy be waived as a reasonable accommodation under the FHAA because he was disabled and unable to support himself. Id. The defendant cited its policy and denied the accommodation. Id. The court held that the plaintiff satisfied its burden of demonstrating that an accommodation requesting a guarantor was "reasonable on its face" and that the defendant failed to show that the requested accommodation caused an undue burden. Id. at 1157.
The Giebeler court reasoned that permitting a guarantor did "not require. . . [defendant] to accept less rent would not otherwise alter the essential obligations of tenancy. . . (such as appropriate behavior and care of the premises) and would provide a lessee with the proper financial qualifications and credit history." Id. Further, the plaintiff's mother would be responsible for the rent, there was no unusual risk, she had significant assets, her income was reliable and ample, and the defendants could collect from her first, obviating financial risk. Id. Nowhere in this opinion does the court provide support for waiving minimum income thresholds, as Plaintiff requests. Significantly, the Giebeler court stressed that plaintiff "was [*22]  in no way trying to avoid payment of the usual rent for the apartment he wanted to live in, nor was he proposing to leave . . . [defendant] without a means of ascertaining that an individual with the means to pay that rent would be responsible for doing so." Id.
Pennypack established its income thresholds out of concern and due to experience with some residents being unable to make ends meet, which meant that Pennypack was not receiving membership fees. (ECF No. 40-2 at 50.) Like many, Pennypack sets a threshold that considers not just whether a potential resident's entire income can pay for membership fees but whether they can afford to live there. The minimum income requirement exists so that Pennypack can evaluate new members who are able to meet the primary responsibility of paying their dues and ensure a thriving community. Although Plaintiff is not asking to pay less for the Unit, the request for a waiver to Pennypack's income requirement expose it to an undue financial risk in the way that a suitable guarantor in Giebeler did not.
What Plaintiff further neglects is that Pennypack did consider making an exception for Plaintiff by permitting her to apply alongside several family members [*23]  to ensure Plaintiff's ability to pay for the Unit. Plaintiff was given numerous opportunities to find a suitable guarantor but was unable to do so. First, Pennypack agreed to let Plaintiff's son, Mr. Schueller, apply for trial membership with Plaintiff as a "composite" member due to Plaintiff's inability to meet the income requirements. (ECF No. 56-2 at 14.) Following Mr. Schueller's rejection by Pennypack due to concern regarding his prior criminal record and drug history, Pennypack offered to allow Plaintiff's sister, Ms. Dougherty apply for trial membership with Plaintiff as part of her "composite" family. (ECF No. 39-6 at 28.) However, Plaintiff never even asked her sister to apply. (ECF No. 56-2 at 4-5.)
It was not until December 4, 2018 - after Plaintiff unilaterally moved into the Unit - that Plaintiff, through her attorney, requested that her mother, Anna Walker, serve as guarantor. (See ECF No. 40-2 at 32.) Plaintiff's mother, according to representations by Plaintiff's counsel, had a monthly income of $2,319 and $620 in rent per month, and therefore, also did not meet Pennypack's minimum income requirement for the Unit. (Id.) Plaintiff's mother, unlike the guarantor in Giebeler who [*24]  had significant assets and income, cannot be said to sufficiently minimize Pennypack's financial risk by serving as Plaintiff's guarantor. Giebeler, 343 F. 3d at 1158 (Noting that plaintiff's mother "had significant assets" "ample source of rent funds," paid off her mortgage in full, and that by allowing her to co-sign, defendants would "not assume any substantial financial or administrative risk or burden."). In sum, Plaintiff still to this day has not offered a viable guarantor for the Unit and has rejected all accommodations offered by Pennypack.
This is not a case where Plaintiff can meet the income threshold using her SSDI benefits - Pennypack considered Plaintiff's SSDI and Plaintiff still failed to meet the income requirements. Unlike Giebeler, Plaintiff was afforded numerous opportunities to apply and find a suitable guarantor but could not do so. Thus, on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and after the conclusion of discovery, there is insufficient evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact for a jury and thus, summary judgment is warranted.
V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. An appropriate Order will follow.
IT IS SO ORDERED [*25] .
