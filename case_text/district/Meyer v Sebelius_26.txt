Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE came before the Court on Defendant's, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS['s]"), Motion for Summary Judgment . . . ("Motion") [ECF No. 53], filed with a Statement of Undisputed Facts . . . ("HHS's SMF") [ECF No. 52] on August 30, 2013. Plaintiff, Stacey Meyer ("Meyer"), filed a Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition1 . . . ("Response") [ECF No. 56] on September 23, 2013. HHS filed its Reply . . . ("Reply") [ECF No. 57] on October 3, 2013. The Court has carefully [*2]  considered the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law.

I. BACKGROUND
"Meyer suffers from generalized anxiety, social anxiety, major depression, and panic disorder." (Resp. 4). Meyer brings this action against the HHS alleging she was discriminated against because of her disabilities and her gender, she was denied a reasonable accommodation for her disability, and she was terminated in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation. (See generally Am. Compl. [ECF No. 21]).
Meyer began working with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as a Consumer Safety Officer ("CSO") in April 2002. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 1). As a CSO, Meyer's duties included entry/review, filing evaluations, field examinations, and sample collection. (See July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 124:3-6 [ECF No. 52-1]). Meyer and other CSOs were given access to a government-owned [*3]  vehicle ("GOV"), which was to be used for authorized purposes pursuant to FDA policy. (See July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. Ex. F). Throughout Meyer's tenure as a CSO, Meyer fully met all performance expectations, as reflected in her annual performance evaluations. (See Resp. 3). Meyer was eventually promoted to a GS12 position on August 6, 2006, and she continued to receive steady salary increases throughout her employment with the FDA. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 4).
Meyer and co-worker William Keck ("Keck") "exchanged telephone numbers" and began seeing each other socially outside of the office in early 2003. (July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 49:22-50:1 [ECF No. 52-1]). Throughout that time Keck, who became Meyer's first-line supervisor in October 2009, was a CSO in the Miami office. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 7). Meyer and Keck socialized outside the office "once [or] twice a week, maybe somewhere in the range of five to eight [times] a month." (July 23 Meyer Dep. 51:5-7). During their relationship, Meyer confided in Keck about her depression and anxiety. (See Resp. 5). Meyer and Keck had one instance of physical intimacy in 2004 or 2005, which was initiated by Keck. (See July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 54:2-3). After that [*4]  incident, Meyer felt "confused," "violated," and "ashamed," and "any thought that [Meyer and Keck] could have progressed into the next step was gone." (Id. 59:17-21). Soon afterward, Keck transferred to Tampa for another job at the FDA. (See id. 61:5-8).
On October 31, 2006, Meyer's supervisor at the time, Raymond Lyn ("Lyn"), received a letter from Meyer's psychologist, Dr. Lana Stern, stating Meyer was experiencing "symptoms of anxiety and depression." (Meyer's SMF ¶ 13a). As a result, Lyn gave Meyer more entry review work and less work in the field. (See id. ¶ 13d). In 2008, Meyer again brought her health issues to Lyn's attention. (See id. ¶ 13b). On April 2, 2008, Meyer received a memorandum of caution from Lyn regarding her excessive unscheduled absences. (July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 152:18-156:1). Shortly thereafter, on August 19, 2008, Meyer was placed on leave restriction, which required her to report her arrival and departure on a daily basis, and provide her supervisor with a medical certification anytime illness required her to miss time from work. (See id. 158:1-159:7). The leave restriction lasted approximately six months. (See id. 161:4-6).
Keck returned to South Florida [*5]  as Meyer's first-line supervisor in October 2009. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 7; Resp. 5). On April 1, 2010, Keck issued Meyer a memorandum of caution for issues related to Meyer's unavailability for work during her scheduled working hours and failing to attend a mandatory meeting. (See July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 162:22-164:24). On April 21, 2010, Meyer was placed on leave restriction for a second time. (See Meyer's SMF ¶ 14a). On July 30, 2010, Meyer formally requested an accommodation for her disabilities. (See Resp. 7)
Meyer, along with her National Treasury Employees Union (the "Union") representatives, met with Facundo Bernal ("Bernal"), Meyer's second-line supervisor at the time, and Keck "to discuss Meyer's reasonable accommodation request" on September 14, 2010. (Resp. 7). By letter dated September 17, 2010, Bernal granted Meyer's request for a reasonable accommodation. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 15; Resp. 7). Specifically, Bernal granted Meyer's request to be placed on an "Any-80" schedule, which allowed her the flexibility to work at her discretion, so long as she worked a total of eighty hours every two-week pay period and was present in the office during core hours Monday through Friday. (See [*6]  July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 235:2-9; HHS's SMF ¶ 12). Bernal also terminated Meyer's leave restriction one month ahead of schedule. (See id. 237:8-23).
Shortly after Bernal granted Meyer her Any-80 schedule request, the FDA and the Union entered into a new Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA"). (See HHS's SMF ¶ 16). The new CBA did not contain an Any-80 schedule. (See id.). Bernal incorrectly believed he was required to change Meyer's schedule as a result of the new CBA. (See Bernal Dep. 20:4-7 [ECF No. 52-5]). Consequently, Bernal met with Meyer and explained to her that he was changing her accommodation to a First-40 schedule — the most flexible schedule remaining under the CBA. (See HHS's SMF ¶ 18). The First-40 schedule allowed Meyer to vary her schedule as long as she completed forty hours each week and was present in the office during core hours Monday through Friday. (See July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 241:7-11; HHS's SMF ¶ 12). Although Meyer was concerned the First-40 schedule might not provide her the flexibility she needed to properly accommodate her disability, she never voiced that concern to Bernal or Keck. (See July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 8:22-9:15).
In October 2010, Keck was approached [*7]  by two CSOs separately, each of them reporting Meyer had invited them to go to the park during work hours. (See Keck Dep. 48:10-51:13 [ECF No. 52-8]; Bernal Dep. 54:20-55:1). Keck took this information to his direct supervisor, Bernal, who told Keck to investigate the matter and find out what times Meyer was leaving firms during field work and when she was arriving at the FDA. (See Keck Dep. 50:15-22; Bernal Dep. 54:20-55:14). In an e-mail dated October 25, 2010, Keck reported Meyer's comings and goings over a four-day period to Bernal. (See Bernal Dep. Ex. 1 at 1-2). The findings "gave [Bernal] an indication that [Meyer] was taking longer out in the field and there was some unaccounted time . . . ." (Bernal Dep. 58:2-5).
In late October or early November 2010, Bernal reached out to Emma Singleton ("Singleton"), Director of the Florida District for the FDA, regarding the allegations Meyer was going to the park during work hours. (See Decl. Singleton ¶¶ 1, 3 [ECF No. 52-9]). Believing the allegations to be "egregious," Singleton spoke with her supervisor, Malcolm Frazier ("Frazier"), Southeast Regional Director for the FDA, and advised him she was considering reporting the matter to [*8]  the FDA Office of Internal Affairs ("OIA") — a decision Frazier approved. (Id. ¶ 5). Singleton then contacted the FDA's OIA and reported the allegations concerning Meyer. (See id. ¶ 6).
Mark McCormack, Special Agent in Charge in the OIA "made the decision to institute surveillance of Meyer and assigned Special Agents Alberto L. Gonzalez [("Agent Gonzalez")] and Patrick Hanks [("Agent Hanks")] to perform the investigation." (Decl. McCormack ¶ 3 [ECF No. 52-10]). Agent Gonzalez "surveilled Stacey Meyer at the direction of Mr. McCormack." (Decl. Gonzalez ¶ 3 [ECF No. 52-11]). Agent Gonzalez had no knowledge of Meyer's disabilities or request for an accommodation when he began the OIA investigation on November 16, 2010. (See id. ¶ 4). Agent Gonzalez ran surveillance on Meyer from November 31, 2010 through February 2, 2011, for a total of 35 working days, revealing that during that time, "Meyer had been to the park on [thirty-one] occasions during working hours, spending between eleven minutes and four hours at the park each time." (Id. ¶ 5). After the investigation concluded, Agent Gonzalez and Agent Hanks "met with Meyer on February 3, 2011, to allow Meyer to respond to [their] findings." [*9]  (Id. ¶ 9).
On April 11, 2011, Keck sent Meyer notice of her Proposed Removal [ECF No. 52-3], citing Meyer for: (1) misusing a GOV, (2) providing misleading information to investigators, and (3) misrepresenting her time and attendance records. (See Proposed Removal 1). The Proposed Removal included thirty-two specific examples of Meyer's misuse of a GOV, most often for trips to the park. (See id. 1-9). The Proposed Removal states Meyer provided misleading information regarding her visits to the park to investigators during her February 3, 2011 interview with Agents Gonzalez and Hanks. (See id. 9-10). In addition, the Proposed Removal includes twenty-eight specific examples in which Meyer misstated her actual hours worked by a total of forty-three hours and eleven minutes. (See id. 10-17). Meyer responded to the Proposed Removal orally and in writing, and on July 12, 2011, Bernal issued his Decision to Remove [ECF No. 51-5] after carefully reviewing the Proposed Removal and Meyer's Oral Reply [ECF No. 51-6] to the Proposed Removal notice. (See HHS's SMF ¶¶ 54, 57).
Meyer filed an Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") complaint of discrimination on April 21, 2011, alleging "she was subjected to harassment and hostile [*10]  work environments on the bases of disability (mental), sex (female), and retaliation/reprisal (for requesting and being granted reasonable accommodation on September 17, 2010)." (May 10, 2012 Meyer Dep. Ex. 3 [ECF No. 52-4]). Meyer's First Amended Civil Complaint ("Amended Complaint") [ECF No. 21] alleges four separate claims: (Count I) discrimination based on disability for Meyer's termination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. sections 701-797b (the "Rehabilitation Act"); (Count II) discrimination based on disability for the FDA's failure to accommodate Meyer's disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act; (Count III) retaliatory termination against Meyer for engaging in a protected activity in violation of the Rehabilitation Act; and (Count IV) discrimination based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. section 2000e-2(a) ("Title VII"). (See Am. Compl. 16-20). Through its Motion, HHS seeks summary judgment on all claims. (See generally Mot.).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled [*11]  to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c). "[T]he court must view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment." Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (quoting Haves v. City of Miami, 52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir. 1995)). "An issue of fact is material if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case." Burgos v. Chertoff, 274 F. App'x 839, 841 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Allen v. Tyson Foods Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). "A factual dispute is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Channa Imps., Inc. v. Hybur, Ltd., No. 07-21516-CIV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56591, 2008 WL 2914977, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Jul. 25, 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)).
The movant's initial burden on a motion for summary judgment "consists of a responsibility to inform the court of the basis for its motion and to identify those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). "[T]he plain language of Rule 56 mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that [*12]  party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, 683 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).

III. ANALYSIS
HHS argues Meyer's gender and disability discrimination claims in Counts I and IV fail, as Meyer has not demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination (see Mot. 4-7, 11-13), and even if she could, Meyer has not presented any evidence to establish HHS's reasons for terminating Meyer were pretextual or the result of intentional discrimination (see id. 16-17). Similarly, HHS contends Meyer cannot establish a prima facie claim for retaliation in Count II because she has not established a causal connection between her termination and her complaint of discrimination. (See id. 10-11). HHS additionally argues Meyer cannot establish a claim for failure to accommodate Meyer's disability in Count III because "the FDA fulfilled its obligation toward Meyer by providing her an accommodation that allowed her the flexibility she needed to address her condition." (Id. 9). Meyer contends she has presented sufficient circumstantial evidence of her employer's discriminatory intent to survive summary judgment as to Counts I and IV. (See Resp. 15-16, 19-20). She argues the FDA acted in contravention of [*13]  the Rehabilitation Act when it revoked her reasonable accommodation without engaging Meyer in an interactive process. (See id. 18). Meyer further asserts her retaliation claims are not appropriately resolved on summary judgment, as she has presented evidence of a causal connection between her discrimination complaints and her subsequent termination. (See id. 17).
The Court begins its analysis with a discussion of Count IV before turning to Counts I, II, and III, as the legal framework for evaluating Title VII discrimination claims is equally applicable to discrimination claims made pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).

A. Count IV — Gender Discrimination
HHS contends summary judgment on Meyer's gender discrimination claim is appropriate because Meyer fails to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination through the use of comparators or other circumstantial evidence. (See Mot. 16). HHS further asserts it has legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Meyer. (See id.). Meyer responds, "[a] convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence . . . supports an inference of gender-based discrimination by Keck." (Resp. 19-20).
Title VII makes it unlawful "to fail or [*14]  refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). "A plaintiff can prove gender discrimination through either direct or circumstantial evidence." Lawver v. Hillcrest Hospice, Inc., 300 F. App'x 768, 771 (11th Cir. 2008) (citing E.E.O.C. v. Joe's Stone Crabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002)). "Direct evidence is evidence, which if believed, proves the existence of the fact in issue without inference or presumption." Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dep't of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003) (alterations, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Absent such evidence, a plaintiff may prove its case through circumstantial evidence, using the familiar burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), . . . and subsequent cases." Joe's Stone Crabs, 296 F.3d at 1272. "Under this framework, the plaintiff initially must establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Id. (citation omitted). A plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of discrimination by establishing: "(1) [s]he is a member of a protected class; (2) [s]he was qualified for the position; (3) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) [s]he was replaced by a person outside [her] protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside [her] [*15]  protected class." Maynard, 342 F.3d at 1289 (alterations added) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802). A similarly-situated comparator is an employee "involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct," "similarly situated in all relevant respects," that is disciplined differently than the plaintiff. Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).
"By establishing a prima facie case, the plaintiff creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against her." Joe's Stone Crabs, 296 F.3d at 1272 (citing U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 714, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 75 L. Ed. 2d 403 (1983)). "The burden then shifts to the employer to rebut this presumption by producing evidence that its action was taken for some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason." Id. (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). "An employer's burden to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for an action is 'exceedingly light.'" Beha v. Fla., Dep't of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles, No. 4:11cv587-RH/CAS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152674, 2012 WL 5258527, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 24, 2012) (quoting Perryman v. Johnson Prods. Co., 698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir. 1983)). "At this stage of the inquiry, the defendant need not persuade the court that its proffered reasons are legitimate; the defendant's burden is merely one of production, not proof." Perryman, 698 F.2d at 1142 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
"Should the employer meet its burden of production, the presumption of discrimination is rebutted, and the inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity, in which the plaintiff [*16]  must show that the proffered reason really is a pretext for unlawful discrimination." Joe's Stone Crabs, 296 F.3d at 1272-73 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "In order to show pretext, the plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Brown v. Ryder Sys. Inc., No. 11-62746-Civ, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7761, 2013 WL 221496, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 18, 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1030 (citations omitted). "Although the intermediate burdens of production shift back and forth, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee remains at all times with the plaintiff." Joe's Stone Crabs, 296 F.3d at 1273 (citations omitted).
"However, establishing the elements of the McDonnell Douglas framework is not, and never was intended to be, the sine qua non for a plaintiff to survive a summary judgment motion in an employment discrimination [*17]  case." Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011). A "plaintiff's failure to produce a comparator does not necessarily doom the plaintiff's case." Id. Consequently, a plaintiff may survive a motion for summary judgment if she can present "a convincing mosaic of evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decision[-]maker." Id. (footnote call number, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, both parties agree there is no direct evidence of gender discrimination. HHS expressly argues, "there is no direct evidence of . . . gender discrimination" (Mot. 3), while Meyer appears to concede this position by incorporating the McDonnell Douglas framework into her Response, arguing "[a] convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence also supports an inference of gender-based discrimination by Keck" (Resp. 19-20). Additionally, HHS does not dispute Meyer is a member of a protected class who was otherwise qualified for her job as a CSO. (See generally Mot.). Clearly, Meyer's termination qualifies as an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Ganpath v. Advance Stores Co., No. 10-60036-Civ, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140236, 2011 WL 6069336, at * 8 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 6, 2011). As a result, whether Meyer presents a triable issue on her discrimination claim depends on whether she can establish [*18]  a similarly-situated comparator received more favorable treatment than she did or a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence to infer discriminatory intent.
Meyer has failed to identify a similar-situated comparator outside her protected class who was treated more favorably. Meyer loosely identified Biera Montalvo ("Montalvo"), Diana Ramirez ("Ramirez"), Giovanna Schei-Surpa ("Schei Surpa"), John Bernal ("J. Bernal"), Cindy Laboyd ("Laboyd"), Marty Muckenfuss ("Muckenfuss"), Bernal, and Keck as potential comparators. (See July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 101:14-16, 102:10-103:6, 109:5-17, 111:7-18, 112:22-113:8). However, any attempt to identify Montalvo, Ramirez, Schei-Surpa, and Laboyd as valid comparators fails because each of them is the same gender as Meyer. See, e.g., Jeudy v. Holder, No. 10-22873-CIV, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128746, 2011 WL 5361076, at *9 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 7, 2011). Muckenfuss, J. Bernal, Bernal, and Keck each reported to a different supervisor than Meyer, and are thus not comparators. See, e.g., Gaston v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 129 F. Supp. 2d 1355, 1368 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Furthermore, Meyer does not present any evidence to show any of the referenced individuals engaged in conduct of the same scope and magnitude as Meyer. Cf. Bush v. Houston Cnty. Comm'n, 414 F. App'x 264, 267 (11th Cir. 2011) ("Employees who have committed multiple policy violations are not similarly situated to employees [*19]  who committed only one such violation." (citation omitted)). Meyer's blanket assertion that "a lot of people" misrepresented their time and took long lunches is not specific enough to identify a particular individual for comparison. Meyer has failed to identify any employee who misused a GOV on multiple occasions, misrepresented his time and attendance, and made misleading statements during an OIA investigation. See Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999) ("We require that the quantity and quality of the comparator's misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers' reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges." (citation omitted)). In sum, Meyer has not identified a similarly-situated employee outside her protected class who was treated more favorably by her employer. Consequently, Meyer has failed to state a prima facie claim of gender discrimination.
Even if Meyer could establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas framework, HHS has proffered sufficient evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Meyer's termination to rebut any presumption of discriminatory intent. HHS has presented evidence of Meyer's history of unscheduled absences, [*20]  which twice resulted in Meyer being placed on leave restriction. Furthermore, FDA policy clearly establishes that use of a GOV for unauthorized purposes is strictly prohibited and can result in removal. After being informed of Meyer's proclivity to take extended lunches in the park, her supervisors took this information up the chain of command to Singleton, who in turn brought these facts to the attention of the OIA at the FDA, where Special Agent in Charge McCormack decided to initiate an investigation into Meyer's actions. That investigation resulted in an abundance of evidence demonstrating Meyer had violated several FDA employee policies. After reviewing the evidence presented by the OIA and Meyer's own Oral Reply, Bernal came to the decision that Meyer's violations were serious and numerous enough to warrant her removal. Therefore, HHS has met its burden of demonstrating a legitimate business reason for Meyer's termination. See Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 770 (11th Cir. 2005) ("So long as the employer articulates a 'clear and reasonably specific' non-discriminatory basis for its actions, it has discharged its burden of production." (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55)).
Meyer fails to present any argument that her termination for these violations was [*21]  pretext designed to disguise her employer's discriminatory intent. Instead, Meyer maintains "a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence . . . supports an inference of gender-based discrimination by Keck." (Resp. 19-20). Her argument rests on Keck's "denial of sexual contact with Meyer," which she contends "calls [Keck's] credibility into question on all matters related to Meyer's removal . . . ." (Id. 20). Essentially, Meyer's position is that her previous relationship with Keck and the resulting isolated sexual encounter with Keck "[i]n 2004 or 2005" (id. 4), when Meyer and Keck were both CSOs, creates an inference of discriminatory intent (see id. 20). To support her position, Meyer cites Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998), in which she claims "the Supreme Court held that Title VII prohibits discrimination because of sex in the terms or conditions of employment, and this must extend to sexual harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements." (Resp. 19 (quoting Oncale, 523 U.S. at 79-80)). However, the Supreme Court also noted that "'[t]he critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.'" Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 25, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). And [*22]  in "[a]pplying Oncale, [the Eleventh Circuit] has distinguished between actions based on discriminatory animus and those based on personal animosity resulting from failed consensual relationships." Pipkins v. City of Temple Terrace, Fla., 267 F.3d 1197, 1200 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).
Meyer has failed to present a "convincing mosaic of evidence" sufficient to establish the inference of discrimination that Lockheed-Martin requires to avoid summary judgment. Assuming a sexual encounter between Meyer and Keck took place in 2005, Meyer fails to establish an inference of intentional discrimination on this basis. The lone sexual encounter was consensual and occurred several years before Keck became Meyer's supervisor.2 Furthermore, Meyer admits Keck has not made a sexual advance since returning to Miami as her supervisor. (See July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 76:14-16). The circumstances presented by Meyer are a far cry from the circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent presented to the Eleventh Circuit in Lockheed-Martin, another case cited by Meyer, which included: (1) a backdrop of racial tension in a corporation following a workplace shooting by an employee who was a white supremacist; (2) evidence the defendant's disciplinary review committee had utilized a spreadsheet [*23]  indicating an employee's race and gender in the course of its disciplinary investigation, (3) evidence of the distribution of racially insensitive and offensive e-mails; and (4) tension generated by an upcoming news program portraying Lockheed's struggles with racial intolerance in an unflattering light. See Lockheed-Martin, 644 F.3d at 1344-1346. In contrast, the circumstantial evidence presented by Meyer fails to demonstrate such a compelling mosaic of discriminatory animus.
Construing Meyer's allegations in the light most favorable to her, she has failed to present a convincing mosaic of evidence tending to show her termination was the result of discriminatory animus, and, at best, portrays Keck to have taken action against her because of his disappointment in their failed relationship — a relationship that ended years before Keck became Meyer's supervisor. Such a motivation is simply not "because of . . . gender" within the meaning of Oncale. Succar v. Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., 229 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir. 2000) ("We do not disregard this precept of sexual harassment law simply because the plaintiff and the alleged harassing party had a past sexual relationship. Regardless of the factual context, our analysis focuses only on whether the complaining employee was targeted because of his or her gender." (citation omitted)). Consequently, Meyer has failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on her claim of gender discrimination.

B. Count I — Disability Discrimination
HHS next argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Meyer's claim of disability discrimination [*25]  because Meyer cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. (See Mot. 4). Additionally, HHS maintains Meyer has failed to present evidence to rebut the FDA's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Meyer — namely, her trips to the park in a GOV during work hours. (See Reply 5). Meyer asserts "there are numerous material facts in dispute that, resolved in Meyer's favor, create 'a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination' by the FDA." (Resp. 16).
Pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. section 791, federal agencies are prohibited from discriminating against "otherwise qualified individuals with a disability" in employment decisions. Mullins v. Crowell, 228 F.3d 1305, 1313 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). The term "disability" is defined as (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual; (2) a record of such impairment; or (3) that the individual is regarded as having such an impairment. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Federal regulations define "major life activities" as functions such as "[c]aring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, [*26]  sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1). A "qualified individual" is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
The burden-shifting framework applied in Title VII discrimination cases is applicable to cases of discrimination pursuant to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. See Ellis, 432 F.3d at 1326 (citation omitted). "To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must show that [s]he was: (1) disabled or perceived to be disabled, (2) a qualified individual; and (3) discriminated against on the basis of his disability." Shannon v. Postmaster Gen. of U.S. Postal Serv., 335 F. App'x 21, 24 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). Meyer need only show she was discriminated against on the basis of her disability, as HHS has admitted Meyer is a "qualified individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act." (Resp. to Reasonable Accommodation Request 1 [ECF No. 52-2]).
In order to establish discrimination on the basis of disability occurred, an employee must show she suffered an adverse employment action because [*27]  of her disability. See Ellis, 432 F.3d at 1326 (citing Doe v. Dekalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1445 (11th Cir. 1998)). The employee must demonstrate she suffered an adverse employment action "solely by reason of" her disability. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); see also Ellis, 432 F.3d at 1326.
Meyer again argues a "convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence" exists that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the FDA based on the actions of Keck and Bernal. (Resp. 16). As part of this mosaic, Meyer cites: (1) "Bernal's hostility during the September 14, 2010 meeting;" (2) "Bernal's failure to tell Meyer that [Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA")] leave was an available accommodation;" (3) "Bernal's unjustified revocation of her Any-80 schedule;" (4) "Keck's hostility . . . [when he] stripp[ed] Meyer of entry review duties and mock[ed] her request for a less exposed cubicle;" (5) Keck and Bernal's refusal to simply confront and counsel Meyer regarding working at the park;" and (6) "Bernal's escalation of the matter to Singleton, which he intended to cause Meyer's removal." (Id.).
First, as to Meyer's alleged hostility during the September 14, 2010 meeting regarding Meyer's request for a reasonable accommodation, Meyer does not explain how any perceived hostility during a single meeting was guided by discriminatory animus. [*28]  When asked why Bernal was hostile, Meyer answered, "[h]e called me a liability. He challenged that I was unable to do my work because I can't concentrate and we have to talk to high officials when we go out to the field and '[h]ow can she do that if she has this inability to communicate with others?'" (Meyer Dep. 245:15-21). Assuming the conversation occurred as Meyer described it, Bernal was (insensitively) participating in a discussion regarding Meyer's capabilities and limitations in light of her disabilities. The EEOC regulations anticipate this sort of frank interaction will occur during the process of determining the proper accommodation to provide a qualifying employee. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) ("To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations."). That Bernal may have been blunt, inarticulate, or even rude during the meeting does not change the result. See Ganstine v. Buss, No. 4:11cv88-RH/WCS, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148497, 2011 WL 6780956, at *5 (N.D. Fla. Dec. 27, 2011) [*29]  ("The ADA, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is not a general civility code."); see also Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1245 (11th Cir. 1999).
Next, Bernal was under no affirmative duty to explain to Meyer that FMLA leave was a potential accommodation. The burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation rests with the employee, not the employer. And the record demonstrates Meyer was previously provided with information regarding FMLA leave on two separate occasions. (See July 22, 2013 Meyer Dep. 232:3-234:14). Even assuming Bernal did have an affirmative duty to explain to Meyer that FMLA leave was a potential accommodation, and further assuming Meyer was never given any information regarding FMLA leave, this evidence fails to connect Meyer's disability to the FDA's decision-making. See, e.g., Connor v. Bell Microproducts-Future Tech, Inc., 492 F. App'x 963, 967 n.1 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding summary judgment dismissing an employee's race and age discrimination claims was appropriate where the employee, arguing a mosaic theory, failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating his employer was particularly concerned with race or that the circumstantial evidence sufficiently connected the employee's race and age to the employer's decision-making process).
As to Bernal's decision to change Meyer's accommodation [*30]  from an Any-80 schedule to a First-40 schedule, the Court fails to see how this action shows discriminatory animus against Meyer. Bernal claims he changed Meyer's schedule because the new CBA had done away with the Any-80 schedule, and the First-40 was "the most flexible schedule that we [had] in the new collective bargaining agreement." (Bernal Dep. 19:20-22). An employer is within his rights to change an employee's accommodation, so long as the employer is providing the employee with a reasonable accommodation. See infra, Part III.C.
Likewise, Meyer does not point to a discriminatory basis for Keck's decision to assign her to do field work. The record is clear that both entry review and field work are among the official duties of a CSO. The discretion to assign work among the various CSOs is within the purview and discretion of a particular supervisor. Even if Meyer can establish that Keck reassigned her to do field work exclusively as a punitive measure, there is no evidence to suggest Keck did so solely on the basis of Meyer's disability (or her gender). As to Meyer's claim regarding her exposed cubicle, the record shows Meyer picked her own cubicle from a blueprint in October 2010. [*31] 3 (See July 23, 2013 Meyer Dep. 15:6-16:3). And even if Keck's comment regarding Meyer's inability to concentrate at her cubicle can be considered a remark on her disabilities, such a stray remark, although potentially inflammatory or insensitive, is not sufficient to connect Meyer's termination to her disability.
Regarding Bernal and Keck's failure to counsel Meyer regarding her trips to the park and Bernal's subsequent conversation with Singleton wherein Bernal brought these allegations to her attention, these actions show no discriminatory animus whatsoever. As explained by the Eleventh Circuit,
[f]ederal courts do not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions. No matter how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high-handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers, the ADEA does not interfere. Rather, our inquiry [*32]  is limited to whether the employer gave an honest explanation of its behavior.
Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Keck, after being told by two employees that Meyer had invited them to the park during work hours, made the decision to report the allegations to his direct supervisor, Bernal. Bernal, not wanting to confront Meyer with bare accusations, instructed Keck to continue to investigate the matter. Keck's brief investigation of Meyer revealed her time was potentially being misrepresented. After being briefed by Keck, Bernal made the decision to bring the situation to the attention of Singleton, Director of the Florida District for the FDA and Bernal's direct supervisor. These actions amount to mere business decisions made by Keck and Bernal as managerial employees of the FDA. Consequently, Meyer has failed to establish the existence of circumstantial evidence that would enable a jury to infer discriminatory intent. Summary judgment on count I in favor of HHS is appropriate.

C. Count II — Failure to Accommodate
HHS maintains a grant of summary judgment on Meyer's failure to accommodate claim is proper because the FDA provided Meyer with a reasonable accommodation that [*33]  "allowed her the flexibility she needed to address her condition," and it had no obligation to provide Meyer with the accommodation of her choice. (Mot. 9). Additionally, HHS contends the FDA had no further obligation to engage Meyer in an interactive dialogue after Meyer "failed to articulate how the change in accommodation would not accommodate her disability . . . ." (Id.). In response, Meyer argues the FDA revoked her accommodation without engaging her in the interactive process. (See Resp. 18-19).
An employer may run afoul of the Rehabilitation Act by "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). "To state a prima facie case for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) [s]he is disabled; (2) [s]he is a qualified individual; and (3) [s]he was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). A claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA does not require evidence of a discriminatory intent by the employer — the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation is itself a violation [*34]  of the ADA.4 See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007). As previously discussed in Part III.B., supra, HHS does not rebut Meyer is a qualified individual with a disability. Thus, the Court's analysis deals exclusively with whether HHS failed to provide Meyer a reasonable accommodation.
"An accommodation can qualify as 'reasonable,' and thus be required by the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows h[er] to perform the job's essential functions." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted). Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 12111(9)(A)(B), a "reasonable accommodation" may include "part-time or modified work schedules." Id. § 12111(9)(B). However, a qualified employee with a disability is not automatically "'entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 948 (N.D. Ga. 1995)). And "[a] plaintiff does not satisfy her initial burden by simply naming a preferred accommodation — even one mentioned in the statute or regulations; she must show that the accommodation [*35]  is 'reasonable' given her situation." Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).
Meyer has identified a reasonable accommodation — the Any-80 flexible schedule. The record establishes Bernal agreed to accommodate Meyer with an Any-80 flexible schedule shortly after they met to discuss Meyer's request for reasonable accommodation. But in October 2010, Bernal told Meyer he had decided to change her Any-80 schedule to a First-40 schedule. At the time, Bernal was under the mistaken belief the new CBA's elimination of the Any-80 schedule required him to change Meyer's schedule to the most flexible option remaining — the First-40 schedule. Although the new CBA did abolish the Any-80 schedule, the Any-80 schedule was not provided to Meyer as part of a collective bargained action, but as a reasonable accommodation to her disabilities. The essential question is whether Meyer was discriminated against when the FDA changed her schedule from an Any-80 schedule to a First-40 schedule.
Meyer maintains a reasonable jury could find the FDA failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation based on its "imposition of the inadequate Any-40 schedule without any interactive process . . . ." (Resp. 19). "The federal regulations [*36]  implementing the ADA 'envision an interactive process that requires participation by both parties.'" Templeton v. Neodata Servs., Inc., 162 F.3d 617, 619 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996)). "To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); see also Gilliard v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., 500 F. App'x 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012). "But where . . . the employer does not obstruct the [interactive] process, but instead makes reasonable efforts both to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possessed, ADA liability simply does not follow." Beck, 75 F.3d at 1137.
Although Meyer cites to some cases from other jurisdictions in support of her theory that an employer's failure to engage in the interactive process is enough to establish a claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, this is not the law of the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit has determined "the ADA provides no cause of action for 'failure to investigate' possible accommodations . . . ." Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). Moreover, even if that were the law of this circuit, the record shows the parties did meet in September 2010 to discuss a reasonable accommodation. Although the CBA changed shortly [*37]  thereafter and Bernal made up his mind to change Meyer's accommodation, there is nothing in the record to suggest Bernal did not utilize the information gleaned from the prior meeting when he decided to change Meyer's accommodation. Furthermore, when Meyer was told about the change in her accommodation, she did not protest or otherwise respond despite having the opportunity to do so. Bernal sent Meyer an e-mail regarding her First-40 schedule in which Bernal advised Meyer to "please feel free to contact [him]" if she had any questions regarding the accommodation. (April 25, 2013 Bernal Dep. Ex. 10 [ECF No. 52-6]). Consequently, even if a failure to engage in the interactive process is actionable, the FDA did all that the law requires of it in investigating Meyer's disability.
An employer's decision to provide a qualifying employee an accommodation that goes beyond the minimum requirements of reasonableness does not prevent the employer from later affording the employee a different reasonable accommodation. Cf. Schwertfager v. City of Boynton Beach, 42 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1365 n.14 (S.D. Fla. 1999) (finding where employer provided accommodations that exceeded those required under the ADA, "a decision to discontinue accommodations does not give rise to liability for failure [*38]  to reasonably accommodate." (citation omitted)). Undeniably, the Rehabilitation Act only requires that an employer provide a qualifying employee with a reasonable accommodation — not the accommodation of the employee's choosing. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286.
Here, it is undisputed that the FDA provided Meyer with the First-40 schedule as an accommodation for her disabilities. Although not as flexible as the Any-80 schedule, Bernal believed this alternative work schedule would still allow Meyer the flexibility she needed to perform the essential functions of her job. (See Bernal Dep. 17:16-20). In contrast, Meyer has failed to present any evidence showing the First-40 schedule was not a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities. In fact, Meyer did not contest the reasonableness of the First-40 schedule accommodation until after she was made aware of the OIA investigation against her — approximately five months after Meyer was placed on the First-40 schedule. Having failed to meet her initial burden, summary judgment on Meyer's reasonable accommodation claim in favor of HHS is appropriate.

D. Count III — Retaliation
HHS argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Meyer's retaliation claim, as Meyer has failed [*39]  to establish the causal connection between her termination and her request for a reasonable accommodation. (See Mot. 11). Meyer asserts she need only show that her request for a reasonable accommodation and her termination are not completely unrelated, and that "the same convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence already discussed" establishes a causal link between her request for a reasonable accommodation and her termination. (Resp. 17).
The Rehabilitation Act incorporates the ADA's anti-retaliation provision, which is similar to Title VII's prohibition on retaliation and is assessed under the same framework. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that she (1) engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was some causal relationship between the two events. See Tarmas v. Sec'y of Navy, 433 F. App'x 754, 762 (11th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). "To establish prima facie the causation element of a retaliation claim, the plaintiff need only show that h[er] protected activity and the adverse employment action are not completely unrelated." Castillo v. Roche Labs., Inc., 467 F. App'x 859, 862 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). Where an employee has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that she has a disability, the act [*40]  of requesting a reasonable accommodation qualifies as a statutorily protected activity. See Tarmas, 433 F. App'x at 762 (citation omitted).
"A plaintiff satisfies this element by showing that the decision-maker knew of the protected activity, and that a close temporal proximity existed between this awareness and the adverse employment action." Castillo, 467 F. App'x at 862 (citation omitted). "But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close." Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the employer to present legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment action to negate the inference of retaliation. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287 (citation omitted). The plaintiff must then demonstrate the employer's proffered non-discriminatory reasons are pretext for retaliation. See id. (citation omitted).
Here, the causal connection between Meyer's request for a reasonable accommodation and her removal is too attenuated. "Meyer engaged in protected activity when she formally requested an accommodation in July 2010." (Resp. 17). The FDA removed Meyer, after a full OIA investigation, approximately one year later, on July 12, 2011. Simply put, a one-year gap in time is not close [*41]  enough, standing alone, to establish temporal proximity. See, e.g., Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1221 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)). Additionally, Meyer's reliance on the "same mosaic of circumstantial evidence already discussed" (Resp. 17), fails for the reasons explained in Part III.B., supra. Accordingly, Meyer fails to establish a prima facie retaliation claim.
Even if the Court assumes Meyer properly makes out a prima facie retaliation claim, Meyer has not rebutted the FDA's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for her termination by submitting sufficient evidence to show the FDA's stated reasons for terminating her were actually pretext for retaliation. Meyer offers no argument of pretext related to her retaliation claim, and the Court's exhaustive analysis of pretext similarly applies here. See supra, Part III.A. Consequently, summary judgment is appropriate on the retaliation count as well.
