Opinion



ORDER AND REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
The following motions are pending before the Court:
1. Plaintiff Neda Mehryari's ("Plaintiff") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment") (Dkt. 29), to which Defendant First National Bank Texas d/b/a First Convenience Bank ("Defendant") filed a response (Dkt. 51); Plaintiff filed a reply (Dkt. 55); and Defendant filed a sur-reply (Dkt. 67);
2. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment") (Dkt. 74), to which Plaintiff filed a response (Dkt. 80); Defendant filed a reply (Dkt. 93); and Plaintiff filed a sur-reply (Dkt. 95);
3. Defendant's response to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (see Dkt. 51) also embodies a motion to exclude [*2]  Plaintiff's summary judgment evidence pursuant to Rule 37 ("Defendant's Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence"), to which Plaintiff responded in its reply (Dkt. 55); and Defendant responded in its sur-reply (Dkt. 67); and
4. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence (Dkt. 82), to which Defendant filed a response (Dkt. 91); and Plaintiff filed a reply (Dkt. 94).
As set forth below, the Court recommends: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29) should be DENIED; and (2) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 74) should be DENIED.
Further, the Court finds: (1) Defendant's Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence (see Dkt. 51) is DENIED; and (2) Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence (Dkt. 82) is DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked for Defendant from on or around March 17, 2015, until she was terminated on or around October 7, 2016. See Dkt. 29 at 7. Plaintiff brought this action alleging she was wrongfully terminated when she requested accommodations for her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12112, and the similar state law, Section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code, as well as the Family and Medical [*3]  Leave Act (the "FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2615. See generally Dkt. 1. Plaintiff asserts she disclosed her condition to Defendant in or around October 2015, when she was hospitalized for her condition of clinical depression, and again in January 2016. See id. at 3. Plaintiff also alleges she suffered retaliation in violation of Section 21.055 of the Texas Labor Code. See id. According to Plaintiff, her superiors harassed her because of her condition, often referring to her as "the crazy one" to her face and to others. Id. Plaintiff also asserts she occasionally requested time off from work due to her condition. Id. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29) argues that the record establishes Plaintiff 's diagnosis of depression qualifies as a disability as a matter of law. See Dkt. 29.
Defendant counters that Plaintiff was terminated for falsifying her time record after she arrived to work late on October 1, 2016. See Dkt. 74 at 4-5. According to Defendant, Plaintiff did not inform Defendant that she had a disability and did not request an accommodation for any alleged disability at the time of hire. Id. at 4. Although Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff took leaves of absence for inpatient hospital treatment in October 2015, January 2016, and [*4]  June 2016, Defendant claims it believed those hospitalizations were for substance abuse issues. Id. Defendant states that even after those leaves of absence, Plaintiff failed to inform Defendant that she had a disability and did not request an accommodation. Id. at 5. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 74) argues that Plaintiff cannot meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case because she cannot prove that she is a person with a disability, that she was qualified for her job, or that she suffered an adverse employment action on account of her disability. See id. at 11.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the evidence and all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1999). The appropriate inquiry is "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden to prove there are no genuine issues of material fact for trial. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Goel, 274 F.3d 984, 991 (5th Cir. 2001). In sustaining this burden, [*5]  the movant must identify those portions of pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The moving party, however, "need not negate the elements of the nonmovant's case." Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc). The movant's burden is only to point out the absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party's case. Stults v. Conoco, Inc., 76 F.3d 651, 655 (5th Cir. 1996).
In response, the non-movant "may not rest upon mere allegations contained in the pleadings, but must set forth and support by summary judgment evidence specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial." Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255-57). Once the moving party makes a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must look beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts in the record to show there is a genuine issue for trial. Stults, 76 F.3d at 655. The citations to evidence must be specific, as the district court is not required to "scour the record" to determine whether the evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact. E.D. Tex. LOCAL R. CV-56(d). Neither "conclusory allegations" nor "unsubstantiated assertions" will satisfy the nonmovant's burden. Stults, 76 F.3d at 655 [*6] .

III. ANALYSIS

A. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Discovery disputes have been the rule rather than the exception in this case, which has been fraught with an abundance of discovery disputes requiring Court intervention and resulting in multiple extensions of scheduling deadlines. See, e.g., Dkts. 16, 27, 51, 81, 82, and 86. In addition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29) and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 74), there are a number of pending objections and motions to strike with respect to expert testimony and other summary judgment evidence. Although Plaintiff's motions to strike Defendant's proposed human resources expert, Kim Jackson ("Ms. Jackson"), and Defendant's proposed medical expert, George S. Glass, M.D., P.A. ("Dr. Glass"), (collectively, "Plaintiff's Motions to Strike Experts") (Dkts. 27. 69-1, 77-1) remain pending at this time, the Court determines it need not address Plaintiff's Motions to Strike Experts for purposes of the parties' present motions for summary judgment. Furthermore, to the extent Defendant presents the declarations of Ms. Jackson and Dr. Glass as evidence in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment (see Dkts. 74-5, 74-8), [*7]  such evidence was not relied upon by the Court in reaching the findings and recommendations in this opinion, and thus, need not be addressed herein. Thus, the Court will address objections only with respect to the parties' proffered summary judgment evidence considered by the Court.

1. Defendant's Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence
The Court will first address Defendant's attempt to re-argue discovery disputes already resolved by the Court. Defendant asks the Court to employ Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to strike documents Defendant produced after the discovery deadline. See Dkt. 51 at 3-5. Rule 37 provides, in relevant part:

(c) Failure to Disclose, to Supplement an Earlier Response, or to Admit.

(1) Failure to Disclose or Supplement. If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or was harmless.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Specifically, Defendant requests the Court to strike the documents submitted as Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29-3) and to preclude Plaintiff from using these documents [*8]  "for any purpose at any time in this litigation. " Dkt. 51 at 7.
The documents in Exhibit C consist of copies of documents that Plaintiff submitted to Defendant during her employment, which were related to her FMLA leave requests. See Dkt. 51 at 4. As Defendant frames the issue, Plaintiff was not entitled to request these records because: (1) the discovery deadline had already passed; (2) Plaintiff failed to timely disclose the existence of any medical providers or medical records; and (3) Plaintiff had no need to request the records from Defendants, as they were her own records. Id. at 4. Defendant goes on to accuse Plaintiff of demonstrating "a consistent history of discovery abuse" and "hiding information and documentation regarding her medical providers." Id. at 3. As discussed further below, these accusations are not supported by the record. The record indicates that the documents about which Defendant complains were in Defendant's possession and are relevant to Plaintiff's claims.
The parties' dispute regarding these documents was first brought to the Court's attention when Plaintiff's counsel contacted the undersigned's chambers via telephone in early May 2018, and then again via email on May [*9]  14, 2018. See Dkt. 29-5. In the email, Plaintiff complained that Defendant's counsel refused to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff's Request for Production ("RFP") No. 9, which asked for "any medical records or other documents that discuss, refer to, or relate to Plaintiff." Id. at 1. Plaintiff posited that any documents in Defendant's possession wherein Plaintiff requested FMLA leave or applied for short-term disability benefits, as well as any other medical records in Defendant's possession, were relevant to the claims and defenses in this case. See id. at 3. Defendant disagreed with Plaintiff's contention that such documents were relevant. Id. at 10. However, on May 15, 2018, Defendant responded that it would in fact produce the requested documents, not because they were relevant to any claim or defense, but because the documents were and always had been in Plaintiff's custody and control. Id. at 5.
The dispute, however, was not resolved, as the parties again communicated with the undersigned's chambers via telephone on May 16, 2018, Defendant seeking to quash subpoenas issued to Plaintiff's medical providers after the discovery deadline, and Plaintiff responding that, for a number of reasons, the subpoenas [*10]  should not be quashed. Thereafter, the parties appeared before the undersigned for a hearing on May 29, 2018. On May 30, 2018, the undersigned issued an Order (the "May 30 Order") (Dkt. 37), denying Defendant's motion to quash certain third-party subpoenas issued by Plaintiff and extending the discovery deadline, the expert disclosure deadline, and the dispositive motion deadline. See id. Defendant filed an objection to the May 30 Order (Dkt. 58), complaining that the undersigned failed to consider good cause in deciding to modify the scheduling deadlines. Finding no error in the ruling, the district judge overruled Defendant's objection to the May 30 Order. See Dkt. 66.
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Defendant's arguments seeking to exclude Exhibit C to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (see Dkt. 29-3) are meritless. Defendant has made multiple attempts to object to this evidence, all of which the Court has rejected. See, e.g., Dkts. 37, 55. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence (see Dkt. 51 at 6) is DENIED.

2. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence
Next, the Court considers Plaintiff's Motion [*11]  to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence (Dkt. 82), wherein Plaintiff objects to portions of the testimony of Defendant's Human Resources Senior Vice President, Michael Clubb ("Clubb"). See id. Specifically, Plaintiff objects to the following two statements in Clubb's affidavit (Dkt. 74-3):
a. Ms. Mehryari faxed a request for accommodations to her work on the afternoon of Saturday, October 1, 2016, after she had falsified her timecard for the day (id. at ¶ 5); and
b. Ms. Mehryari was fired on October 7, 2016, for timecard falsification (id. at ¶ 11).
Plaintiff argues that because Clubb's statements are not based on personal knowledge, they are inadmissible hearsay, and therefore, should be stricken. See generally Dkt. 82.
Hearsay is not admissible evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 802. Hearsay is a statement, not made while testifying in the current litigation, that is offered for "the truth of the matter asserted in the statement." Fed. R. Evid. 801. Statements offered against an opposing party that were made by "the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship" and statements "by the party in an individual or representative capacity" are also not hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). The Federal Rules of Evidence also [*12]  list twenty-nine exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Fed. R. Evid. 803-804, 807. A party's subjective belief is not itself excluded under the Rules of Evidence and may be relevant, for example to show motivation. See Lindsey v. Harris Cty., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46320, 2017 WL 1164299, at *11 (S.D. Tex. 2017) (internal citation omitted).
Here, neither of the objected-to statements in the Clubb affidavit are relied upon to prove that Plaintiff in fact falsified her time card entry, and thus, are not hearsay evidence on that issue. Moreover, the Court does not rely on such statements for that purpose in making its findings and recommendations in this opinion. Rather, the objected-to statements are offered either to show the bank's rationale for terminating Plaintiff's employment or the bank's belief that time records were falsified. Thus, the statements are admissible. Because the statements are admissible and because the Court did not rely on Clubb's affidavit in reaching its findings and recommendations, the Court declines to strike Clubb's affidavit for purposes of this opinion. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Summary Judgment Evidence (Dkt. 82) is, therefore, DENIED.

B. THE ADA AND THE ADAAA
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-13, prohibits discrimination against [*13]  an employee on the basis of physical or mental disability and requires an employer to make reasonable accommodations necessary to allow an employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of her job unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Section 12112(a) of the ADA provides that no covered entity shall "discriminate" against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such an individual in regard to, inter alia, "the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees . . . and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." In addition, Section 12112(b)(5) states that the term "discriminate" includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the know n physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of the business of such covered entity."
A "qualified individual with a disability" is defined as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). A disability is: "(A) [*14]  a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. " Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999); Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002). The ADA was amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"). See Neely v. PSEG Texas, Ltd. P'ship, 735 F.3d 242, 244 (5th Cir. 2013). Both Sutton and Toyota were overturned by the ADAAA. Sutton, holding that an employee is not disabled if his impairment is corrected by a mitigating measure to the point where it does not substantially limit a major life activity (e.g., by insulin given to a diabetic), required a court to take into account the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures in determining whether there was a disability, while Toyota narrowly construed and strictly interpreted the term "disability." Garner v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., L.P., 834 F. Supp. 2d 528, 534 (S.D. Tex. 2011).
In crafting the ADAAA, Congress intended "that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations [ ] and . . . that the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis." Neely, 735 F.3d at 244 (citing Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(5), 122 Stat. 3553 (Sept. 25, 2008) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1201 (Note)). To that end, the ADAAA primarily focuses on broadening the definition of "disability" by singling [*15]  out and superseding Sutton, 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450, and Toyota, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615. Neely, 735 F.3d at 244 (citing Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(a)(4)-(6), (2)(b)(2)-(5) (listing congressional findings and purposes regarding the rejection of the rulings in these cases)). Because those two decisions interpreted congressional intent to narrow the scope of the words "substantially limits" and "major" in the first prong and "regarded as" in the second prong of the ADA's definition of disability, Congress added 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)-(4) to correct that perceived misinterpretation. Neely, 735 F.3d at 244.

C. THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS BURDEN-SHIFTING SCHEME
In a discriminatory termination action under the ADA, the employee may either present direct evidence that she was discriminated against because of her disability or alternatively proceed under the burden-shifting analysis first articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), a Title VII case. E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir. 2014) (internal citations omitted). Under the modified McDonnell Douglas approach, a plaintiff must demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668.
This analysis first requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discriminat ion. See LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d at 694. If the plaintiff succeeds in establishing her prima facie case, then the defendant must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination. See id. Finally, the burden shifts back [*16]  to the plaintiff to show the defendant's proffered reason is pretextual. See id. In the summary judgment context, a case of discrimination plus a showing that the proffered reason is pretextual is typically enough to survive summary judgment. Id. (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 146-48, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)).
To make her prima facie case, Plaintiff must establish that she was: (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) qualified and able to perform the essential functions of her job; and (3) fired because of her disability. Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 235 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing Talk v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 165 F.3d 1021, 1024 (5th Cir.1999)).

D. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Both parties seek to have the Court decide on summary judgment whether Plaintiff has met her prima facie burden to establish that she is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADAAA. For the reasons explained below, the Court finds both motions should be denied, and this matter should proceed to trial.

1. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
Plaintiff argues the undisputed evidence establishes that she had a disability as a matter of law because she both had an actual disability within the meaning of the ADAAA and a record of a disability. See Dkt. 29 at 5. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment that her impairment of clinical depression qualified as a disability [*17]  under both state and federal law. Id. at n. 1. As explained above, the ADAAA broadens the definition of "disability" and narrows the scope of the words "substantially limits" and "major" in the first prong and "regarded as" in the second prong of the ADA's definition of disability. See Neely, 735 F.3d 242, 244; 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)-(4). Despite the broadening of "disability" and the narrowing of "substantially limits" and "major" in the first prong, the Court finds Plaintiff has not established that these issues are undisputed. As the Fifth Circuit has pointed out, these amendments "make it easier to prove a disability, [however,] it does not absolve a party from proving one." Neely, 735 F.3d at 245.
Plaintiff alleges that she suffers from clinical depression. However, "[m]erely having an impairment . . . does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA." Chevron Phillips, 570 F.3d at 614. "[N]o matter how serious the impairment; the plaintiff still must adduce evidence of an impairment that has actually and substantially limited the major life activity on which he relies." Waldrip v. General Electric Co., 325 F.3d 652 (5th Cir. 2003). Therefore, to sustain her disability claim, Plaintiff must produce evidence that she both has an impairment, and that such impairment substantially limits a major life activity. In this case, Plaintiff provides [*18]  little more than vague and conclusory descriptions of the alleged limitations to her major life activities. See, e.g., Dkt. 29 at 10 (stating without further elaboration that Plaintiff's depression substantially limits several major life activities, such as "thinking and remembering, caring for herself, interacting and communicating with others, sleeping, eating, and feeling happy or experiencing happiness"). This is insufficient to establish Plaintiff's disability as a matter of law. Plaintiff must show with some level of specificity how her major life activities have been affected. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 502 (5th Cir. 2011). Furthermore, the fact that Plaintiff has been medicated and hospitalized for depression (see, e.g., Dkt. 29 at 11) does not by itself establish that her impairment substantially limited a major life activity.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to show the required limitation on her major life activities so as to allow the Court to make a reasonable inference that she is a person with a disability, as defined by the ADAAA, as a matter of law. Therefore, the Court concludes that the finder of fact must perform the necessary individualized analysis to determine whether [*19]  Plaintiff's alleged impairment can be shown to have substantially limited a major life activity.
Plaintiff also has not pointed to competent summary judgment evidence showing that her disability and its consequential limitations were known by Defendant. See Neely, 735 F.3d at 247. The Fifth Circuit has held:
For purposes of proving ADA discrimination, it is important to distinguish between an employer's knowledge of an employee's disability versus an employer's knowledge of any limitations experienced by the employee as a result of that disability. This distinction is important because the ADA requires employers to reasonably accommodate limitations, not disabilities. The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has, but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual.
Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 164 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(j), App. (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In this case there remains a triable fact question as to whether Plaintiff's disability (not just her impairment) and its consequential limitations were known by Defendant at the relevant time. See Neely, 735 F.3d at 247. Thus, Plaintiff has not established that she had a record of a disability. [*20] 
Because there remain genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff had a disability within the meaning of the ADAAA and whether she had a record of a disability, the Court finds that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29) should be DENIED.

2. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment argues that Plaintiff has failed to make her prima facie case because she cannot prove she is a person with a disability, that she was qualified for her job, or that she was subject to an adverse employment action on account of her disability. See Dkt. 74. With respect to Defendant's first basis for summary judgment—that Plaintiff has not established her prima facie case—the Court has already determined there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff had a disability within the meaning of the ADAAA. Thus, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.
Defendant's second and third bases for summary judgment are also without merit. Defendant argues that Plaintiff was not qualified for her position because she was "dishonest," a reference to the allegation that Plaintiff falsified her timecard, which is [*21]  itself a disputed fact. See Dkt. 74 at 16-17. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of her job because she was "dishonest." Defendant also has not established that there is no factual dispute with respect to the reason for Plaintiff's termination. Although Defendant contends it discharged Plaintiff for falsifying her timecard, Plaintiff contends a "routine timecard discrepancy" was used as a pretext for her termination. See Dkt. 80 at 40. Plaintiff also offers additional evidence of discriminatory animus toward Plaintiff in the form of comments from supervisors and co-workers that Plaintiff was "crazy," that "something was wrong with her," that she was "out there," and that she was "sick or whatever she is." Dkt. 80-8 (Declaration of Clarence "Chip" Griffith). Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that a jury could find that discrimination was the reason for Plaintiff's termination. See Goudeau v. Nat'l Oilwell Varco, L.P., 793 F.3d 470, 478 (5th Cir. 2015). Accordingly, the Court finds that determination of these issues should be left to the trier of fact, and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 74) should be DENIED.

IV. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, the Court [*22]  recommends: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 29) should be DENIED; and (2) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 74) should be DENIED.
