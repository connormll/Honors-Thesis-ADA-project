REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Statement of Facts and of the Case
This workplace disability discrimination and retaliation lawsuit case comes before us for consideration of a summary judgment motion filed by the defendant. (Doc. 33). With respect to this motion, the essentially undisputed facts1 reveal that Lori MacDonald was a long term, but troubled, employee at UPMC who had amassed a significant adverse history in the workplace at the time that her employment was terminated December of 2018. MacDonald also faced a number of medical challenges in 2017 and 2018, challenges which were consistently accommodated by UPMC, albeit occasionally in a slightly halting fashion.
Lori MacDonald worked as a nurse in the neonatal unit of UPMC Pinnacle Hospital-Harrisburg [*2]  from July 1985 through December 8, 2018. By 2017, MacDonald's employment history was marked by two prior disciplinary citations—a December 31, 2015 employee coaching record which cited her for failure to work collaboratively, and a January 9, 2017 notation citing her for excessive absenteeism from work. In addition, by 2017 MacDonald had twice utilized FMLA leave to address her medical needs and to care for her mother. According to MacDonald, on neither of these two prior occasions did she experience any workplace discrimination.
By the Fall of 2017, MacDonald was experiencing a series of medical and emotional impairments, including lymphedema, sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, neuromyositis, depression, and anxiety. As she had done in the past, MacDonald sought, and received, accommodations from her employer to address these medical conditions. UPMC first accommodated MacDonald by approving two months of FMLA leave for her from November 16, 2017 through January 27, 2018. In January of 2018, as her return date approached, MacDonald sought an additional accommodation in the form of an additional 30 days of leave. While MacDonald's immediate supervisor, Tina Willier, initially indicated that [*3]  MacDonald would have to re-apply for employment if she extended her leave for a third month, when MacDonald contacted UPMC's HR department, she received this second accommodation and was approved for an additional 30 days of leave, until the end of February 2018.
At the time of her return to work, MacDonald's physician completed a work capacities form for MacDonald. There was an enigmatic quality to this form. It stated that MacDonald could work full duty without limitations, but then suggested some shift limitations and indicated that MacDonald could not be pulled to work on other floors at the hospital. However, having been cleared to work full duty without limitations and having received these prior two accommodations from UPMC, MacDonald returned to work in the neonatal unit on or about March 2, 2018. When MacDonald returned to work she learned that the scheduling committee had created a work schedule for her which included a back-to-back 12 and 8 hour shift. It appears that this schedule was created before MacDonald returned to work by a committee that was not comprised of the individuals MacDonald now alleges discriminated against here.
MacDonald was upset when she returned to [*4]  work and learned of this schedule. She protested that she was physically unable to perform the schedule's back-to-back 12 and 8 hour shifts. After providing UPMC with a medical note confirming this physical limitation, MacDonald received a third accommodation and her shift schedule was revised to eliminate this back-to-back 12 to 8 hour work shift. With this accommodation, MacDonald was never required to work this particular shift.
While this action by UPMC constituted a third accommodation of MacDonald's physical and emotional needs, the manner in which she had expressed her dismay at her work schedule created a separate issue for UPMC staff. MacDonald apparently learned of this proposed schedule when she returned to work on March 2, 2018. Upset by this schedule, she engaged in a loud exchange with her supervisors and it was reported that she briefly left the neonatal unit during her shift, requiring other staff to oversee the children in her charge. When MacDonald returned to the unit she was confronted by a supervisor about her reported absence from the workplace. This admonition by the supervisor, in turn, led to a verbal altercation between MacDonald and a co-worker who MacDonald [*5]  accused of being "two-faced." This second incident was also reported to neonatal unit management, who cited MacDonald for unprofessionalism in the workplace on March 15, 2018. This citation warned MacDonald that her conduct violated UPMC's code of conduct, caused other staff to have to cover her tasks, and UPMC put MacDonald on notice that future deficiencies could result in corrective action, including termination of her employment.
Two months later, on May 29, 2018, MacDonald was placed on a one-month performance improvement plan which specifically required her to improve her workplace performance and refrain from disruptive and profane actions at work. MacDonald's work performance was also monitored by peer reviewers and a representative of UPMC's Patient Care Experience Team. These reviews provided a mixed picture of MacDonald's work performance, with some reviewers describing her performance in positive terms, while others cited continuing work deficiencies.
In particular, there were concerns that MacDonald was not consistently feeding and caring for infants in a timely fashion, and was engaging in occasional verbal outbursts that were not deemed appropriate for the culturally diverse [*6]  population served by the hospital.
In light of these reports, on October 16, 2018 MacDonald received a final written warning from UPMC, which provided her with specific instructions regarding how she should conduct herself at the workplace. This October 2018 final written warning also placed MacDonald on notice that further infractions could lead to additional corrective action including termination.
Despite this written warning, one month later MacDonald's supervisors received a disturbing report of additional unprofessional behavior on her part. This report came from Amanda Cresswell, who was a Regional Chief Nursing Officer for UPMC, and in November of 2018 was a patient in the hospital's neonatal unit. Notably, although she was employed by UPMC there is no indication that Cresswell had played any role in the supervision or oversight of MacDonald. While in the hospital with her own infant, Cresswell reported that she observed violations of UPMC's code of conduct by MacDonald on multiple occasions. These violations included the use of profanities by MacDonald, an episode in which MacDonald loudly complained that her patient care duties were interfering with her meal schedule, as well [*7]  as MacDonald's alleged description of an infant in her care as "stinky" and "disgusting," coupled with a complaint by MacDonald that the infant's mother left her with "such a mess." Cresswell reported that she also observed MacDonald's co-workers placed in the position of covering for her, and stated that her lack of professionalism created anxiety among the mothers whose children were entrusted to MacDonald's care.
MacDonald's supervisors resolved to address these latest issues directly with MacDonald but she called off of work on her next scheduled work days, November 26 and 27, 2018. Ultimately, MacDonald's supervisors contacted her by telephone to discuss this latest patient complaint on November 28, 2018. During this conversation, MacDonald denied using some profanities, while admitting using other profane terms but denied knowing that the words were considered vulgar. MacDonald also denied some of her derogatory remarks about infants in her care, while acknowledging other statements which she characterized as having been made in jest.2
Upon consideration of this latest incident, MacDonald's explanations and troubled work history, and some 11 instances of tardiness or absenteeism [*8]  that UPMC had experienced with MacDonald between May 31, 2018 and November 17, 2018, the decision was made to terminate MacDonald's employment on December 5, 2018. MacDonald was informed of this decision, and this litigation ensued.
Presently3 MacDonald is pursuing four claims: allegations of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), (Doc. 15, Counts I and III); as well as retaliation claims under the ADA and PHRA. (Id., Counts II and IV). It is against the backdrop of these legal claims, and this employment history, that the defendant, UPMC, has moved for summary judgment on these ADA and PHRA claims. This motion is fully briefed and is, therefore, ripe for resolution.
For the reasons set forth below, it is recommended that this motion for summary judgment be granted.

II. Discussion

A. Motion for Summary Judgment - Standard of Review
The defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a [*9]  "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-0493, 702 F. Supp. 2d 465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31615, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006), accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the [*10]  non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Schs., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark New Jersey v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting [*11]  a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence or assess credibility when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material [*12]  fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d
It is against these legal benchmarks that we assess the instant motion for summary judgment.

B. Elements of ADA and PHRA Discrimination and Retaliation Claims4
The purpose of the ADA is to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F.Supp.2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). The Act requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an undue hardship in the operation of their business." Id. (quoting Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, 2011 WL 1899198, at *9 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011)).
In order to make out a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is [*13]  (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998). A disability can take the form of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing under this three-part standard, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. See Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 2000) (noting that the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies to ADA disparate treatment and retaliation claims). If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is given, then the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's reasons were pretext for its unlawful action. Id. The plaintiff may meet this burden by identifying evidence that allows a factfinder either to disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate justification, or to conclude that an invidious discriminatory reason was [*14]  more likely than not a "but for" cause of the employment action. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994). This "but for" standard of causation sets an exacting benchmark for these claims.
Moreover, when a plaintiff brings a failure-to-accommodate claim under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that "(1) [s]he was disabled and h[er] employer knew it; (2) [s]he requested an accommodation or assistance; (3) h[er] employer did not make a good faith effort to assist; and (4) [s]he could have been reasonably accommodated." Capps v. Mondelez Global, LLC, 847 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Armstrong v. Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, 438 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted)).
The ADA also prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who oppose an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA or because the employee has made a charge under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Shellenberger v. Summit Bancorp, Inc., 318 F.3d 183, 188 (3d Cir. 2003) ("[I]t is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee based upon the employee's opposition to anything that is unlawful under the ADA"). Although requesting a reasonable accommodation does not appear to "fit[] within the literal language of the statute," Soileua v. Guilford of Maine, Inc., 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that making a good-faith request for an accommodation is protected activity for purposes of the ADA's anti-retaliation provision. Shellenberger, 318 F.3d at 191.
In order to make out a prima facie case of [*15]  illegal retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) protected employee activity, (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity, and (3) a causal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action. Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 759 (3d Cir. 2004); Fogleman v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., 283 F.3d 561, 567-68 (3d Cir. 2002). The same McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework described above with respect to ADA discrimination claims also applies to ADA retaliation claims. In all cases involving retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that retaliatory animus played a role in the employer's decision-making process and that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of the process. Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 501 (3d Cir. 1997). That burden always remains with the plaintiff. Id.
"In order to demonstrate a causal connection, a plaintiff may show (1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing." Gardner v. SEPTA, 410 F. Supp. 3d 723, 745 (E.D. Pa. 2019), aff'd, 824 F. App'x 100 (3d Cir. 2020) (citing Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 2007)). Oftentimes plaintiffs cannot rely upon direct evidence to carry this burden of proof and must turn to circumstantial proof. When a plaintiff seeks to establish discrimination or retaliation by circumstantial evidence, the Court of Appeals has prescribed [*16]  standards we must consider when evaluating the temporal proximity or remoteness of such circumstantial proof. In order to establish a retaliation claim circumstantially, "the timing of the alleged retaliatory action must be 'unusually suggestive' of retaliatory motive before a causal link will be inferred. Id. at 503. Applying this analysis courts have held that:
Although there is no bright line rule as to what constitutes unduly suggestive temporal proximity, a gap of three months between the protected activity and the adverse action, without more, cannot create an inference of causation and defeat summary judgment. See Clark County School Dist. 532 U.S. at 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508 (citing favorably Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir. 1997), which rejected such an inference where the events were three months apart); Andreoli v. Gates, 482 F.3d 641, 650 (3d Cir. 2007) (five-month time period between employee's complaint and first adverse action was, without additional evidence, insufficient to raise an inference of causation). Thus we ask whether there is sufficient evidence in the record for a reasonable fact-finder to determine that LeBoon's termination was caused by her complaint about the termination of her coworker.
LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 233 (3d Cir. 2007). See e.g., Hanna v. Lincoln Fin. Grp., 498 F.Supp.3d 669, 676 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (2 days sufficient to show temporal proximity); Cartagena v. Temple Univ. Hosp., Inc., 389 F.Supp.3d 341, 343 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (12 months); Parrotta v. PECO Energy Co., 363 F.Supp.3d 577, 582 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (8 months); Oden v. SEPTA, 137 F.Supp.3d 778 (E.D. Pa. 2015), aff'd, 671 F. App'x 859 (3d Cir. 2016) (5 months).
But establishing [*17]  a prima facie case does not guarantee success to a plaintiff pursuing an ADA claim. Rather:
If an employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, the burden shifts to the employer to advance a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its adverse employment action. Woodson, 109 F.3d at 920 n. 2. The employer's burden at this stage is "relatively light: it is satisfied if the defendant articulates any legitimate reason for the [adverse employment action]; the defendant need not prove that the articulated reason actually motivated the [action]." Id.
Krouse, 126 F.3d at 500-01.
The Third Circuit has summarized the showing that a defendant must make in order to obtain summary judgment on a claim of ADA retaliation:
[T]he employer must show that the trier of fact could not conclude, as a matter of law, (1) that retaliatory animus played a role in the decisionmaking process and (2) that it had a determinative effect on the outcome of that process. This may be accomplished by establishing the plaintiff's inability to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to either: (1) one or more elements of the plaintiff's prima facie case or, (2) if the employer offers a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action, [*18]  whether the employer's proffered explanation was a pretext for retaliation.
Id.

C. The Defendant's Summary Judgment Motion Should Be Granted.
Given the essentially undisputed facts in the instant case, we submit that MacDonald's claims fail as a matter of law and should be dismissed. Turning first to MacDonald's disability discrimination claims, as we have noted, under the ADA and the parallel provisions of the PHRA a discrimination claim typically is premised upon the unreasonable refusal to provide requested accommodation or assistance to a disabled employee. Here we are unable to discern what accommodation or assistance was requested by MacDonald, but refused by UPMC. Quite the contrary, while the interactive process behind these accommodations may have been halting at times, the uncontested record seems to reflect that every accommodation that was timely sought5 by MacDonald was granted by her employer. Thus, when MacDonald requested two months FMLA leave in November of 2017, she was afforded that leave. Later, when MacDonald requested for her leave to be extended to February of 2018, this request was also approved. Further, when upon her return MacDonald objected to back-to-back 12 [*19]  and 8 hour shifts, her work schedule was revised to accommodate this request. Finally, UPMC honored her request that she not be pulled off of the neonatal unit and sent to other units to work. Moreover, as MacDonald has conceded, she had previously been afforded FMLA leave on two separate occasions and by her own admission had experienced no discrimination from UPMC as a result of these prior accommodations. Given this history of disability accommodation, and the plaintiff's inability to identify a single timely request that was not ultimately accommodated, these ADA and PHRA discrimination claims fail and should be dismissed.
Likewise, MacDonald cannot prevail upon her ADA and PHRA retaliation claims on the current, essentially uncontested, factual record. These retaliation claims fail on several scores.
First, MacDonald cannot sustain these claims because they rely upon disparate and temporally remote events. MacDonald exercised her rights under the ADA and PHRA to request various accommodations from November of 2017 through March of 2018. She was then fired in December of 2018, more than one year after her first accommodation request and some nine months after her last ADA request [*20]  for assistance. These temporally remote events, standing alone, simply do not have the type of unusually suggestive temporal proximity that will support and inference of retaliation. While MacDonald attempts to bridge this temporal gulf by citing to isolated remarks and actions by her supervisors which the plaintiff contends demonstrate hostility based upon her exercise of her ADA rights, these efforts are unpersuasive and unavailing. Instead, MacDonald's dealings with her co-workers and supervisors upon her return to work in March of 2018 simply highlight a separate and compelling legal justification for her termination.
Simply put, even if we found that MacDonald had somehow bridged this temporal gulf and stated a prima facie claim, UPMC has amply shown that its employment actions rested upon legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. In particular, the evidence reveals that between March 2018 and December 2018, UPMC officials received multiple reports of unprofessional and belligerent conduct by MacDonald in the workplace. This misconduct included: chronic tardiness and absenteeism; use of profanities; confrontations with co-workers; failures to follow corrective actions and instructions; [*21]  inappropriate exchanges in the presence of patients; and derogatory comments about the infants placed in her care. These reports came from multiple sources, including a senior UPMC official who had observed MacDonald's misconduct while a patient in the neonatal unit. Moreover, this conduct reportedly persisted even after MacDonald received two written warnings and was placed on a performance improvement plan. Given these undisputed facts, it is clear that there were a host of legitimate grounds for terminating MacDonald's employment. See Ragsdale v. Univ. of Pennsylvania Health Sys., No. CV 19-2797, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63848, 2020 WL 1853552, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 13, 2020). Given that UPMC has provided these legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its actions, to avoid summary judgment, MacDonald:
"[M]ust be able to convince the factfinder both that the employer's proffered explanation was false, and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action." Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500-01 (3d Cir.1997). To survive a motion for summary judgment in the employer's favor, a plaintiff must produce some evidence from which a jury could reasonably reach these conclusions. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994). Moore v. City of Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 342 (3d Cir. 2006).
In this case, we find that UPMC has met its "relatively light" burden of showing a valid non-retaliatory reason for terminating MacDonald's employment. Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 at 500. However, MacDonald has not met [*22]  her burden of producing evidence which would show that UPMC's proffered explanations were false and pretextual. Accordingly, her retaliation claims also fail and should be dismissed.

III. Recommendation
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT the defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 33) be GRANTED..
The parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof.

The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, [*23]  in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
