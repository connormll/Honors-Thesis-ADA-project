Opinion



DECISION & ORDER
WILLIAM F. KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge: By Amended Complaint filed on October 9, 2018, Linda Soriero ("Plaintiff") brings this action against the Battery Park City Authority ("Defendant") alleging Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the New York City Human Rights Law ("CHRL"), on the basis of her gender, in violation of CHRL and the New York State Human Rights Law ("SHRL"), and retaliated against her in violation of ADA and CHRL. Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion for summary judgment in part and DENIES it in part.

BACKGROUND
The Court finds the following facts from the parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements, declarations, deposition testimony, and other evidence submitted in support of the motion, to be undisputed or construed [*2]  in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving party. Where facts in a party's Rule 56.1 Statement are supported by citations to evidence and denied by conclusory statements without citations to conflicting evidence, the Court finds such facts to be true. E.D.N.Y. Local Rules 56.1(c)—(d).
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant in 1999. Def.'s Statement of Facts ¶ 1, ECF No. 53 ("Def. St."). Plaintiff was hired as an administrative assistant to Mr. Robert Serpico, Defendant's Chief Financial Officer. Id. ¶ 2. Serpico retired in November 2016, id. ¶ 22, and Plaintiff began to work as administrative assistant for Ms. Janet Ozarchuk, Defendant's new CFO as of January 9, 2017, id. ¶¶ 23-25. On March 21, 2017, Shari Hyman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Defendant, made the decision to termination Plaintiff. Id. ¶ 55, 61. On April 5, 2017, Ms. Brenda McIntyre, Defendant's Vice President of Human Resources, emailed Plaintiff a notice she was terminated effective immediately. Id. ¶¶ 67, 86.

I. Sexual Harassment of Plaintiff
Until his retirement in 2016, Serpico was Plaintiff's supervisor and was responsible for completing performance evaluations. Id. ¶ 11. During Plaintiff's employment prior to 2013, Serpico would attempt [*3]  to have Plaintiff sit in his lap, Dep. of Pl. at 26:3-15, Ex. C to Decl. of Thomas M. Lancia, ECF No. 59-1 ("Lancia Pl. Dep."), persistently put a banana in Plaintiff's face asking "do you want my banana?", id. at 27:16-23, and ask if Plaintiff would "take me home with you?", id. at 227:11-228:8. At the end of 2012, Plaintiff complained about Serpico's conduct to Ms. Allyson Ford in Defendant's Equal Employment Office. Id. at 21:23-22:10. After Plaintiff complained about Serpico's conduct he became "more careful" and professional towards her. Dep. of Pl. at 228:12-229:16, Ex. 1 to Decl. of Beth L. Kaufman, ECF No. 52-1 ("Kaufman Pl. Dep."). After her complaints to Ford and prior to Serpico's retirement in 2016, Serpico gave Plaintiff a banana on one occasion, Def. St. ¶ 9, and on one occasion asked Plaintiff if she was sleeping with an individual employed as building security, id. ¶ 20.

II. Plaintiff's Health Condition
On March 15, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Ozarchuk and Sonia Henry, Defendant's Director of Human Resources, stating she had injured her back and would not be coming into work. Id. ¶ 43. On March 16, 17, and 20, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Ozarchuk and Henry to state she would [*4]  not be coming into work. Id. ¶¶ 45-47. On March 20, 2017, Plaintiff telephoned Henry to state she would be filing for workers' compensation based on carpal tunnel syndrome. Id. ¶ 48. On March 21, 2017, Plaintiff email Henry stating she had seen a physician and would not be coming to work because of her condition. Id. ¶ 50. On March 22, 2017, Plaintiff telephoned Henry stating she would not be coming into work because of doctor's appointments. Id. ¶ 70. On March 23, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Henry and McIntyre stating she was under doctor's care and did not know when she would be returning to the office. Id. ¶ 74. On Friday, March 31, 2017, Henry contacted Plaintiff to confirm she would be returning to work and Plaintiff responded with a doctor's note stating she would return to work on April 4, 2017. Id. ¶ 78. Hyman was unaware of Plaintiff's application for worker's compensation when she decided to terminate Plaintiff. Id. ¶ 64.

III. Copying Documents and the Greer Lawsuit
Among other duties, Plaintiff was responsible for filing and reviewing Serpico's mail. Id. ¶ 3. Beginning in 2009 or 2010 until 2014-2015, Plaintiff on occasion photographed Serpico's mail, other work documents, and [*5]  Serpico's personal correspondence. Id. ¶¶ 4-5. Among other documents, Plaintiff photographed Serpico's computer files related to Mr. Steven Greer, who formerly lived in a residential building operated by Defendant. Id. ¶ 5. Plaintiff did not have Serpico's permission to copy or photograph the documents. Id. ¶ 6.
Defendant produced an employee handbook which, inter alia, described employees' duty not to disclose "confidential information." Id. ¶ 15; Pl.'s Counterstatement of Material Facts ¶ 15, ECF No. 57 ("Pl. St."). Each year of her employment with Defendant, Plaintiff signed an acknowledgement she had read the most recent edition of the employee's handbook. Kaufman Pl. Dep. at 149:2-150:10. The 2015 edition of Defendant's employee handbook states "[e]mployees are prohibited from disclosing information that they know or should know is confidential and/or private . . . . Failure to abide by this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination." Def. St. ¶ 15 (emphasis in original).
In 2015, Greer commenced a lawsuit against Defendant, Serpico, and others. Id. ¶ 17. Greer had been a resident of the Battery Park City building until 2015, when he was [*6]  evicted from his apartment. Id. ¶ 19. On or about March 12 or 13, 2017, Plaintiff emailed Greer from her personal email. Id. ¶ 33. On March 12, 2017, Plaintiff called Greer. Id. ¶ 35. Plaintiff then emailed Greer documents from Defendant she had photographed or copied including, her complaint about Serpico to Ford, Serpico's calendar entries, and computer files related to Greer. Id. ¶¶ 36-40. Plaintiff spoke with Greer an additional four times between March 12, 2017 and April 5, 2017. Id. ¶ 41. During her correspondence with Greer, Plaintiff provided Greer a copy of a September 9, 2013 letter to Serpico from the Office of the Inspector General of the State of New York (the "September Letter"). Id. ¶¶ 54-55. After learning of the disclosure of the September Letter at a March 21, 2017 court appearance in the Greer litigation, Defendant's outside counsel informed Defendant's in-house counsel Plaintiff had provided the September Letter to Greer. Id. ¶ 55.
On March 21, 2017, after learning Plaintiff had provided Greer with the September Letter, Hyman and Abigail Goldberg, in-house counsel for Defendant, immediately met to discuss terminating Plaintiff. Id. ¶¶ 55-63. Hyman determined Plaintiff's [*7]  disclosure of the September Letter was in violation of the employee handbook's section "Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information" and was grounds for terminating Plaintiff. Id. ¶¶ 58-63. Hyman decided to terminate Plaintiff effective immediately. Id. ¶ 61. On March 22, 2017, Hyman instructed McIntyre she had decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment and instructed her to inform Plaintiff. Id. ¶¶ 67-69. On April 5, 2017, McIntyre emailed Plaintiff she was terminated effective immediately. Id. ¶ 86.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant on March 2, 2018. Compl., ECF No. 1. Defendant then moved to dismiss the Complaint on March 6, 2019. ECF No. 28. The Court granted Defendants' motion as to Plaintiff's first claim for relief and denied the motion as to all other claims. ECF No. 36.
Defendants now move for summary judgment on all remaining claims arguing they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, asserting there are no genuine disputes regarding any material facts in this case. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Defendants' motion in part and denies it in part.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where the "the pleadings, depositions, answers [*8]  to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). "An issue of fact is genuine if 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.' A fact is material if it 'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'" Roe v. City of Waterbury, 542 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must "construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant." Brod v. Omya, Inc., 653 F.3d 156, 164 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Williams v. R.H. Donnelley, Corp., 368 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2004)). The movant has the burden of showing the absence of a disputed issue of material fact, after which the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to present specific evidence showing a genuine dispute. See Brown v. Eli Lilly & Co., 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir. 2011).

DISCUSSION

I. Plaintiff's ADA and SHRL Claims for Wrongful Termination
Plaintiff's ADA and SHRL claims are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013) (ADA); Tebbenhoff v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 244 F. App'x 382, 383 (2d Cir. 2007) (SHRL). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, "[a] plaintiff must establish a prima facie case; the employer must offer through the introduction of admissible evidence [*9]  a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the discharge; and the plaintiff must then produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the proffered reason is a pretext." McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009). If a plaintiff fails to present a prima facie case or fails to carry the burden of persuasion at the third step, the defendant is entitled to summary judgement. See Abdu-Brisson v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 239 F.3d 456, 461 (2d Cir. 2001).
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, if Defendant demonstrates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment, and Plaintiff fails raise an issue of material fact that the reason is pretext, Defendant is entitled to summary judgement. Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 173 (2d Cir. 2006) (affirming summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact that the stated reason for his termination was pretextual).
Here, Defendant has presented undisputed evidence it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff photographed and copied the private correspondence of her supervisor over the course of nearly six years. Def. St. ¶¶ 4-5. She then disclosed those documents to Greer, a third-party litigating a case against Defendant. Id. ¶¶ 36-40. Plaintiff's actions were in clear contravention of Defendant's [*10]  handbook, both the 2009 and 2015 editions. Id. ¶ 15; Pl. St. ¶ 15. Plaintiff's argument the "confidentiality [of Serpico's correspondence] was never communicated," Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 3, ECF No. 56 ("Pl. Mem."), is unavailing. Though the Court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiff, the non-moving party, Brod, 653 F.3d at 164, no reasonable fact finder could conclude Plaintiff was unaware photographing and sharing the private correspondence of her supervisor with outside persons would be in violation of Defendant's employment policies.
Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the pretext of Defendant's stated reason for terminating her employment. The same day Defendant's President and Chief Operating Officer learned Plaintiff had disclosed Serpico's correspondence, she made the determination to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Def. St. ¶¶ 58-63. Indeed, Hyman made the determination to fire Plaintiff without knowing Plaintiff planned to apply for worker's compensation, id. ¶ 64, and Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show Hyman was aware of Plaintiff's disability or considered it in any way in her decision to terminate Plaintiff. [*11] 
Defendant has presented a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Accordingly, Plaintiff's failure to demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact as to the pretextuality of the reason is fatal to Plaintiff's case. The Court grants summary judgment to Defendant on Plaintiff's ADA and SHRL claims based on her termination.

II. Plaintiff's Claims for Failure to Accommodate
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: "(1) her employer is subject to the ADA; (2) she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) she suffered adverse employment action because of her disability." Snowden v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 612 F. App'x 7, 8-9 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (citing McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125); see also Kinneary v. City of New York, 601 F.3d 151, 158 (2d Cir. 2010) (noting "the same elements that must be proven to establish an ADA claim must be also demonstrated to prove claims under the []SHRL and []CHRL"). "An employer may also violate the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125.
Defendant argues Plaintiff has failed to establish the third element of a prima facie case. Def. Mem. at 11-13. The protections of [*12]  the ADA are available to "qualified individuals," which the ADA defines as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). To establish a prima facie claim for discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADA "the plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his employment." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 126 (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Where "no reasonable accommodation would have allowed [plaintiff] to perform his job, his ADA claim fails." Pender v. State of N.Y. Office of Mental Retardation & Developmental Disabilities, 02-CV-2438, 2006 WL 2013863, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. July 18, 2006) (Bianco, J.), aff'd sub nom. Pender v. Union of C.S.E.A., 225 F. App'x 17 (2d Cir. 2007); Dechberry v. New York City Fire Dep't, 124 F. Supp. 3d 131, 153 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (Matsumoto, J.) ("[T]he facts alleged demonstrate that plaintiff was not otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, as she alleges she was 'totally disabled' . . .").
The right to request a leave of absence or modified work schedule is recognized as a reasonable accommodation in some circumstances. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); id. § 12111(9) (defining "reasonable accommodation"); Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir. 1998). However, "an indefinite period [of leave] is not a reasonable accommodation." Manns v. United Airlines, 13-CV-3668, 2016 WL 6826761, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2016) (Amon, J.) (citing Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Vangas v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., 823 F.3d 174, 181 (2d Cir. 2016) ("The [*13]  district court correctly interpreted these actions as requesting an indefinite leave extension, which as a matter of law is not a reasonable accommodation" under SHRL). Nonetheless, requesting an initial leave of absence without being able to provide a fixed date of return is a reasonable accommodation recognized by the EEOC, see EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002).
Here, Dr. Bleicher examined Plaintiff on April 4, 2017, the day before Plaintiff received notice she had been terminated. Def. St. ¶ 81. Dr. Bleicher determined Plaintiff was temporarily "totally disabled" and recommended she be re-evaluated in five to six weeks. Id. When Dr. Bleicher reexamined Plaintiff he reached the same conclusion, she was "temporarily totally disabled." Id. ¶ 91. Between April 2017 and April 2019, Dr. Bleicher would reevaluate Plaintiff fifteen times and reach the same conclusion each time. Id. ¶¶ 89-91. As Plaintiff was temporarily totally disabled at the time of her termination, id. ¶ 84, and for at least the two years that followed, she could not have performed the essential functions of her position and cannot establish a prima facie [*14]  claim under the ADA. Moreover, Plaintiff never explicitly requested a reasonable accommodation from Defendant, Id. ¶ 85. Even if the Court concluded Plaintiff sought a fixed leave of absence, she "has still failed to provide any medical evidence that such an accommodation would allow [her] to perform the essential functions of [her] position." Manns, 2016 WL 6826761, at *9. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims under the ADA for failure to accomodate.

III. Plaintiff's Claims for Retaliation
To establish a claim for retaliation under either the ADA or the CHRL, a plaintiff must show: (1) she participated in a protected activity; (2) the defendant knew about that participation; (3) the defendant took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (4) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Caputo v. Copiague Union Free Sch. Dist., 218 F. Supp. 3d 186, 194 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (Hurley, J.) (applying this framework to ADA and SHRL claims); Fattoruso v. Hilton Grand Vacations Co., LLC, 525 F. App'x 26, 27 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order) (setting forth framework for CHRL retaliation claims). Seeking a reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected activity under the ADA. See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, 148-49 (2d Cir. 2002) (reversing dismissal of retaliation claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act).
"The causal [*15]  connection needed for proof of a retaliation claim can be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action." Cifra v. G.E. Co., 252 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); compare Reed v. A.W. Lawrence & Co., 95 F.3d 1170, 1178 (2d Cir. 1996) (determining causal connection was established when evidence showed the plaintiff's discharge was "a mere twelve days" after the initial complaint), with Stavis v. GFK Holding, Inc., 769 F. Supp. 2d 330, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (Sullivan, J.) (granting summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's CHRL retaliation claim because "the passage of six months between the protected activity and the adverse employment action prevents Plaintiff from" establishing the causal connection).
Plaintiff argues the close temporal proximity between the onset of her disability and her termination establish the casual connection of a prima facie case for retaliation. Pl. Mem. at 16. However, it is undisputed Hyman decided to terminate Plaintiff on March 21, 2017, immediately after learning Plaintiff had disclosed personal and internal communications to a third party. Def. St. ¶¶ 54-63. Plaintiff's objection, that a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to the reason for Plaintiff's firing, Pl. St. ¶ 61, is unsupported by the record. Plaintiff has [*16]  failed to adduce any evidence which would show Hyman was aware of Plaintiff's nascent request for a reasonable accommodation, workers' compensation application, or disability. See Def. St. ¶ 64. Unlike the cases cited by Plaintiff, see e.g., Wu v. Metro. Transportation Auth., 18-CV-6543, 2020 WL 615626, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2020) (Woods, J.), the issue here is not a lack of evidence which would invite indirect proof of causation, but Plaintiff's inability to refute the substantial evidence she was fired for photographing and disseminating her supervisor's private correspondence. As Plaintiff has not adduced evidence to show a genuine dispute of material fact as to the casual element between her protected activities and her termination, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to these claims.

IV. Plaintiff's Claims of Hostile Work Environment
To demonstrate a hostile work environment, Plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a workplace "with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult . . . that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment," Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); and (2) "a specific basis . . . for imputing the conduct that created the hostile [*17]  environment to the employer," Howley v. Town of Stratford, 217 F.3d 141, 154 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, the conduct must be "more than episodic." Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 321 (2d Cir. 2015). However, a plaintiff may demonstrate the creation of a "sufficiently severe or pervasive" work environment through an "extraordinarily severe" single incident, or through a "series of incidents . . . sufficiently continuous and concerted to have altered the conditions of her working environment." Howley, 217 F.3d at 153. Under the CHRL, a plaintiff must meet a lower bar, needing to allege only sufficient facts to show plausibly the plaintiff was "treated less well" because of a protected class. Nguedi v. Fed. Res. Bank of N.Y., 16-CV-636, 2017 WL 5991757, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2017) (Woods, J.) (quoting Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir. 2013)); see Fisher v. Mermaid Manor Home for Adults, LLC, 192 F. Supp. 3d 323, 330-31 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (Kuntz, J.) (denying defendant employer's summary judgment motion on hostile work environment claims, noting "having satisfied the requirements of Title VII, Plaintiff satisfies the minimum requirements for a discrimination claim under [CHRL]").
Defendant's arguments for summary judgment rest entirely on the statute of limitations of the CHRL and SHRL. Def. Mem. at 20-24. Both CHRL and SHRL claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations. N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214(2) (SHRL); N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8- 502(d) (CHRL). However, so long as some act contributing to the hostile work environment occurs within the statutory time [*18]  period, "consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 105 (2002). This is because under the continuing violation doctrine, "if a plaintiff has experienced a continuous practice and policy of discrimination, the commencement of the statute of limitations period may be delayed until the last discriminatory act in furtherance of it." Fitzgerald v. Henderson, 251 F.3d 345, 359 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal alterations omitted). Because of their nature, "hostile work environment claims typically merit application of the continuing violations doctrine because they cannot be said to occur on any particular day, but instead occur over a series of days or perhaps years." Mohamed v. NYU, 14-CV-8373, 2015 WL 3387218, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2015) (Dolinger, Mag. J.), report and recommendation adopted, 14-CV-8373, 2015 WL 5307391 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2015) (Daniels, J.).
Here, Plaintiff has presented evidence Serpico engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment, including regularly offering her his "banana," Lancia Pl. Dep. at 27:16-23, asking Plaintiff to take him home with her, id. at 227:11-228:8, and suggesting she sit in his lap, id. 26:3-15. Though the evidence suggests the pattern of harassment ceased, after Plaintiff complained at the end of 2012, [*19]  id. at 21:23-22:10, Plaintiff has adduced evidence Serpico continued to harass her in a "careful" way such as when he handed her a banana without making an explicit comment, in reference to his earlier banana-related harassment, Kaufman Pl. Dep. at 229:11-16. In conjunction with Serpico's inappropriate question about Plaintiff's possible sexual partners, Def. St. ¶ 20, and considering his status as her direct supervisor, id. ¶ 11, a reasonable fact finder could conclude his pattern of sexual harassment created a hostile work environment that lasted until 2016. Therefore, the Court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 51, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiff's remaining claims are those for hostile work environment under SHRL and CHRL. This case will proceed to trial as to Plaintiff's remaining claims.

SO ORDERED.
