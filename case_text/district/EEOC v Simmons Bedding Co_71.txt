ORDER and OPINION
This case is presently before the Court on defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment on Punitive Damages and Motion to Dismiss the FEOC's Jury Demand [116]. The Court has reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties and, for the reasons set out below, concludes that defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment on Punitive Damages and Motion to Dismiss the EEOC's Jury Demand [116] should be GRANTED.

BACKGROUND
The Court provided a detailed description of the facts underlying this dispute in its previous summary judgment order. (Order [111].) Briefly, plaintiff intervener [*2]  Yvonne Young was working for defendant as a Senior Systems Analyst when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. (Id. at 2.) Young requested and received a six-month medical leave of absence and short-term disability benefits to facilitate her treatment. (Id.) Pursuant to its short-term disability policy, defendant terminated Young's employment when she did not return to work after 180 days of medical leave.1 (Id. at 3.)
Following her termination, Young filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). (Id. at 3.) After investigating Young's charge, the EEOC initiated this lawsuit against defendant pursuant to Title I of the ADA. (Order [111] at 3.) Young intervened in the suit, asserting a claim for disability discrimination under the ADA, as well as a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Id. at 3-4.)
Young and defendant eventually reached a settlement, and filed a joint motion to dismiss the case. (Joint Mot. to Dismiss [102].) The EEOC did not object to the motion, which the Court granted as unopposed. (Order [103].) However, the EEOC subsequently moved to reopen the case as to those claims seeking relief "separate and apart [*3]  from" Young's individual claims. (EEOC's Mot. to Reopen [104].) The Court granted the EEOC's motion, and at the same time permitted defendant to reactivate a motion for summary judgment that was pending at the time of the settlement. (Order [106].)
Defendant's motion for summary judgment focused solely on whether Young was "disabled" as defined by the ADA. (Order [111] at 7.) In support of its motion, defendant argued that Young was not covered by the ADA because she did not have a "disability" when she was terminated. (Id.) The Court rejected defendant's argument, citing evidence that Young's breast cancer, and the treatment it required, substantially limited several of her "major life activities." (Id.) Based on this evidence, the Court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment on the EEOC's ADA claim. (Id.)
With respect to the EEOC's potential remedies in the case, the Court found that any claim by the EEOC for compensatory damages was foreclosed by the settlement agreement between defendant and Young. (Id.) However, the Court noted that the EEOC had not taken a position as to how the settlement affected its claim for punitive damages, or whether it still intended to seek punitive [*4]  damages. (Order [111] at 14.) The Court thus denied without prejudice defendant's motion for summary judgment on the EEOC's punitive damages claim. (Id.) The Court indicated that it would permit defendant to renew its motion for summary judgment on this issue if the EEOC expressed an intent to pursue punitive damages. (Id.)
In the Proposed Pretrial Order, the EEOC clarified its intent to seek punitive damages on its ADA claim. (Proposed Pretrial Order [115] at Attachment C.) Defendant subsequently filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the punitive damages issue, which is presently before the Court. (Def.'s Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. [116].) Defendant's related motion to dismiss the EEOC's demand for a jury trial under 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(c) is also before the Court. (Id. at 2.)

DISCUSSION

I. Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A fact's materiality is determined by the controlling substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue is [*5]  genuine when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. Id. at 249-50.
Summary judgment is not properly viewed as a device that the trial court may, in its discretion, implement in lieu of a trial on the merits. Instead, Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In such a situation, there can be "'no genuine issue as to any material fact,'" as a "complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Id. at 322-23 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).
The movant bears the initial responsibility of asserting the basis for his motion. Id. at 323. However, the movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. The movant may discharge his burden by merely "'showing'--that is, pointing out to the district court--that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case." Id. at 325. After the movant has carried his burden, the non-moving party is then required to "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence designating [*6]  "'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324. While the court is to view all evidence and factual inferences in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, Samples v. City of Atlanta, 846 F.2d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir. 1988), "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (1986).

B. The Settlement Agreement
As an initial matter, the Court agrees with defendant that the EEOC's claim for punitive damages is barred by the settlement agreement between defendant and Young. In its complaint, the EEOC seeks an order recuiring defendant to "pay Young punitive damages" for its "malicious or reckless conduct." (Compl. [1] at 6,) As part of the settlement agreement, Young released any claim against defendant for punitive damages. (Mem. in Supp. of Stipulation of Dismissal ("Stipulation") [102] at 2.) Pursuant to the agreement, there is no basis for the punitive damages order that the EEOC seeks in its complaint.
The EEOC argues that it should not be bound by the terms of the settlement because it was not a party to the agreement. (EEOC's Br. in Resp. to Def.'s Renewed Mot. [*7]  for Summ. J. ("EEOC's Br.") [117] at 9-10.) However, the joint stipulation of dismissal submitted by the parties specifically limited the EEOC's relief to "equitable relief, unrelated to Plaintiff Young or her claims," (Stipulation [102] at 3.) The EEOC did not object to the stipulation. Moreover, it is well-established that an employee's monetary settlement in an employment discrimination case may limit the EEOC's recovery of damages. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 122 S. Ct. 754, 151 L. Ed. 2d 755 (2002)(""courts can and should preclude double recovery'" in an employment discrimination case)(quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw., Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 333, 100 S. Ct. 1698, 64 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1980)). Accordingly, defendant's motion for summary judgment on the punitive damages claim should be GRANTED.

C. The Evidentiary Record
Even assuming that the claim is not barred, there is no factual basis for a punitive damages award in this case. Punitive damages are only authorized in an ADA case where an employer discriminates "with malice or reckless indifference" to an employee's federally protected rights. EEOC v. W&O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600, 611 (11th Cir. 2000), In this context, the terms "malice" and "reckless indifference" pertain to the employer's knowledge that it is acting in violation of federal law, Id. See also Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., 513 F.3d 1261, 1280 (11th Cir. 2008)("'Malice or reckless indifference is established by a showing that the employer discriminated [*8]  in the face of the knowledge that its actions would violate federal law.'") (quoting Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir. 2002)), Thus, punitive damages are not available where the employer reasonably believes that there is a bona fide defense to liability, or where the underlying theory of discrimination is "novel" or "poorly recognized." Koistad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 536, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999).
Based on the evidence in the record, there is considerable debate as to whether Young was a "qualified individual" when she was terminated. (Order [111] at 11-12.) In order to satisfy this prong of its ADA claim, the EEOC must show that Young was "able to perform the essential functions of h[er] job with or without a reasonable accommodation." Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1312 (11th Cir. 2003) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). Young testified that in late September, 2005, after six months of medical leave, she was unable to work in any capacity because of the debilitating side effects of her cancer treatments. (Order [111] at 8, 11.) Given her testimony, it is difficult to see how Young could have performed any of the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination. (Id.)
Apparently, the EEOC assumes that defendant was required by the ADA to offer Young an additional six weeks of medical leave as a "reasonable accommodation" of her disability. (See [*9]  Pl.'s Br. [86] at 21.) This is unquestionably a novel theory concerning what is a reasonable accommodation.2 Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314 ("an accommodation is unreasonable if it does not allow someone to perform his or her job duties in the present or in the immediate future"). See also Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997)("Nothing in the text of the reasonable accommodation provision requires an employer to wait for an indefinite period for an accommodation to achieve its intended effect.").
In essence, the EEOC's position would expand the provisions of the ADA for the purpose of constructively amending the time limitations for medical leave established by the FMLA: the statute that specifically addresses medical leave. The Court is unaware of any legal support for such a proposition. One cannot infer that defendant knowingly or recklessly discriminated against Young merely because it failed to act consistently with a legal theory that is, itself, novel and weak. In short, the EEOC's legal theory will not sustain an award of punitive damages. Koistad, 527 U.S. at 536.
Finally, even were the EEOC's legal theory less shaky, there is undisputed evidence in the record that defendant made a good faith effort to comply with the ADA. At the time of Young's termination, defendant [*10]  had a policy that strictly prohibited disability discrimination. (Koll Decl. [78] at ¶¶ 7-10.3 In order to enforce the policy, defendant staffed and trained a human resources department. (Id.) Application of the policy resulted in Young's receipt of six months of paid medical leave, in addition to several months of long-term disability benefits. (Order [111] at 2-3.) That the policy did not provide additional protection to Young in this particular case does not warrant punitive damages. W&O, 213 F.3d at 611 (mere negligence as to an employee's civil rights is insufficient to support an award of punitive damages).
In short, all of the evidence in the record suggests that defendant acted in good faith and with a reasonable belief that it could legally terminate Young when she was unable to work in any capacity after six months of medical leave. Under the circumstances, there is no factual basis for awarding punitive damages. For this additional reason, defendant's motion for summary judgment on the EEOC's punitive damages claim should be GRANTED.

II. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the EEOC's Jury Demand
The EEOC concedes that its jury demand is dependent upon its claim for punitive damages. (EEOC's Br. [117] [*11]  at 19.) The relevant statute expressly limits jury trials to cases where "a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages." 42 § 1981a(c). As there are no remaining issues of compensatory or punitive damages in this case, the EEOC is not entitled to a jury trial. Id. See also Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 281, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994) ("the jury trial option must stand or fall with the attached damages provisions") and Reid v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., 205 F.R.D. 655, 686 (N.D. Ga. 2001) (Forrester, J.) (noting that plaintiffs have a right to demand a jury trial when damages are sought in a Title VII case).
Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the EEOC's demand for a jury trial should be GRANTED. The EEOC's remaining equitable claim for injunctive relief will be decided by the Court.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment as to Punitive Damages and Motion to Dismiss the EEOC's Demand for a Jury Trial [116]. The Court directs the Clerk to DISMISS the EEOC's demand for a jury trial.
SO ORDERED, this 25 day of January, 2011.
