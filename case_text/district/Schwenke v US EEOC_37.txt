MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS WITHOUT PREJUDICE
Before this Court is a Motion to Dismiss by Defendant the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) / U.S. Department of Justice (Doc. #6). The EEOC and DOJ are hereafter collectively referred to as the "United States." Plaintiff Erick Ralph Schwenke (hereafter "Schwenke") responded (Doc. #8). The United States replied (Doc. #9). Schwenke responded again (Doc. #10). This matter came regularly on for hearing on January 6, 2011. This Memorandum Opinion and Order follows.

SUMMARY OF DECISION
The United States has not waived its sovereign immunity with regard to the claims alleged in this action. Dismissal of all claims is proper for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Dismissal is also appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because Schwenke has presented no claim upon which relief can be granted against the United States.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Erick Ralph Schwenke is a North Dakota resident [*2]  (Doc. #3, "Complaint," p. 2). Schwenke applied for a position with the Desert Regional Medical Center (hereafter "DRMC"), a private hospital located in Palm Springs, California (Doc. #3-2, p. 1). DRMC is part of the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, located in Dallas, Texas (Doc. #3-2, p. 33). DRMC is not named a defendant in this action (Doc. #3, p. 1). Schwenke has commenced an action against the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (hereafter "EEOC") and the United States Department of Justice (hereafter "DOJ"). Nonetheless, the only claims raised in the body of the Complaint relate to DRMC and the EEOC (Doc. #3).
On his employment application with DRMC, Schwenke originally answered that he was able to perform the functions of the job for which he applied (Doc. #3-2, p. 2). In the application, Schwenke failed to respond to a question whether an accommodation would allow him to perform the functions of the job (Doc. #3-2, p. 2). In October of 2007, DRMC offered and Schwenke accepted a position as a registered nurse with a tentative start date of November 18, 2007 (Doc. #3-2, "Offer Letter," p. 14; p. 1). The offer and a relocation bonus were contingent upon Plaintiff [*3]  passing all pre-employment assessments. Id. Schwenke moved to California using a relocation bonus of $4,900 from DRMC (Doc. #3-2, pp. 1, 33).
In response to a question on a Pre-Placement Health Questionnaire, Schwenke advised DRMC that he needed a job accommodation because he needed to "avoid standing in one area for greater than 10 minutes without floor mat or stool or other assistive device" (Doc #3-2, pp. 16-17). The reason given for the accommodation was described by Schwenke as "leg varicosities." Id., at p. 17. According to Schwenke, DRMC Assistant Employee Health Manager Jeanne Griffin told him he passed the health assessment (Doc #3-2, pp. 1, 9). Even so, Schwenke was asked by DRMC to attend a meeting regarding employment. Id.
On December 3, 2007, Schwenke attended the employment meeting at DRMC where his accommodation request was discussed (Doc. #3-2, p. 3). Schwenke claims DRMC told him he should probably look for work in an office or clinic setting but failed to discuss alternative employment options, and that they would not have hired him if he had made the request on his application. Id. DRMC denies the statements, stating that the meeting was an interactive discussion that included [*4]  a discussion of various employment options (Doc. #3-2, "DRMC Response to EEOC," pp. 35-39). Schwenke offered to rescind his request for accommodation, but DRMC told him he must clear his request with an "ADA physician" (Doc. #3-2, p. 3). In an e-mail DRMC informed Schwenke he could "get something in writing from your original treating physician who would either need to concur or refute your need for accommodation." (Doc #3-2, p. 21). DRMC then told Schwenke in a telephone call that he could clear his accommodation request with any physician (Doc. #3-2, pp. 3, 21). Schwenke admits DRMC also informed him that he could come in and "sign-off" on his request for an accommodation (Doc. #3-2, p. 4).
Schwenke failed to ever provide DRMC with documentation from a physician or to "sign-off" on his accommodation request (Doc. #3-2,"Email from Schwenke to DRMC," p. 24; "DRMC Response to EEOC," p. 35). Schwenke admits that DRMC left two voice messages stating "'that I needed to call them at my earliest convenience'" (Doc. #3-2, p. 4). Schwenke responded with an e-mail message to DRMC that he was still working on obtaining his California R.N. license. Id. In the end, Schwenke failed to provide a [*5]  physician status report or to formally withdraw his request for accommodation. On December 18, 2007, DRMC rescinded its employment offer (Doc. #3-2, "Rescission Letter," p. 26).
In December of 2007, Schwenke filed a complaint with the EEOC against DRMC asserting retaliatory denial of employment because he made an ADA accommodation request. (Doc. #3-2, "Charge of Discrimination," pp. 27-32). DRMC denied the allegations, contending it: (1) engaged in an interactive process with Plaintiff; (2) offered him an opportunity to provide documentation from a physician for his accommodation request; and (3) only rescinded its employment offer when Schwenke failed to complete the pre-employment assessments (Doc. #3-2, "DRMC Response to EEOC," p. 38). DRMC denied any duty to Schwenke as he repeatedly admitted he had no disability. Id., at p. 35. DRMC also argued that the requested accommodation was not reasonable for the position. Id., at p. 36. Finally, DRMC argued that Schwenke left them no choice but to rescind the offer when he absolutely failed to complete the pre-employment process. Id., at p. 38.
The EEOC investigated Schwenke's complaint, eventually deciding that on its investigation it was unable to conclude that DRMC had violated [*6]  the ADA or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Doc. #3-1, p. 2). The EEOC closed its file and sent Schwenke a Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter (hereafter "right to sue letter"). Id.

DISCUSSION
In a pro se complaint filed December 1, 2009 (Doc. #3), Schwenke claims that the EEOC created a process that required him to answer certain questions without ever informing him of the consequences of his answer (Doc. #3-2, p. 8). The unusual aspect of his Complaint is that Schwenke asserts his action against the "U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) / U.S. Department of Justice," as opposed to the actual actor, DRMC. Schwenke believes that the EEOC is the responsible party because it somehow coerced DRMC's action. Id. It appears this claim is a result of confusion—a confusion that persists despite repeat efforts to explain the nature of claims brought under the ADA. Rather than pursue a legally recognized claim against DRMC, Schwenke has sued the EEOC, seeking an order that the EEOC:
(1) Enact a mandatory process by which employers are required to provide information in the forms of verbal and written documentation to the applicant, prospective employee as to the full [*7]  meaning and implications involved with the Americans with Disabilities Act mandated question related to 'reasonable accommodation' before he/she is permitted to answer the question.
(2) Enact a mandatory process by which the EEOC is required to inform the individual(s) of the "interactive process" as outlined according to the current laws related to charges of dissemination, whenever a charge claim is filed with the EEOC.
(3) Award mitigating and other applicable financial damages for the period of December 2007 to January 2009 (original intended employment period pertaining to this case, est. $70,000.00-$90,000.00).
Doc. #3, "Complaint," p. 4.
The United States seeks dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) asserting that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity for claims against the EEOC under: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e - 2000e-17 (2006) (hereafter "Title VII"); the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 - 12213 (2008) (hereafter "ADA"); or the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2671 - 2680 (2006) (hereafter "FTCA"). The United States additionally contends that Schwenke's claim against the United States is barred under the FTCA because he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
Schwenke argues [*8]  in response that: (1) he exhausted his administrative remedies by filing an EEOC complaint and receiving a right to sue letter; and (2) sovereign immunity does not apply in this case. Schwenke also asserts that the ADA "reasonable accommodation" question and the "interactive process" violate his due process rights by depriving him of a purported "right to work" civil liberty interest.

I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides that a party may assert by motion the defense of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Kessler v. Nat'l Enters., Inc., 347 F.3d 1076, 1081 (8th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by the parties, conferred by consent, or ignored by the court. Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. Parsons Corp., 430 F.2d 531, 540 (8th Cir. 1970). Any party or the court may raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. GMAC Commercial Credit LLC v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 357 F.3d 827, 828 (8th Cir. 2004). A claim of sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional question, and thus properly raised in a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. Hagen v. Sisseton-Wahpeton Community College, 205 F.3d 1040, 1043 (8th Cir. 2000).
"Congress has directed the EEOC to exercise the same enforcement powers, remedies, and procedures that are set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it is enforcing the ADA's prohibitions against employment discrimination on the basis of disability." E.E.O.C. v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 285, 122 S. Ct. 754, 151 L. Ed. 2d 755 (2002); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a) (2008). 42 U.S.C. sections 2000e-5, 2000e-6 [*9] , and 2000e-16 (2006) provide remedies for employment discrimination and retaliation claims against employers and allow individuals to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. The EEOC is empowered to investigate the claim and facilitate resolution if possible. If it is unable to resolve the matter, the EEOC will issue a right to sue letter. After receiving an EEOC right to sue letter, individuals are authorized to pursue a matter further by filing suit in the proper United States district court against the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) (2006).
In the case at bar, Schwenke lodged a charge against his employer, DRMC, for a claim of retaliation and ultimately received a right to sue letter (Doc. #3-1, p. 2). However, instead of filing this action against the employer, DRMC, Schwenke brought a suit against the EEOC and DOJ seeking the relief described above (Doc. #3, "Complaint," p. 4).

A. Statutory waiver of sovereign immunity
"It is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction." United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1983). Waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied, it must be unequivocally expressed. Amerind Risk Mgmt. Corp. v. Malaterre, 633 F.3d 680, 2011 WL 500216, *3 (8th Cir. 2011). A party bringing a cause of action against a sovereign bears [*10]  the burden of demonstrating an unequivocal waiver of immunity. 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 2920, [WL] at *4.
The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") is a federal agency of the United States created pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-4 (2006). As an agency of the federal government, the EEOC cannot be sued unless Congress has waived sovereign immunity for the type of claim made. Great Rivers Habitat Alliance v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 615 F.3d 985, 988 (8th Cir. 2010).
Title VII does not include a waiver of immunity permitting claims against the EEOC. Ward v. E.E.O.C., 719 F.2d 311, 312 (9th Cir. 1983) ("Congress neither expressly nor impliedly provided for an action against the EEOC for negligence, and the EEOC's nonfeasance is not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act."); McCottrell v. E.E.O.C., 726 F.2d 350, 351 (7th Cir. 1984) ("It is settled law, in this and other circuits, that Title VII does not provide either an express or implied cause of action against the EEOC to challenge its investigation and processing of a charge."). Nothing in the act makes the United States liable for the improper acts of private employers.
Schwenke mistakenly believes he can sue the EEOC relying upon a document entitled, "Information Related to Filing Suit Under the Laws Enforced by the EEOC" (Doc. #3-1, p. 1). This document explains an individual's right to "file a lawsuit against the respondent(s) named in the charge" [*11]  pursuant to Title VII, the ADA, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Equal Pay Act. Id. Schwenke's confusion in this matter apparently arises out of his failure to comprehend that the respondent in his EEOC complaint is DRMC. Schwenke's argument that this document created a cause of action against the EEOC is misguided because whatever the document is, it clearly is not an act of Congress waiving immunity.
There is no statutory provision for bringing this sort of suit against the EEOC. Schwenke has identified no statutory provision authorizing his novel position, nor can the Court find one. It is plain that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity and this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Schwenke's claims.

B. The Federal Tort Claims Act
The FTCA waives the federal government's sovereign immunity for some tort law claims of negligence. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2674 and 2671 (2006); Riley v. United States, 486 F.3d 1030, 1032 (8th Cir. 2007). The United States has never waived all tort immunity, rather "[t]he federal courts have jurisdiction over claims under the FTCA only to the extent that the United States has waived its sovereign immunity." T.L. ex rel. Ingram v. United States, 443 F.3d 956, 959, (8th Cir. 2006). Even if there is a waiver of immunity for tort law claims, administrative remedies [*12]  must be exhausted before a FTCA action can be brought. 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) (2006). Failing exhaustion, the claim should be dismissed. McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S. Ct. 1980, 124 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1993); Bohac v. Walsh, 386 F.3d 859, 8-61 (8th Cir. 2004).
While Schwenke asserts he has exhausted his administrative remedies by filing an EEOC charge (Doc. #8, p. 15), and contacting his Congressional delegation (Docs. #8-1, 8-2), the FTCA requires at a minimum written notice to the federal agency before filing a lawsuit. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2401(b) and 2675(a) (2006); Bohac, 386 F.3d at 861. Schwenke did not provide written notice of his claims to the EEOC or DOJ prior to filing his complaint, nor has a claim ever been denied by either the EEOC or DOJ. Schwenke has wholly failed to comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) (2006). Under these circumstances he has failed to initiate an administrative claim, let alone exhausted it. The Court has no jurisdiction to hear Schwenke's unexhausted claim. 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) (2006); McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S. Ct. 1980, 124 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1993).
Schwenke also claims that he has been deprived of a "right to work" civil liberty interest. While some courts have recognized that the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness includes a "right to work and earn an honest living," there is no constitutional right to specific employment by a specific employer. Van Zandt v. McKee, 202 F.2d 490 (5th Cir. 1953). Even if such a right existed, the Congress has never authorized [*13]  constitutional tort claims under the FTCA. F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. at 478 ("[T]he United States simply has not rendered itself liable under § 1346(b) for constitutional tort claims."). Schwenke's claim of a violation of a purported constitutional right to work is not authorized.

II. Failure to State a Claim for Relief
Even though Schwenke has named the DOJ as a defendant, he has alleged no facts in support of his "claim." Nor does he identify a cause of action against the DOJ. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) the claim is dismissed for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

III. Other Claims
The Court has considered the other claims presented by Schwenke. They are either completely devoid of merit or incomprehensible. One thing is plain though: Plaintiff either has failed to state any non-frivolous claim or he has completely failed to pursue his administrative claim—let alone exhaust it. The Court is wholly without jurisdiction to consider them.

DECISION
The Court finds that dismissal of the Complaint without prejudice is appropriate under both Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED without prejudice and with costs [*14]  to be taxed as allowed by law.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY.
Dated this 22nd day of March, 2011.
