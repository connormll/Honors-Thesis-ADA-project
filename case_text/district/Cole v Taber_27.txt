Opinion



ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Marilyn Faye Cole sues Defendants Shelby County Government ("Shelby County"), and, in their individual and official capacities, Shelby County Division of Corrections Director George Little, Deputy Director Andrew Taber, Chief of Security Anthony Alexander, and Lieutenant Edgar Hampton. Plaintiff alleges violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et. seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., 42 U.S.C § 1981, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
Plaintiff's claims under § 1981, all individual capacity claims under Title VII and the ADA, and all claims against Defendant George  [*2] Little were dismissed by this Court's order on motion to dismiss dated October 4, 2007. On July 9, 2008, the Court granted Defendant Shelby County's motion for summary judgment.
Before the Court is the August 7, 2008, motion for summary judgment on behalf of Defendants Andrew Taber, George Little, Anthony Alexander, and Edgar Hampton. Plaintiff responded on September 18, 2008. For the following reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

I. Background
Defendant Shelby County submitted an Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("UMF") with its January 25, 2008 motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff responded to the UMF and agreed with most of the facts stated. In its July 9, 2008, Summary Judgment Order, relying only on the facts Plaintiff had admitted, the Court described the background in this case as follows:
Plaintiff Marilyn Faye Cole was formerly employed by the Shelby County Division of Corrections ("DOC"). (Undisputed Material Facts "UMF" ¶ 1.) She started at the DOC in 1985 as a clerk, but was later transferred to security where she worked as a correctional officer beginning in 1987. (Id. ¶ 1-2.) Cole retired from the DOC on December 14, 2007, while still a correctional  [*3] officer. (Id. ¶ 3.) Cole is flat-footed, has ruptured tendons in both feet, and has developed degenerative joint disease as result of extensive standing and walking. (Id. ¶ 5.) However, she has never asked her physician to certify that her foot problems are work-related and does not dispute Defendant's contention that they are not the result of an on-the-job injury. (Id. ¶¶ 7, 91.)
In 1998, Cole applied for disability retirement on the basis of her foot pain. (Id. ¶ 8.) After her request was denied, she applied for a permanent work accommodation based on her inability to walk or stand for extended periods of time. (Id. ¶ 9.) Cole was temporarily assigned to visitation duty (a light duty post and, in her opinion, a reasonable accommodation), but was later forced to return to her original post. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10.)
On February 10, 1999, then DOC Director Mark Luttrell, Jr. issued an official memorandum on the subject of light duty. (Id. ¶ 12.) In pertinent part, it reads:
The work performed by Correction Officers and Care & Custody Counselors is recognized to be demanding, challenging, and at times, hazardous... .
The Division of Corrections has always temporarily excused Correctional Officers  [*4] and Counselors from performing all of the essential duties of their position in case where recovery from injury or illness was needed. These "light duty" or "limited duty" assignments required the employee and their physician to certify that the injury or illness would allow a return to full duty within a reasonable time. Some employees have misunderstood this policy and have recently provided the Division with requests that they be provided permanent "light duty" assignments. All of these recent requests have been due to off-duty accidents or illness and have seriously affected the Division's ability to staff posts fairly, and with fully fit Corrections workers... .
Effective February 15, 1999, the Division will only assign Correction Officers and Counselors to "light duty" posts in extraordinary cases involving minimal restriction of duties, and for a specific time period. In most cases, the light duty period will not exceed twenty (20) workdays... .
It is important to know that these policies do not apply to On-the-Job-Injury (OJI) cases. On-the-Job-Injury cases will continue to be handled according to existing County policy... .
(Def.'s Exh. 2 at 2-3.)
In 2002, Cole was assigned to  [*5] a post in the east wing of the women's building, which required extensive standing and walking. (UMF ¶ 19.) After experiencing foot pain and swelling, Cole met with DOC Director Andrew Taber to discuss an assignment to a control center post, a light duty position. (Id. ¶ 20.) Cole was thereafter assigned to a variety of light duty control center posts for the remainder of 2002 and throughout 2003. (Id. ¶¶ 21-22.)
Beginning in 2004, however, Cole was no longer assigned to control posts. (Id. ¶ 23.) This change prompted her to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). (Id.) Dated April 28, 2004, the EEOC charge reads:
I have been denied a reasonable accommodation on a permanent basis. I am classified as a Correctional Officer and have been employed since February 1985.
I believe I have been discriminated against because of my disability (Rupture Tendon & Degenerative Joint Disease) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)[.] Additionally, I believe I have been discriminated against because of my sex (female) and in retaliation for filing previous charges of discrimination and a federal lawsuit against the employer in violation of Title VII  [*6] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, because the employer has denied me a reasonable accommodation; however, it has assigned a male employee (Warren Tillman) to a job assignment which does not involve extensive walking and prolong [sic] standing.
(Def.'s Exh. 2 at 7.)
On December 5, 2004, Cole wrote Shelby County Mayor A C Wharton to complain of "harassment" by an internal affairs officer who questioned her about inappropriate emails which had been sent around the DOC. (UMF ¶ 27, Def.'s Exh. 2 at 2-3.) The following January, she was "reassigned." (UMF ¶ 29.) Then, on January 25, 2005, Cole filed another charge with the EEOC. It reads:
I have been and continue to be treated differently in the terms and condition of my employment while working for the [DOC] as a Correctional Officer. Specifically, I have been denied a reasonable accommodation with respect to my disability. I am required to do extensive walking and standing which is contrary to the orders given by the employer's physician and my own personal physician. I am aware of three male Officers who have been granted accommodations for their disabilities. I also believe that I am treated differently because I wrote a letter  [*7] complaining on a manager. My life has been threatened by inmates of the facility which I was assigned to work.
I believe that I have been and continue to be discriminated against because of my sex (female), disability and in retaliation for filing previous charges of discrimination against the employer in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,; and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
(Def.'s Exh. 2 at 10.)
Plaintiff was deposed on October 4, 2007. (UMF ¶ 47.) Afterward, DOC management tried unsuccessfully to telephone Cole to discuss arranging a reasonable accommodation for her disability. (Id.) DOC Human Resources Manager Vicky Lyons then wrote a letter asking Cole to meet to discuss what she would consider a reasonable accommodation. (Id.) Cole received the letter on December 14, 2007, and immediately submitted a notice of retirement. (Id. at 48.)
(Summ. J. Order Jul. 9, 2008, at 2-7 (footnotes omitted).)

II. Jurisdiction
The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(3).

III. Standard of Review
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary judgment is proper "if the pleadings, discovery and  [*8] disclosure material on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The party moving for summary judgment "bears the burden of clearly and convincingly establishing the nonexistence of any genuine issue of material fact, and the evidence as well as all inferences drawn therefrom must be read in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Kochins v. Linden-Alimak, Inc., 799 F.2d 1128, 1133 (6th Cir. 1986). The moving party can meet its burden by pointing out that the respondent, having had sufficient opportunity for discovery, has no evidence to support an essential element of her case. See Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479 (6th Cir. 1989).
When confronted with a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts establishing that there is a genuine issue for trial by showing that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The "mere existence  [*9] of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment." Id. The party opposing the motion must "do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party may not oppose a properly supported summary judgment motion by mere reliance on the pleadings. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Instead, the nonmoving party must present "concrete evidence supporting its claims." Cloverdale Equip. Co. v. Simon Aerials, Inc., 869 F.2d 934, 937 (6th Cir. 1989). The district court does not have the duty to search the record for that evidence. See InterRoyal Corp. v. Sponseller, 889 F.2d 108, 110-11 (6th Cir. 1989). The nonmovant has the duty to point out specific evidence in the record that would be sufficient to justify a jury decision in her favor. See Id.

IV. Analysis

A. Official Capacity Claims
The Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss the official capacity claims against Andrew Taber, Anthony Alexander, and Edgar Hampton. Official capacity suits "generally represent  [*10] only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent." Monell v. New York City Dept. of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978). "As long as the government entity receives notice and an opportunity to respond, an official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity." Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-166, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985). The individual defendants are all Shelby County employees. Because Cole's suit named Shelby County as a defendant, suing its employees in their official capacities is redundant. Cole's official capacity claims against Andrew Taber, Anthony Alexander, and Edgar Hampton are, therefore, dismissed.

B. First Amendment Claims
A "public employee retains his First Amendment right to comment on matters of public concern without fear of reprisal from the government as his employer." Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll., 260 F. 3d 671, 678 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 574, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968)). Defendants Taber, Alexander, and Hampton argue they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's First Amendment claim because the Court found in its July 9, 2008, order that  [*11] Plaintiff's memorandum to Mayor Wharton "does not satisfy the threshold requirement—speech on a matter of public concern—of a First Amendment retaliation claim." (Summ. J. Order Jul. 9, 2008 at 31.) Plaintiff "urges the Court to re-examine this issue." (Pl. Resp. Mem. at 4.) Plaintiff has offered no reason for the Court to reconsider its finding that her memorandum to Mayor Wharton was not speech on a matter of public concern. (Id.) For the reasons set forth in the Court's July 9, 2008, Order, the Court finds that Cole's memorandum did not touch a matter of public concern. Therefore, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for violation of her First Amendment rights.

C. Fourteenth Amendment
"The showing a plaintiff must make to recover on an employment discrimination claim under Title VII mirrors that which must be made to recover on an equal protection claim under section 1983." Morris v. Oldham County Fiscal Court, 201 F.3d 784, 794 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing Risinger v. Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, 883 F.2d 475, 483-84 (6th Cir. 1989)); see also Wilson v. Ohio, 178 Fed.Appx. 457, 467 (6th Cir. 2006). To make a prima facie case of Title VII discrimination  [*12] based on indirect evidence Plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) membership in a protected class, (2) an adverse employment action, (3) qualification for accommodation, and (4) differing treatment for similarly situated person(s) outside the protected class. Hoskins v. Oakland County Sheriff's Dep't, 227 F.3d 719, 731 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)).
In its July 9, 2008, Order, the Court found that Plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination, because she had not identified a similarly situated employee who was treated more favorably. (Summ. J. Order Jul. 9, 2008 at 24.) Defendants Taber, Alexander, and Hampton argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's claim for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the Court found that Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of discrimination. (Def. Mem. at 4.) Plaintiff responds that "the Court should revisit the question of whether she was similarly situated to Willie Hughes." (Pl. Resp. Mem. at 3.)
In its July 9, 2008, Order, the Court found that Hughes was not similarly-situated because he suffered from an on-the-job injury and Plaintiff  [*13] did not. (Summ. J. Order Jul. 9. 2008 at 16.) As a result, Plaintiff and Hughes were subject to different DOC policies. (Id.) Plaintiff argues that "the distinction between an on-the-job injury or off-duty injury had [sic] not been a decisive factor as to whether an employee received a permanent light duty assignment." (Pl. Resp. Mem. at 3.) She further contends that "[t]he inconsistent application of the so-called 'on-the-job' policy is evidence of the arbitrary and discriminatory practices that took place at the Division of Corrections in general and specifically as such practices applied to Plaintiff." (Id. at 3-4.)
Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence that supports her claim that the "on-the-job policy" is inconsistently applied. The only evidence Plaintiff has provided is consistent with city policy. (Pl. Resp. Mem. at 3.) Hughes was injured on-the-job and was given a permanent light duty assignment; Cole was not injured on-the-job and was not given a permanent light duty assignment. (Summ. J. Jul. 9, 2008 at 15.) For the reasons set forth in the Court's July 9, 2008, Order, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, because Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie  [*14] case of discrimination. (Summ. J. Order Jul. 9, 2008, at 13-26.)

D. Time Barred Claims
Defendants also argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff's claims against them are time-barred. (Def. Mem. at 3.) The Court need not address that argument because it has found that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the merits.

V. Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the motion of Defendants Andrew Taber, Anthony Alexander, and Edgar Hampton for summary judgment is GRANTED.
So ordered this 30th day of January, 2009.
