ORDER RE: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Having reviewed and considered all the briefing filed with respect to defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation's ("defendant" or "Costco") Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 23, "Motion"), the court finds that oral argument is not necessary to resolve the Motion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Willis v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 244 F.3d 675, 684 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2001), and hereby concludes as follows.

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Clint Matkovich ("plaintiff" or "Matkovich") filed this action in Ventura County Superior Court on January 16, 2015, (see Dkt. 1-1, Complaint), which Costco removed to this court on March 19, 2015. (See Dkt. 1, Notice of Removal). [*2]  Plaintiff alleges five causes of action pursuant to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940, et seq.: (1) disability discrimination, (see Dkt. 1-1, Complaint at ¶¶ 13-20); (2) failure to accommodate, (see id. at ¶¶ 21-29); (3) failure to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process, (see id. at ¶¶ 30-36); (4) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, (see id. at ¶¶ 37-44); and (5) retaliation. (See id. at ¶¶ 45-51).

STATEMENT OF FACTS1
In August 2005, Costco hired plaintiff to work as a Front End Assistant at its Westlake Village Warehouse. (See Dkt. 23-2, Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("SUF") at D1). As a Front End Assistant, plaintiff's duties included, among other things, loading merchandise onto cashiers' conveyor belts, packing merchandise into boxes, transferring items onto carts, restocking shelves, and performing clean-up. (See id. at D2-3 & P69).
On January 18, 2009, plaintiff injured his back while lifting a freezer product. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D4 & P73). Plaintiff reported the injury to Costco, sought medical treatment, and continued working for the following two months with temporary work restrictions calling for him not to lift, push, or pull [*3]  anything over 25 pounds. (See id. at D5-6 & P74-75). Plaintiff was released to return to work at full capacity on March 17, 2009, (see id. at D6 & P76), and continued working as a Front End Assistant without restrictions until January 3, 2012. (See id. at D7 & P77).
On January 3, 2012, plaintiff was diagnosed with a lumbar spine condition, (see Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P78), and was placed on work restrictions calling for "no forward flexion and pu[s]hing a load or sim[i]lar motions (i.e. like pushing multiple carts)." (Id. at D8 & P79). Plaintiff informed Costco of these restrictions, (see id. at D8 & P80), and continued working for approximately two years as a Front End Assistant with those restrictions. (See id. at D10 & P82). During that time, plaintiff was not required to push carts and, if something was too heavy for him to lift, he would ask a coworker or supervisor for assistance. (See id. at D12 & P144).
On October 31, 2013, plaintiff's doctor declared the injury "permanent and stationary" and put plaintiff on indefinite restrictions calling for "no lifting over 25 pounds, and no pushing or pulling over 30 pounds." (Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D13). In response, Costco scheduled a job assessment meeting [*4]  to determine whether plaintiff's restrictions could be accommodated on a permanent basis. (See id. at D14). The meeting was held on January 13, 2014. (See id. at D15). Plaintiff met in person with Costco General Manager Rudy Garcia ("Garcia"), (see id. at D16 & P91), while two other Costco representatives participated by telephone. (See id. at D17 & P92). At the end of the meeting, Garcia concluded that Costco could not provide lifting or shelving assistance as a permanent accommodation, (see id. at D23 & P101-02), and required plaintiff to take a leave of absence. (See id. at D25 & P107).
While plaintiff was on leave, Costco routinely sent him job listings to inform him of positions available at Westlake Village and other Costco locations. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D28-30). On January 23, 2014, plaintiff expressed interest in a Stocker position, (see id. at D32 & P113), but Costco notified him that it did not appear he could perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodations given his work restrictions. (See id. at D33 & P114).
On February 13, 2014, plaintiff expressed interest in a Major Sales Assistant position in Costco's Electronics Department. [*5]  (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D36). Costco determined that plaintiff could perform the essential functions of this position and offered him the job, (see id. at D40-41), but plaintiff rejected the position because he felt that he lacked sufficient knowledge of the products and industry. (See id. at D43 & D45). Costco continued sending job listings to plaintiff on a regular basis, (see id. at D50), but plaintiff did not express interest in any additional positions. (See id. at D31 & D51).
On March 3, 2015, Costco sent a letter to plaintiff inviting him to participate in another job assessment meeting to review his work status and restrictions. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D52). Plaintiff did not respond. (See id. at D53). Garcia sent a follow-up letter to plaintiff on April 23, 2015, asking him to respond no later than May 1, 2015, (see id. at D54), but plaintiff did not respond to this letter either. (See id. at D55). Garcia sent another letter to plaintiff on May 29, 2015, asking him to respond by June 8, 2015, and informing him that if he did not respond, Costco would terminate his employment. (See id. at D56-58). Plaintiff did not respond to this letter. (See id. at D60). On July 16, 2015, Garcia [*6]  sent a final letter to plaintiff informing him that his employment had been terminated pursuant to Costco's leave of absence policy, which provides for a leave of absence "of up to one year" only. (See id. at D61-62).

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Judgment must be entered "if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Id.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each cause of action upon which the moving party seeks judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, "the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000) ("Nissan Fire").
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to identify specific facts, drawn from materials in the [*7]  file, that demonstrate that there is a dispute as to material facts on the elements that the moving party has contested. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514 (A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.").2 A factual dispute is material only if it affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth. SEC v. Seaboard Corp., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982). Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512 (parties bear the same substantive burden of proof as would apply at a trial on the merits).
In determining whether a triable issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1206, 112 S. Ct. 2995, 120 L. Ed. 2d 872 (1992). However, summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying solely on "conclusory allegations [in] an affidavit." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3188, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (more than a "metaphysical doubt" is required to establish a genuine issue of material fact). "The mere existence of a scintilla [*8]  of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position" is insufficient to survive summary judgment; "there must be evidence on which the [fact finder] could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.

DISCUSSION
I. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION.
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge a person from employment, or to discriminate against a person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of a physical disability or medical condition. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Plaintiff asserts a claim for disability discrimination based on Costco's decision to place him on a leave of absence on January 13, 2014, instead of allowing him to continue working as a Front End Assistant with the accommodations that were in place for the previous two years. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Memorandum of Points and Authorities Re: Defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Joint Br.") at 24-25).
To prevail on his disability discrimination claim, "plaintiff must prove that [he could] perform the essential functions of the job . . . with or without reasonable accommodation." Green v. State, 42 Cal.4th 254, 265, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). "The essential functions of a position are 'the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability [*9]  holds or desires.'" Furtado v. StatePers. Bd., 212 Cal. App. 4th 729, 743, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 292 (2013) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)). Costco argues that summary judgment is appropriate because plaintiff could not perform two essential functions of the Front End Assistant position, even with a reasonable accommodation: (1) retrieving flatbeds and carts from the parking lot; and (2) lifting items in excess of 25 pounds.3 (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 18-21).
With respect to cart retrieval, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether this duty constitutes an essential function of the Front End Assistant position. (See Dkt.23-2, SUF at D2-3 & P128-30). Costco asserts that this duty is an essential function because the "job description lists that function as essential[.]" (Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 19). While it is undisputed that Costco's position summary contains a list of "Job Duties/Essential Functions" including the language, "[r]etrieves carts and flatbeds from parking area[,]" (Dkt. 24-1, Declaration of Rudy Garcia [] ("Garcia Decl.") at Exh. A, ECF 11; see Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D2), that fact is not dispositive. In determining whether a duty constitutes an essential function of a job, "[t]he duties listed in a job announcement" [*10]  are merely "a relevant consideration" and "are not conclusive." See Lui v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 211 Cal.App.4th 962, 977-78, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 385 (2012) ("[A]n employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description.") (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted); see also Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 887 (9th Cir. 2001)4 (holding that, "[i]f an employer has prepared a written description" for a job, "this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job[,]" but "such evidence is not conclusive") (internal quotation marks omitted).
Contrary to Costco's job description, the record contains evidence indicating that cart retrieval is not an essential function of the Front End Assistant position. For example, plaintiff stated during his January 13, 2014, job assessment meeting that "[f]emale Front End Assistants are not asked to push carts."5 (Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P130; see also Dkt. 24-7, Deposition of Clint Matkovich ("Matkovich Depo."), Exh. 22 ("Job Assessment Meeting Report") at ECF 83). Additionally, the notes from the January 13, 2014, meeting state that Costco "schedule[s] people to do the carts in the lot," and only "if there is a sick call, they are short handed [*11]  or sales drop off, [then] any front end assistant would have to be scheduled as part of the cart crew; it is not uncommon [for] anyone to be asked to push carts." (See Dkt. 24-7, Job Assessment Meeting Report at ECF 83). The inference from this evidence, which must be construed in plaintiff's favor on summary judgment, see Barlow, 943 F.2d at 1134, is that Front End Assistants who are not assigned to the "cart crew" are not required to push carts at all, and while it may "not be uncommon" for any Front End Assistant to perform cart retrieval, neither does it appear to be a fundamental aspect of the job. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could conclude that cart retrieval is a "marginal" rather than an "essential" function. See Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal.App.4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) ("'Essential functions' does not include the marginal functions of the position. 'Marginal functions' . . . are those that, if not performed, would not eliminate the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an alternative way.") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether "all Front End Assistants [*12]  pushed carts,"6 (Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 19), and whether cart retrieval is one of the "the fundamental job duties" of the position. See Furtado, 212 Cal.App.4th at 743.
With respect to lifting heavy items, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether plaintiff could perform this function with a reasonable accommodation. From January 2012 through January 2014, plaintiff worked as a Front End Assistant with a restriction preventing him from lifting over 25 pounds. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P75 & P82; Dkt. 24-7, Matkovich Depo. at ECF 98-101). To accommodate that restriction, plaintiff would simply ask other employees if he needed help lifting a heavy item. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D12, P94-98 & P144). Costco asserts that this accommodation "created a temporary 'light duty' position" for plaintiff, and that it was not required to indefinitely excuse plaintiff from performing the essential functions of his position merely because it temporarily agreed to do so. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 21). Indeed, "FEHA does not obligate the employer to accommodate the employee by excusing him or her from the performance of essential functions[,]" Nealy, 234 Cal.App.4th at 375, nor does it "require an employer to make any accommodation [*13]  that the employer can demonstrate would impose an 'undue hardship' on the operation of its business." Ross v. RagingWire Telecomms., Inc., 42 Cal. 4th 920, 938, 70 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382, 174 P.3d 200 (2008). Nevertheless, Costco's assertions are unpersuasive.
First, the fact that Costco accommodated plaintiff's restriction for such a long period of time — more than two years — supports a finding that the accommodation was reasonable; in other words, if plaintiff had not been satisfactorily performing the essential functions of his position during that time, Costco likely would have taken action much sooner. Cf. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11040 ("Whether an accommodation is reasonable is a factual determination to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration such factors [as] the duration of the needed accommodation, the employer's legally permissible past and current practices, and other such factors, under the totality of the circumstances."). Second, after plaintiff's condition was declared "permanent and stationary" on October 31, 2013, (see Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D13), he continued working under the same restriction and with the same accommodation until he was placed on a leave of absence on January 13, 2014. (See Dkt. 24-7, Deposition of Rudy Garcia ("Garcia Depo.") at ECF 146). Thus, for at least two-and-a-half [*14]  months after his restriction became permanent, Costco apparently viewed plaintiff as still capable of performing the essential functions of his position. Third, while plaintiff's accommodation was in effect, Costco received no complaints about plaintiff's overall job performance or his ability to perform the essential functions of his position. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P83 & P131; Dkt. 24-7, Garcia Depo. at ECF 139-140). These facts create a genuine dispute as to whether plaintiff's proposed accommodation would require "eliminating an essential function" of the Front End Assistant position, see Nealy, 234 Cal.App.4th at 375, and therefore whether the proposed accommodation is reasonable. See Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 968-69, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014) ("A reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
Moreover, the record contains scant evidence suggesting that the proposed accommodation would "impose an 'undue hardship' on the operation of [Costco's] business." See Ross, 42 Cal.4th at 938. FEHA defines an undue hardship as "an action requiring significant difficulty or expense, when considered in light of" several factors, see Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(u), including, among others, [*15]  "[t]he nature and cost of the accommodation needed[,]" id. at § 12926(u)(1), "[t]he overall financial resources of the facilities involved in the provision of the reasonable accommodations, the number of persons employed at the facility, and the effect on expenses and resources or the impact otherwise of these accommodations upon the operation of the facility." Id. at § 12926(u)(2). Putting aside the fact that a corporation the size of Costco with its extensive resources will rarely be able to establish an undue hardship, it is undisputed that Costco did not analyze "how much in additional payroll it would cost Costco to make Matkovich's accommodations permanent[,]" (Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P138), "how much less efficient it would make Costco to make Matkovich's [accommodations] permanent," (id. at P145), or whether "Costco ran less efficiently during the previous two years while Matkovich worked with restrictions." (Id. at P146). Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute regarding whether plaintiff's proposed accommodation, if made permanent, would impose an undue hardship on the operation of Costco's business.
In short, "[a] highly fact-specific inquiry is necessary to determine what a particular job's essential functions are." Cripe, 261 F.3d at 888 n. 12; see also Liu, 211 Cal.App.4th at 971 ("The [*16]  identification of essential job functions is a highly fact-specific inquiry.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, "[d]etermining whether a proposed accommodation . . . is reasonable . . . requires a fact-specific, individualized inquiry." Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Ross, 42 Cal.4th at 938 ("Whether a requested accommodation is reasonable or not is a highly fact-specific inquiry and requires balancing the needs of theparties.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the "conflicting and equivocal facts" concerning the essential functions of the Front End Assistant position and the reasonableness of the accommodations sought by plaintiff, see Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 266, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000), "it cannot be said that [Costco] met its burden of establishing the absence of a triable issue of material fact with respect to" plaintiff's disability discrimination claim. See id.
II. FAILURE TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION.
"FEHA makes it a separate unlawful employment practice for an employer to 'fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring.'" State Dep't of Health Servs. v. Super. Ct., 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1040, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441, 79 P.3d 556 (2003) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k)). To prevail on a FEHA claim for failure to prevent discrimination, plaintiff must first prove that he suffered actionable discrimination. See Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal.App.4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("Employers should not [*17]  be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except where the actions took place and were not prevented.").
Costco's only argument in favor of summary judgment on this claim is that the claim "fails because Plaintiff cannot establish the underlying claim for disability discrimination." (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 41). As explained above, plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact regarding his disability discrimination claim. See supra at § I. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate with respect to plaintiff's failure to prevent discrimination claim.
III. FAILURE TO ACCOMMODATE.
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1). Plaintiff asserts that Costco is liable for this cause of action because Costco refused to allow him to continue working as a Front End Assistant with the accommodations in place between January 2012 and January 2014. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 31). As explained above, plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact regarding the reasonableness of the accommodation he sought. See supra at § I.
Costco separately [*18]  argues that it cannot be held liable for failure to accommodate because it offered plaintiff a suitable alternative position — the Major Sales Assistant position — which plaintiff unreasonably refused to accept. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 32-33). But even if this position did constitute a reasonable accommodation, it was not offered to plaintiff until March 10, 2014, (see Dkt. 24-1, Garcia Decl. at ¶ 16), almost two months after Costco initially put plaintiff on a leave of absence instead of offering to continue his existing accommodation. (See id. at ¶ 14). "A single failure to reasonably accommodate an employee may give rise to liability, despite other efforts at accommodation." Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 969. Accordingly, to the extent that Costco may be held liable for its refusal to allow plaintiff to continue working as a Front End Assistant, that act alone may give rise to liability regardless of Costco's later offer of the Major Sales Assistant position. Summary judgment is therefore not appropriate with respect to plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.
IV. FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS.
FEHA requires an employer to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee [*19]  . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "[T]he interactive process is a mandatory rather than a permissive obligation on the part of employers [and] is triggered by an employee . . . giving notice of the employee's disability and the desire for accommodation." Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261. Costco does not dispute that it was obligated to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with plaintiff; rather, Costco asserts that it "went above and beyond" in complying with this obligation. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 36). Yet, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the January 13, 2014, job assessment meeting was conducted in accordance with FEHA's requirements. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P93, P103-105, P109-111, P137-38, P140 & P142).
Under FEHA, "the interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261 (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted). "[B]oth sides must communicate [*20]  directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Id. It is critical for employers to comply with these requirements given that "[e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have." Id. at 262. "[I]f the process fails, responsibility for the failure rests with the party who failed to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006).
Here, it is clear that the interactive process failed: plaintiff never returned to work and was terminated after a lengthy leave of absence. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D27 & P121). Plaintiff has put forth evidence tending to show that Costco is responsible for that failure, which first occurred at plaintiff's January 13, 2014, job assessment meeting. For example, although most job assessment meetings range from 45 minutes to two hours in length, (see Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P142), plaintiff's meeting lasted only 20 to 30 minutes. (See id. at P93). During the meeting, Costco prevented plaintiff from fully exploring the potential accommodations for his position, and even stopped him from fully responding to questions, by frequently interrupting him while he was speaking. [*21]  (See id. at P104-05). As a result, plaintiff felt that the meeting was "prearranged and rushed." (Id. at P103). Only 15 minutes after the meeting concluded, Garcia asked plaintiff to sign a document containing notes from the meeting, (see id. at P109), and when plaintiff requested more time to read through the document before signing, Garcia refused and wrote on the document that plaintiff was "unwilling to sign." (See id. at P110-11). These facts suggest that Costco did not "communicate directly" with plaintiff or allow a "good-faith exploration of possible accommodations" as required by FEHA. See Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261. Perhaps more importantly, Garcia decided to put plaintiff on an involuntary leave of absence without considering whether the accommodations that were in place for the previous two years, (see Dkt. 24-7, Garcia Depo. at ECF 146), would enable plaintiff "to perform the job effectively." See Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 261; (Dkt. 23-2, SUF at P140) (stating that Garcia "did not consider continuing to accommodate Matkovich on a temporary basis").
Costco contends that plaintiff was responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process over the next one-and-a-half years leading up to plaintiff's termination. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 39). Even if this were true, it would not warrant [*22]  summary judgment, as "[a] single failure" - here, the failed January 13, 2014, job assessment meeting - "may give rise to liability[.]" Swanson, 232 Cal.App.4th at 969. In any event, an employer is not entitled to summary judgment merely because it sent job listings to an employee on a semi-regular basis. The interactive process requires an employer to "identify which, if any, of the vacant positions met [plaintiff's] limitations and qualifications or could be altered to accommodate" him. See Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 265. Here, Costco apparently sent plaintiff a listing of all available positions, regardless of whether he could perform the essential functions of those positions with or without a reasonable accommodation. For example, Costco sent plaintiff a listing for a Stocker position, and then promptly determined that he was not eligible for it. (See Dkt. 23-2, SUF at D33 & P114). In short, there is a genuine dispute of material fact concerning which party was responsible for the ultimate failure of the interactive process. See Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 266 (denying summary judgment where "it cannot be said that [defendant] met its burden of establishing the absence of a triable issue of material fact with respect to [whether plaintiff] was responsible for the breakdown [*23]  in the informal, interactive process.").
V. RETALIATION.
Under FEHA, an employer may not "retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation . . . regardless of whether the request was granted." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2). To prevail on his FEHA retaliation claim, plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) Costco subjected him to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). Plaintiff contends that his request for a reasonable accommodation constitutes a protected activity, (see Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 43-44), and that Costco retaliated against him as a result of his request by placing him on an involuntary leave of absence. (See id. at 45-46). Plaintiff does not assert any other protected activity aside from his request for accommodation. (See, generally, id.).
Costco argues that summary judgment should be granted because a request for reasonable accommodation does not qualify as a protected activity under FEHA. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 42-43). In Rope v. Auto-Chlor System of Washington, Inc., 220 Cal.App.4th 635, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013), the Second District Court of Appeal held that there was "no support in the regulations or case law for the proposition that [*24]  a mere request — or even repeated requests — for an accommodation, without more, constitutes a protected activity sufficient to support a claim for retaliation in violation of FEHA." Id. at 652; see also Hawkins v. SimplexGrinnell, L.P., 640 F.App'x 640, 642 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Rope for the proposition that, "to constitute protected activity, there must be 'some degree of opposition to . . . the employer's conduct or practices based on the employee's reasonable belief that the employer's action or practice is unlawful'"). In response to the holding in Rope, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 987, see 2015 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 122 (A.B. 987) (West), which amended FEHA "to provide protection against retaliation when an individual makes a request for reasonable accommodation[.]" Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal.App.4th 216, 245, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016). Plaintiff contends that his request for accommodation qualifies as a protected activity pursuant to this amendment. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 44).
"Generally, statutes operate prospectively only[,]" Myers v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc., 28 Cal. 4th 828, 840, 123 Cal. Rptr. 2d 40, 50 P.3d 751 (2002), "unless they contain an express retroactivity provision, or it is very clear that the Legislature intended the statute to operate retroactively." Moore, 248 Cal.App.4th at 246 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Assembly Bill No. 987 "does not contain an express retroactivity [*25]  provision, and there is nothing else . . . that would make it very clear that the Legislature intended for the change it evidences to apply retroactively." Id. "However, a statute that merely clarifies, rather than changes, existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment because the true meaning of the statute remains the same." Id. (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted).
The preamble to Assembly Bill No. 987 states that the amendment was intended to clarify rather than change the law, stating that "the Legislature intends . . . to make clear that a request for reasonable accommodation on the basis of religion or disability is a protected activity[.]" 2015 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 122 (emphasis added). Yet, in the only published state court opinion on this issue, the Fourth District Court of Appeal held that, "in passing A.B. 987, the Legislature intended to change the law, not clarify it." Moore, 248 Cal.App.4th at 247 (emphasis in original). The federal courts have followed suit. See, e.g., Mohsin v. Cal. Dep't of Water Res., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102119, 2016 WL 4126721, *7 n. 2 (E.D. Cal. 2016) ("The Court concludes that this amendment does not apply retroactively [and thus] Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodations . . . do not constitute protected [*26]  activity."); Keshe v. CVS Pharmacy Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46782, 2016 WL 1367702, *10 (C.D. Cal. 2016) ("[E]ffective January 1, 2016, AB No. 987 modified the FEHA such that requests for accommodation can constitute protected activity; however, this amendment does not apply retroactively to Keshe's claim."). Under the circumstances here, the court concludes that plaintiff's request for an accommodation on January 13, 2014 - prior to the effective date of Assembly Bill No. 987 - is not a protected activity under FEHA. See Rope, 220 Cal.App.4th at 652. Accordingly, his FEHA retaliation claim fails.
VI. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
Costco separately moves for summary judgment on plaintiff's claims for punitive damages. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 46; see also Dkt. 1-1, Complaint at ¶¶ 19, 28, 35, 43 & 50 (seeking punitive damages with respect to all five FEHA claims)). "Under FEHA, because Defendant is a corporation, the evidence must demonstrate that an officer, director or managing agent of Defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud to create a genuine issue of material fact on punitive damages." McInteer v. Ashley Distrib. Servs., Ltd., 40 F.Supp.3d 1269, 1295 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted); see also Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v. Sup. Ct., 32 Cal.3d 211, 220, 185 Cal. Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912 (1982) (holding that punitive damages are recoverable for FEHA violations). Costco argues that plaintiff cannot recover punitive [*27]  damages because Garcia is not an officer, director, or managing agent of Costco. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 46-47).
To meet its initial burden of production on summary judgment, Costco "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of [plaintiff's] claim . . . or show that [plaintiff] does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry [his] ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1102. Plaintiff argues that Costco cannot meet its burden merely by "submitting a declaration from Rudy Garcia that parrots[,]" (see Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 48), the standard set forth in White v. Ultramar, 21 Cal.4th 563, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999). See id. at 573 (defining a "managing agent" in the context of corporate liability for punitive damages).
Indeed, the only evidence cited by Costco for the proposition that Garcia was not a managing agent is one conclusory paragraph in Garcia's declaration. (See Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br. at 46-47) (citing Dkt. 24-1, Garcia Decl. at ¶ 22). Although the court "may not disregard a piece of evidence at the summary judgment stage solely based on its self-serving nature[,]" Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 497 (9th Cir. 2015), the court "can disregard a self-serving declaration that states only conclusions and not facts that would be admissible evidence." Id. Costco does [*28]  not cite to any evidence outside of Garcia's declaration tending to show that Garcia was not a managing agent under the White standard, i.e., that he did not "exercise substantial independent authority and judgment . . . so that [his] decisions ultimately determine[d] corporate policy." White, 21 Cal.4th at 566-67; (see, generally, Dkt. 23-1, Joint Br.; Dkt. 25, Defendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment). Garcia's self-serving declaration alone does not negate plaintiff's assertion that Garcia was a managing agent for punitive damages purposes.
Neither has Costco shown that plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to prevail on his punitive damages claims at trial. The record contains evidence from which a reasonable jury may infer that Garcia "possessed broad supervisory and decisionmaking authority" as a Costco General Manager. See White, 21 Cal.4th at 579 (Mosk, J., concurring). For example, Garcia had the authority to: call for and conduct job assessment meetings, (see Dkt. 24-7, Garcia Depo. at ECF 147 & 152); determine whether employees are capable of performing the essential functions of a position, (see id. at ECF 180); determine the reasonableness of accommodations requested by disabled employees and thus whether [*29]  Costco would allow those accommodations, (see id. at ECF 177); place employees on a leave of absence, (see id. at ECF 176); and fire employees. (See Dkt. 24-1, Garcia Decl. at ¶ 21). In short, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, see Barlow, 943 F.2d at 1134, it is unclear whether Garcia qualifies as a managing agent for punitive damages purposes, and thus Costco has failed to carry its initial burden of production on summary judgment. See Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1102.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment (Document No. 23) is granted with respect to plaintiff's retaliation claim (Fifth Cause of Action) and denied as to all other claims. Dated this 13th day of September, 2016.
