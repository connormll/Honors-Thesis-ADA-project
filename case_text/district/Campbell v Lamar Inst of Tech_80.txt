MEMORANDUM ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
When Plaintiff Russell Campbell was a student at Lamar Institute of Technology ("LIT"), Defendants initially denied Mr. Campbell's requests for certain educational accommodations. But twenty-seven days later, LIT responded favorably to Mr. Campbell's grievance and granted him all of his requests. Nevertheless, Mr. Campbell sued, seeking damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief against LIT for himself and similarly-situated students based on LIT's exclusion and failure to accommodate in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act ("RA").
Defendants Rebecca Cole, Vivian Jefferson, Betty Reynard, Gwen [*2]  Walden, and LIT have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss Mr. Campbell's claims of disability discrimination under the ADA and the RA. (Dkt. # 11). In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants also argue for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). The four individually-named defendants are instructors and administrators at LIT who are sued only in their official capacities.
Because LIT's initial denial of Mr. Campbell's request for educational accommodations was quickly granted through LIT's own grievance policy, Mr. Campbell's injury lacks the imminence and redressability required to confer standing for claims of injunctive or declaratory relief.
Mr. Campbell also seeks compensatory damages under the ADA and RA based on LIT's exclusion and failure to accommodate him. But any injury based on exclusion or failure to accommodate is moot because LIT eliminated the controversy by granting his requested accommodation twenty-seven days after the initial denial and nine months before Mr. Campbell filed suit. Alternatively, assuming that the Fifth Circuit recognized a claim for "constructive dismissal" from an educational institution under the ADA or RA, this would fail because Mr. Campbell's deposition [*3]  testimony reveals that he withdrew from LIT because he felt unwelcome and wanted to save his 4.0 GPA, not because of intolerable conditions that compelled resignation.
Finally, Mr. Campbell seeks damages under the ADA based on Defendants' alleged harassment of Mr. Campbell. Even assuming that the Fifth Circuit recognized a claim based on a theory of a "hostile learning environment," this claim would nevertheless fail because LIT took prompt action regarding any alleged hostility, the alleged hostility was neither pervasive nor severe, and Mr. Campbell voluntarily withdrew from the "informal, interactive process" before it could be completed.
Alternatively, Defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity for Mr. Campbell's damages claims under the ADA.

I. Factual Background
Mr. Campbell suffered a debilitating injury in March 2009, when complications from Crohn's disease led to a bursting of his small intestines, which required an emergency small bowel transection and jejunostomy. (Dkt. # 22, at ¶ 5). During recovery, he experienced multiple pneumonias, restrictive lung disease, and an anoxic brain injury. Id. at ¶¶ 6-8. As a result of these illnesses, he can no longer work as an AAS Paramedic. [*4]  Id. at ¶ 3. He has also experienced a decline in cognitive learning. Id. at ¶ 10.
In the fall of 2012, Mr. Campbell enrolled in the Respiratory Therapy Program at LIT. Because of his decreased cognitive function, the Special Populations Office at LIT provided Mr. Campbell with the following educational accommodations: 1) Extended time for testing; 2) Recorder for all lectures; and 3) Laptop to facilitate note taking. (Dkt. # 11-4, at 1, 8-9). With all these accommodations in place, Mr. Campbell was successful during his first year, earning a 4.0 GPA. (Dkt. # 22, at ¶ 20).
During the fall of 2012, one of Mr. Campbell's instructors, Ms. Lanoue, allowed him to take two versions of the same test, issued two weeks apart. (Dkt. # 11-4, at 10). Ms. Lanoue saw Mr. Campbell's performance increase dramatically on the second exam; it was presumed that this was because he needed the additional time to allow the material to pass into his long-term memory and not merely because most students could improve if they took a test twice. Id. On October 4, 2013, one of Mr. Campbell's doctors, Dr. Lai, wrote a letter recommending that deferred testing dates be used to help him retain new material. (Dkt. # [*5]  21-5). The doctor also recommended that Mr. Campbell be provided with a notetaker on days where his illness prevented him from attending classes. Id.
In light of these recommendations, during the fall of 2013, Mr. Campbell approached Ms. Rebecca Cole, Special Populations Coordinator at LIT, to request the accommodations that Ms. Lanoue and Dr. Lai had recommended. Mr. Campbell claims that he only requested to take a single exam two weeks after the rest of his classmates. (Dkt. # 11-2, at 29:2-14). He did, however, expect that a different version of the second exam would be used. (Dkt. # 11-2, at 32:2-6). Ms. Cole felt that Mr. Campbell's request was unreasonable, as it would give Mr. Campbell "an unfair advantage over the other students in the class." (Dkt. # 11-4, at 2). Ms. Cole consulted with Dr. Vivian Jefferson, the Vice President of Student Services, and several other LIT administrators, who "agreed that providing extra study time is not an accommodation they would normally allow." (Dkt. # 11-4, at 2, 12-14).
On October 11, 2013, Mr. Campbell and his wife attended a meeting with Ms. Cole and Dr. Jefferson. During that meeting, Dr. Jefferson told Mr. Campbell that she could not [*6]  provide the requested accommodations because the accommodations were "not reasonable" and would give him an unfair advantage over other students. (Dkt. # 11-5, at ¶ 7). Mr. Campbell, could, however, approach professors individually regarding his requests. Id. at ¶ 7, In the same conversation, Dr. Jefferson explained that he had until October 30 to withdraw from classes. Id. at ¶ 9. Dr. Jefferson also indicated that Mr. Campbell should talk with Dr. Betty Reynard (Vice President of Academic Affairs and Workforce Development at LIT) about obtaining further accommodations. See (Dkt. # 11, Ex. E-1 (audio recording) at 6:13-22, 8:33-41, 11:25-32).
On October 15, 2013, Mr. Campbell approached one of his professors, Ms. Walden, about his desired accommodations. (Dkt. # 11-3, at 2). She discussed these accommodations with two of Mr. Campbell's other instructors (Cynthia McKinley and Stacy Taylor), Dr. Reynard, and Ms. Melissa Armentor (Dean of Instruction). Id.; (Dkt. # 21-17, at 18:25-19:14). These individuals agreed that they would only provide Mr. Campbell with the originally-approved accommodations, not deferred test dates or a notetaker on days in which he was absent. (Dkt. # 11-3, at [*7]  2). On October 17, 2013, Defendant was informed of this decision during a meeting with Ms. Walden, Ms. McKinley, and Ms. Taylor. Id. Defendant "felt" that his instructors would give him failing grades in his classes and that the only way to salvage his 4.0 GPA was to withdraw from the program. (Dkt. # 21, at 16).
Mr. Campbell withdrew from his classes on October 17, 2013. (Dkt. # 21, at 16). Shortly thereafter, he filed a grievance with the Dean of Instruction, Ms. Melissa Armentor, in which he claimed that Ms. Cole's "incompetency and ignorance specifically caused [him] to have to withdraw." (Dkt. # 11-7, at 7). The grievance was eventually directed to Vice President of Academic Affairs Dr. Reynard, to whom he had been earlier directed by Dr. Jefferson. (Dkt. # 11-7, at 1-2); (Dkt. # 11, at 5-6).
On November 6, 2013, LIT informed Mr. Campbell that it would honor his original request and provide him with "extra study time to prepare for exams." (Dkt. # 11-6, at 2-3). The school also offered to waive tuition and fees for the spring 2014 semester. Id. But Mr. Campbell responded that he no longer wished to attend LIT. Id. at 4-6. He claimed to be "frustrated" that he never received a "formal apology [*8]  for the discrimination and mismanagement of [his] cognitive disability" and alleges he felt "humiliated [and] embarrassed" by his instructors. Id. at 6. During an April 10, 2015 deposition, Mr. Campbell re-affirmed that he did not wish to be readmitted at LIT. (Dkt. # 11-2, at 9:22-24).

II. Legal Standards Governing Defendant's Motion
A. Summary Judgment Standard
Defendants move for summary judgment, asserting that Plaintiff lacks standing, can not support his claims of disability discriminations, and that the Eleventh Amendment provides Defendants with immunity from the Title II ADA claim. The standard under which a court reviews a motion for summary judgment is set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, which has been interpreted by numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals. There is no need for a lengthy review of those decisions. In short, a summary judgment motion should be granted if "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Only a genuine dispute over a material fact—a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law—will preclude summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
B. Standard for Review [*9]  of Challenge to Subject Matter Jurisdiction
An action must be dismissed if it appears that the court does not possess subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is to be considered before other challenges. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998).
A challenge to subject matter jurisdiction may be "facial" or "factual." Paterson v. Weinberger, 644 F.2d 521, 523 (5th Cir. 1981). A "factual" attack is one that involves the submission of evidentiary materials. Superior MRI Services, Inc. v. Alliance Healthcare Services, Inc., 778 F.3d 502, 504 (5th Cir. 2015). "To defeat a factual attack, a plaintiff 'must prove the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence' and is 'obliged to submit facts through some evidentiary method to sustain his burden of proof.'" Id. (quoting Irwin v. Veterans Admin., 874 F.2d 1092, 1096 (5th Cir. 1989)).
Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Mr. Campbell lacks standing is a "factual" attack on subject matter jursidiction because Defendants argue for dismissal based on evidentiary materials outside of the pleadings. To defeat Defendants' "factual" attack, Mr. Campbell must "submit facts" to "prove the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence." Superior, 778 F.3d at 504 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
A plaintiff has standing where he has suffered an injury that [*10]  is "concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling." Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149, 130 S. Ct. 2743, 177 L. Ed. 2d 461 (2010). "The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements" and "each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of litigation." Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992).

III. Analysis
A. The Court Lacks Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Claims for Compensatory Damages
Defendant asserts that Mr. Campbell lacks standing to assert his claims for compensatory damages, or, stated another way, that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because those claims are moot. Federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over moot claims. "Mootness is a jurisdictional question because the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions.'" N.C. v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S. Ct. 402, 30 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1971) (quoting United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., 253 U.S. 113, 116, 40 S. Ct. 448, 64 L. Ed. 808 (1920)). For a court to have jurisdiction, "an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review." Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S. Ct. 2330, 45 L. Ed. 2d 272 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10, 94 S. Ct. 1209, 39 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1974)). Where a state employee's voluntary resignation renders her unaffected by a challenged state law her claim is moot. Arizonans for Official English v. Ariz., 520 U.S. 43, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997). A case becomes moot when [*11]  a county voluntarily removes a statue that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause. Staley v. Harris Cnty., Tex., 485 F.3d 305, 309 (5th Cir. 2007). But a controversy would not be moot if the state was likely to reenact the allegedly-offending conduct. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S. Ct. 1070, 71 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1982).
There is no active controversy that would entitle Mr. Campbell to damages because his requested accommodations were granted by LIT through the grievance process nine months before suit was filed.
The first alleged denial of an accommodation was on October 10, 2013, during a meeting between Mr. Campbell and Ms. Cole. (Dkt. # 21, at 18). The denial was reaffirmed during meetings on October 11 and October 17. (Dkt. # 11-5, at ¶ 7); (Dkt. # 1, at ¶ 22). Mr. Campbell filed a grievance with the Office of Student Services on October 25, 2013. (Dkt. # 11-7, at 5). LIT granted Mr. Campbell the initially-denied accommodations on November 6, 2013 and also offered to waive Mr. Campbell's tuition for the spring 2014 semester. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 2-3). This was twenty-seven days after the accommodations were initially denied, and only twelve days after LIT received the grievance. The president of LIT has already spoken to Ms. Cole about her handling of the matter. (Dkt. # 21, at 13).
Mr. Campbell claims he refused to return [*12]  to LIT because he felt humiliated and wanted an apology. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 6). But he later testified that he would not have accepted an apology even if one had been offered. (Dkt. # 11-2, at 70:23-71:5).
Mr. Campbell was able to quickly obtain a favorable ruling under LIT's own grievance process. The court is aware of no Fifth Circuit case holding an educational institution liable because a requested accommodation was not instantly granted. If that were the law there would be no need for a grievance process or for any review of requests by higher level administrators of the institution.
There is no basis to hold LIT and the other defendants liable for exclusion or failure to accommodate. It is unfortunate that Mr. Campbell feels retaliated against and mistreated, even with the grant of his requested accommodations. See, e.g., (Dkt. # 11-7, at 7); (Dkt. # 21, at 20). That, however, does not change the fact that LIT's grievance process properly functioned to provide him with his requested accommodations. And even Mr. Campbell does not aver that he was expelled or excluded in any way except for denial of reasonable accommodations.
As Mr. Campbell has been granted his requested accommodations, [*13]  and LIT even offered to waive tuition for a semester in the event he wished to return, it cannot be said that his rights will be affected by the outcome of the present case. See Rice, 404 U.S. at 246. A groveling apology is not relief this court could order even if the case went to trial. There is also no indication that LIT will repeat the allegedly-offending conduct. See City of Mesquite, 455 U.S. at 289. Because the requested relief was granted on November 6, 2013, there was no active controversy when the Complaint was filed on August 1, 2014, and there is no active controversy now.
Defendants have established that there is not a live controversy regarding Mr. Campbell's claims of exclusion or failure to accommodate under the ADA and RA. Defendants have also satisfied the "heavy burden" of establishing non-recurrence. Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189. Mr. Campbell's claims of exclusion or failure to accommodate under the ADA and RA are therefore moot. A court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over moot claims. See, e.g., Sannon v. United States, 631 F.2d 1247, 1250 (5th Cir. 1990). Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment regarding these claims is therefore granted.
B. No Standing to Obtain Injunctive or Declaratory Relief
For similar reasons, Mr. Campbell can not show that he has standing to bring, or that the court [*14]  has jurisdiction over, his requests for injunctive or declaratory relief. In the context of a request for injunctive relief, the Supreme Court has "repeatedly reiterated that 'threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,' and that '[a]llegations of possible future injury' are not sufficient." Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. 398, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147, 185 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2013) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S. Ct. 1717, 109 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1990)). See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 184, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000) (holding that standing was present where the discharge of pollutants was "concededly ongoing"). Courts have refused to enter an injunction for lack of standing where the threatened future injury is based "on mere conjecture about possible government actions" and not "certainly impending." Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1154-55. Stated another way, a plaintiff must demonstrate "a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way" to establish standing. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983).
The injury forming the basis of Mr. Campbell's request for injunctive and declaratory relief is that "Defendants discriminated against [him] by failing to provide him with reasonable accommodations that were supported by physician documentation and teacher recommendation in violation of" the ADA and RA. (Dkt. # 1, at ¶¶ 28, 32). See also id. at ¶ 40 ("[I]njunctive relief is necessary to order Defendants to ensure that, [*15]  at [LIT], . . . students with disabilities are provided with reasonable accommodations as recommended by physicians or appropriate persons . . . ."); id. at ¶ 41 ("Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment concerning Defendants' violations of the ADA and Section 504 [to] receive reasonable accommodations as recommended by physicians or appropriate persons . . . ."). Such exclusion from a federally funded program is an element under the ADA and the RA. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011) (element 2 of the ADA satisfied if the plaintiff is "denied the benefits of services, programs, or other activities for which the public entity is responsible"); Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 391 F.3d 669, 676 n.8 (5th Cir. 2004) (element 3 of the RA satisfied if plaintiff is "denied benefits from" a federally funded program).
Mr. Campbell lacks standing to obtain declaratory or injunctive relief for himself because his injury is not "certainly impending." Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1155. In a letter dated November 6, 2013, LIT's Vice President of Academic Affairs informed Mr. Campbell that it would honor his original request and provide him with "extra study time to prepare for exams." (Dkt. # 11-6, at 3). LIT even offered to waive his tuition for the spring 2014 semester. Id. Any injury, then, is no longer "certainly impending." Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1155. Also, it seems [*16]  unlikely that Mr. Campbell "will again be wronged in a similar way." Lyons, 461 U.S. at 95. Mr. Campbell therefore lacks standing to sue for LIT's original denial of accommodations.
Mr. Campbell also lacks standing to obtain an injunction or declaratory relief on behalf of other students with disabilities. (Dkt. # 1, at ¶¶ 39-41). A limitation on the standing doctrine is that "the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties." Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474, 102 S. Ct. 752, 70 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1982) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 343 (1975)). Under this limitation, Mr. Campbell lacks standing to sue for other students with disabilities.
There is no evidence or even allegation that other students have been excluded or denied a reasonable accommodation. It is uncontested that LIT has what Mr. Campbell calls a "Special Populations Program." (Dkt. # 11, at 9); (Dkt. # 21, at 5). Mr. Campbell stresses in his first semester that he received accommodations and obtained a 4.0 GPA. So assuming that some instructor initially denied him a particular accommodation, this does not mean that this denial, which was reversed within days, is likely to affect Mr. Campbell or others.
Mr. Campbell has not established the "standing" [*17]  element of "imminence" by a preponderance of the evidence. See Superior, 778 F.3d at 504 (requiring that the plaintiff establish subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence for a "factual" attack on subject matter jurisdiction). The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Campbell's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to claims for injunctive and declaratory relief is granted.
C. Novel "Educational Harassment" and "Constructive Discharge" Claims Fail
Perhaps to avoid the familiar bar of subject matter jurisdiction, Mr. Campbell's pleadings and responses to the motion for summary judgment raise, directly or by implication, two somewhat novel theories. The first is a theory of educationally based harassment or "hostile learning environment" under the ADA. The second is a theory of "constructive expulsion" from the institution. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on both theories.
Mr. Campbell alleges that "Defendants . . . engaged in direct discrimination by ambushing [him], insulting, bullying, and harassing him because of his disability." (Dkt. # 1, at ¶ 29). This allegation is only made under the ADA, not the RA. See id. [*18]  at ¶¶ 31-35.

1. "Educational Harassment"
This court has not found any opinion in which the Fifth Circuit has recognized ADA-based claims for disability-based educational harassment of students by instructors (ie, non-peer-to-peer harassment) under a "hostile learning environment" theory. See R.S. v. Starkville Sch. Dist., No. 1:12-CV-00088-SA-DAS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134264, 2013 WL 5295685, at *11 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 19, 2013). Since no such cause of action exists, these claims are dismissed.
Alternatively, assuming for purposes of argument that this Circuit might recognize an "educational harassment" or "hostile learning environment" claim, the court analyzes the summary judgment evidence.
Courts recognizing a claim for a "hostile learning environment" under the ADA have applied the same elements and evidentiary standards applied to a hostile work environment claim under Title VII. See Pell v. Trustees of Columbia Univ., No. 97 CIV. 0193 (SS), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 407, 1998 WL 19989, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 1998); Guckenberger v. Boston University, 957 F.Supp. 306, 314 (D. Mass. 1997); Gaither v. Barron, 924 F.Supp. 134, 136 (M.D. Ala. 1996).
In the Fifth Circuit, the requirements to establish a claim for disability-based workplace harassment under the ADA are the same as those for a hostile work environment under Title VII:
(1) that he belongs to a protected group; (2) that he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) that the harassment complained of was based on his disability [*19]  or disabilities; (4) that the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt, remedial action.
Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 235-36 (5th Cir. 2001).
The standard for such harassment is high. "For workplace abuse to rise to the level of an actionable offense the disability-based harassment must be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment." Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., 321 F.3d 503, 509 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The Fifth Circuit has specifically refused to "elevate a few harsh words or 'cold shouldering' to the level of actionable offense." Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted).
In Flowers, the Fifth Circuit upheld a jury verdict of disability-based workplace harassment. In that case, after plaintiff revealed that she was HIV positive, she experienced an eight-month pattern of dismissive behavior, an increased incidence of random drug testing, and belligerent treatment over the course of several meetings, where she was called a "bitch," told that the administration was "tired of her crap," placed on 90-day probation, and had a tape recorder forcibly removed [*20]  from her person. 247 F.3d at 236-39. In another case, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a jury verdict based on a repeating pattern of harassing statements regarding plaintiff's hearing impairment, including statements made by her immediate supervisor during several staff meetings and by the company president during a Christmas party. EEOC v. Bobrich Enters., No. 08-10162, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 4314, 2009 WL 577728, at *1-*3 (5th Cir. Mar. 6, 2009). In that case, the harassment had continued despite plaintiff's earlier protestations. Id.
Assuming that the Fifth Circuit were to recognize a claim for educational-based disability harassment under the ADA, there are two reasons that Mr. Campbell fails to establish such a claim. First, there is no genuine fact issue regarding element 5, that LIT "knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt action." Flowers, 247 F.3d at 236. Mr. Campbell filed his grievance on October 25, 2013 and was provided with his request for deferred testing dates on November 6, 2013, a mere twelve days later. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 2-3); (Dkt. # 11-7, at 1). LIT president Dr. Szuch spoke to Ms. Cole, who had originally denied the request for deferred testing dates, about her handling of the matter. (Dkt. # 21, at 13). Based on these facts, it is clear that the LIT administration took prompt action as soon [*21]  as it became aware of Mr. Campbell's "harassment."
Second, Mr. Campbell does not demonstrate the requisite pervasiveness and severity to survive summary judgment. According to Mr. Campbell, "[t]he events made the basis of this legal dispute arose during the Fall semester of the 2013-2014 school year, when Campbell was enrolled as a student" in LIT's Respiratory Care Program. (Dkt. # 21, at 4). That was his third semester at LIT. During his first two semesters, LIT provided Mr. Campbell with accommodations, and he was able, in these particular classes, to obtain a 4.0 GPA.1 (Dkt. # 22, at ¶ 20). By October 2013, however, Mr. Campbell was failing his classes due to extended absences.2 (Dkt. # 11-3, at ¶¶ 8-9). The first alleged denial of his request for deferred testing dates was on October 10, 2013, and several similar denials followed over the course of the next week. (Dkt. # 21, at 18). On October 17, 2013, Mr. Campbell withdrew from LIT. (Dkt. # 21, at 16-17). He claims that he felt humiliated and embarrassed by his experience seeking deferred testing dates from LIT. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 6).
It strains credulity to hold that a single bad week over the course of three academic semesters is [*22]  sufficient to establish the pervasiveness and severity of treatment needed to state a claim for a hostile learning environment. "For workplace abuse to rise to the level of an actionable offense the disability-based harassment must be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment." Gowesky, 321 F.3d at 509 (internal citations and quotations omitted). This is not a situation where the alleged harassment occurred over a period of months (as in Flowers) or years (as in Bobrich). It is also not a situation where patently offensive statements were made ("bitch" as in Flowers, "do you have your ears on?" as in Bobrich), or where harassment continued after a complaint was made (as in Bobrich). Rather, it is a single bad week of alleged harassment that LIT quickly remedied after being notified.
It is also not apparent that LIT's denial of Mr. Campbell's request for deferred testing dates "alter[ed] the conditions of employment and create[d] an abusive working environment." Gowesky, 321 F.3d at 509. As already noted, Mr. Campbell was failing his classes before he was denied deferred testing dates. (Dkt. # 11-3, at ¶¶ 8-9). Other than making him mad, it is not clear how LIT's [*23]  denial fundamentally altered his ability to attend class and learn as he did during his prior two semesters, when he obtained a 4.0 GPA without deferred testing dates.
Again, assuming that this Circuit recognizes a hostile learning environment cause of action, LIT is also entitled to summary judgment because Mr. Campbell withdrew before the interactive process could be completed. "When a qualified individual with a disability requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer and employee should engage in flexible, interactive discussions to determine the appropriate accommodation." E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distrib., 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009). However, "an employer cannot be found to have violated the ADA when responsibility for the breakdown of the 'informal, interactive process' is traceable to the employee and not the employer." Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216, 224 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Loulseged v. Akzo Nobel Inc., 178 F.3d 731, 736 (5th Cir. 1999)).
The November 2012 version of LIT's Respiratory Care Student Handbook ("RC Handbook") contains a section entitled "Student Grievance Procedures." (Dkt. # 31-3, at 17). It states that "[s]tudents should first attempt to resolve grievances locally and informally." Id. "Locally" means "within the Respiratory Program." Id. A student then proceeds to the "Department of Allied Health-chair," then to the "Dean of [*24]  Student Services," and finally, to the "Vice President of Academic Affairs." The RC Handbook states that "there is a chain of command, which the student is strongly urged to make use of if the need arises." Id. According to LIT, Dr. Jefferson holds the position of "Dean of Student Services" and "Vice President of Student Services." (Dkt. # 31, at 4 n.3). The Vice President of Academic affairs is Dr. Reynard. (Dkt. # 1, at ¶ 9).
The "Grievance Procedure" outlined in the RC Handbook is consistent with the procedure that Dr. Jefferson described in a conversation with Mr. Campbell and his wife:
Mr. Campbell: If I take the same test in the same amount of time, I'm going to make a 60. . . . I don't care what you do or what I do, that's what I'm going to make. You come back a week later and give me that same test, and I'll make a 90 . . . because then I know the material and once I know it, I know it. It's not going anywhere.
Dr. Jefferson: Well, you're going to have to take that up with a teaching method, you're going to have to take that up with the Vice President of Academic Affairs because I cannot make . . .
Mr. Campbell: That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Dr. Jefferson: And that's Dr. [*25]  Betty Reynard.
(Dkt. # 11, Ex. E-1 (audio recording), at 5:44-6:23).
Although the RC Handbook and Dr. Jefferson both instructed Mr. Campbell to contact Dr. Reynard, Mr. Campbell did not contact her. According to Dr. Reynard, she had been informed of Mr. Campbell's request by other instructors, but was not initially provided with the medical documentation supporting his requests. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 1-2). It was not until Mr. Campbell's post-withdrawal grievance came to her direct attention that Dr. Reynard looked at his complete Student Services file. Id. At that point, she was able to "understand the basis for and reasonableness of Mr. Campbell's request," which was ultimately granted. (Dkt. # 11-6, at 2). LIT, then, cannot be held responsible for the breakdown of the grievance process because Mr. Campbell withdrew before completing it.
For these reasons, LIT is entitled to summary judgment for Mr. Campbell's claim of harassment under the ADA.

2. "Constructive expulsion"
Mr. Campbell admits he was not expelled from LIT, but argues that he was forced to withdraw. The court has found no Fifth Circuit case recognizing a cause of action for "constructive expulsion." Assuming the Circuit Court [*26]  wanted to consider such a cause of action in the context of the ADA, the closest legal analogy would be constructive discharge cases under Title VII.
"Constructive discharge" is recognized as "a means of proving the element of an adverse employment action in Title VII and other cases." Wells v. City of Alexandria, No. 3-30750, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 8525, 2004 WL 909735, *3 (5th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). In the context of employment law, "[a] resignation is actionable under Title VII, allowing the plaintiff to seek compensatory damages for events after the resignation, only if the resignation qualifies as a constructive discharge." Brown v. Kinney Shoe Corp., 237 F.3d 556, 566 (5th Cir. 2001). "To survive summary judgment on a constructive discharge claim," the plaintiff must provide evidence of more than "mere harassment." Hockman v. Westward Communications, LLC, 407 F.3d 317, 331, 122 Fed. Appx. 734 (5th Cir. 2004). Rather, "the plaintiff must provide evidence that working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable employee . . . would have felt compelled to resign." Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). Feelings of embarrassment or awkwardness are also insufficient to establish this type of claim. See Haley v. Alliance Compressor LLC, 391 F.3d 644, 652 (5th Cir. 2004) (holding that a co-worker's sarcastic ridicule of an employee, which made her co-workers laugh at her, as well as "an overly severe performance plan and micromanagement by her superiors," [*27]  did not "constitute the type of badgering or harassment designed to encourage the employee's resignation that is required for constructive discharge").
Even if a court was considering recognizing "constructive expulsion" from college in the context of the ADA and RA, the facts of this case do not bring it into line with the analogous employment law theory. Mr. Campbell has not provided sufficient evidence to establish the requisite hostility. Mr. Campbell testified that he withdrew from LIT because he felt unwelcome and wanted to save his 4.0 GPA. During a deposition, Mr. Campbell was questioned as follows:
Q: Okay. Did anyone at LIT ever tell you that you had no choice but to withdraw?
Mr. Campbell: Not in so many words.
Q: Did anyone at LIT ever physically force you to withdraw?
Mr. Campbell: No. The closest anybody came to any of that was Vivian Jefferson.
Q: And that was during your meeting with her that you recorded?
Mr. Campbell: Yes.
Q: And you withdrew after your meeting with your three instructors on October 17th, 2013, because, one, you wanted to salvage your GPA and, two, you felt unwelcome; is that correct?
Mr. Campbell: Yes.
(Dkt. 11-2, at 59:24-60:13).
Assuming the law governing [*28]  constructive discharge will be the guideline, this testimony would be insufficient to establish an action for "constructive expulsion." It cannot be said that a reasonable student would withdraw merely because administrators denied requests for deferred exam dates, or because he did not want to risk having any grade point average below perfect, or because he had four bad weeks in an otherwise satisfactory academic career. And even if that was reasonable, what reasonable student would then reject the offer of the Administration, made twelve days after he filed his grievance, to grant him his requested accommodations and to waive next semester's tuition? Defendants' motion for summary judgment will therefore be granted regarding this claim.
D. Defendants are Entitled to Sovereign Immunity
The Eleventh Amendment jurisdictionally bars a suit in federal court by a private individual against a state, absent Congress' express abrogation of immunity or the state's consent. See Pace v. Bogalusa City School Bd., 403 F.3d 272, 276-77 (5th Cir. 2005). If sovereign immunity applies, the defendant is immune from retroactive monetary relief that would be paid from the state treasury. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974). This includes compensatory damages. See Clay v. Texas Women's Univ., 728 F.2d 714, 715 (5th Cir. 1984) (stating that the Eleventh Amendment bars "suits against a state by private parties [*29]  who seek monetary relief from the state in the form of compensatory damages . . . and also to suits against a state agency or state official when the monied award is to be paid from the state treasury"). Under the Ex parte Young exception, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar "suits for prospective relief against a state employee acting in his official capacity." Nelson, 535 F.3d at 321.
Whether a state is entitled to sovereign immunity under Title II of the ADA is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by considering the following factors:
(1) which aspects of the state's conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress's purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.
United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006).
Mr. Campbell's allegation is that the state's denial of an accommodation for twenty-seven days before granting the accommodation in the grievance process was a violation of Title II. But as discussed, Mr. Campbell lacks standing to obtain prospective relief stemming from LIT's denial of his request for deferred testing dates. The court has granted summary judgment for compensatory damages [*30]  stemming from the denial of deferred testing dates and for harassment.
Defendants' alleged misconduct is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that education is not a fundamental right and that a state "need not justify by compelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is provided to its population." Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 223, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982). See also San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33-37, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). It follows that refusal to grant a deferred exam date on the grounds of disability does not violate a fundamental right. There is therefore no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Mr. Campbell agrees with this conclusion. (Dkt. # 21, at 48).
In addressing the third factor, the Fifth Circuit has held that "disability discrimination is subject only to rational-basis review, under which there is no constitutional violation so long as 'there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.'" Hale v. King, 624 F.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir. 2010), opinion withdrawn and superseded on other grounds, 642 F.3d 492 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001)). See also Purvis v. Tex. A & M Univ., No. CIV.A. G-10-520, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129086, 2011 WL 5416313, at *5 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 8, 2011) (applying rational-basis review to the third Georgia factor); Baker v. Univ. of Tex. Health Sci. Ctr. Houston, No. CIV.A. H-08-1908, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43286, 2011 WL 1549263, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 21, 2011) (applying rational-basis review in reliance upon Hale, 624 F.3d at 184).
Here, Defendants have provided several legitimate reasons for the short delay in [*31]  providing Campbell's requested accommodations:
1. Concern that the accommodations would give Mr. Campbell an unfair advantage over the other students.
2. It would be burdensome to require professors to make a second version of the same test.
3. Could cause scheduling conflicts, particularly if a final exam fell outside of the academic calendar.
(Dkt. # 11-4, at 2); (Dkt. # 11-5, at 2). Taken together, these reasons provide a rational relationship between the alleged disparity of treatment and the alleged discriminatory conduct which ceased shortly after the grievance was filed. Therefore, Defendants' decision survives rational basis scrutiny and the state is entitled to sovereign immunity.
LIT and the individually-named defendants are entitled to the state's sovereign immunity. LIT is entitled to sovereign immunity because it is a state institution. See, e.g., Nelson v. Univ. of Texas at Dallas, 535 F.3d 318, 320 (5th Cir. 2008); United States ex rel. Foulds v. Texas Tech Univ., 171 F.3d 279, 289 n.14 (5th Cir. 1999). Because the four individual-named defendants are being sued in their official capacity (Dkt. # 1, at ¶¶ 7-10), they are also entitled to the state's sovereign immunity, subject to the Ex parte Young exception that "the Eleventh Amendment is not a bar to suits for prospective relief against a state employee acting in his official capacity." Nelson, 535 F.3d at 321. Such [*32]  prospective relief is inapplicable here, because Mr. Campbell lacks standing to obtain injunctive relief. Sovereign immunity does, however, bar recovery of compensatory damages under the ADA, as this is retroactive relief to be paid from the state treasury. See Edelman, 415 U.S. at 651.
