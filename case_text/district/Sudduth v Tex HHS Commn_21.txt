Opinion



ORDER
BE IT REMEMBERED on this day the Court reviewed the file in the above-styled cause, and specifically Defendants Texas Health and Human Services Commission and Kyle Janek's Motion for Summary Judgment [#53], Plaintiff Karen Renee Sudduth' s Response [#54] thereto, Defendants' Reply and Objections to Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence [#55], Defendants' Opposed Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence [#56],1 Plaintiff's Response [#57] thereto, Defendants' Reply [#61] thereto, Plaintiff's Opposed Motion to Properly Support a Fact Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) [#58],2 and Defendants' Response [#60] thereto. Having reviewed the documents, the governing law, and the file as a whole, the Court now enters the following opinion and orders.
Background
Plaintiff Karen Renee Sudduth, who has diabetes [*2]  and related visual impairments, including total blindness in her left eye and limited vision in her right eye, brings this employment discrimination suit against the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC), her former employer, and its director, Kyle Janek, in his official capacity (together, Defendants). Sudduth claims she was discriminated against by Defendants on the basis of her disabilities. The facts of this case are difficult to weave into a coherent narrative, as Sudduth's second amended complaint contains a hodgepodge of various allegations of discrimination and Sudduth provides no statement of facts in her response to the motion for summary judgment. As far as the Court can discern, the facts, recounted in the light most favorable to Sudduth, are as follows.
Sudduth was employed by HHSC as a CBS Clerk III from July 25, 2011, through July 31, 2012, in Austin, Texas. Sudduth's job duties included handling mail and processing applications sent to HHSC. On August 1, 2011, shortly after her employment began, Sudduth informed her supervisor, Diamond Mendoza, that she had a visual impairment and required accommodations to perform her job duties. According to Sudduth, Mendoza [*3]  responded by making Sudduth "very uncomfortable . . . through repeated sighs, rolling of eyes, and sounds of exasperation[.]" Second Am. Compl. [#21] ¶ 7.
Also on August 1, 2011, Sudduth filled out a Reasonable Accommodation Request form requesting a closed-circuit television system, magnifying computer software, a hand-held magnifier, an LED lamp, and a keyboard with large letters and numbers. See Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] Ex. 5-A at App'x 79-80. Mendoza signed the form, which was received by the HHSC Civil Rights office on August 3,2011. On August 4, 2011, Joe Madrigal, a representative from the HHSC Civil Rights office, sent Sudduth a letter informing her additional medical information was required to process her accommodation request and asking she provide the information by September 5, 2011. Id. Ex. 13 at App'x 135. While it is not clear when Sudduth provided that information, HHSC records show Sudduth's physician faxed at least some documentation to HHSC on August 31, 2011, see Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [#54-2] Ex. 8 at App'x 102,3 and email records show Madrigal sent three additional requests for information to Sudduth on September 6, 2011, September 21, 2011, and October 6, 2011. See [*4]  Mot. Summ J [#53-1] Ex. 13 at App'x 135-140.
On October 18, 2011, the HHSC Civil Rights office approved Sudduth's accommodation request. See id. Ex. 6 at App'x 81. While Sudduth's complaint alleges Tit took over nine months" for the equipment to arrive, Second Am. Compl. [#21] ¶ 9, at deposition, Sudduth estimated she received the equipment "approximately two to three months" before she was terminated, or approximately six to seven months after her accommodation request was approved, id. Ex. 1 (Sudduth Dep.) at 133:17-21, and Sudduth's response to the motion for summary judgment indicates it took "at least four months" from approval for Sudduth to receive her accommodations. Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [#54] at 13.
In addition to the alleged eye-rolling and delayed receipt of accommodation equipment, Sudduth alleges additional "occurrences of discrimination" took place during her tenure at HHSC. See Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [#54] at 7 & n.8. According to Sudduth: (1) on August 2, 2011, she was pressured by Mendoza to sign certain new-hire documents she could not read, and never received an enlarged copy of those documents despite requesting them; (2) on August 10, 2011, she was "removed from a training class" because [*5]  she was having difficulty seeing the training materials and HHSC did not have the necessary accommodation materials at that time; (3) in October 2011, she was told she could only ask Mendoza for help with her work, rather than being able to ask her co-workers; (4) in January 2012, she was moved to a workspace with inadequate lighting and a hazardous structural pole and was not moved to a suitable space until she threatened to report the issue to the Civil Rights office; (5) throughout her term of employment, she was required to obtain a doctor's excuse for all of her doctor's appointments although her co-workers were not held to the same standard; and (6) she was "continually harass[ed]" about the number of bathroom breaks she took in order to check her glucose levels or inject insulin. See Second Am. Compl. [#21] ¶¶ 8, 10, 13, 26.
On July 13, 2012, an incident occurred between Sudduth and Salina Carter, a co-worker, during which Sudduth allegedly raised her voice and spoke in a threatening fashion to Carter, telling Carter to "get out of [her] face" and saying something to the effect of "Girl, don't make me slap you in the back of the head." Sudduth Dep. at 185:12-16; see Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] [*6]  Ex. 14-A (Notification of Possible Disciplinary Action) (recounting the incident). An HHSC supervisor reported the incident to Gary Gossett, then Sudduth's supervisor, and on July 16, 2012, Gossett called Sudduth into his office for a "coaching session" regarding Sudduth's "tone and volume of voice." Second Am. Compl. ¶ 21. Two days later, on July 18, 2012, Gossett called Sudduth into his office again, this time to discuss Sudduth's allegedly continued "huffing and puffing" and aggressive behavior when walking by Carter's cubicle. Id. ¶ 22; Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] Ex. 3 (Gossett Dep.) at 68:2-14. After this second "coaching session," Sudduth contacted HHSC's Civil Rights office to complain about the "falsified stories of alleged misconduct" in addition to her other grievances outlined above. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 22.
On July 26, 2012, HHSC sent Sudduth a "Notification of Possible Disciplinary Action," notifying Sudduth she was subject to discipline up to and including termination because of the July 13, 2012 incident, which violated HHSC's policies against "threatening behavior" and "workplace violence," including making a threat to physically assault another employee, and ran afoul of HHSC's standards of [*7]  conduct as set forth in HHSC's human resources manual. See Notification of Possible Disciplinary Action. Sudduth provided both a written and verbal rebuttal to the notice, but was ultimately terminated on July 31, 2012 following management's review. See Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] Ex. 14-B (Notice of Disciplinary Action).
Sudduth filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on May 13, 2013, alleging she was discriminated against on the basis of her race (American Indian) and her disability in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Id. Ex. 11 (EEOC Complaint) at App'x 114. Sudduth received a right-to-sue letter on July 20, 2013. Second Am. Compl. [#21] ¶ 30. Proceeding pro se, Sudduth filed her complaint on October 17, 2013, alleging race discrimination in violation of Title VII and disability discrimination in violation of the ADA. The Court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint on April 16, 2014.4 See Order of Apr. 16, 2014 [#20]. Sudduth subsequently retained counsel and amended her complaint, asserting claims for (1) discrimination under the ADA against Kyle Janek,5 Executive Commissioner of HHS C, Gossett, [*8]  and Tina Pham, Assistant Regional Director for HHSC, in their official capacities; (2) discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act against HHSC; (3) retaliation in violation of Title VII against HHSC; and (4) a 14th Amendment due process claim against the individual defendants in their individual capacities. See Second Am. Compl. [#21].
Defendants filed a second motion to dismiss, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on June 23, 2014. See Order of June 23, 2014 [#30]. The Court dismissed Sudduth's due process claim, Title VII retaliation claim, and ADA claims against Gossett and Pham. See id. The following claims thus remain live: (1) discrimination under the ADA, asserted against Janek in his official capacity; and (2) discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, asserted against HHSC. Sudduth seeks prospective injunctive relief in the form of an order clearing her employment record of any allegation of "workplace violence," damages, and attorney's fees.6 Defendants have now moved for summary judgment on Sudduth's remaining claims.

Analysis

I. Legal Standard
Summary judgment shall be rendered when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits [*9]  show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. Civ, P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-25, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Washburn v. Harvey, 504 F.3d 505, 508 (5th Cir. 2007). A dispute regarding a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is required to view all inferences drawn from the factual record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Washburn, 504 F.3d at 508. Further, a court "may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence" in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254-55.
Once the moving party has made an initial showing that there is no evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, the party opposing the motion must come forward with competent summary judgment evidence of the existence of a genuine fact issue. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586. Mere conclusory allegations are not competent summary judgment evidence, and thus are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007). Unsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation are not competent summary judgment evidence. Id. The party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the [*10]  record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his claim. Adams v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn., 465 F.3d 156, 164 (5th Cir. 2006). Rule 56 does not impose a duty on the court to "sift through the record in search of evidence" to support the nonmovant's opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Id.
"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing laws will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed fact issues that are "irrelevant and unnecessary" will not be considered by a court in ruling on a summary judgment motion. Id. If the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to its case and on which it will bear the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment must be granted. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.

Application
To prevail on a discrimination claim under the ADA, Sudduth must show that she was disabled, was qualified for her position, and was subject to an adverse employment action because of her disability. E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. 2014); id. at 695 (explaining splintered Fifth Circuit case law on elements of ADA prima facie case and applying three-element formulation as articulated above). Similarly, to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, [*11]  a plaintiff must show she "(1) was an individual with a disability; (2) was otherwise qualified; (3) worked for a federal agency; (4) suffered an adverse employment action; and (5) was denied the benefits of [her] employment or subjected to discrimination solely because of [her] disability." Smith v. Shinseki, 716 F. Supp. 2d 556, 565-66 (S.D. Tex. 2009) (citing Pinkerton v. Spellings, 529 F.3d 513, 519 (5th Cir. 2008); Washburn, 504 F.3d at 508). The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act generally are interpreted in pari materia; both "are judged under the same legal standards, and the same remedies are available under both Acts." Kemp v. Holder, 610 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir. 2010).
Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment for four reasons: first, because Sudduth is not a "qualified individual"; second, because Sudduth cannot establish Defendants took any adverse employment action against her because of her disability; third, because it is undisputed Sudduth received all of the accommodations she requested; and finally, because Defendants had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Sudduth's employment.7 As set forth below, the Court finds while Sudduth is a "qualified individual," she has failed to show Defendants terminated her because of her disability, and has therefore failed to establish her prima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. [*12]  Further, even presuming Sudduth has established her prima facie case (which she has not), the Court finds Sudduth has failed to demonstrate Defendants' legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination was pretextual. Finally, the Court agrees Sudduth cannot maintain a failure-to-accommodate claim—to the extent she has asserted one—as Sudduth received all of the accommodations she requested. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all of Sudduth's claims.

A. Sudduth is a "qualified individual"
Defendants first argue they are entitled to summary judgment because Sudduth has conceded she is no longer qualified to perform the essential functions of the CBS Clerk III position, and therefore cannot prove she is a "qualified individual," an essential element of her prima facie case. See Mot. Summ. J. [#53] Ex. 1 (Sudduth Dep.) at 84:4-5 ("Q. You're completely disabled? A. I am—yes. Right now I cannot work."); 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) (defining "qualified individual with a disability" as someone who has a disability but who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires"). Defendants are incorrect. The question [*13]  is not whether Sudduth is presently able to perform the essential functions of the position, but whether she was able to do so as of the date she was terminated. See, e.g., Amsel v. Tex. Water Dey. Bd., 464 F. App'x 395, 400 (5th Cir. 2012) (unpublished) ("[T]he question . . . is whether [the plaintiff] was qualified at the time his position was eliminated."); Bennett v. Calabrian Chem. Corp., 324 F. Supp. 2d 815, 828-29 (E.D. Tex. 2004) (collecting cases). Whether or not Sudduth later became unable to perform the essential functions of her position is therefore irrelevant.8 As there is no dispute Sudduth was qualified for the job at the time of her termination, Defendants' first argument is rejected.

B. Sudduth has failed to demonstrate she was terminated because of her disability
Defendants next claim they are entitled to summary judgment because Sudduth cannot establish she was subject to any adverse employment action because of her disability. Specifically, Defendants point out Sudduth neither pled nor alleged in her EEOC charge that her termination was the result of disability discrimination; rather, Sudduth claimed she was terminated in retaliation for reporting management's allegedly discriminatory practices to the HHSC Civil Rights office. See Second Am. Compl. [#21] ¶¶ 45-47. Defendants further argue that to the extent [*14]  Sudduth asserts the individual "occurrences of discrimination" outlined above are independently actionable, those claims are untimely and should be dismissed.
Sudduth's rather confusing response asserts that she has alleged claims predicated upon two different adverse employment actions: a wrongful termination and a failure to train. As for the latter: as Sudduth did not plead a claim predicated upon a failure to train in her complaint, such a claim is not properly before the Court. See, e.g., Gomez v. LSI Integrated LP, 246 F. App'x 852, 854 (5th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (citing Roeder v. Am. Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, 180 F.3d 733, 737 n.4 (6th Cir. 1999)) (affirming district court's finding an unpled claim raised for the first time in response to a motion for summary judgment was not properly before the court). Further, even had Sudduth pled such a claim, it would be subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust, as Sudduth did not present it to the EEOC. See EEOC Complaint at App'x 114-116; Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 788-89 (5th Cir. 1996) (finding ADA plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit in federal court). Consequently, Sudduth must hang her hat on wrongful termination. The Court will assume without deciding that Sudduth sufficiently pled her termination was the result of disability discrimination and exhausted that claim by raising it in [*15]  her EEOC charge.
Even given that allowance, Sudduth's claim fails. At this stage of the proceedings, Sudduth must show Defendants' decision to terminate her was motivated by discriminatory animus. "Plaintiff's speculation and belief are insufficient to make this prima facie showing . . . . [B]ald conclusions are also insufficient." Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 43 F. Supp. 2d 652,656-57 (S.D. Miss. 1998) (citing EEOC v. Exxon Shipping Co., 745 F.2d 967, 976 (5th Cir. 1984)). Sudduth marshals little in attempting to carry her burden, merely pointing without elaboration to the alleged "occurrences of discrimination" previously recounted. The Court is unpersuaded. Three of the "occurrences"—the August incidents regarding Sudduth' s signature on new-hire documents and lack of specialized training materials and the October incident where Sudduth was directed to ask only Mendoza for help when she needed it—took place within the first three months of Sudduth's employment, fully nine months prior to her termination. Sudduth does not explain how those incidents, or the January 2012 incident in which she was moved between workspaces, are linked to Defendants' decision to terminate her employment. Further, Sudduth neither points the Court to evidence substantiating her claims of "harassment" because of trips to the bathroom or excessive [*16]  production of doctor's excuses nor explains how those actions motivated Defendants' decision to fire her. The only thing linking these occurrences to Sudduth's termination is Sudduth's own speculation and belief; that, of course, is not enough. The Court concludes Sudduth has failed to prove up her prima facie case, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.

C. Sudduth has not shown Defendants' explanation for her termination is pretextual
Even if Sudduth could establish a prima facie case of discrimination, moreover, she would nevertheless be unable to recover because she has failed to show Defendants' explanation for her termination is pretextual. To establish a claim for discrimination under the ADA, absent direct evidence of discrimination,9 a plaintiff may utilize the McDonnell Douglas indirect method of proof. Daigle v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 70 F.3d 394, 396 (5th Cir. 1995). Under McDonnell Douglas, after the plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, the employer must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. Id. (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). If the employer produces any evidence "'which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action,'" then the employer has satisfied [*17]  its burden of production. Id. (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). The burden then shifts to the employee to demonstrate the proffered non-discriminatory reason was mere pretext. A plaintiff may prove pretext either by "showing that a discriminatory reason motivated the defendant or by showing that the proffered reason is unworthy of credence." Moore v. Eli Lilly & Co., 990 F.2d 812, 815 (5th Cir. 1993) (internal citations omitted). To carry that burden, the plaintiff "must produce substantial evidence of pretext." Auguster v. Vermillion Parish Sch. Bd., 249 F.3d 400, 402-03 (5th Cir. 2001).
Defendants have articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Sudduth's termination: Sudduth's behavior during her July 13, 2012 altercation with Salina Carter, which violated HHSC's policies against "threatening behavior" and "workplace violence" and ran afoul of the standards of conduct set forth in HHSC's human resources manual. See Notice of Disciplinary Action at App'x 156-57. Because Defendants have met their burden of production, Sudduth must adduce evidence of pretext—and Sudduth fails to do so. As Defendants point out, Sudduth spends much of her response arguing that Salina Carter did not actually feel threatened during the July 13 incident and that the statements Sudduth allegedly made to Carter were [*18]  only jokes. See Resp. Mot. Summ. J. [#54] at 15-16. Whether true or false, those assertions are not relevant. "The question is not whether an employer made an erroneous decision; it is whether the decision was made with discriminatory motive." Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., 55 F.3d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing Little v. Republic Refining Co., 924 F.2d 93, 97 (5th Cir. 1991)). Even if Defendants incorrectly determined Sudduth violated HHSC policy, that incorrect determination still constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Sudduth's termination. See id. ("Even an incorrect belief that an employee's performance is inadequate constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." (quoting Little, 924 F.2d at 97).
Sudduth does argue Defendants treated other employees accused of "workplace violence" differently than she was treated, which could, under different circumstances, provide competent evidence of pretext. Here, however, the record fails to substantiate Sudduth' s claim. Sudduth points to a "Security Incident Report" which was generated by HHSC when one Tommy Shafighi committed an act of workplace violence, and questions why no "Security Incident Report" was generated concerning Sudduth following the July 13 incident. The Court does not find the lack of a "Security Incident Report" in Sudduth's file persuasive evidence [*19]  of anything. It is certainly not "'enough to support a reasonable inference that the proffered reason [for Sudduth's termination] is false,'" as "'a mere shadow of doubt is insufficient.'" Auguster, 249 F.3d at 403 (quoting Bauer v. Albemarle Corp., 169 F.3d 962, 967 (5th Cir. 1999)). In any event, Sudduth's employee file reflects detailed documentation of the July 13 incident itself and of a subsequent meeting with Sudduth to discuss the incident. See Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] Ex. 9 at App'x 104-05. Sudduth has failed to demonstrate pretext.

D. Sudduth received her requested accommodation
Finally, to the extent Sudduth has asserted a claim under the ADA based upon Defendants' alleged failure to make reasonable accommodations, the Court finds Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on that claim. It is the employee's burden to make her need for an accommodation known to the employer. Jenkins v. Cleco Power, LLC, 487 F.3d 309, 316 (citing Loulseged v. Akzo Nobel Inc., 178 F.3d 731, 735 n.4 (5th Cir. 1999)). Once the employer is on notice of the employee's need for an accommodation, both parties are obligated to engage in a good-faith interactive process to develop a reasonable accommodation. An employer that "demonstrates good faith efforts" to engage in the interactive process and to make a reasonable accommodation is shielded from liability. 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(3). If a breakdown in the process is attributable [*20]  to the employee rather than the employer, there is no ADA violation. Loulseged, 178 F.3d at 736.
Here, while acknowledging she eventually received all of the accommodations she requested, Sudduth complains she did not receive them quickly enough. At least part of the delay, however, was attributable to Sudduth's own failure to gather and submit the required medical information in a timely fashion. The record shows Sudduth did not inform HHSC of her need for an accommodation until August 1, 2011. Joe Madrigal in the HHSC Civil Rights office received Sudduth's accommodation request on August 3, 2011, and on August 4, 2011, informed Sudduth he needed additional documentation to process her request. Sudduth did not provide Madrigal with all of the necessary information until after October 6, 2011. See Mot. Summ. J. [#53-1] Ex. 13 at App'x 139 (October 6, 2011 email from Madrigal to Sudduth noting Sudduth had yet to provide a physician's explanation of her need for accommodations). Additionally, Sudduth does not suggest that Defendants failed to order the necessary equipment once Sudduth's accommodation request was approved, and it is undisputed that while waiting for the equipment to arrive, Defendants provided [*21]  Sudduth with a retail-quality handheld magnifier and enlarged the font size on Sudduth's computer display. Finally, Sudduth does not dispute that she was meeting production and job quotas during the period of time she was waiting for her accommodation equipment.
The record before the Court does not support a claim for failure to accommodate. In short, there is simply no evidence Defendants were unwilling to engage in a good-faith interactive process with Sudduth regarding her request for a reasonable accommodation. Once Sudduth's accommodation request was approved, Defendants ordered Sudduth's requested accommodation equipment, and before the equipment arrived, modified Sudduth's existing equipment to enable Sudduth to perform her duties.10 See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9 ("The accommodation . . . does not have to be the 'best' accommodation possible, so long as it is sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated."). Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Sudduth's failure-to-accommodate claim.

Conclusion
Sudduth has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants terminated her employment because of her disability or failed to make reasonable [*22]  accommodations. Summary judgment in Defendants' favor is therefore warranted.
Accordingly:
IT IS ORDERED that Defendants Texas Health and Human Services Commission and Kyle Janek's Motion for Summary Judgment [#53] is GRANTED;
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff's Opposed Motion to Properly Support a Fact Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) [#58] is GRANTED; and
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Defendants' Opposed Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Summary Judgment Evidence [#56] is DISMISSED.
SIGNED this the 13th day of July 2015.
