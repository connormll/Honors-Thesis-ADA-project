CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [26]
Before the Court is Plaintiff Chris Langer's Motion for Summary Judgment (the "Motion"), filed September 3, 2020. (Docket No. 26). Defendants Golbahar Investments LLC, Akhtar Golbahar, and Alexander Golbahar did not file an opposition.
The Motion was noticed to be heard on October 5, 2020. The Court read and considered the papers on the Motion and deemed the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15. Vacating the hearing is also consistent with General Order [*2]  20-09 arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is DENIED. Plaintiff bears the burden of production to show that the removal of barriers is readily available. Because he presented no evidence on this issue, the Court cannot determine that there are no genuine disputes of material fact.

I. BACKGROUND
On July 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants seeking injunctive relief and statutory damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (the "Unruh Act"), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51-53. (Complaint (Docket No. 1)).
Plaintiff is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair for mobility. (Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ("SUF") ¶ 1 (Docket No. 26-2)). Twenty Twenty Wine (the "Store") is located at or about 2020 Cotner Avenue, Los Angeles, California. (Id. ¶ 3). Defendant Golbahar Investments LLC is currently the owner of the real property on which the Store is located and was so in March 2019. (Id. ¶ 4). Defendants Akhtar Golbahar and Alexander Golbahar are currently the owners and operators of the Store, and were in March 2019 as well. (Id. ¶ 5). The Store is a facility open to the public, a place of public accommodation, [*3]  and business establishment. (Id. ¶ 6).
On March 25, 2019, Plaintiff went to the Store to shop and to assess the business for compliance with access laws. (Id. ¶ 7). Parking spaces are one of the facilities, privileges, and advantages offered by Defendants to patrons of the Store. (Id. ¶ 8). When Plaintiff arrived at the Store, he found that there were several parking spaces offered to patrons of the Store, including a parking space marked and designated as "van accessible" for use by persons with disabilities. (Id. ¶ 10). The disabled parking space surface had cracks and was uneven. (Id. ¶ 11). The access aisle adjacent to this disabled parking space was very narrow and appeared inaccessible to smaller cars, let alone vans. (Id. ¶ 12). There was also no "no parking" lettering in the access aisle. (Id. ¶ 13). Plaintiff needs a van accessible parking space with an eight-foot access aisle to deploy his ramp. (Id. ¶ 2). Because there was no van accessible parking space, he could not park his van in the parking stall. (Id. ¶ 14). Because Plaintiff could not park and safely deploy his ramp, he was deterred from patronizing the Store. (Id. ¶ 15). Plaintiff's experience with the parking caused [*4]  him difficulty, discomfort and frustration. (Id. ¶ 16).
On June 26, 2019, Zion Sapien visited the Store and counted approximately thirteen parking spaces in the Store's parking lot, one of which was marked and designated as "van accessible" for use by persons with disabilities. (Id. ¶ 17). Using a measuring tape, Mr. Sapien found that the access aisle adjacent to the disabled parking space measured approximately 3-4 inches wide. (Id. ¶ 18). There was also no "no parking" lettering in the access aisle. (Id. ¶ 19). The disabled parking space surface had cracks and was uneven. (Id. ¶ 20). Using a digital slope meter, Mr. Sapien found that the disabled parking space had a slope of 11.5% gradient and cross slope of 6.1% gradient. (Id. ¶ 21). The access aisle had a slope of 10.2% gradient and cross slope of 2.9% gradient. (Id. ¶ 22). Mr. Sapien also found that the ramp leading to the entrance had a cross slope of 3.1% gradient. (Id. ¶ 24). The walkway ramp from the sidewalk had a running slope of 17.5% gradient. (Id. ¶ 25). Paths of travel are one of the facilities, privileges, and advantages offered by Defendants to patrons of the Store. (Id. ¶ 23).
Because Plaintiff is an active ADA litigator, [*5]  his efforts to identify law-breaking businesses brings him to Los Angeles on a continuing and ongoing basis. (Id. ¶ 27). When the paths of travel at the Store become accessible to wheelchairs, Plaintiff will return to the Store to assess the business for compliance with disability access laws. (Id. ¶ 29).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the Court applies Anderson, Celotex, and their Ninth Circuit progeny. Anderson, 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
"When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, 'it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.'" C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Restaurants, Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Houghton v. South, 965 F.2d 1532, 1536 (9th Cir. 1992)).

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff asserts two claims for relief: (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and (2) violation of California's Unruh Civil Rights Act (the "Unruh Act"), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51-53. (See generally Complaint). Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment on both claims. (See generally Motion). Plaintiff seeks an order requiring [*6]  Defendants to provide and maintain accessible parking and paths of travel, and judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $8,000. (Id. at 17).
To succeed on a Title III, ADA claim, "a plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendants are private entities that own, lease, or operate a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodations by the defendants because of his disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enterprises, Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2010). "The third element — whether plaintiffs were denied public accommodations on the basis of disability — is met if there was a violation of applicable accessibility standards." Moeller v. Taco Bell Corp., 816 F. Supp. 2d 831, 847 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Chapman v. Pier 1 Imps. (U.S.), Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 945 (9th Cir. 2011)).
Plaintiff's undisputed facts establish that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, that Defendants are private entities that own and operate the Store, and that the Store is a place of public accommodation. (SUF ¶¶ 1, 4, 5, 6). As to the third element, Plaintiff contends he is entitled to summary judgment with respect to two different barriers: (1) the lack of a van accessible parking space; and (2) the lack of an accessible path of travel leading to the entrance of the Store. (Motion at 8-13).

A. Application [*7]  of the California Building Code
Plaintiff argues that the Store's parking lot contains multiple violations of the California Building Code, which is integrated into the ADA. This Court disagrees.
Plaintiff claims that "[u]nder the ADA, the method, color of marking, and length of the parking space are to be addressed by state or local laws or regulations," citing no controlling authority for that assertion. (Motion at 9 n.38). Instead, Plaintiff points to the ADA advisory, which reads: "The method and color of marking are not specified by these requirements but may be addressed by State or local laws or regulations." ADA Standards for Accessible Design at 150 (2010), available at https://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm . This advisory is not part of the actual agency regulation. See 36 C.F.R. § Pt. 1191, Appendix D § 502.3.3.
The Court joins numerous district courts in holding that "non-compliance with the California Building Code does not establish a violation of the ADA." Vogel v. Kafco P'ship, CV 19-656-R (MRWx), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228406, 2019 WL 8108714, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2019) (denying summary judgment for plaintiff on ADA claim for violation of California Building Code); see also Garibay v. Rodriguez, CV 18-9187-PAA (FMx), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228019, 2019 WL 8060795, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2019) (same); Johnson v. Kohanbash Century Plaza, Ltd. Liab. Co., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131881, at *12-13 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2019) (same); Shaw v. Kelley, No. 16-CV-03768-VKD, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21936, 2019 WL 497620, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2019) (same); Johnson v. 42816 Mission Blvd LLC, No. 17-CV-03040-CRB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100926, 2018 WL 3008677, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 15, 2018) (same).
Because violations of the California [*8]  Building Code are not violations of the ADA, Plaintiff are prohibited from referencing or relying upon any violations of the California Building Code at trial.

B. Whether the Removal Barriers are Readily Accessible
"There are three categories of accessibility requirements under Title III of the ADA — the 'new construction' provisions, which apply to public accommodations constructed after January 26, 1993; the 'alteration' provisions, which apply to post-January 26, 1992 alterations to buildings that existed as of that date; and the 'readily achievable' provisions, which apply to unaltered portions of buildings constructed before January 26, 1993." Moeller, 816 F. Supp. 2d at 847. "In existing but unaltered facilities, barriers must be removed where it is 'readily achievable' to do so. The removal of barriers is 'readily achievable' when it is 'easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.'" Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181(9), 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)).
Plaintiff argues that Defendants have the burden to show that removal of barriers is not readily achievable. (Motion at 13-16) (citing Molski v. Foley Estates Vineyard and Winery, LLC, 531 F.3d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir. 2008)). Plaintiff further argues that even if he did have the burden, he has satisfied it because creating designated accessible parking spaces [*9]  and installing ramps are presumed to be readily achievable. (Id. (citing 28 C.F.R. § 36.304(b)(1)(18)). The regulation Plaintiff cites for this proposition does not state that these types of removals are "presumed," and Plaintiff cites no other authority or case law in support of this argument.
The Court disagrees with Plaintiff. Although the Ninth Circuit has yet to decide who has the burden of proving that removal of an encountered barrier is readily achievable, numerous district courts in the Ninth Circuit, including this Court on previous occasions, "have applied the Tenth Circuit's burden-shifting framework, as articulated in Colorado Cross Disability v. Hermanson Fam., Ltd., 264 F.3d 999 (10th Cir. 2001)." Vogel v. Rite Aid Corp., 992 F. Supp. 2d 998, 1010 (C.D. Cal. 2014).
In Colorado Cross, the Tenth Circuit held that the "[p]laintiff bears the initial burden of production to present evidence that a suggested method of barrier removal is readily achievable," and if the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden shifts to the defendant, who "bears the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding [his] affirmative defense that a suggested method of barrier removal is not readily achievable." Id. (citation omitted); see also Wilson v. Pier 1 Imps. (US), Inc., 439 F. Supp. 2d 1054, 1067 (E.D. Cal. 2006) ("It is plaintiff's burden to demonstrate that barrier removal is readily achievable.").
As for Molski v. Foley Estates [*10]  Vineyard and Winery, LLC, that case was decided after a trial, not in the context of summary judgment. 531 F.3d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir. 2008). Additionally, the Ninth Circuit in Molski held that the defendant had the burden of production because the Ninth Circuit wanted to "place the burden on the party with the best access to information regarding the historical significance of the building." Id. (emphasis added). Therefore, the Ninth Circuit held that the defendant in that case, who had "sought the historical designation," possessed "the best understanding of the circumstances under which that designation might be threatened." Id. Plaintiff does not explain why Molski should apply in this action, where no similar factual allegations exist. Accordingly, the Court is unpersuaded that Defendants should bear the burden of production.
Plaintiff offers no evidence to show that the removal of barriers at the Store is readily achievable, instead relying solely on his argument that Defendants bear the burden of production. (See Motion at 16).

IV. CONCLUSION
Because Plaintiff failed to carry his burden to show that removal of the barriers is readily available, the Court cannot determine that there is no genuine dispute as to any [*11]  material fact and that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's ADA claim.
Under California law, an ADA violation constitutes a violation of the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f). Because Plaintiff based his Unruh Act claim on a violation of the ADA, the Court concludes that there are also genuine issues of material fact as to the Unruh Act claim. Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim.
For the foregoing reasons, the Motion is DENIED in its entirety.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
