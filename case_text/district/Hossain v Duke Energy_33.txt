REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
This action arises from Plaintiff's employment with Defendant. Plaintiff, who is proceeding pro se, alleges causes of action pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. § 2000(e) et seq., and the Equal Pay Act (EPA), 29 U.S.C. § 206(d). Presently before the court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 101). Because Plaintiff is proceeding pro se, he was advised pursuant to Roseboro v. Garrison, 528 F.2d 309 (4th Cir. 1975), that a failure to respond to Defendant's motion could result in dismissal of his case. Plaintiff timely1 filed a Response (ECF No. 111), and Defendant filed a Reply (ECF No. 113). All pretrial proceedings in this case were referred to the undersigned pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Rule 73.02(B)(2)(e), DSC. This report and recommendation is entered for review by the district judge.

II. FACTS
On June 17, 2013, Defendant hired Plaintiff for an Engineer II position in the Electrical and Instruments & Controls [*2]  (I&C) Department at its Robinson Nuclear Plant (RNP) located in Hartsville, South Carolina. Pl. Dep. 43 (ECF No. 102-2); Job History Report (ECF No. 102-3). In this role, Plaintiff reported directly to Nuclear Engineering Manager David Shaver. Pl. Dep. 72 & Ex. 5.
Prior to performing independent work as an Engineer II, all newly hired Duke Energy employees, including Plaintiff, must complete required training and demonstrate proficiency in basic procedures and engineering principles by passing a number of courses and examinations. Pl. Dep. 60; Job Description & Training History (ECF No. 102-4). Plaintiff struggled to demonstrate proficiency from the outset of his employment and displayed a troubling lack of understanding as to basic concepts and repeatedly failed the required examinations for his position. Pl. Dep. 63-71 & Ex. 5; Job Description & Training History.
On October 18, 2013, Plaintiff requested a medical leave of absence and applied for short-term disability (STD) for advanced renal failure. STD Approval (ECF No. 102-5). Defendant approved both requests and Plaintiff remained on leave until November 12, 2013. STD Approval. Following his return, Plaintiff resumed his mandatory [*3]  training but continued to struggle with the prerequisites for his position. Pl. Dep. 63-71 & Ex. 5. Plaintiff never passed the Emergency Response Organization (ERO) Exam or the Basic Systems Training Course required to remain employed with Defendant. Pl. Dep. 66-68 & Ex. 5; Job Description & Training History. On December 12, 2013, Plaintiff participated in a performance counseling session with his supervisor, where he was advised that he was not meeting the goals and competencies required for the Engineer II position. Pl. Dep. Ex. 5; Shaver Email (ECF No. 102-7).
The day following his performance counseling session, December 13, 2013, Plaintiff sought a second medical leave of absence for a kidney transplant due to advanced renal failure, which was approved by Defendant. 2013 Medical Notes (ECF No. 102-6); STD Approval. Plaintiff also applied for STD, which was approved by Liberty Mutual (Defendant's third-party administrator under its disability plans), exhausted, and subsequently converted to long-term disability (LTD). Id. Defendant filled his Engineer II position approximately eight months after Plaintiff began his medical leave. Plaintiff did not provide any indication that he [*4]  intended to return to work until approximately 18 months later, on June 23, 2015. Pl. Dep. Ex. 7. At that time, Plaintiff advised Defendant that he was still unable to return to work, but anticipated a medical release sometime between September 2015 and January 2016. Id.
Plaintiff was released to return to work on September 15, 2015.2 Pl. Dep. Ex. 8. By that time, Plaintiff had been out of work for nearly two years and his Engineer II position had been filled. June 24, 2015 Letter (ECF No. 102-8). As a result, Defendant placed Plaintiff on an unpaid leave of absence and allowed him to begin looking for other opportunities within the Company through its Medical Accommodations Program (MAP) process and pursuant to its Employment Policy. June 24, 2015 Letter; Feb. 17, 2016 Letter (ECF No. 102-9); Employment Policy (ECF No. 102-10). Defendant's records indicate that between September 23, 2015, and April 29, 2016, Plaintiff submitted applications for 643 positions posted at various locations throughout Defendant's service territory, which includes the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Of those 64 positions, Plaintiff did not meet the basic qualifications for 18, he was not as [*5]  qualified as other candidates for 13, management decided to cancel the postings for 22, and the remaining 11 postings were put on hold and never filled. Pl. Job Application History (ECF No. 102-11).
As of May 19, 2016, Plaintiff continued to be afforded unpaid leave but had not obtained another position within Duke Energy. May 19, 2016 Letter (ECF No. 102-12). As such, Plaintiff's employment was terminated, effective May 26, 2016. Job History; May 19, 2016 Letter.
On October 13, 2016, Plaintiff filed his Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC. Pl. Dep. 56-57 & Ex. 4. In his Charge, Plaintiff claimed Defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disability by failing to offer him assistance in securing another position upon his release to return to work and by terminating his employment. Pl. Dep. Ex. 4. The EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on November 17, 2017. EEOC Notice (ECF No. 1-1).

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, the moving party bears the burden of showing that summary judgment is proper. Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment is proper if [*6]  the non-moving party fails to establish an essential element of any cause of action upon which the non-moving party has the burden of proof. Id. Once the moving party has brought into question whether there is a genuine dispute for trial on a material element of the non-moving party's claims, the non-moving party bears the burden of coming forward with specific facts which show a genuine dispute for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The non-moving party must come forward with enough evidence, beyond a mere scintilla, upon which the fact finder could reasonably find for it. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The facts and inferences to be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Shealy v. Winston, 929 F.2d 1009, 1011 (4th Cir. 1991). However, the non-moving party may not rely on beliefs, conjecture, speculation, or conclusory allegations to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977 F.2d 872, 874-75 (4th Cir. 1992). The evidence relied on must meet "the substantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at a trial on the merits." Mitchell v. Data General Corp., 12 F.3d 1310, 1316 (4th Cir. 1993).
To show that a genuine dispute of material fact exists, a party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Rather, the party must present evidence supporting his or her position by "citing to particular parts of materials [*7]  in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1)(A); see also Cray Communications, Inc. v. Novatel Computer Systems, Inc., 33 F.3d 390 (4th Cir. 1994); Orsi v. Kirkwood, 999 F.2d 86 (4th Cir. 1993); Local Rules 7.04, 7.05, D.S.C.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Americans with Disabilities Act
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide him with a reasonable accommodation for his disability and subsequently terminated his employment in violation of the ADA. The ADA provides:
No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA places an affirmative obligation on employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals if such accommodation will enable the employee to successfully perform the job in question. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Violations of the ADA occur when the employer fails to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual with a disability. Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n. 11 (4th Cir.2001). "In a failure to accommodate case, a [*8]  plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing '(1) that she was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of her disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation she could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations.'" Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n. 11 (quoting Mitchell v. Washingtonville Ctr. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir.1999)). To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that he is "within the ADA's protected class"; (2) that he was terminated; (3) that, at the time of her termination, he was "performing the job at a level that met [his] employer's legitimate expectations"; and (4) that he was terminated "under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination." Id.
Defendant argues first that Plaintiff cannot show that he falls within the ADA's protected class. For both failure to accommodate and wrongful discharge claims under the ADA, a plaintiff must first show that he is an individual with a disability. For purposes of the ADA, a person is disabled when he has "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; [*9]  (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) [is] ... regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C).
Plaintiff alleged in his complaint and testified in his deposition that the alleged discrimination did not begin until after he was medically released to return to work in September of 2015, after approximately twenty-two months of leave. Compl. p. 6; Pl. Dep. 91. Plaintiff testified that he no longer considered himself disabled as of September 15, 2015. Pl. Dep. 89. However, the question presented concerns Defendant's obligations under the ADA with respect to Plaintiff's renal failure. Therefore, the issue of whether Plaintiff was disabled turns on his renal failure, not his condition after he was released to return to work. Renal failure substantially limits one or more major life activities, see Heiko v. Colombo Sav. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 257 (4th Cir. 2006); Talbot v. Acme Paper & Supply Co., No. JFM-04-1567, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18537, 2005 WL 2090699, at *4 (D. Md. Aug. 30, 2005), aff'd sub nom., 173 F. App'x 219 (4th Cir. 2006), and thus Plaintiff falls within the ADA.
With respect to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim4, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to present sufficient evidence to show that Defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations to allow Plaintiff to remain employed. A reasonable accommodation is a "[m]odification[ ] or adjustment[ ] to the work environment, or to the manner [*10]  or circumstances under which the position held ... is customarily performed, that enable[s] an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position". 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). A "reasonable accommodation ... is by its terms most logically construed as that which presently, or in the immediate future, enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job in question." Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 466 (4th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added). The ADA does "not require an employer to give a disabled employee 'an indefinite period of time to correct [a] disabling condition.'" Id. at 465 (citing Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 280 (4th Cir. 1995)). Courts have held that extended leaves of absence are not reasonable accommodations under the ADA. See Bros. v. STVT-AAI Educ., Inc., No. 7:19-CV-19-BO, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142475, 2019 WL 3987752, at *2 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 22, 2019) (holding that medical leave in excess of five months was not a reasonable accommodation); Collins v. Vernadero Grp., Inc., No. 3:18CV636, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108980, 2019 WL 2718495, at *5 (E.D. Va. June 28, 2019) (holding that termination following eleven months of medical leave with no indication from the employee of a return date did not violate the ADA); McNeil v. Scotland Cty., 213 F. Supp. 2d 559, 570 (M.D.N.C.), aff'd, 53 F. App'x 242 (4th Cir. 2002) (deciding that additional medical leave following expiration of FMLA leave was not a reasonable accommodation where the employee could not indicate when she would be able to return to work); [*11]  Reed v. Maryland, Dep't of Human Res., No. CIV.A. ELH-12-0472, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17761, 2013 WL 489985, at *20 (D. Md. Feb. 7, 2013) (finding no requirement under the ADA to provide an indefinite period of medical leave where, after two months of leave, the employee had not obtained relief from his medical condition and did not indicate when he expected to return) Severson v. Heartland Woodcraft, Inc., 872 F.3d 476, 481-82 (7th Cir. 2017) (determining that two or three months of leave in excess of FMLA leave was not a reasonable accommodation).
Here, Plaintiff was on leave for approximately twenty-two months beginning in December of 2013, in addition to the one month of leave he took in October of 2013. In December of 2013, Plaintiff submitted a letter from his doctor stating that Plaintiff was "in advanced renal failure and need[s] urgent care. Please hold him excused." 2013 Med. Notes. Plaintiff also submitted the letter of a CRNP, who stated that Plaintiff "will need to start Disability for his Renal Failure management. He will need a kidney transplant per our Renal Department." Id. Neither of these letters indicated even an approximate amount of time Plaintiff would require medical leave. Further, on January 29, 2014, approximately six weeks after Plaintiff began his leave, his supervisor reached out to him via email to [*12]  determine his status:
Zee,
How are you doing? I haven't heard from you since you left for your transplant. I hope things went well. I would like to hear from you when you have the opportunity.
Shaver Email (ECF No. 102-7). Plaintiff responded the following day, January 30, 2014:
Dave,
I am with my family member here in Bangledesh, so physiologically feeling much better. I am also following up with a nephrologist and transplant team in Dhaka Bangledesh. I am also in search of a donor. Thanks for your email.
Regards,
Zee
Id. Plaintiff again failed to provide any indication of how long he would be out of work due to his medical condition. Plaintiff's supervisor did not hear from Plaintiff again until his email in June of 2015, after eighteen months of leave, indicating that he anticipated a medical release sometime between September 2015 and January 2016. Because Plaintiff's requested leave was indefinite, Defendant was not obligated under the ADA to await, indefinitely, his medical improvement and restore his employment following an unknown time of recovery. In other words, Defendant's ADA obligations towards Plaintiff as his employer ended when Plaintiff's return to work status remained indefinite. [*13]  In fact, after eighteen months, Plaintiff estimated a return to work approximately three to eight months later. Therefore, given the facts and circumstances in this case, Defendant did not violate the ADA by failing to reassign Plaintiff to another position within the company after being out for work for almost two years.5 Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate.
It cannot be ignored, however, that Plaintiff unsuccessfully applied for sixty-four jobs within Duke Energy following his release to work. Applying the liberal construction afforded pro se litigants, see Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985), these facts give rise to a failure to hire type claim. Failure to hire claims under the ADA are analyzed using the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). See Heiko v. Colombo Savings Bank, 434 F.3d 249, 258 (4th Cir.2006). Plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing " that: (1) he is within the ADA's protected class; (2) he applied for the [vacant] position in question; (3) he was qualified for that position; and (4) the defendants rejected his application under circumstances that give rise to an inference of discrimination."  [*14] Malone v. Greenville Cnty., C/A No. 6:06-2631-RBH, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86520, 2008 WL 4557498, at *9 (D.S.C. Aug.11, 2008) (citing Heiko, 434 F.3d at 258). As stated above, Defendant argues that Plaintiff was no longer disabled at the time he was released by his doctor to return to work, and Plaintiff testified that he no longer considered himself disabled by that time. However, an employee is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA if he has a record of having "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more" major life activities. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C); Rhoads, 257 F.3d at 387 n.11. To show that Defendant had a record of Plaintiff's impairment, he must show that he "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2. Plaintiff clearly has a history of renal failure that required a substantial time away from work.
In this failure to hire context, Plaintiff also bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to show that he was qualified for the positions at issue. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff was qualified for thirteen positions and that eleven positions were never filled. Applying and being rejected for this many positions, in the light most favorable to Plaintiff on the facts presented, creates an inference of discrimination [*15]  for purposes of a prima facie showing. Defendant argues, without evidentiary support, that other applicants were more qualified for thirteen position and fails to present any explanation for why eleven positions were not filled. Thus, it fails to meet its McDonnell Douglas burden of showing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rejecting Plaintiff's applications for these twenty-four positions. Therefore, Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be denied on the record presented.
In sum, with respect to Plaintiff's ADA claims, it is recommended that summary judgment be granted as to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate/wrongful termination claim and denied as to any failure to hire claim.

B. Title VII
On his complaint form, Plaintiff checks the box for Title VII as a basis for jurisdiction in this action. However, he does not check the boxes for race, color, gender/sex, religion, or national origin as a basis for Defendant's alleged discrimination. He checks only the box for disability. Further, in his EEOC Charge Plaintiff fails to reference Title VII and/or alleged discrimination on the basis of any protected category covered by Title VII. Pl. Dep. Ex. 4. "Before filing suit [*16]  under Title VII, a plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies by bringing a charge with the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)]." Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 202 F.3d 234, 247 (4th Cir.2000); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1). The allegations contained in the administrative charge of discrimination generally limit the scope of any subsequent judicial complaint. King v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 538 F.2d 581, 583 (4th Cir.1976) (stating that a subsequent civil suit "may encompass only the 'discrimination stated in the [EEOC] charge itself or developed in the course of a reasonable investigation of that charge'") (quoting Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n v. Gen. Elec., 532 F.2d 359, 365 (4th Cir.1976)); see also Smith v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 202 F.3d 234, 247 (4th Cir.2000) ("A plaintiff's EEOC charge defines the scope of her subsequent right to institute a civil suit."). Only those claims stated in the initial administrative charge, those reasonably related to the original complaint, and those developed by reasonable investigation of the original complaint may be maintained in a subsequent lawsuit. Evans v. Technologies Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 963 (4th Cir.1996) (affirming the district court's dismissal of some of the plaintiff's claims because they were outside the scope of her original EEOC charge and were therefore time barred). Because Plaintiff did not raise claims of discrimination based on race, color, gender/sex, religion, or national origin in his charge of discrimination, or within the present action, [*17]  other than citing to Title VII, summary judgment is appropriate as to any Title VII claim.

C. Equal Pay Act
Plaintiff also mentions the Equal Pay Act in his complaint. The EPA prohibits employers from discriminating "between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees ... at a rate less than the rate at which [they] pay[ ] wages to employees of the opposite sex" for work requiring "equal skill, effort, and responsibility, ... performed under similar working conditions." 29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1)(2000). To establish a prima facie case under the EPA, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that his employer has paid different wages to employees of opposite sexes; (2) that said employees hold jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility; and (3) that such jobs are performed under similar working conditions. Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 189, 94 S.Ct. 2223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974); Fowler v. Land Mgmt. Groupe, Inc., 978 F.2d 158, 161 (4th Cir.1992). Plaintiff did not allege in his complaint any facts sufficient to create a prima facie case under the EPA. Further, in his deposition, Plaintiff admitted that he could not identify any other Engineer II who was paid more money than him. Pl. Dep. 54. Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate on his EPA claim.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons discussed above, it is recommended that Defendant's [*18]  Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 101) be denied as to any ADA failure to hire claim and granted as to all other causes of action. It is further recommended that Defendant's Motion to Compel Mediation (ECF No. 86) be granted.6
