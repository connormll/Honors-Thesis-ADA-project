Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff, Norman Toland, Jr., filed this action [3] against his former employer, AT&T, alleging (1) race discrimination in violation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII") and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("§ 1981"); (2) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"); and (3) a state law tort claim of invasion of privacy. (See First Am. Compl. Counts I-IV.)
This matter is now before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [39]. For the reasons explained below, plaintiff has failed to submit probative evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact over his claims of race and disability discrimination.1 Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that defendant's [*2]  motion for summary judgment [39] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered against plaintiff on his Title VII, § 1981, and ADA claims.
Before turning to the facts, the Court addresses two preliminary items. In the last sentence of the introductory section of its Brief [39-1], defendant requests an award of attorney's fees based on the alleged frivolous nature of this lawsuit. Because that request fails to comply with the requirements of the Local Rules, the undersigned does not address it. See N.D. Ga. L. R. 54.2.
Defendant has also filed a Motion to Strike [61] some of statements contained in Mr. Toland's Affidavit [50-1] and in his Response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts [51] ("R-DSMF"). Motions to strike are governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f), which provides as follows:
Upon motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these rules, upon motion made by a party within 20 days after the service of the pleading upon the party or upon the court's own initiative at any time, the court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (emphasis added).
Because neither Mr. Toland's Affidavit nor [*3]  his R-DSMF were attached to a pleading,2 but were part of a response to a motion for summary judgment, defendant should have filed a notice of objection to the challenged testimony, not a motion to strike. Jordan v. Cobb County, Ga., 227 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1346 (N.D. Ga. 2001). Nevertheless, because the Court may only consider admissible evidence when deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court has reviewed defendant's Motion to Strike and plaintiff's Response [62]. Although no separate Order will issue, as discussed below, the Court rejects certain assertions in plaintiff's Affidavit that contradict his deposition testimony and certain assertions in his R-DSMF that are factually unsupported. In order for the Clerk to terminate that pending motion, the Court GRANTS IN PART defendant's Motion to Strike.

I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
In compliance with Local Rule 56.1(B)(1)-(2), AT&T as movant filed a Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [39-2] ("DSMF"), to which plaintiff filed a response. (See R-DSMF.) The Court accepts as undisputed those proposed facts that plaintiff admits. (Id. ¶¶ 1-2, 4-8, 10-14, 18, 22-24, 32, 34-35, 37, 39, 46, 47, 49, 51, 54-55, 57.)3 When plaintiff denies a proposed fact, the Court reviews the record to determine whether the fact is disputed, and [*4]  if so, whether any dispute is material. Where appropriate, the Court includes facts from its own review of the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record.").

A. Plaintiff's Job as an OPT
Plaintiff, Norman Toland, formerly worked for BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. ("BST") as an Outside Plant Technician ("OPT"). (DSMF ¶ 1; R-DSMF ¶ 1.) The OPT Job Description requires a "valid driver's license and ability to drive vehicle with manual shift in some assignments." (DSMF ¶ 2; R-DSMF ¶ 2.) The OPT Job Description also states that OPTs "may be required to meet DOT rules and regulations including DOT certifications." (DSMF ¶ 2; R-DSMF ¶ 2.)4

B. Plaintiff's DUI and Loss of his CDL
On November 17, 2007, police arrested Mr. Toland and charged him with driving under the influence and failure to maintain lane. (DSMF ¶ 4; R-DSMF ¶ 4.) Mr. Toland pleaded guilty to a DUI less safe on February 20, 2008. (Id.) As a result of the guilty plea, Mr. Toland's Commercial Driver's License ("CDL") was suspended for a year. (DSMF ¶ 5; R-DSMF ¶ 5.) Although Mr. Toland's driver's license was also suspended, he obtained a "hardship [*5]  permit" that allowed him to drive to work and for work. (DSMF ¶ 5; R-DSMF ¶ 5.)
At that time, Mr. Toland worked under the supervision of Horace Hill in Tucker, Georgia. (DSMF ¶ 8; R-DSMF ¶ 8.) On February 20, 2008, Mr. Toland reported to Mr. Hill that he had lost his CDL. (DSMF ¶ 6; R-DSMF ¶ 6.)5 Mr. Hill told Mr. Toland that the DUI would not be a problem because the type of vehicle he was assigned to drive at the time did not require a CDL to operate. (DSMF ¶ 9 (first sentence); see also Hill Decl. [39-6] ¶ 6.)6 Mr. Hill did not report to his Area Manager, Bob Summers, that Mr. Toland had lost his CDL. (DSMF ¶ 9 (second sentence).)7

C. Plaintiff's Medical Leave and Return Under a New Supervisor
On March 28, 2008, Mr. Toland's physician placed him on medical leave that lasted until June 30, 2008. (DSMF ¶¶ 11-12; R-DSMF ¶¶ 11-12.)8 In May 2008, while he was out on leave, BST transferred plaintiff to the supervision of Euford Herring in Chamblee, Georgia. (Herring Decl. [39-5] ¶ 4; see also DSMF ¶ 14; R-DSMF ¶ 14.) Mr. Herring's group worked out of BST's Buford Highway office. (Herring Dep. [54] 9-12.)
On Thursday, June 26, 2008, Mr. Herring received a request from BST's disability [*6]  administrator regarding whether he could accommodate Mr. Toland with the following restrictions: "Sedentary duty with restricted use of the injured arm, no lifting over 10 pounds. He can stand & walk as needed." (Herring Decl. ¶ 7.) Mr. Herring avers that he informed BST's disability carrier that he could accommodate Mr. Toland's restrictions. (Id. ¶ 8.) In further support of that averment, defendant submitted a supplemental Declaration from Mr. Herring, which attached an email he sent to BST's disability carrier reflecting his consent to plaintiff's return to light duty work. (Supp. Herring Decl. [60-1] ¶ 11, Ex. A, bates no. BST 0882.)
Mr. Herring intended to accommodate Mr. Toland's restrictions by permitting him to ride along with three new OPTs who had learners' permits and were in training to obtain CDLs. (DSMF ¶ 15.) Federal and state law require that an individual holding a CDL be in the truck with an individual driving under a CDL learner's permit. (DSMF ¶ 16 (citing 49 C.F.R. § 383.23 [37-1]; 49 C.F.R. § 383.1 [37-2]; O.C.G.A. § 40-5-142 [37-3]; and O.C.G.A. § 40-5-146 [37-4]).)9
Plaintiff disputes whether Mr. Herring actually intended to accommodate his restrictions. (R-DSMF ¶ 15.) For example, when Mr. Toland returned to work on Monday, June 30, 2008, his right arm was in a sling and he was restricted from using his right arm. (DSMF ¶ 13; R-DSMF ¶ 13; see also supra note 8.) Plaintiff claims that when Mr. Herring first saw him that morning, he called him a cripple who "can't do anything." (R-DSMF ¶ 15; Toland Aff. ¶¶ 18-19.) In a transcript [50-2] of conversations that Mr. Toland secretly recorded (hereafter "Secret Tr."), Mr. Toland comments to Mr. Herring about their meeting the previous day, during which Mr. Herring had referred to plaintiff as cripple. Mr. Herring responds as [*8]  follows: "No, I was just kidding when I said you were a cripple. But it's just—it's a requirement of the job that you have a CDL." (Secret Tr. 34.)
In any event, Mr. Toland informed Mr. Herring for the first time on June 30, 2008, that he did not have a CDL. (DSMF ¶ 18; R-DSMF ¶ 18.) In response, Mr. Herring told Mr. Toland that he could not ride with the OPT trainees because he did not have a valid CDL. (Herring Decl. ¶ 9.)10 Mr. Herring subsequently spoke with his manager, Jeffery Kee, regarding what action to take with respect to Mr. Toland since his CDL had been suspended. (DSMF ¶ 20.)11 Mr. Kee in turn consulted with BST's human resources department and learned of the Loss of Driver's License Policy (the "LDL Policy") (discussed infra). (Kee Dep. [56] 57-58.)
Before advising Mr. Herring of his decision, Mr. Kee called Area Manager Summers to determine why Mr. Toland had not been previously placed on unpaid leave under the LDL Policy. (DSMF ¶ 30.)12 Mr. Summers advised Mr. Kee that he was unaware that Mr. Toland had lost his CDL. (Id.) Plaintiff's former supervisor, Mr. Hill, had not reported plaintiff's loss of his CDL in February 2008 because he was unaware of the LDL Policy. (DSMF ¶ 31.)13
While waiting for a decision from Mr. Kee and BST's human resources department about what action to take, Mr. Herring found other light-duty work for Mr. Toland to perform consistent with his restrictions. (DSMF ¶ 21.)14 For approximately two to three hours, Mr. Herring had Mr. Toland sit at the entry gate to the Chamblee location to open it for contractors delivering cable reels. (DSMF ¶ 22; R-DSMF ¶ 22.)15 Thereafter, at around noon, Mr. Herring transported Mr. Toland to a cul-de-sac in Dunwoody, Georgia to wait for other members of Mr. Toland's work crew, while Mr. Herring went to a meeting. (DSMF ¶ 23; [*10]  R-DSMF ¶ 23.) Mr. Toland waited for approximately 45 minutes for them to arrive. (DSMF ¶ 24; R-DSMF ¶ 24.)16

D. Plaintiff's Placement on Leave for Lack of a CDL
On June 30, 2008, after consulting with BST's human resources department, Mr. Kee informed Mr. Herring that Mr. Toland could not hold the OPT title without a CDL. (DSMF ¶ 25.)17 Mr. Kee also informed Mr. Herring that Mr. Toland would have to be placed on leave pursuant to the LDL Policy. (Id.)
Defendant submits several proposed facts about the LDL Policy that parrot its terms. Inexplicably, plaintiff disputes them. (Compare DSMF ¶¶ 26-28, with R-DSMF ¶¶ 26-28.) Rather than expend effort explaining why those denials lack merit, the Court lists the LDL Policy's salient provisions below:
Policy Statement A valid driver's license is required for all employees who operate vehicles or are required to drive as a condition of employment. Employees who operate vehicles in connection with performing their job duties, and whose license has been suspended or revoked, must notify their supervisor at the beginning of the next business day. . . .
If the employee has complied with the requirement to notify the supervisor in a timely [*11]  manner, attempts will be made to assign the employee to non-driving duties, if available, or to place the employee in a position that does not require driving. A reasonable time period based on the needs of the business, but not to exceed 90 days, will be allowed for such assignments or for employees to regain their licenses or obtain a valid hardship permit. . . .
Staffing Issues • The company is not obligated to find a non-driving position for an employee whose driver's license has been revoked or suspended. . . .
Manager Responsibility • Step One: Reasonable efforts should be made to assign represented employees to non-driving duties within the job title. . . .
• Step Two: If non-driving duties are not available, a supervisor may place the employee on a 30-day departmental, unpaid leave of absence. . . .
• Step Three: . . .
❑ A represented employee may be placed on unpaid personal time off for no more than 60 days. . . .
• Step Four: If the employee has not regained the driver's license or secured a non-driving position or duties, he or she will be dismissed.
(Kee Decl. [39-7] Ex. 2, Bates nos. BST 0794-0798 (emphasis added).)18
BST applies the LDL Policy to CDLs, where a CDL is a requirement [*12]  of the job title. (DSMF ¶ 29.) Plaintiff denies DSMF ¶ 29. (See R-DSMF ¶ 29 (citing Toland Dep. 24-25; Moss Dep. [52] 70-71; and Toland Aff. ¶ 17).) However, those multiple record citations fail to support that denial. For example, the pages cited from plaintiff's deposition address only his report to supervisor Hill that he had lost his CDL. The pages cited from Union Steward Moss's deposition address Seth Denman, an OPT who transferred into the bargaining unit without a CDL, and who had to wait for an undetermined period of time to obtain one. Ms. Moss does not discuss the LDL policy or its application. Finally, the paragraph cited from plaintiff's Affidavit avers that, after Mr. Toland initially reported the loss of his CDL to Mr. Hill, that supervisor replied that there was no requirement to have a CDL to perform an OPT position. However, this averment does not aid plaintiff because, as discussed supra, it is undisputed that Mr. Hill was unaware of the LDL Policy; thus, he would not have known how defendant applied that policy to loss of a CDL. Accordingly, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 29 admitted.
OPTs in Mr. Herring's group drove either a T-36 truck, a T-42 truck, or a T-60 truck. (DSMF [*13]  ¶ 17.) All three trucks qualify as commercial vehicles under DOT regulations and Georgia law because they weigh more than 26,001 pounds when loaded; thus, they may only be operated by drivers with valid CDLs. (Id.) Plaintiff disputes DSMF ¶ 17 in part, asserting that not all trucks operated by OPTs in Mr. Herring's group required the driver to possess a CDL. (See R-DSMF ¶ 17 (citing unspecified paragraphs of the Gibson Decl. [50-3], the Kee Dep. 4-20,19 and the Hill Dep. [55] 55-56).20) In his Declaration, Mr. Gibson avers that when he worked for Mr. Herring, six of the ten trucks available for use by OPTs were pickup or small bucket trucks that did not require the operator to have a CDL. (Gibson Decl. ¶ 10.) Moreover, he observed two Caucasian OPTs (Clint Cook and Jeremy Clark) who worked for Mr. Herring drive U Body or small bucket trucks, neither of which required a CDL to operate. (Id. ¶¶ 7-8.) For reasons made clear below, any dispute over the types of vehicles operated by OPTs in Mr. Herring's group is not material. On July 2, 2008, Mr. Herring informed Mr. Toland that he could not hold the OPT title without a CDL. (DSMF ¶ 35; R-DSMF ¶ 35.)21 Mr. Herring offered to accompany Mr. Toland [*14]  to see the judge to help obtain reinstatement of his CDL. (DSMF ¶ 36; R-DSMF ¶ 36 (admitting offer was made).) However, Mr. Toland refused Mr. Herring's offer because he believed that the court would not reinstate his CDL for one year. (DSMF ¶ 36.)22
There is some confusion about what plaintiff claims Mr. Herring said next on July 2, 2008. Defendant asserts that Mr. Herring informed plaintiff that he had a maximum of 90 days to find a new job or obtain his CDL, or his employment would be terminated. (DSMF ¶ 38 (citing Toland Dep. 66).)23 Although this proposed fact is supported by the record cited, plaintiff denies it with a factual assertion also supported by the record—that Mr. Herring told him that he had 30 days to regain his CDL and 90 days to obtain a new title. (R-DSMF ¶ 38 (citing Toland Dep. 65).) In any event, this dispute over contradictory portions of Mr. Toland's own testimony is immaterial because, as shown below, defendant waited 90 days before terminating plaintiff's employment.
Defendant contends that it could not unilaterally transfer Mr. Toland to another job in lieu of placing him on leave, because any job must be bid in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement [*15]  ("CBA") with plaintiff's union, the Communication Workers of America ("CWA"). That CBA required Mr. Toland to bid on any job in which he was interested to avoid violating the seniority rights of other employees. (DSMF ¶ 43.) Plaintiff denies that contention, asserting that defendant could legally transfer him to another job to comply with the ADA, and that Mr. Kee recognized the supremacy of the ADA over the CBA. (R-DSMF ¶ 43.) The Court will address an employer's duty of reasonable accommodation under a CBA infra.
With regard to transfers, the CBA provides as follows: "In matters relating to assignment of hours and vacations, layoffs, rehiring after layoffs, voluntary transfers, involuntary transfers and promotions, seniority shall govern . . . ." (See CBA excerpts [39-5] Ex. 3, Art. 13.01, bates no. BST 0192.) Under the CBA, job vacancies within the bargaining unit are advertised via the staffing system. (Id., Art. 12.01A, bates no. BST 0172.) Employees must submit a request for a transfer via the staffing system. (Id., Art. 12.01B, bates nos. BST 0173-0174.) Mr. Herring did not have access to the staffing system to search for non-management jobs. (DSMF ¶ 44.)24
Mr. Toland never applied [*16]  for any other jobs at BST. (DSMF ¶ 45.) He never contacted the CWA to ask about bidding on other jobs. (Id.) Between July 2, 2008, and his termination, Mr. Toland never came to the Work Center to search for jobs. (Id.) Plaintiff denies all three parts of DSMF ¶ 45 (see R-DSMF ¶ 45), but those denials are argumentative. He provides only excuses for why he did not apply for another job, and fails to refute the undisputed fact that he never applied for any other job with defendant.25 Thus, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 45 undisputed.

E. Plaintiff's Termination
On September 30, 2008, Mr. Herring telephoned Mr. Toland and informed him that his employment was being terminated. (DSMF ¶ 39; R-DSMF ¶ 39.) On October 1, 2008, BST terminated plaintiff's employment because his inability to obtain a CDL rendered him unqualified for the OPT job title. (DSMF ¶ 40.) Although plaintiff disputes the preceding proposed fact with arguments that BST's reason was pretextual (see R-DSMF ¶ 40), the undisputed fact is that BST articulated the foregoing reason in support of its termination decision. Therefore, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 40 admitted.
Mr. Toland is not aware of any OPT in Mr. Herring's group who was allowed [*17]  to continue working as an OPT without a valid CDL. (DSMF ¶ 54; R-DSMF ¶ 54.) Defendant did not hire anyone to replace Mr. Toland. (DSMF ¶ 47; R-DSMF ¶ 47.)
Mr. Kee made the decision to terminate plaintiff's employment. (DSMF ¶ 42.) Plaintiff denies that proposed fact, asserting that defendant's interrogatory answers list Mr. Herring as a decision maker, and that his former supervisor, Mr. Hill, was responsible for deciding whether to accommodate disabled employees in his work group or send them home. (R-DSMF ¶ 42.) Mr. Kee avers that he was the final decision maker. (Kee Decl. ¶ 22.) Because an interrogatory response stating that Mr. Herring was "involved in the decision" (see Def.'s Supp. Resp. Pl.'s First Interrog. No. 19 [50-4]) does not contradict Mr. Kee's averment, and because what Mr. Hill may have done with persons under his supervision is irrelevant to identifying the person who made the discharge decision here, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 42 admitted.
At the time he made the decisions to place plaintiff on leave and to terminate his employment, Mr. Kee was unaware that any supervisor had allegedly made derogatory comments about Mr. Toland's disability. (DSMF ¶ 60.)26 Plaintiff never [*18]  heard Mr. Kee or Mr. Hill say anything derogatory or negative about his restrictions or disability. (DSMF ¶ 57; R-DSMF ¶ 57.)
Neither Mr. Kee nor Mr. Herring made or overheard any racist remarks, statements or comments to or about Mr. Toland. (DSMF ¶ 59.)27 Mr. Toland also never heard any supervisors make any racist slurs or comments during the time that he worked in either supervisor Hill's group or supervisor Herring's group. (DSMF ¶ 58.) Plaintiff denies the preceding proposed fact. (See R-DSMF ¶ 58 (citing Toland Aff. ¶ 45).)28 In his Affidavit, plaintiff avers that he heard some unidentified BST managers making racial slurs in 2007 and 2008. (Id.) That assertion contradicts the following excerpt from plaintiff's deposition:
Q. Let's focus on the 2007, 2008 time period when you were working first in Mr. Hill's group and later in Mr. Herring's group. Did you ever hear any of your supervisors or managers at that time make any kind of racist slurs or comments or remarks?
A. Not that I can recall.
(Toland Dep. 133.) Plaintiff cannot create a fact dispute with a sham affidavit that contracts without explanation his clear deposition testimony. Van T. Junkins & Assocs., Inc., 736 F.2d at 657. Therefore, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 58 admitted. [*19]  Even if that paragraph of plaintiff's affidavit is not a sham, it fails to create a fact dispute because race-based comments by some unidentified managers who had nothing to do with plaintiff's termination are immaterial.

F. Assignment of Work to OPTs and Accommodation
The managers who supervised plaintiff assert that the OPT position is a "one-man" job; besides training, the only instances when two OPTs are allowed in a truck is when one is driving and the other is in the lift bucket, but because of safety reasons, both individuals must have a valid CDL. (DSMF ¶ 41 (citing Kee Decl. ¶¶ 7-10 and Herring Decl. ¶ 29).) Plaintiff disputes this proposed fact (see R-DSMF ¶ 41) with numerous assertions supported by various record citations. However, as discussed below, none of those citations create a material fact dispute.
First, plaintiff claims that Mr. Herring admitted that OPTs without valid CDLs ride as passengers in trucks. (R-DSMF ¶ 41 (citing Herring Dep. 32-34).) However, he made no such admission at the cited pages of his deposition. Instead, Mr. Herring testified that when Mr. Toland returned to work in June 2008, his work group had only one OPT with a CDL license, Terry [*20]  Wessenger, but two or three OPTs with CDL learner's permits who could only drive if Mr. Wessenger rode with them. Mr. Herring pointed out that, if Mr. Toland had ridden in a commercial vehicle while Mr. Wessenger drove, then none of those OPTs holding learner's permits could do anything.
Second, plaintiff claims that it was "common" in 2008 for OPTs to work in two-man teams, where one OPT drives the truck and the other OPT rides as a passenger. (R-DSMF ¶ 41 (citing Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 6-12 and Hill Dep. 56-57).) Only two paragraphs of Mr. Gibson's Declaration (¶¶ 6, 9) actually make a point close to that asserted in R-DSMF ¶ 41, but Mr. Gibson makes clear that he was working for Mr. Hill and not for Mr. Herring when he observed OPTs working in two-man crews. Thus, while two-man crews may have been common in Mr. Hill's group, there is no evidence that they were common in Mr. Herring's. Moreover, the cited pages of Mr. Hill's deposition only provide that the T-40 trucks in his group were usually driven by James McDaniels or Ricky Alford. He says nothing about OPTs working in two-man teams.
Finally, Mr. Toland asserts that several OPTs under the supervision of Mr. Herring and Mr. Kee worked [*21]  in two-man teams, with one OPT driving and the other OPT riding as a passenger. (R-DSMF ¶ 41 (citing Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 6-12 and Kee Dep. 44-45).) However, nothing in Mr. Gibson's Declaration makes any contention about OPTs under the supervision of Mr. Herring and Mr. Kee working in two-man teams. Although Mr. Kee testified in the cited pages of his deposition transcript that two OPTs are assigned to a large bucket truck (one as driver and the other to operate the bucket), both had to possess valid CDLs in case of emergency.29 Given plaintiff's failure to controvert defendant's proposed fact with record evidence, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 41 admitted.
Defendant asserts that it could not have made any accommodations to the OPT position that would have permitted Mr. Toland to perform it without a CDL. (DSMF ¶ 48 (first sentence).) Plaintiff denies that proposed fact, asserting that defendant had "accommodated" other OPTs who had no CDLs. (R-DSMF ¶ 48 (citing Moss Dep. 70-71, 73 and Gibson Aff. ¶ 11).) However, the Court has placed the word accommodation in quotation marks because plaintiff did not use it in the manner typically seen in ADA cases. For instance, there is no proof that the [*22]  persons plaintiff claims received an accommodation—Seth Denman (Caucasian) and Jared Gibson (African American)—were disabled, i.e., suffering a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.30 Union Steward Moss testified that Mr. Denman transferred into her CWA local as an OPT and worked for an indeterminate time period before obtaining a CDL.31 Mr. Gibson, who became an OPT in October 2007, avers that, for an initial period of weeks after he came under Mr. Herring's supervision in June 2008, he did not yet have his CDL, but Mr. Herring allowed him to operate vehicles that did not require a CDL. Because plaintiff's denial has nothing to do with accommodation under the ADA, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 48 admitted. Defendant also shows that it has never permitted an employee to retain the OPT title without a valid CDL. (DSMF ¶ 48 (second sentence).) Plaintiff denies that proposed fact. (See R-DSMF ¶ 48 (citing Gibson Aff. ¶¶ 7, 11; Moss Dep. 70-71, 73;32 and Secret Tr. 37-38).) However, none of those citations support that denial. For example, Mr. Gibson avers that he saw an OPT named Clint Cook (Caucasian) drive a truck that did not require a CDL to operate,33 and [*23]  that before he (Gibson) received his CDL, Mr. Herring allowed him to drive a truck that did not require a CDL to operate. Unlike plaintiff, neither of these employees (Messrs. Cook and Gibson) lost their CDLs. Finally, plaintiff's statements in the secretly recorded conversation with Mr. Herring shows that Mr. Toland had worked six months as an OPT without a CDL. Mr. Herring responded that it was fine to have no CDL during training, but once an OPT obtains a CDL and then loses it, he cannot retain the position. That testimony supports defendant's proposed fact. Thus, the Court deems the second sentence of DSMF ¶ 48 admitted.
During the time that Mr. Toland's arm was in a sling, he was unable to climb poles, climb ladders, go into manholes, operate a T-40 truck, or operate a cable reel. (DSMF ¶ 50.) Beginning in June 2008, Mr. Toland's physician instructed him not to drive. (Id.) As of August 2010, Mr. Toland's physician still had not advised him that it was acceptable to drive. (Id.) Plaintiff does not controvert the first two sentences of DSMF ¶ 50; therefore, the Court deems them admitted. Plaintiff takes issue only with the last sentence of DSMF ¶ 50. (See R-DSMF ¶ 50 (citing [*24]  Toland Dep. 101-03 and Toland Aff. ¶¶ 38-41).) Mr. Toland claims that he has not seen the physician discussed in his deposition (Dr. Myers) since January 2009 because he cannot afford to go back, but Dr. Myers had advised him that, once he completed physical therapy (which occurred in March 2009), driving would be within his physical restrictions. In construing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds that Mr. Toland's physician cleared him to drive as of March 2009.
The ability to drive, safely operate commercial vehicles, climb poles34 and ladders, crawl into manholes and small spaces, and load equipment (that weighs up to 120 pounds) onto commercial vehicles are all essential functions of the OPT job. (DSMF ¶ 52 (citing OPT Job Description, filed as Toland Dep. Ex. 1).) Plaintiff denies this proposed fact (see R-DSMF ¶ 52), but as shown below, that denial is ineffective.
The OPT Job Description contains the following sixteen job responsibilities:
1. Provides consistent, respectful and professional internal/external customer care. Initiates and maintains an open line of communications to ensure all customers receive the highest level of customer satisfaction [*25]  possible.

(Toland Dep. Ex. 1; also filed as Kee Decl. Ex. 1; see also DSMF ¶ 2 (OPT Job Description requires ability to drive vehicle and may require the OPT to meet DOT rules and regulations).)
In the deposition excerpt cited to support his denial of DSMF ¶ 52, plaintiff testified that he rarely performed the above-listed items numbered 3, 5, 6, 11, 14, and 16. (See R-DSMF ¶ 52 (citing Toland Dep. 45-48).) Rarely means that plaintiff sometimes performed the duties described in those items. Moreover, plaintiff cites no evidence that the sixteen items listed on the OPT Job Description do not accurately describe the essential functions of the OPT position. Indeed, by implication plaintiff admits that he regularly performs [*27]  items numbered 1-2, 4, 7-10, 12-13, and 15. Therefore, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 52 admitted.
A number of the duties performed by OPTs require both hands in order to operate equipment or perform work safely. (DSMF ¶ 53 (first sentence).) Plaintiff takes no exception to that proposed fact; therefore, the Court deems the first sentence of DSMF ¶ 53 admitted.
Defendant shows that it could not have made any accommodations to the OPT position that would have permitted Mr. Toland to perform its essential functions with just one arm. (DSMF ¶ 53 (second sentence).)35 Plaintiff denies this proposed fact. (R-DSMF ¶ 53 (citing Toland Dep. 45-48).)36 He claims that BST accommodated an OPT with an arm restriction similar to his. (Id. (citing Moss Dep. 55-56).) Specifically, Union Steward Moss testified that she had heard about an unidentified OPT who broke his arm; because management felt that it was not safe for him to drive a big truck, he was allowed to ride as a passenger in another OPT's truck. However, another union steward told Ms. Moss about the employee who broke his arm. (Moss Dep. 58-59.) Thus, Ms. Moss's testimony about this employee is inadmissible hearsay. See Fed. R. Evid. 801. Even if her testimony were [*28]  not hearsay, Ms. Moss lacks the requisite personal knowledge. See Fed. R. Evid. 602. She was so unfamiliar with the situation that she did not know the employee's name and was unsure of his race (although she believed him to be African American). (Moss Dep. 57.) Moreover, there is no evidence that this employee with the broken arm was similarly situated to Mr. Toland, i.e., he had a CDL but lost it. Given these considerations, the Court deems the second sentence of DSMF ¶ 53 admitted.
Neither Mr. Kee nor Mr. Herring has ever permitted any OPT to work on the job with his dominant arm in a sling. (DSMF ¶ 55.) Plaintiff admits that proposed fact (see R-DSMF ¶ 55), but cites Union Steward Moss's testimony to support his assertion that another BST manager allowed an OPT to work with his dominant arm in a sling. (Id. (citing Moss Dep. 55-56).) Because that testimony is inadmissible for the reasons discussed supra, the Court deems DSMF ¶ 55 admitted.
DSMF ¶ 56 is in two parts; thus, the Court considers those two parts—and plaintiff's responses to them—separately below.37 First BST contends that it has never paid two OPTs to perform a one-man job. (DSMF ¶ 56 (first sentence).) Mr. Toland denies that assertion. [*29]  He contends that BST would not have to pay two employees to perform a one-man job, but would have to pay two employees to perform a two-man job, which he claims was a common practice for OPTs working under supervisors Hill and Herring. (R-DSMF ¶ 56 (citing Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 6-12; Hill Dep. 56-57; Kee Dep. 44-45; and Toland Aff. ¶ 31).) Again, the supporting citations fail to support the denial. Mr. Gibson's Declaration avers that when he worked for Mr. Hill, he saw OPTs working in two-man teams, with one driving and the other operating the bucket. (Gibson Decl. ¶ 6.) The cited excerpt from Mr. Hill's deposition testimony recounts that of his nine employees, two drove T-40 trucks while seven drove bucket trucks. Mr. Key testified that there is only one situation when two OPTs ride in the same truck, which is when BST utilizes a T-42 truck. In that instance, one OPT drives and the other is a passenger until they reach the work site, at which time the passenger operates the bucket. However, Mr. Kee explained that both OPTs were required to have CDLs in case of an emergency that required the bucket operator to drive the truck. Finally, plaintiff's Affidavit avers that, when he worked as [*30]  an OPT, it was common for OPTs to work on two-man teams, with one OPT riding as a passenger and the other operating the bucket. (Toland Aff. ¶ 31.) Because nothing plaintiff cites controverts defendant's assertion that it has never paid two employees to perform a one-man job, the Court deems the first sentence of DSMF ¶ 56 admitted.
In the second part of DSMF ¶ 56, defendant asserts that it would have imposed an undue hardship to permit Mr. Toland to perform the OPT position with another person in the vehicle as an accommodation. Defendant provides two reasons supporting this assertion. First, this accommodation would have violated the law or company policy, as both individuals in a commercial vehicle are required to have a CDL in case either needs to drive. Second, such an accommodation would have required it to pay two employees to perform a one-man job. (Id.)
Plaintiff denies the foregoing assertion. (See R-DSMF ¶ 56.) Mr. Toland first contends that it would not have been a hardship for defendant to allow him to ride as a passenger in a vehicle, since it was common for OPTs to do so. (Id. (citing Gibson Decl. ¶¶ 6-12; Hill Dep. 56-57; Kee Dep. 44-45; and Moss Dep. 55-56).) Mr. [*31]  Gibson avers that when he worked for Mr. Hill, some OPTs worked in two-man teams, with one driving the truck and the other operating the bucket. (Gibson Decl. ¶ 6.) Second, Mr. Hill's deposition testimony recounts that of his nine employees, two drove T-40 trucks while seven drove bucket trucks. He makes no statement about whether OPTs rode as passengers. Third, in Mr. Kee's deposition, he testified that there is only one situation when two OPTs ride in the same truck. Specifically, when operating a T-42 truck, one OPT drives and the other is a passenger until they reach the work site, at which time the passenger operates the truck's bucket. However, Mr. Kee explained that both OPTs were required to have CDLs in case of an emergency which required the bucket operator to drive the truck. Finally, the excerpt from Union Steward Moss's deposition is the same inadmissible hearsay discussed supra, i.e., that someone told her that an unidentified employee broke his arm and was allowed to ride as a passenger in a bucket truck.38 As the foregoing summary makes clear, plaintiff cites no record evidence to refute defendant's contention that requiring it to place another employee in a vehicle with [*32]  plaintiff as an accommodation to help him perform the essential functions of the OPT position would constitute an undue hardship. Accordingly, the Court deems the second portion of DSMF ¶ 56 admitted.

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
A "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of "informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Rice-Lamar v. City of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 232 F.3d 836, 840 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). Those materials may include "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials" F e d . R . C i v . P . 56(c)(1)(A). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991).
The non-moving party is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence "showing [*33]  that there is a genuine issue for trial" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the non-movant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). If in response the non-moving party does not sufficiently support an essential element of his case as to which he bears the burden of proof, summary judgment is appropriate. Rice-Lamar, 232 F.3d at 840. "In determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist, [the Court] resolve[s] all ambiguities and draw[s] all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party." Id. (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255); see also Hammer v. Slater, 20 F.3d 1137, 1141 (11th Cir. 1994) ("Once the moving party has met its initial burden by negating an essential element of the non-moving party's case, the burden on summary judgment shifts to the non-moving party to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. For issues on which the non-moving party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the non-moving party must either point to evidence in the record or present additional evidence sufficient to withstand a directed verdict motion at trial based on the alleged evidentiary deficiency.") (citation and quotation marks omitted).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court's function is not to resolve issues of material [*34]  fact, but rather to determine whether there are any such issues to be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251. The applicable substantive law will identify those facts that are material. Id. at 248. Facts that are disputed, but which do not affect the outcome of the case, are not material and thus will not preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id. Genuine disputes are those in which "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. For factual issues to be "genuine," they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). When the record as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-movant, there is no "genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Plaintiff's Race Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff's claims arise under both Title VII and § 1981.39 Title VII and Section 1981 "'have the same requirements of proof and use the same analytical framework.'" Shields v. Fort James Corp., 305 F.3d 1280, 1282 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 1998)). Accordingly, the Court reviews and applies Title VII's analytical framework in addressing both the Title VII and § 1981 claims.
In a Title VII case, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against him. Green v. Sch. Bd. of Hillsborough County, Fla., 25 F.3d 974, 978 (11th Cir. 1994). The issue on summary judgment is whether Mr. Toland has carried his burden of producing evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue as to a material fact on his disparate treatment claim. Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment, 132 F.3d 635, 641 (11th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff can carry this burden either by producing (1) direct evidence of discrimination motivating the employment decision, (2) circumstantial evidence sufficient to allow an inference of discrimination, or (3) statistical proof of a pattern of discrimination. Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287, 1293 n.8 (11th Cir. 1999).
Because there is no direct or statistical proof here, the Court evaluates plaintiff's disparate treatment claim under the circumstantial evidence framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004). Under that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination, which varies slightly depending on the type of claim asserted. See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie [*36]  case, an inference of discrimination is raised, and the burden of production then shifts to the defendant to rebut the inference of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. This burden is "exceedingly light." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1564 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). If the defendant meets this light burden, then the inference of discrimination is erased, and the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff "to demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Id. at 1565. Despite this burden-shifting framework, the "ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.40
Plaintiff alleges that defendant terminated his employment because of racial bias. A plaintiff establishes a prima facie case in this situation by showing that he (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) was qualified to do the job; and (4) was replaced or otherwise lost a position to a person outside the protected class. Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024. Alternatively, the fourth element may be satisfied if a plaintiff shows that [*37]  he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside the protected class. Maniccia v. Brown, 171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1999).
Plaintiff satisfies elements one (he is African American) and two (he was discharged). Defendant disputes plaintiff's ability to establish element three—qualifications—because he had lost his CDL. See Reid v. Aransas County, Civ. Action No. C-10-144, 805 F. Supp. 2d 322, 2011 WL 1337108, at *6 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 6, 2011) ("Plaintiff was not 'qualified for his position' during the period that his license was suspended or otherwise inactive, and thus cannot make out his prima facie case"); Roberson v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc., No. 07-2140-JAM-JFM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111836, 2009 WL 4715859, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2009) (plaintiff failed to establish qualifications element of her prima facie case because she lacked requisite license).
The undisputed material facts are that defendant applies the LDL policy to CDLs where a CDL is a requirement of the job title, and that defendant requires its OPTs to have CDLs. (See DSMF ¶ 29 (deemed admitted).) Thus, when plaintiff lost his CDL, he was no longer qualified to hold the OPT title under defendant's application of its policies.
Plaintiff argues that the OPT Job Description merely requires a valid driver's license, and states only that OPTs "may" be required to have a CDL. He points to numerous trucks [*38]  in defendant's fleet that do not require a CDL to operate. Finally, Mr. Toland argues that the LDL Policy provides that the defendant will attempt to find an employee who loses his driver's license non-driving duties,41 but that defendant never attempted to do that for him. He would not have had to drive if defendant had assigned him to work as the passenger in a two-man crew. (Pl.'s Br. 18-19.)
Although the OPT Job Description could be read in the manner plaintiff suggests, it is undisputed that defendant interprets it as requiring all OPTs to hold CDLs; moreover, defendant interprets the LDL Policy to apply to holders of CDLs. Thus, when plaintiff lost his CDL, it was reasonable for defendant to disqualify him from his OPT position. Plaintiff's assignment to a two-man crew would not have been possible, since defendant reasonably required both the driver and bucket operator to hold CDLs in case of emergency. An employer is entitled to interpret its policies as it sees fit, and where that interpretation is reasonable, no inference of discriminatory intent arises. Wu v. Southeast-Atl. Beverage Corp., 321 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1334 (N.D. Ga. 2004); see also Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comms., 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984) ("Title VII does not take away an employer's right to interpret its rules as it chooses, and [*39]  to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules.")42
It is also undisputed that defendant has interpreted its policies in an even-handed manner. Plaintiff concedes that no OPT in Mr. Herring's group has been allowed to continue working without a valid CDL. (DSMF ¶ 54; R-DSMF ¶ 54; see also DSMF ¶ 48 (deemed admitted).) This concession means that plaintiff cannot satisfy the fourth element of his prima facie case in the alternative manner, by showing that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees outside the protected class.43
Despite that concession, plaintiff argues that defendant allowed Caucasian employees to operate vehicles that did not require a CDL. (Pl.'s Br. 16-20.)44 These employees include: Bryan Matheson, Clint Boone, Seth Denman, and James Culbreath. (Id. at 17.) Plaintiff has failed, however, to show how these employees were similarly situated to him. See Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam) ("To show that employees are similarly situated, the plaintiff must show that the 'the employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects. . . . It is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different [*40]  ways.'") (quoting Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1562).
In other words, plaintiff has failed to show that these OPTs lost their CDLs but were allowed to continue working in that job title. Mr. Matheson never served as an OPT and had no CDL. (Matheson Dep. [53] 19, 28.) Mr. Herring could not identify anyone named Clint Boone. (Herring Dep. 38, 70.) Plaintiff may have meant to list Clint Cook instead of Clint Boone.45 Mr. Herring avers that Mr. Cook became an OPT in 2008 and obtained his CDL in August 2008. Unlike plaintiff, he never had his CDL suspended. (Supp. Herring Decl. ¶ 7.) Seth Denman obtained the OPT title in early 2008 and was in training to obtain his CDL, which he received in July 2008. (Herring Dep. 37-38; Supp. Herring Decl. ¶ 5.) Mr. Denman's CDL was never suspended. Finally, Mr. Culbreath, who is African American, became an OPT in early 2008 and obtained his CDL in July 2008. (Supp. Herring Decl. ¶ 6.)46 Mr. Culbreath's CDL was never suspended.
These undisputed facts show that the three OPTs plaintiff identified as comparators—Messrs. Cook, Denman, and Culbreath—were not similarly situated to him. Instead, their employment pattern followed what was typical for OPTs. They lacked a CDL when they obtained [*41]  the OPT title; thus, the Company provided them time for training.47 Until these OPTs completed their training, defendant placed them in trucks that do not require a CDL to operate.48 None of the persons plaintiff has identified were like him—none lost their CDLs.
Plaintiff's apparent complaint is that he should have been assigned a truck that did not require a CDL to operate until he regained his CDL or assigned as a passenger in a two-man crew. However, that is neither his choice nor this Court's choice to make. That is a decision left to management's discretion. If an employer interprets its policies to require (1) the suspension of OPTs who lose their CDLs, (2) valid CDLs for all OPTs even if CDLs are not necessary to operate all trucks, and (3) valid CDLs for OPTs riding as passengers because they might be required to drive the truck,49 those interpretations must be respected by this Court unless they are applied in a discriminatory manner. See McNorton v. Ga. Dept. of Transp., 619 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1380 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (court's role is not to second-guess the wisdom of an employer's decisions as long as the decisions are not racially motivated). As the Eleventh Circuit has emphasized, federal courts
"do not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines [*42]  an entity's business decisions. No matter how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high-handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers, the [civil rights laws] do[] not interfere."
Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (quoting Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted in original)); see also Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 1999) ("We have repeatedly and emphatically held that a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law. We are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair.") (citation omitted).
Because plaintiff has submitted no probative evidence showing that defendant applied its interpretation of its policies in a discriminatory manner, summary judgment should be entered for defendant on plaintiff's Title VII and § 1981 claims, given his failure to establish a prima facie case. See Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., 135 F.3d 1428, 1433 (11th Cir. 1998) ("summary judgment against the plaintiff is appropriate if he fails to satisfy any one of the elements of a prima facie case").50

B. Plaintiff's ADA Claim51
The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . discharge . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).52 The ADA further provides that the term "discriminate" [*43]  includes "not making reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of the otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Employing those twin concepts, plaintiff contends that AT&T terminated him because of his disability, and that AT&T refused to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. (Pl.'s Br. 7-8.) He thus makes two discrete claims of disability discrimination: (1) disparate treatment and (2) failure to make reasonable accommodation. Because these claims have some common elements, the Court addresses them together.
In the absence of direct evidence,53 an ADA disparate treatment claim employs the familiar burden-shifting framework used in Title VII actions. Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). A plaintiff establishes a prima facie ADA disparate treatment case by showing that he (1) is disabled; (2) is a qualified individual; and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability.54 Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam); Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1226.
Establishment of a prima facie case raises an inference of discrimination, causing the burden [*44]  of production to shift to the defendant to rebut that inference by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1564. This burden is "exceedingly light." Id. If the defendant successfully rebuts the plaintiff's prima facie case, "the presumption of discrimination is eliminated." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024. To survive summary judgment, the plaintiff must then "'come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.'" Id. (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997)).
In contrast to a disparate treatment claim, a failure to make reasonable accommodation claim requires no discriminatory animus and occurs when a covered entity fails to fulfill its affirmative duty to "make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability" without demonstrating that "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Thus, while disparate treatment claims are concerned with policing an employer's actions based on invidious [*45]  discriminatory intent, '[t]he reasonable accommodation requirement is best understood as a means by which barriers to the equal employment opportunity of an individual with a disability are removed or alleviated.'" Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630, app. (2003)). A claim that an employer failed to provide reasonable accommodation to a known disability employs a different evidentiary framework than a disparate treatment claim. 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272 [WL] at *9; see also Jones v. Ga. Dep't of Corr., No. 1:07-CV-1228-RLV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2008) (applying Nadler's holding that McDonnell Douglas framework does not apply to reasonable accommodation claim) (Vining, J.).
A plaintiff who asserts that his employer failed to make reasonable accommodation for his known physical or mental limitation must show that (1) he is disabled, (2) he is otherwise qualified, and (3) a reasonable accommodation was not provided. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). Once a plaintiff has shown that he is an otherwise qualified disabled individual and that a defendant has not provided a reasonable accommodation, a defendant must provide a reasonable accommodation unless he can assert undue hardship as an affirmative defense. Willis v. Conopco Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 286 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam).55
The disparate treatment prima facie case and the failure to accommodate claim share two common elements. In both, the plaintiff must [*47]  show that he is (1) disabled and (2) a qualified individual. Defendant concedes for purposes of this motion that Mr. Toland was disabled. (Def.'s Br. 15 n.5.)56 However, defendant contends that plaintiff was not a qualified individual. The Court agrees.
Determining whether an individual is "qualified" for a job is a two-step process. First, does the individual satisfy the prerequisites for the position; does the individual have sufficient experience and skills, an adequate educational background, or the appropriate licenses for the job? Second, can the individual perform the essential functions of the job, either with or without reasonable accommodations? The plaintiff has the burden of proving that reasonable accommodations were available.
Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); see also Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522, 1527 (11th Cir. 1997) (driver's license was legitimate requirement for job of crime scene investigator).
It is undisputed that all OPTs who have completed training must maintain a valid CDL. When Mr. Toland lost his CDL, he was no longer qualified for the OPT position because he could no longer operate commercial vehicles. There was nothing defendant could do to reinstate plaintiff's CDL. (See DSMF ¶ 48 (deemed admitted).) [*48]  Thus, plaintiff's claim fails at the first step of the qualified individual analysis.
But, even if plaintiff had not lost his CDL, his claim fails at the second step of the qualified individual analysis. Plaintiff cannot show that he could perform the essential functions of the OPT position, either with or without reasonable accommodation. Specifically, plaintiff's doctor had restricted him from driving. As noted supra, even construing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, Mr. Toland could not drive from the date he returned to work (June 30, 2008) through March 2009.57 Thus, he could not perform one of the OPT job's essential functions—driving—for about nine months.
The only accommodation that could have allowed plaintiff to continue working as an OPT was to assign him to be the passenger in a two-man crew. Of course, that proposed accommodation was not reasonable because AT&T requires that the non-driving OPT have a valid CDL. (DSMF ¶ 41 (deemed admitted).) However, even if that requirement did not exist, plaintiff still could not have performed the essential functions of the OPT position.58 According to the OPT Job Description (quoted supra pages 28-30), the ability to [*49]  drive, safely operate commercial vehicles, climb poles and ladders, crawl into manholes and small spaces, and load equipment (that weighs up to 120 pounds) onto commercial vehicles are all essential functions of the OPT job. (DSMF ¶ 52 (deemed admitted).) Plaintiff admits that he was required to perform all of the duties listed on the OPT Job Description, even if he may have performed some of them only rarely. AT&T was not required to modify the OPT's essential functions. See Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305 ("ADA does not require [an employer] to eliminate an essential function of [the plaintiff]'s job").
Moreover, a number of those OPT duties require both hands in order to operate equipment or perform work safely. (DSMF ¶¶ 50, 53 (deemed admitted).) Defendant could not have made any accommodations to the OPT position that would have permitted Mr. Toland to perform it with one arm.59 (Id. ¶ 53.) Plaintiff has presented no probative evidence suggesting otherwise.60 Because plaintiff is "unable to perform an essential function of his [OPT] position, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a 'qualified individual' and, therefore, not covered under the ADA." Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305.
In sum, because plaintiff cannot establish that he was a qualified individual, his claims of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate fail as a matter of law. Accordingly, summary judgment should be entered for defendant on plaintiff's ADA claims. See McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 682 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (because plaintiff failed to show a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he was a qualified individual, court affirms district court's grant of summary judgment on ADA failure to accommodate claim); Boykin v. Honda Mfg. of Ala., 288 F. App'x 594, 597 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (entry of summary judgment on disability discrimination claim [*51]  proper where plaintiff failed to show he a qualified individual with a disability).
In the interest of providing the District Court with a full Report, the undersigned continues the analysis of both of these claims.
With regard to the disability discrimination claim, even assuming that plaintiff was a qualified individual (i.e., the second element of his prima facie case), he fails to establish the third element of his prima facie case. Specifically, he has no probative evidence that he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability. The most compelling evidence supporting this failure of proof comes from plaintiff's own lips. In the secret recording he made of a conversation with Mr. Herring, plaintiff articulated his belief about his employer's motivation for his termination as follows: "But y'all not letting me come to work, it ain't because of my injury, it's because I don't have my CDL." (Secret Tr. 41.) Because plaintiff has submitted no probative evidence suggesting that his torn rotator cuff was the reason for his termination, summary judgment should be entered for defendant on plaintiff's disability discrimination claim. See Reed, 206 F.3d at 1063 ("The burden is on the plaintiff [*52]  to prove by a preponderance of the evidence all elements of the prima facie case.").61
With regard to plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim, even assuming plaintiff was a qualified individual, he fails to establish the third element of that claim, which requires plaintiff to show that no reasonable accommodation was provided. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. Under the EEOC's interpretive guidance to its ADA regulations, "[I]t is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App. § 1630 (interpretive guidance to § 1630.9) (2011). Moreover, "The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam).
Plaintiff contends that he asked Mr. Herring to find any assignment or position he could do on June 30, 2008, as a reasonable accommodation. (Toland Aff. ¶ 28.) The undisputed material facts show that Mr. Herring attempted to do so initially, but plaintiff's disclosure that he had no CDL meant that plaintiff could not perform the task that Mr. Herring had envisioned. [*53]  Plaintiff nevertheless argues that, as a reasonable accommodation, defendant should have unilaterally transferred him to the positions of Temporary OPT, Premises Technician, Customer Service Representative, or Sales Associate. (Pl.'s Br. 15.)
The ADA lists as examples of reasonable accommodations "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). As the list indicates, the ADA may require the employer to "reassign," i.e., transfer, the disabled employee to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation.
However, none of these proposed transfers were a reasonable accommodation. There is no evidence that the essential functions of the Temporary OPT position were any different than the essential functions of the normal OPT position. The difference was in the word "temporary." The Temporary OPTs working for Mr. Kee were employed, as the title suggests, on a short-term basis and were assigned to drive pickup trucks to perform OPT work. (Kee Dep. 30-34.)
Moreover, two of the other jobs (Customer Service Representative [*54]  and Sales Associate) are governed by the CBA under which plaintiff worked, while the other job (Premises Technician) is governed by another CBA. (DSMF ¶ 46; R-DSMF ¶ 46.) Defendant could not have simply transferred plaintiff into one of these jobs as a reasonable accommodation because of the potential impact on the seniority rights of other bargaining unit employees. See Davis, 205 F.3d at 1306 ("The ADA does not require accommodations . . . that contravene the seniority rights of other employees under a collective bargaining agreement."); see also U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 394 (2002) (to show that a requested accommodation conflicts with the rules of a CBA's seniority system is ordinarily to show that the accommodation is not reasonable).
As discussed above, the burden was upon plaintiff to bid for any of these positions under the provisions of the CBA. With his seniority, plaintiff likely would have received one of them. (Herring Dep. 61.) However, for some inexplicable reason, Mr. Toland failed to make any bids. Thus, any blame in this matter lies with plaintiff, not defendant. Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that summary judgment be GRANTED for AT&T on plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated [*55]  above, plaintiff fails to create a triable issue of material fact on his race and disability discrimination claims. Therefore, the undersigned
GRANTS IN PART defendant's Motion to Strike [61]; and
RECOMMENDS that defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [39] be GRANTED.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO ORDERED and RECOMMENDED, this 20th day of April, 2011.
