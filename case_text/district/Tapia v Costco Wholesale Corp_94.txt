Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS — COURT ORDER
Before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco"). (Docket No. 13.) Plaintiff Samuel Tapia, Jr. ("Plaintiff") has filed an Opposition (Docket Nos. 14, 20 ("Opp'n")), to which Costco has filed a Reply (Docket No. 25). Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the Court finds that this matter is appropriate for decision without oral argument.

I. Background

A. Plaintiff's Employment
Plaintiff was hired by Costco on April 30, 2015, to work at the Northridge warehouse. (App. of Exs. to Costco's Mot. for Summ. J. ("Costco's Exs."), Ex. 1,1 36.) During his time working for Costco, Plaintiff worked at the front end of the store, then in the food court, and finally as a stocker. [*2]  (Id. at 57, 59.) Hourly employees at the Northridge warehouse, including Plaintiff, are members of Teamsters Local Union 896. (Id. at 49.) Therefore, the terms and conditions of Plaintiff's employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) entered into between Costco and the union. (See Costco's Exs., Ex. 22 ("CBA"); Decl. of Chantal Kupelian in Supp. of Mot. ("Kupelian Decl.") ¶ 23; See also Tapia Depo., 153.) Under the CBA in effect during Plaintiff's employment, non-probationary employees may be discharged after "a prior verbal corrective consultation on record and a written corrective consultation, or two (2) written corrective consultations of a related or similar offense." (CBA, Art. IV(a).) One such offense is unsatisfactory work performance. (Id., p. 101.) Costco uses the term "corrective consultation" (CC) to describe a disciplinary write-up issued at a unionized Costco warehouse. (Kupelian Decl. ¶ 4.) In her deposition, Chantal Kupelian ("Kupelian"), the Northridge Costco Warehouse Manager, represented that Costco usually issues one verbal and two written CCs before termination, depending on the violation. (Kupelian Depo., 21-22.)

B. Plaintiff's First CC
While Plaintiff [*3]  worked in the front end as a cart pusher, one of his supervisors said that Plaintiff was a "great and excellent worker." (Tapia Depo., 58-59.) However, Plaintiff was then reassigned to the food court. (Id. at 59.) On August 4, 2015, while working in the food court, Plaintiff received his first CC for unsatisfactory work performance. (Id. at 89; Costco's Exs., Ex. 3.) This was documented as a verbal consultation. (See Costco's Exs., Ex. 3.) According to the CC, Plaintiff had failed to complete closing procedures including cleaning tasks, and failed to notify management that he was unable to complete those tasks. (Id.) The CC further stated, in bold, "It is understood that failure to correct the above may result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination." (Id. (emphasis omitted).) Plaintiff's only dispute with his first CC was that his training was inadequate to enable him to complete the task in the time allowed. (Tapia Depo., 92, 94.)

C. Plaintiff's Second CC
Plaintiff was then assigned to the position of stocker. (Id. at 80.) In that position, Plaintiff was usually assigned to the sundries area. (Id.) A stocker's job duties include ensuring that pallets of merchandise in his assigned aisles [*4]  were fully stocked, that each item had proper signage displaying its price, and that the aisles were swept and free of trash. (Id. at 78-80.) On December 23, 2015, Plaintiff was issued a second CC for unsatisfactory work performance, specifically for failing to fully sweep and clean his area. (See Costco's Exs., Ex. 4.) This also constituted a verbal consultation. (Id.)
On December 29, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a statement to management challenging this CC. (Costco's Exs., Ex. 5.) Plaintiff explained that he had checked his area multiple times to confirm that it was clean, and that any trash was in the produce area, for which he was not responsible. (Id.) Plaintiff asserted that Robert Armstrong ("Armstrong"), a manager at Costco, made a mistake blaming him. (Id.) Plaintiff also complained about how Armstrong treated Plaintiff. (Id.) In particular, Plaintiff asserted that Armstrong had told Plaintiff he could still be fired despite completing his probationary period, told Plaintiff to stop chewing gum, and asked Plaintiff to remove his hat and sweater. (Id.) Plaintiff complained that Armstrong pushed Plaintiff to do more work faster than was possible, and told Plaintiff he was moving slowly. ( [*5] Id.)
Plaintiff then discussed this second CC with Kupelian, who had recently begun working as the Northridge Warehouse Manager. (See Kupelian Decl. ¶ 1.) Kupelian agreed to remove the December 23, 2015, CC from Plaintiff's file because, as Kupelian explains, she had never worked with Plaintiff before and "wanted to give him another chance to show [her] he could do the job and get his work done." (Id. at ¶ 4.)

D. Plaintiff's Injury and Disability
On December 31, 2015, while wrapping items on a pallet with plastic shrink wrap, Plaintiff tripped and fell, hitting his back, shoulder, elbow, and backside. (Tapia Depo., 125.) He got up, kept working, and did not report the accident until he felt some pain while driving home. (Id. at 111.) He then called Costco. (Id. at 111-12.) Because he was already off-duty and the warehouse was closed the following day, Plaintiff was told to fill out the workplace injury paperwork on January 2, 2016, which he did. (Id. at 112, 114.) Costco had Plaintiff speak by phone with a nurse, who advised Plaintiff to take over-the-counter pain medicine and apply ice. (Id. at 124-26.) The nurse called Plaintiff to follow-up the next week. (Id. at 128-29.) Though Plaintiff requested to see a doctor, the nurse did not refer him to [*6]  one. (Id. at 126, 129.) Plaintiff took no time off work and was able to perform all of his regular duties until his termination, though he asserts he was in pain. (Id. at 130, 133.) Plaintiff told the supervisor almost every day that his back hurt, and most of his supervisors told him to "just do whatever [he could]." (Id. at 134-37, 139.) As before the injury, Armstrong continued to tell Plaintiff to "pick up the pace," though, according to Plaintiff, this became "more excessive[]" after Plaintiff's injury. (Id. at 138.) Plaintiff attests that two doctors told him that he was permanently disabled, and Plaintiff asserts that this disability arose from his fall on December 31, 2015.4 (See id. at 67, 233.) Plaintiff stated that he "cannot bend" and "cannot lift heavy stuff," and that he is "limit[ed] from doing what [he] was doing 100 percent before." (Id. at 233.)

E. Plaintiff's First Grievance
Plaintiff filed a grievance with his labor union on January 4, 2016. (Tapia Depo., 163; Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 7.) Union grievances such as this are forwarded to Costco's Warehouse Manager. (See Kupelian Depo. 158.) In this grievance, Plaintiff made most of the same allegations as those contained in his December 29, 2015, statement about his first CC. (Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 7.) Plaintiff [*7]  further asserted that he felt "discriminated, targeted, left out and harassed by [Armstrong]" because Armstrong did not allow Plaintiff to wear beanies or sweaters, but allowed other employees to do so. (Id.) Plaintiff also stated that his injury was the result of Armstrong pushing him to work faster. (Id.)

F. Plaintiff's Third CC
Plaintiff received a third CC for unsatisfactory work performance on January 11, 2016, for leaving trash on the floor and not having all of the necessary price signs displayed in his assigned area. (Tapia Depo., 166; Costco's Exs., Ex. 6.) This was documented as a written CC, and was marked "related" to Plaintiff's first CC. (Costco's Exs., Ex. 6.) Plaintiff admits he was missing at least one sign and that there was trash on the floor, but claims the trash was left there by other employees after he had already swept. (Tapia Depo., 168.) Again, the CC warned, "It is understood that failure to correct the above may result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination." (Costco's Exs., Ex. 6 (emphasis omitted).) Plaintiff was told that if he had any further violations of a similar nature within six months, he would receive another CC and be suspended [*8]  pending termination. (Id.; Tapia Depo. 167-68.)

G. Plaintiff's Fourth CC, Second Grievance, and Termination
On January 25, 2016, Michael Peppard ("Peppard"), a manager at the Northridge warehouse, noticed trash on the floor in the frozen foods aisle. (Docket No. 13, Attach. 4, Decl. of Michael Peppard in Supp. of Mot. ("Peppard Decl.") ¶¶ 1-2.) Peppard contends that he saw Plaintiff sweeping nearby, asked him to clean the trash on the floor, and Plaintiff nodded in response. (Id. at ¶ 2.) When Peppard walked by the same aisle approximately 25 minutes later, he observed that it had not been swept. (Id. at ¶ 3.) Peppard looked for Plaintiff to inquire why the area had not been cleaned, and learned that Plaintiff had left for the day. (Id.) Peppard relayed the incident to Kupelian. (Id. at ¶ 4.)
On January 27, 2016, Kupelian called Plaintiff into her office, told Plaintiff she believed Peppard's version of what happened, gave Plaintiff a fourth CC for unsatisfactory work performance, and suspended him. (Tapia Depo., 173; See Costco's Exs., Ex. 7.) This CC was marked "related" to Plaintiff's first and third CCs. (Costco's Exs., Ex. 7.) Plaintiff challenged the CC and filed a grievance with [*9]  his union on January 29, 2016, alleging he never heard Peppard and that the trash had been left by other employees. (Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 9; Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 10.)
On January 25, 2016, Kupelian sent her supervisor a request for approval to terminate Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 3; Kupelian Depo., 15-16, 21.) In her email, Kupelian stated: "Attached is a term request. This guy is a piece of Sh@#!!!!! Since I've been here, we've issued THREE counseling notices for work performance. He did not agree with one of them, so I threw it out. He has ZERO sense of urgency . . . should have been gone a while back. // Thank you." (Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 3.) Kupelian's supervisor approved the termination request. (Kupelian Depo., 20-21.) In deposition, Kupelian admitted that she "probably" used profanity in the warehouse. (See id. at 72.)
On February 1, 2016, Plaintiff returned to work, at which time Kupelian then brought Plaintiff into a meeting with Armstrong, Peppard, and Plaintiff's union steward. (Tapia Depo., 181, 183.) Kupelian told Plaintiff that he had three CCs in his file (not including the one she had removed at his request) and that Plaintiff was being terminated for unsatisfactory work performance. (See id. at 181, 183, 189;  [*10] see also Costco's Exs., Ex. 8.)

H. Procedural History
Plaintiff initiated this action in Los Angeles County Superior Court on October 8, 2016, alleging claims for (1) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, (2) harassment based upon disability, (3) discrimination based upon disability, (4) failure to accommodate, (5) failure to engage in the interactive process, (6) retaliation, (7) failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and retaliation, and (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). (Docket No. 1, Attach. 1.) Costco removed the action to this Court on November 2, 2016, asserting that this Court has jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. (Docket No. 1.) Presently before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment, in which Costco contends that each of Plaintiff's claims is legally deficient.

II. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is proper where "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "[T]he burden on the moving party may be discharged [*11]  by 'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Musick v. Burke, 913 F.2d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir. 1990). The moving party must affirmatively show the absence of such evidence in the record, either by deposition testimony, the inadequacy of documentary evidence, or by any other form of admissible evidence. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265. The moving party has no burden to negate or disprove matters on which the opponent will have the burden of proof at trial. See id. at 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265.
As required on a motion for summary judgment, the facts are construed "in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). However, the nonmoving party's allegation that factual disputes persist between the parties will not automatically defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A "mere 'scintilla' of evidence will be insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment; instead, the nonmoving party must introduce some 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.'" Fazio v. City & Cnty. of S.F., 125 F.3d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202). Otherwise, summary judgment shall be entered.

III. Discussion

A. Harassment Based Upon Disability
Plaintiff alleges that he was harassed because [*12]  of his disability while working at Costco. (Opp'n 15.) California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits harassment of an employee based on physical disability. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(j)(1). To demonstrate harassment, a plaintiff must prove: "(1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she was subjected to harassment because she belonged to this group; and (3) the alleged harassment was so severe that it created a hostile work environment." Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1244 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 121, 129, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 132, 980 P.2d 846 (1999)).
Plaintiff's harassment claim is based on the following alleged conduct of Armstrong and Kupelian: "(1) . . . making light of Tapia's disability, denying his requests for treatment and acting as though he were not injured even though it knew he was; (2) ordering Tapia to return to work even though he was disabled and unable to; (3) yelling at Tapia to 'pick up the pace'; (4) ordering Tapia to remove his beanie and sweater prior to working in the freezer, even though non-disabled stockers were able to wear beanies and sweaters while working in the freezer; (5) calling Tapia an 'old man'; (6) telling Tapia that if he actually worked and broke a sweat, he would not need a sweater; . . . (7) subjecting Tapia to curse words"; and criticizing Plaintiff's [*13]  work performance. (See Opp'n 13-15 (internal citations omitted).)
However, as Costco correctly points out, the evidence Plaintiff cites does not support each of these contentions. (Reply 2-3.) In particular, while Plaintiff argues that Costco made light of Plaintiff's disability, denied his request for treatment, acted as though Plaintiff were not injured, and ordered Plaintiff to return to work, the evidence cited does not support such conclusions. (See Reply Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law ("SUF") 124-35 (Plaintiff's evidence).)
Additionally, a manager's criticism of work performance is not actionable as harassment, so directions to work faster, without more, are not actionable. See Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1245; Joseph v. Target Corp., No. 2:12-cv-01962-KJM-EFB, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8130, at * 24 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2015). Furthermore, Kupelian's possible use of profanity in the warehouse or in her email cannot support a harassment claim, as "the use of profanity by itself is not an unlawful practice under Title VII or FEHA. The profane language must be so abusive as to alter the working conditions, and it must be driven by a discriminatory motive." See Allen v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs. Silicon Valley, Case No. 12-1656 PSG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96434 at *11 (N.D. Cal. 2013)  [*14] (citing Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998); Lyle v. Warner Bros. Telev. Prod., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 273-74, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006)). Here, Kupelian's use of profanity could not have altered Plaintiff's working conditions because Plaintiff has presented no evidence that he learned of it before his termination or that such language was "driven by a discriminatory motive." Thus, these allegations do not support Plaintiff's harassment claim.
Costco further argues that Plaintiff cannot show that any of Armstrong or Kupelian's conduct was because of Plaintiff's disability. (Mot. 5.) Plaintiff admits his disability arose on December 31, 2015, and there is no dispute that prior to that date, Plaintiff was not disabled. (See Tapia Depo. 233, 238.) However, the conduct Plaintiff complains of began before Plaintiff was injured, as demonstrated in Plaintiff's December 29, 2015, statement and January 4, 2016, grievance. (Pl.'s Exs., Exs. 5, 7.) Thus, this conduct could not have been motivated by Plaintiff's later-developed disability. Further, while the Opposition asserts that "non-disabled stockers were able to wear beanies and sweaters," no evidence establishes whether or not the other employees were disabled. Plaintiff even admitted in his deposition that he remained unaware of Armstrong's [*15]  motivation for treating Plaintiff differently than other employees. (See Tapia Depo., 202-03.) For these reasons, and in the absence of any evidence to support a finding of an illegally discriminatory motive, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a triable issue as to whether he was harassed because of his disability.
As a further ground for judgment in its favor, Costco argues that the alleged conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to give rise to a harassment claim. (Mot. 5-6.) To establish actionable harassment, a plaintiff must prove persistent, sustained conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile work environment. Miller v. Dep't of Corrs., 36 Cal. 4th 446, 462, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77 (2005). "[A]cts of harassment cannot be occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial[;] rather the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature." Muller v. Auto. Club of So. Cal, 61 Cal. App. 4th 431, 446-47, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 573 (1998). On the record before this Court, no reasonable factfinder could find the conduct at issue to be severe or pervasive.
For these reasons, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's harassment based on disability claim.

B. Discrimination Based Upon Disability
Next, Plaintiff asserts that he was discriminated against because of his [*16]  disability. (Opp'n 16.) The FEHA expressly prohibits discrimination against any person based on physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. California courts apply the three-part burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), to analyze FEHA disparate treatment claims. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354-55, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). McDonnell Douglas puts the initial burden on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case. Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1242. The prima facie elements of a FEHA discrimination claim are as follows: "(1) [the plaintiff] is a member of a protected class; (2) she was performing competently in the position she held; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination; and (4) some other circumstances that suggest a discriminatory motive." Id.
Once a prima facie case is shown, a presumption of discrimination arises and the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the adverse employment action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Stating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason negates the presumption of discrimination and shifts the burden back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason is mere pretext for discrimination.
Id. (internal citations omitted) (citing Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355).
When an employer moves for summary judgment, however, 'the burden is [*17]  reversed . . . because the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden.' 'Thus, [t]o prevail on summary judgment, [the employer is] required to show either that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of [the] FEHA claim or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment.' If the employer meets its burden, the discharged employee must demonstrate either 'that the defendant's showing was in fact insufficient or . . . that there was a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing.'
Id. (internal citations omitted) (citing Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745-46 (9th Cir. 2011)). A plaintiff's suspicions based on conjecture and speculation that discrimination occurred is insufficient to create a genuine, triable issue of material fact, and thus is insufficient to establish pretext and avoid summary judgment. See Carmen v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1028 (9th Cir. 2001).5
Costco asserts that Plaintiff fails to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination. (Mot. 8-9.) Costco argues that Plaintiff's multiple CCs constituted violations of Costco's established rules, and demonstrated that Plaintiff's performance was incompetent. (Mot. 8.) Plaintiff presents his own deposition testimony that when [*18]  he was a front end assistant, the initial position he held at Costco, his supervisor "said [he] was a great and excellent worker." (Tapia Depo., 58-59.) Plaintiff was a front end assistant before his receipt of any CCs, and thus, even if his prior supervisor made such a statement, it does not establish that Plaintiff was performing his tasks satisfactorily at the time of his termination. See Warch v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510, 514 (4th Cir. 2006) ("An employee may be qualified when hired, but could fail either to maintain his qualifications or, more commonly, to meet his employer's legitimate expectations for job performance."). As Costco correctly observes, "[a]lthough [Plaintiff] generically claims his CCs were undeserved, he admitted at deposition that he failed to wash the dishes, failed to put out the required signs and failed to sweep by the coolers, the events giving rise to his three CCs." (See Reply 4; Tapia Depo. 92, 168-69, 173.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has not created a disputed material issue of fact, and Costco is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Even if Plaintiff could make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Costco asserts that it has provided a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. [*19]  (Mot. 9.) If non-discriminatory, an employer's reason for adverse action "need not necessarily have been wise or correct." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358. Costco presents evidence that Plaintiff had three CCs for unsatisfactory work performance in his record, and that the CBA provided that unsatisfactory work performance could be grounds for discharge. (Id.; See Tapia Depo., 89, 166, 173; CBA, p. 101.6) Costco's showing is sufficient to demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff.
This shifts the burden back to Plaintiff to demonstrate either that Costco's showing is in fact deficient or that there is a triable issue of fact material to Costco's showing. First, Plaintiff argues that Costco did not follow its disciplinary policy because Plaintiff disputes receiving a verbal CC or second written CC. (Opp'n 14.) However, the only evidence offered in support of this argument is Kupelian's deposition testimony, in which she recalled meeting with Plaintiff twice prior to his termination. (See SUF 110-11 (citing Kupelian Depo., 24-26, 36).) This fails to create a genuine dispute of how many CCs Plaintiff received. Plaintiff admits receiving four CCs, one of which was later removed from [*20]  his record. (Tapia Depo., 89, 146, 166, 173.) Of those remaining in his record, the first CC was verbal, while the last two were written. (Costco's Exs, Exs. 3, 6, 7.) Each CC was for unsatisfactory work performance and identified as related. (Costco's Exs, Exs. 3, 6, 7.) Thus, Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine dispute of material fact to rebut Costco's showing of a legitimate basis for Plaintiff's termination.
For these reasons, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's discrimination claim.

C. Retaliation
Plaintiff asserts that he was retaliated against because "[h]e complained of harassment and discrimination," "was subjected to adverse employment actions," and "a causal link between the two exists." (Opp'n 19.) California courts apply the familiar McDonnell Douglas framework to analyze retaliation claims under the FEHA. Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1243 (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)). "[T]o establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action . . . . Once an employee establishes a prima [*21]  facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action . . . . If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation 'drops out of the picture,' and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation." Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042 (internal citations omitted).
Costco argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case because he has not demonstrated that he engaged in protected activity. (Mot. 15.) To constitute protected activity under the FEHA, "an employee need not formally file a charge . . . ." Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1046. However, "such activity must oppose activity the employee reasonably believes constitutes unlawful discrimination . . . . [C]omplaints about personal grievances or vague or conclusory remarks that fail to put an employer on notice as to what conduct it should investigate will not suffice to establish protected conduct." Id. Plaintiff has presented no evidence that he ever complained of unlawful discrimination. In the first of his grievances, Plaintiff asserted "I feel discriminated [sic], targeted, left out and harassed by [Armstrong]" because, according to Plaintiff, Armstrong [*22]  allowed some other employees to wear beanies and sweaters, while repeatedly instructing Plaintiff to remove them. (Pl.'s Exs. Ex. 7.) However, this conduct began before Plaintiff was injured or disabled. (See Pl.'s Exs., Ex. 7 (complaining of Armstrong's December 30, 2016 conduct); Tapia Depo., 244 (admitting alleged disability arose on December 31, 2015).) Despite the Opposition's misrepresentation of the evidence, no evidence suggests that Plaintiff ever complained to anyone prior to his termination that he was discriminated against based on a disability. Dinslage v. City & Cty. of S.F., 5 Cal. App. 5th 368, 382, 209 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2016) ("[N]one of these activities are protected for the purposes of the FEHA's antiretaliation provision, because none of them express opposition to practices one could reasonably believe are unlawful under the FEHA.").
Even if the facts alleged somehow established a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff has failed to present evidence to rebut Costco's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff discussed above. See supra Part III.B.
Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's retaliation claim.

D. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in [*23]  violation of public policy is derivative of his FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims. (Opp'n 11-14, 16.) Since Plaintiff's claims for discrimination and retaliation in violation of the FEHA fail, Plaintiff cannot prove his tort claim for wrongful termination. See Stevenson v. Super. Ct., 16 Cal. 4th 880, 904, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997) ("[W]hen a plaintiff relies upon a statutory prohibition to support a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the common law claim is subject to statutory limitations affecting the nature and scope of the statutory prohibition . . . ."); see also Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) (holding that derivative claim for wrongful termination failed where FEHA claim for disability discrimination failed). Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.

E. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff claims that he "was denied the accommodation of being permitted to see a doctor or any accommodations that would have assisted him in working without pain and discomfort." (Opp'n 18.) "The essential elements of a claim of failure to accommodate are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate [*24]  the plaintiff's disability." Furtado v. State Pers. Bd., 212 Cal. App. 4th 729, 744, 151 Cal. Rptr. 3d 292 (2013).
Costco argues that it was not required to provide Plaintiff accommodations because Plaintiff could perform his tasks after his injury, and that an employer is not required to provide an employee his preferred medical treatment. (Mot. 12-13.) A reasonable accommodation under the FEHA is "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held . . . ." Furtado, 212 Cal. App. 4th at 744. Such accommodations include making existing facilities accessible, or modifying a plaintiff's job, schedule, training, or equipment. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). While Plaintiff told each of his supervisors that his back hurt, there is no evidence that Plaintiff was unable to "perform the essential functions of the job held." (See Tapia Depo., 127, 133, 143.) Plaintiff took no time off and continued to perform all of his duties. (Id. at 130, 133.) Plaintiff has presented no evidence that he sought any accommodation at the workplace. Though Plaintiff requested and was denied a referral to a doctor by a nurse affiliated with Costco, there is no evidence that Costco prevented Plaintiff from visiting a doctor. Furthermore, Plaintiff has presented no authority to suggest that the FEHA [*25]  imposes a duty on an employer to provide certain medical treatment.
Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to create triable issue of fact as to whether he was denied a workplace measure or modification necessary to enable him to perform the essential functions of his job. Summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

F. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff claims that "Defendant never engaged in the interactive process." (Opp'n 18.) The FEHA requires an employer to engage in "a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively . . . . For the process to work both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." [*26]  Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984-85, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (alterations incorporated). "This interactive process is triggered upon notification of the disability and the desire for accommodation." Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000). "Both employer and employee have the obligation 'to keep communications open' and neither has 'a right to obstruct the process' . . . . Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984.
Plaintiff has not created a triable issue that the interactive process was ever triggered because he has put forward no evidence that he requested an accommodation. See Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1114; Boudreaux v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., No. 2:14-cv-00720-KJM-KJN, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104761 at *5, 18 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2015) (holding that, where continued to perform his regular work while complaining of back and shoulder pain, he failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the employer failed to engage in an interactive process). Accordingly, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's failure to engage in the interactive process claim.

G. Failure to Take Reasonable Steps to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation
Plaintiff claims that Costco's failure [*27]  to respond to Plaintiff's complaints about Armstrong constitutes a failure to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation from occurring in violation of state law. (Opp'n 20.) Government Code §12940(k) permits a cause of action for an employer's failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Taylor v. City of L.A. Dep't of Water and Power, et al., 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1222, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 206 (2006), overruled in part on other grounds by Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines P'ship, 42 Cal. 4th 1158, 72 Cal. Rptr. 3d 624, 177 P.3d 232 (2008). However, a failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, or retaliation claim cannot succeed in the absence of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. See Trujillo v. N. Cnty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 286-89, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998); Featherstone v. S. Cal. Permanente Med. Grp., 10 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1166, 217 Cal. Rptr. 3d 258 (2017).
Because Plaintiff cannot prevail on his harassment, discrimination, or retaliation claims, see supra Parts III.A, III.B, III.F, he cannot prevail on his derivative claim that Costco failed to prevent such violations from occurring. Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on this claim.

H. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Finally, Plaintiff asserts a claim for IIED premised upon his harassment, discrimination, and retaliation claims. (Opp'n 22.) "The elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless [*28]  disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering, and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress." Molko v. Holy Spirit Ass'n, 46 Cal. 3d 1092, 1120, 252 Cal. Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46 (1988); Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal. App. 3d 590, 617, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989).
Costco argues that Plaintiff's IIED claim fails because the alleged conduct could not be found to be outrageous. (Mot. 18-19.) "A defendant's conduct is 'outrageous' when it is so 'extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.'" Hughes v. Pair, 46 Cal. 4th 1035, 1050-51, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 209 P.3d 963 (2009). Where conduct constitutes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation under the FEHA, it may satisfy the outrageous conduct element of an IIED claim; where, however, the plaintiff fails to establish harassment, retaliation, or discrimination, a derivative IIED claim will also fail. See Fisher, 214 Cal. App. 3d at 617-18 ("Given an employee's fundamental, civil right to a discrimination free work environment (§§ 12920, 12921), by its very nature, sexual harassment in the work place is outrageous conduct as it exceeds all bounds of decency usually tolerated by a decent society."); Okorie v. L.A. Unified Sch. Dist., 14 Cal. App. 5th 574, 598, 222 Cal. Rptr. 3d 475 (2017) (holding that, where plaintiff's IIED claim was based on the same conduct plaintiff alleged to be discriminatory under the FEHA, and plaintiff had failed to provide sufficient evidence of discriminatory animus, plaintiff's IIED claim, [*29]  "by extension," failed); McCoy v. Perris Union High Sch. Dist., No. D067421, 2015 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 3974, at *37 (Cal. App. June 8, 2015) ("Given our conclusion McCoy is unable to meet his burden to establish the District engaged in discriminatory or retaliatory action, there is no triable issue of material fact as to his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim."); see also McCoy v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 216 Cal. App. 4th 283, 295, 156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 851 (2013) (concluding that though conduct satisfied retaliation standard, it was insufficient to constitute "outrageous conduct" for purposes of a derivative IIED claim).
On the evidence presented, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his harassment, discrimination, or retaliation claims. See supra Parts III.A, III.B, III.F. Plaintiff provides no other basis for his IIED claim. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not created a genuine dispute that he suffered outrageous conduct.
Therefore, summary judgment is granted in Costco's favor on Plaintiff's IIED claim.7

I. Preemption
Because Costco's Motion is granted as to each of Plaintiff's claims, the Court need not reach the issue of whether Plaintiff's claims are preempted by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a).

J. Punitive Damages
Because Costco's Motion is granted as to each of Plaintiff's claims, the Court need not reach Costco's separate [*30]  argument that punitive damages are not available.

Conclusion
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Costco's Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for a Continuance (Docket No. 38) is denied as moot. A Judgment consistent with this Order will be entered.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
