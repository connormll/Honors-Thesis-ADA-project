Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE ON MOTION TO DISMISS OF THE DEFENDANT UTMB
The Plaintiff Robert Back, an inmate of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division proceeding pro se, filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA) complaining of alleged violations of his rights. The lawsuit has been referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1) and (3) and the Amended Order for the Adoption of Local Rules for the Assignment of Duties to United States Magistrate Judges. The named defendants are the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions [*2]  Division and the University of Texas Medical Branch. This Report concerns the motion to dismiss filed by the University of Texas Medical Branch.

I. Background

A. The Plaintiff's Complaint
Back states that he has been under the care of the Brace and Limb Clinic of the University of Texas Medical Branch, receiving bracing for his left leg disabilities and impairments. He was seen and evaluated by a specialist he identifies as "Mr. Zack" in late 2015. He told Zack that he was experiencing further injury and pain from the bracing, and Zack told him that the correct bracing was a knee-ankle-foot orthotic brace, known as a KAFO brace. Zack told him that Back had to be approved by a referral from Dr. Niak at the Jester Unit. Back asked for a referral to Dr. Niak, but has never seen him.
In January of 2016, Back complained of continuing pain and injury from his bracing, and the complaint was forwarded to Dr. Kendall at the Beto Unit. Dr. Kendall responded that under UTMB policy, Back was required to have a job or be in a vocational class in order for bracing over $1000 to be issued.
Back states that the University of Texas Medical Branch charges a medical co-pay of $100 for the rendering of services, [*3]  which he claims is "basically a contract." However, he maintains that the co-pay fee is a means to extort money from prisoners for services that UTMB has no intention of providing, based on the fact that he is physically unable to work based upon his physical limitations.
Thus, Back states that persons needing bracing over $1000 who are able to work are accommodated because they are not disabled, but because he cannot work, he is refused the bracing based on his disabilities. He argues this is a violation of his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Back also contends that he was unable to file grievances raising his allegation that these actions were criminal and amounted to extortion; he states that this amounts to "engaging in organized corrupt activities or omissions of civil or criminal nature to aid or encourage one another in acting in a combination as an enterprise of continuing violations in connection with the alleged violations of the ADA and RA." He also alleges a conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1985.
For relief, Back asks for declaratory and unspecified equitable relief as well as compensatory damages and a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation [*4]  into the criminal extortions. At the conclusion of the memorandum of law attached to his complaint, Back asks specifically for a declaratory judgment that: (1) UTMB and TDCJ-CID, acting in a collaboration scheme," violated the ADA and RA as well as the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) UTMB and TDCJ-CID aided and assisted one another's conduct through an "organized activity of numerous parties;" (3) it was the intentional and wanton intent to cause actual physical injury and pain to Back and to violate his rights; (4) it is necessary to take Back into federal custody if UTMB and TDCJ-CID fail to stop their conduct and fail to assist Back in his disability and mobility related needs. Back also asks for $50,000.00 in compensatory damages against UTMB and $50,000.00 in compensatory damages against TDCJ-CID.

2. The Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law
In an attached memorandum of law, Back argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to cases under the ADA and RA. He states that under UTMB policy, bracing over $1000 will not be issued to Back if he cannot work; instead, he has substandard bracing which causes additional pain and injury. He argues that this policy is discriminatory based on disability and therefore null and void, [*5]  and amounts to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Back further contends that TDCJ-CID officials refused to file his grievance, which he construes as showing intent to evade responsibility in the face of allegations which are true.

3. The Plaintiff's Exhibits
The first exhibit attached to the complaint is a health summary for classification form, known as an HS-18. This form shows that Back has no restrictions on facility assignment, no restrictions on his basic housing assignment, restrictions limiting him to ground floor only and bottom bunk only, and work assignments showing that he can perform only sedentary work, with no lifting over 10 pounds, no repetitive squatting, no climbing, and no walking on uneven surfaces. The form also shows that as of its date, January 3, 2013, Back was medically unassigned. He had no restrictions for the disciplinary process and did not have an individualized treatment plan or transportation restrictions.
The next exhibit is the I-60 inmate request form from Back to Dr. Kendall. This form reads as follows:
Dr. Kendall, please be advised and advise Zack as well, I am still having problems with my braces. I was told by Zack he would refer [*6]  me to Dr. Niak for possible approval for the KAFO Brace. You as well stated I had the type of and severity of the nerve damage and amount of atrophy, it would do no good to attempt to rehabilitate the leg. Even though I have no job assignment, I am still entitled to enjoy life's major activity of walking as those who are physically able to perform work functions. These braces are causing me a lot of pain butting up against each other and rubbing on my ankle. Thank you.
A note on the bottom reflects that the message was emailed to Dr. Kendall. The reply reads as follows:
The policy clearly states you must have a job or be in a vocational class in order for bracing over $1000 to be issued. At Powledge, they are aware and can provide you with a job built around your problem.
Back's third exhibit is a grievance complaining of discrimination under the ADA and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The grievance was screened (i.e. returned unprocessed) as being a submission in excess of one grievance every seven days, with a notation on the bottom saying "Application of the screening criteria for this grievance is not expected to adversely affect the offender's [*7]  health."
Back's fourth exhibit is a letter from an attorney to a TDCJ investigator with the Patient Liaison Program dated September 10, 2012, complaining that Back is being denied braces and medical boots because he is unable to work.
In a "statement of additional facts" attached to a motion for preliminary injunctive relief, Back states that on March 18, 2016, he received a lay-in pass to pick up indigent hygiene supplies. He noticed on the pass that his job assignment had changed from "medically unassigned" to "inside medical squad," with work hours from 00:00 to 00:00. Back contends that this shows he has no job hours, but has simply been given a "job assignment description" to prevent him from raising legitimate claims of discrimination.

II. UTMB's Motion to Dismiss
In its motion to dismiss, UTMB argues that Back seeks monetary damages, which request is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. While Article II of the ADA can abrogate sovereign immunity and create a private cause of action for monetary damages against a State for conduct which actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, UTMB contends that Back has not shown a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights and thus fails to overcome its sovereign immunity defense. Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking compensatory [*8]  damages under the ADA must demonstrate intentional discrimination, and Back failed to meet this standard.
After arguing that Back failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by his own admission, UTMB asserts that Back failed to show that he was discriminated against by reason of his disability. UTMB states that Back failed to allege that he was precluded from enrollment in a vocational class and that Back's documentation shows that accommodations would be arranged to assign him to a job so that he could qualify for the KAFO brace.
UTMB further maintains that Back has not shown a deprivation of his right to equal protection or that he was the victim of deliberate indifference. His claims are of negligence at best and he plainly received medical treatment, as shown by his complaint that his current bracing was inadequate. UTMB further argues that Back's allegations of conspiracy under RICO and 42 U.S.C. §1985 do not state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

III. Back's Response to the Motion to Dismiss
In his response to UTMB's motion to dismiss, Back states that he has recently been transferred from the Powledge Unit to the Darrington Unit, based on the fact that TDCJ-CID and UTMB are refusing [*9]  to provide him with the benefit of services, programs, or activities for his medical needs. When he was evaluated in 2015 by the Brace & Limb Clinic, he was told he would be referred to Dr. Niak, but this was never done. When he sent in an I-60 inmate request form, he was told that by policy, he had to have a job assignment or be in vocational class to obtain bracing over $1000. The response also advised him that Powledge Unit officials were aware of this requirement and could provide him with a job built around his problem. Back argues this is discrimination because it bases the need for the brace on whether the individual can work or go to a vocational class, or even chooses to do so. Back specifies that he personally has never refused to work or attend a vocational class and in fact has completed two vocational trades, but states that he has been unable to work because a UTMB medical provider made a decision to permanently medically unassign him from participating in any work activities. He claims that this assignment overrules another limitation he also has for sedentary work only.
Back concedes that TDCJ-CID has now provided him with a job assignment which is supposed to assist [*10]  him in meeting the policy requirements, but says that despite this, no effort has been made to ensure that he receives the bracing for which he now qualifies. Back argues this proves TDCJ-CID and UTMB are acting in bad faith in an extortion scheme. He asks why TDCJ CID transferred him back into UTMB's regional jurisdiction, why the medical personnel do not take him to an outside medical provider, and why UTMB did not comply with the ADA to begin with.
Back sets out the standards governing motions to dismiss and argues that UTMB has failed to competently dispute any of his factual assertions. He contends that UTMB has presented only legal conclusions or unsubstantiated assertions. Back notes that the ADA provides for abrogation of sovereign immunity and that he has shown an equal protection violation because the denial of the KAFO brace amounts to intentional discrimination. The requirement of a job in order to receive a brace is discriminatory because if it were not, he would have been issued a brace as soon as the job assignment was obtained.
Back points to a prior lawsuit he filed in the Western District of Texas wherein he says that the court held that he had been denied the benefits [*11]  of the Brace & Limb Clinic. Although this other case concluded that Back failed to show that a one-time denial of a referral to the Clinic was based on his disability, Back maintains that "he can now show that the UTMB knows he is disabled and requires the bracing that the Brace & Limb issues and he can now show that it is a pattern of denial to access to the accommodations so that he may enjoy the mere activity of major life function of walking." Instead, he claims that it was never UTMB's intent to provide him with a KAFO brace and the failure to do so amounts to retaliation.
With regard to exhaustion of administrative remedies, Back argues that while his grievance was screened (returned unprocessed), the screening criteria are overcome if a prisoner alleges that he is being physically harmed. He also asserts that he made a good faith effort to exhaust administrative remedies but was impeded by TDCJ-CID, and that the grievance he originally submitted was destroyed, as shown by the fact that the one he received back had "accept as original" written on it.

IV. Prior Litigation History
In cause no. 6:14cv301, filed in the Western District of Texas, Back sued TDCJ-CID, UTMB, and two officials [*12]  at the Hughes Unit, Valencia Pollard and Teri Smith. He complained that he is disabled in his left leg and has been under the care of the Brace and Limb Clinic. According to Back's complaint, on September 5, 2012, the medical director at the Hughes Unit, Dr. Greene, referred Back to the Brace and Limb Clinic to replace his orthotic footwear; however, on September 10, 2012, the Brace and Limb Clinic denied the referral because Back did not have a job.
When Back filed grievances, the Step Two response stated that an expedited prosthesis specialty referral was submitted on his behalf on January 3, 2013, which referral had been approved. Back asserted that on January 31, 2013, a specialist at the Brace and Limb Clinic determined that he should not have been denied the requested footwear and braces. He also complained of being denied a medical storage box.
In ruling on the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas concluded that Back was denied a benefit on September 10, 2012, when he was denied a referral to the Brace and Limb Clinic, but that he cannot show that this onetime denial of access to the clinic was based on his disability; [*13]  instead, the summary judgment evidence showed that Back was denied the referral because his footwear was assigned on June 23, 2011, and should still be in good condition because Back was not working. Even if representatives of the Brace and Limb Clinic were negligent in failing to review the judgment of Dr. Greene, Back failed to show intentional discrimination and thus cannot obtain compensatory damages under the ADA or the RA. The court further determined that Back's §1983 claims against TDCJ-CID and UTMB were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court therefore granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Back's appeal of this decision remains pending.
In cause no. 6:16cv15 (E.D.Tex., July 24, 2016), Back complained that he was denied a medical storage box at the Powledge Unit, with the result that he was deprived of legal paperwork for over a month. He asserted that the denial of the storage box violated the ADA. This Court permitted him to proceed on his ADA claims, but ultimately dismissed the complaint because Back's claims for equitable relief became moot upon his transfer to another unit, while his claims for compensatory and punitive damages failed because he did not allege facts [*14]  showing intentional discrimination and because his claims were barred by sovereign immunity.

V. Legal Standards and Analysis

A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
The University of Texas Medical Branch argues that Back's pleadings show he failed to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit. The law governing the exhaustion of administrative remedies is found in 42 U.S.C. § 1997e, which provides as follows:
No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.
Under this statute, prisoners are required to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 202, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007); Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir. 2004). Proper exhaustion is required, meaning the prisoner must not only pursue all available avenues of relief, but must also comply with all administrative deadlines and procedural rules. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 89-95, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). This requirement means mere "substantial compliance" with administrative remedy procedures does not satisfy exhaustion; instead, prisoners must exhaust administrative remedies properly. Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 268 (5th Cir. 2010). The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional [*15]  Institutions Division has a two-step grievance procedure, and both steps must be pursued in order to complete the exhaustion process. Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir. 2004).
The Fifth Circuit has held district courts have no discretion to excuse a prisoner's failure to properly exhaust the grievance procedure before the filing of the complaint. Instead, pre-filing exhaustion is mandatory and the case must be dismissed if available administrative remedies were not exhausted. Gonzalez v. Seal, 702 F.3d 785, 788 (5th Cir. 2012).
Back states that he attempted to exhaust his administrative remedies, but TDCJ-CID would not allow him to do so. He attaches a Step One grievance to his complaint (docket no. 1, p. 37) which was screened (i.e. returned unprocessed) for the reason given of "submission in excess of one every seven days." The top of the grievance has "Accept as original" handwritten on it, and at the bottom there appears a notation saying "Application of the screening criteria for this grievance is not expected to adversely affect the offender's health." This is signed by a medical signature authority, but the signature is not clear.
Back argues that prison officials "destroyed his originally submitted grievance" without notice of any type of accident which would justify [*16]  such destruction. Instead, these officials wrote "accept as original" on the face of the grievance. Even if Back's original grievance was destroyed, he has failed to show any harm because the one he attaches was accepted as original.
Back's grievance does not exhaust his administrative remedies because he did not pursue it through both steps of the grievance procedure, but violated procedural rules because the grievance was in excess of one every seven days. The Fifth Circuit has stated that grievances which are returned unprocessed for procedural violations do not serve to exhaust the prisoner's administrative remedies. Robinson v. Wheeler, 338 Fed. Appx. 437, 2009 WL 2222844 (5th Cir., 2009) (grievance which was rejected as procedurally improper because it presented multiple claims did not serve to exhaust administrative remedies); see also Sanchez v. Grounds, civil action no. 5:14cv64, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40054, 2015 WL 1456068 (E.D.Tex., March 30, 2015) (grievance which was returned unprocessed because the issue presented was not grievable and the grievance was redundant did not serve to exhaust administrative remedies). This holding conforms with the Supreme Court's determination that prisoners must comply with all administrative deadlines and procedural rules. Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95.
Back argues that the refusal to process the grievance is [*17]  unjustifiable because it "raises criminal extortion tactics of the UTMB that are meant to intimidate, coerce, or retaliate, which any alleged criminal activity must be investigated as an emergency situation." A prisoner's assertion that the prison officials did not properly process his grievance does not excuse the exhaustion requirement. Taylor v. Burns, 371 Fed. Appx. 479, 2010 WL 1141663 (5th Cir., 2010); Arevalo v. M.T.C., civil action no. 3:13cv1032, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156115, 2014 WL 5529196 (S.D.Miss., November 3, 2014); Sanchez, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40054, 2015 WL 1456068 at *5. Nor can prisoners create exceptions to the prison's grievance rules merely by claiming that the official actions complained of amount to criminal activity.
Back does not contest UTMB's assertion that he filed more than one grievance in a seven-day period, resulting in this grievance being returned unprocessed. Nor does he offer any explanation why he did not simply re-file it after the seven-day period had expired. The TDCJ Offender Orientation Handbook, p. 75, explains that grievances which do not meet certain specified screening criteria may be returned unprocessed, but most grievances may be corrected and resubmitted within 15 days from the "date returned to the offender" noted on the grievance form. Back did not pursue his claims against UTMB through both steps of the grievance procedure and [*18]  thus has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; in the interest of justice, however, the Court will proceed to examine his claims.

B. The ADA Claim
Title II of the ADA provides that individuals with disabilities may not be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2011). Title II thus imposes an obligation on public entities to make reasonable accommodations or modifications for disabled prisoners, including prisoners. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004).
To state a claim under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must allege that he has a qualifying disability, that he is being denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities for which the public entity is responsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the public entity, and that such discrimination is by reason of his disability. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011); see also Davidson v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 91 Fed. Appx. 963, 2004 WL 542206 (5th Cir., 2004) (affirming dismissal of ADA lawsuit where plaintiff failed to show that he was adversely treated because of his handicap); Shaw v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 46 Fed. Appx. 225, 2002 WL 1939847 (5th Cir., 2002) (inmate denied participation in program for handicapped prisoners because of a notation in his record labeling him a member of a militant organization failed to show an ADA violation because the adverse [*19]  treatment was not due to his disability). In order to obtain compensatory damages for violations of the ADA or the RA, a plaintiff must show intentional discrimination. Delano-Pyle v. Victoria County, Texas, 302 F.3d 567, 575 (5th Cir. 2002).
The causation requirements for the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act differ in that the ADA prohibits discrimination by reason of disability, while the Rehabilitation Act premises liability only on discrimination which was solely by reason of a person's disability. See Soledad v. United States Dep't of Treasury, 304 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2002). Other than causation, the rights and remedies afforded plaintiffs under Title II of the ADA are almost entirely duplicative of those provided under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Board of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 2005).
The Supreme Court has set out a three-part test to determine whether or not Title II of the ADA abrogates a state's sovereign immunity. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). First, the district court must consider which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II. After making this determination, the court must ask to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment. If the State's conduct violated both Title II and the Fourteenth Amendment, then Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity. See also Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 498 (5th Cir. 2011). If the conduct only violates Title II and not the Fourteenth Amendment, the court must then consider whether [*20]  Congress' purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid. Id.
Back maintains that UTMB's policy requiring him to have a job or be enrolled in a vocational class in order to receive bracing over $1000 violates the ADA, stating that because he cannot work, he is refused bracing based on his disabilities. He claims to have been medically unassigned permanently, even though his HS-18 health summary for classification form also shows that he can do sedentary work; he states that he has never refused to work and that he has taken two vocational courses.
Back's pleadings show that he was given a job assignment to the "inside medical squad." He does not allege that he ever had to show up for work in the "inside medical squad," much less that any such work was beyond his physical capacity; evidence in other cases has indicated that assignments to an "inside medical squad" require no work. See, e.g., White v. Stephens, civil action no. 6:14cv262, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71512, 2015 WL 3561292 (E.D.Tex., June 3, 2015) (plaintiff assigned to an inside medical squad which did no work); Witt v. Bell, civil action no. 9:13cv55, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79824, 2013 WL 2468736 (E.D.Tex., June 6, 2013) (plaintiff reassigned to inside medical squad and was not required to work after suffering a foot [*21]  injury).
To the extent that Back challenges the UTMB policy requiring prisoners to have a job or be enrolled in a vocational program in order to obtain bracing over $1000, he lacks standing to bring such a challenge because by his own admission, he was provided with a job and therefore met the policy requirements. See Cramer v. Skinner, 931 F.2d 1020, 1024 (5th Cir. 1991) (standing requires a showing that the litigant has personally suffered actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, this injury can fairly be traced to the challenged action, and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision). Because Back was assigned to a job and thus was entitled to request and obtain bracing under the policy, he lacks standing to assert the purported rights of anyone not so entitled.
Back pleads no facts suggesting that UTMB denied him a brace because of his disability, much less that he was the victim of intentional discrimination. On the contrary, he indicates that he was assigned to a job which normally requires no work to assist him in qualifying for a KAFO brace. Because Back has failed to show a Fourteenth Amendment violation and has not shown that Congress' purported abrogation of sovereign immunity [*22]  as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid, he has not overcome the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the University of Texas Medical Branch as an agency of the State of Texas. Harris v. Angelina County, 31 F.3d 331, 338 n.7 (5th Cir. 1994); Aguilar v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1053 (5th Cir. 1998).
Back also seeks a declaratory judgment that UTMB acted in concert with TDCJ-CID to violate his rights through an organized pattern of activity, with the wanton intent to cause physical injury and pain, and that it would be necessary to take him into federal custody if TDCJ-CID and UTMB fail to stop violating his rights. In order to obtain a declaratory judgment, a plaintiff must show that there is an actual case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution. Such a showing requires that the plaintiff allege facts from which it appears that there is a substantial likelihood that he will suffer injury in the future. This continuing controversy may not be conjectural, hypothetical or contingent, but must be real and immediate and create a definite rather than speculative threat of future injury. Bauer v. Texas, 341 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2003).
In this regard, the Fifth Circuit has explained that past exposure to illegal conduct does not itself show a present case or controversy for a declaratory judgment if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects. Society of Separationists, Inc. v. Herman, 959 F.2d 1283, 1285 (5th Cir. 1992), citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). [*23]  In Lyons, the Supreme Court held that an individual who had been subjected to a chokehold by police officers upon being stopped for a traffic violation lacked standing to obtain equitable relief because it was entirely speculative that police officers would stop him again and choke him without provocation. See also Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U.S. 171, 172, 97 S.Ct. 1739, 52 L.Ed.2d 219 (1997) (for a declaratory judgment to issue, there must be a dispute which calls, not for an advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, but for an adjudication of present right upon established facts).
Back has not shown a substantial likelihood that he will continue to suffer injury in the future, nor that he is otherwise entitled to a declaratory judgment in the face of the fact that he has failed to show that UTMB violated the ADA or the RA. He is no longer at the Powledge Unit but has been transferred to the Darrington Unit.
In a recent motion for injunctive relief, Back states that he has been told he would receive a medical lay-in to obtain his brace, but he has not yet received one. He offers nothing to suggest that the University of Texas Medical Branch is engaged in intentional discrimination by the fact that he has not yet received a lay-in, nor that this delay amounts [*24]  to discrimination because of his disability.
In a "motion to strike," Back argues that in fact, the UTMB policies say nothing about a requirement for a job or enrollment in a vocational class in order to obtain bracing. He attaches a purported copy of Policy G-59.3. Section II of the policy attached by Back reads as follows:
Offenders that are independent in their major functional activities are not eligible for prosthetics or orthotic devices unless the prosthetic/orthotic items are (a) required for entry in a vocational training program entailing standing or walking for which the offender has already gained admittance, or (b) required for assignment to a work program providing work experience that has the obvious potential for producing marketable skills at a stand up or walking level.
This provision plainly provides the source for the requirement of holding a job or enrollment in a vocational course in order to obtain bracing. Back has failed to show that he is entitled to any relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

C. Deliberate Indifference
Back acknowledges that deliberate indifference is a very high standard, but argues that he is being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. [*25]  He argues that the medical personnel at the Brace & Limb Clinic are aware of his medical condition, but have made a decision to deny him the proper bracing.
Deliberate indifference is an Eighth Amendment standard and thus falls under 42 U.S.C. §1983 rather than the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., Walls v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 270 Fed. Appx. 358, 2008 WL 793792 (5th Cir., 2008). The University of Texas Medical Branch is an agency of the State of Texas and as such, is shielded from suit by the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity absent a waiver of this immunity. Harris v. Angelina County, 31 F.3d 331, 338 n.7 (5th Cir. 1994); Aguilar v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1053 (5th Cir. 1998). Back has offered nothing to suggest that UTMB waived its sovereign immunity with regard to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. See also Mayes v. University of Texas Medical Branch, civil action no. A-06-163, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39376, 2007 WL 1577670 (W.D.Tex., May 30, 2007) (dismissing deliberate indifference claims against TDCJ and UTMB as barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity), aff'd 294 Fed. Appx. 137, 2008 WL 4375778 (5th Cir., September 26, 2008).
Nor has Back pleaded a viable deliberate indifference claim even if he could overcome sovereign immunity. The Fifth Circuit has held that deliberate indifference to a convicted inmate's serious medical needs could state a civil rights violation, but a showing of nothing more than negligence does not. Norton v. Dimazana, 122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Cain, 864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir. 1989). However, simple disagreement with the medical treatment [*26]  received or a complaint that the treatment received has been unsuccessful is insufficient to set forth a constitutional violation. Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985); Norton, 122 F.3d at 293.
In Domino v. Texas Dep't of Crim. Justice, 239 F.3d 752 (5th Cir. 2001), an inmate who was a psychiatric patient expressed suicidal ideations and the psychiatrist returned him to his cell after a five-minute examination; the inmate committed suicide two and a half hours later. The Fifth Circuit, in reversing a denial of summary judgment by the district court, stated as follows:
Deliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet. It is indisputable that an incorrect diagnosis by prison medical personnel does not suffice to state a claim for deliberate indifference. Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985). Rather, the plaintiff must show that the officials "refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs." Id. Furthermore, the decision whether to provide additional medical treatment "is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 107, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1972). And, "the failure to alleviate a significant risk that [the official] should have perceived, but did not," is insufficient to show deliberate indifference. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 838, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994).
Domino, 239 F.3d at 756; see also [*27]  Stewart v. Murphy, 174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir. 1999).
Back has failed to show that UTMB engaged in conduct clearly evincing wanton disregard for serious medical needs. His pleadings and supporting documentation show that he has been seen by medical personnel on numerous occasions and he was told he needed a KAFO brace, for which he had to have a job or be enrolled in a vocational class. He provides documentation showing that the Powledge Unit officials were aware of this requirement and could provide him with a job built around his problem, and states that he was reassigned to an "inside medical squad." Although Back complains that he has not yet received a brace despite this job assignment, he acknowledges that he has been told he will receive a lay-in for it; he offers nothing to suggest that this delay is due to deliberate indifference rather than a waiting list for Brace & Limb Clinic services.

D. Criminal Extortion
Back explains that the "criminal extortion" of which he complains is the fact that he is required to have a job or be enrolled in vocational classes to get bracing over $1000. He asserts that this shows organized criminal and civil corrupt activities in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. [*28] 
In order to maintain a civil cause of action under RICO, the plaintiff must show a pattern of racketeering activity connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir.1993). A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more predicate acts and a demonstration that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to or pose a threat of continuing criminal activity. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 441 (5th Cir.2000). Back's pleadings wholly fail to set out such a showing. In any event, his civil RICO claim is barred by sovereign immunity. Anderton v. Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, civil action no. 3:13cv1641, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185486, 2014 WL 11281086 (N.D.Tex., February 14, 2014), aff'd 605 F.App'x 339, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 4911 (5th Cir., March 26, 2015). To the extent he seeks to file criminal RICO charges, he cannot do so because private individuals do not have a right to file criminal charges or to compel prosecutors to do so. United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); Oliver v. Collins, 914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir. 1990). Back has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted in this regard.
Similarly, Back refers to a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. §1985. This statute prohibits "two or more persons" from conspiring: (1) to prevent any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States; (2) to deter any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending court or [*29]  from testifying therein; or (3) to deprive any person of the equal protection of the law or of equal protection and immunity under the law. Neither States nor state agencies such as prisons are "persons" within the meaning of §1985. See Small v. Chao, 398 F.3d 894, 898 (7th Cir. 2005), citing Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). This contention fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

VI. Conclusion
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) permits dismissal if a plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) states a pleading must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The Supreme Court has made clear this pleading standard does not require detailed factual allegations, but does demand more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).
To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief which is plausible on its face. This plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility a defendant has acted unlawfully. When the complaint pleads facts which are "merely consistent" with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility [*30]  of entitlement to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Montoya v. FedEx Ground Packaging System Inc., 614 F.3d 145, 149 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).
The Court assumes well-pleaded factual allegations to be true and then determines whether these allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. However, this is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Thus, "threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice," and Rule 8 does not "unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. While legal conclusions can provide the framework for a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. Id. at 679; see also Hershey v. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., 610 F.3d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 2010).
In proceeding under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a plaintiff with an arguable claim is ordinarily accorded notice of a pending motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and an opportunity to amend the complaint before the motion is ruled upon. These procedures alert him to the legal theory underlying the defendants' challenge, and enable him meaningfully to respond by opposing the motion to dismiss on legal grounds or by clarifying his factual allegations so as to conform with the requirements of a valid cause of action. This adversarial process also crystallizes the pertinent issues and facilitates appellate review [*31]  of a trial court dismissal by creating a more complete record of a case. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 329-30, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989).
Back received notice of the Defendant's motion to dismiss and filed an extensive response to this motion. A review of his pleadings shows that Back failed to plead factual content allowing the court to reasonably infer that the University of Texas Medical Branch can be held liable for the misconduct alleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Because Back's pleadings do not show he is entitled to relief, he has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted against UTMB.

RECOMMENDATION
It is accordingly recommended the motion to dismiss filed by the Defendant University of Texas Medical Branch Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division (docket no. 19) be granted and the Plaintiff's claims against the University of Texas Medical Branch be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
A party's failure to file objections to the findings, conclusions, and recommendations contained in this Report within 14 days after service with a copy thereof shall bar that party from de novo review by the district judge of those findings, conclusions, and recommendations and, except [*32]  upon grounds of plain error, from appellate review of the unobjected-to factual findings and legal conclusions accepted and adopted by the district court. Douglass v. United Services Automobile Association, 79 F.3d 1415, 1430 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).
So ORDERED and SIGNED this 24th day of January, 2017.
