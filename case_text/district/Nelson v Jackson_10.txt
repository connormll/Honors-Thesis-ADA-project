Opinion



ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Dennis Nelson filed the above-styled employment discrimination action against Defendant Ted Jackson in his official capacity as Sheriff of Fulton County on September 4, 2014. [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff Nelson alleges that Defendant Sheriff Jackson subjected him to retaliation and discrimination on the basis of his disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. [Doc. 6, Counts 1, 2; Doc. 31; Doc. 33]. Defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on Plaintiff's claims based upon the pleadings, statements of material [*2]  facts, exhibits, and discovery materials submitted to the court. [Doc. 63]. Plaintiff has filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his claim that Defendant failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability. [Doc. 66]. Also pending before the court are Defendant's motion [Doc. 71] to strike a declaration and Defendant's motion [Doc. 77] to strike a statement of additional undisputed facts submitted by Plaintiff.

I. Defendant's Motions to Strike
"A motion to strike should be granted only if the matter sought to be omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy, may confuse the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party." United States ex rel. Chabot v. MLU Services, Inc., 544 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1330 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Because this standard is rarely met, '[m]otions to strike are generally disfavored by the Court and are often considered time wasters.'" Id. (quoting Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Kimball, 168 F.R.D. 69, 71 (M.D. Fla. 1996)). Motions to strike are provided for by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), which states in pertinent part:
The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act: . . .
(2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being [*3]  served with the pleading.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (as amended 2009). The rule explicitly provides that the object being stricken must be in a "pleading." "Only material included in a 'pleading' may be the subject of a motion to strike, and courts have been unwilling to construe the term broadly." 2 Moore's Federal Practice, § 12.37[2] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.). The Federal Rules define a "pleading" as "(1) a complaint; (2) an answer to a complaint; (3) an answer to a counterclaim designated as a counterclaim; (4) an answer to a cross-claim; (5) a third-party complaint; (6) an answer to a third-party complaint; and (7) if the court orders one, a reply to an answer." Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) (as amended 2007). "Motions, briefs or memoranda, objections, or affidavits may not be attacked by the motion to strike." 2 Moore's Federal Practice, § 12.37[2] (Matthew Bender 3d ed.). Accord Sum of $66,839.59 v. United States IRS, 119 F. Supp. 2d 1358, 1359 n.1 (N.D. Ga. 2000) ("With respect to the IRS' motion to strike, because a motion to strike is only appropriate with regard to a pleading and an affidavit is not a pleading (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 7), the motion to strike Calloway's affidavit is procedurally improper."); Lowery v. Hoffman, 188 F.R.D. 651, 653 (M.D. Ala. 1999) ("[A]s an initial matter, the motion to strike must be denied as to all non-pleadings, and, in this case, that would be all documents filed by Kay other than Triad's and Body Energetic's answers [*4]  to the complaints.").
In the present case, Defendant has filed a motion [Doc. 71] to strike the declaration [Doc. 66-2] of Plaintiff's physician Dr. Suzanne Ferree Turner. Defendant has also filed a motion [Doc. 77] to strike a statement [Doc. 74-3] of additional undisputed facts submitted by Plaintiff. The court finds that both motions must be denied. Neither the statements made by Dr. Turner nor the statement of additional facts are pleadings. As a result, Defendant's motions to strike are improper. "Rather than filing a motion to strike as under Rule 12, the proper method for challenging the admissibility of evidence in an affidavit is to file a notice of objection to the challenged testimony." Sum of $66,839.59, 119 F. Supp. 2d at 1359 n.1. Defendant's motions [Docs. 71, 77] to strike are DENIED.
The court, however, will treat the motions to strike as notices of objection. The arguments made by Defendant in support of his objection [Doc. 77] to Plaintiff's statement [Doc. 74-3] of additional facts are without merit. The Local Rules for the Northern District of Georgia provide that a respondent to a summary judgment motion may file a statement of additional facts. LR 56.1(B)(2)(b)., N.D. Ga. Despite Defendant's arguments to the contrary, [*5]  Plaintiff did not act improperly by submitting such a statement. Nevertheless, the court finds it unnecessary to specifically cite to Plaintiff's statement of additional facts because the parties have pointed to the evidence relevant to their arguments in the numerous documents filed with the court in support of their various motions and responses.1
With regard to Defendant's objection [Doc. 71] to the declaration [Doc. 66-2] of Dr. Turner, the court agrees with Defendant that some, but not all, of the physician's statements should not be considered. Defendant contends that Dr. Turner's testimony should be stricken because it constitutes expert testimony and Plaintiff did not identify the physician as an expert and did not submit her expert report under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a). [Doc. 71-1 at 3-8]. To the extent Dr. Turner's "testimony is based on a hypothesis, not the experience of treating" Plaintiff, Defendant is correct that the physician's testimony has "cross[ed] the line from lay to expert testimony" and it will not be considered. Williams v. Mast Biosurgery USA, Inc., 644 F.3d 1312, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 2011). The expert testimony offered by Dr. Turner does not comply with Federal Rule of Evidence 702, and Plaintiff has not followed Rule 26 in submitting the evidence.2 This includes Dr. Turner's interpretation of [*6]  a sleep study and her opinions regarding the risks associated with sleep apnea that Plaintiff would face if he did not follow her recommended treatment. [Doc. 66-2]. However, some of Dr. Turner's statements are simply her observations of Plaintiff and testimony about her treatment of him as a long-time patient. [Id.]. A "treating physician is not considered an expert witness if he or she testifies about observations based on personal knowledge, including the treatment of the party." Williams, 644 F.3d at 1317 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, Dr. Turner's observations of Plaintiff and her recommended course of treatment may be considered. The court next turns to the parties' summary judgment motions [Docs. 63, 66].

II. Statement of Facts
When evaluating the merits of a motion for summary judgment, the court must "view the evidence and all factual inferences raised by it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party." Comer v. City of Palm Bay, Florida, 265 F.3d 1186, 1192 (11th Cir. 2001). However, mere conclusions and unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). Therefore, the evidence [*7]  presented by the parties having been evaluated in accordance with the foregoing principles, the following facts are deemed to be true for the limited purpose of evaluating the parties' motions [Docs. 63, 66] for summary judgment.
Plaintiff Dennis Nelson has received treatment from Dr. Suzanne Ferree Turner for severe chronic sleep apnea since approximately 2007. [Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") ¶ 3]. Dr. Turner testified that after Plaintiff underwent a sleep study in 2007 at her direction, she recommended that Plaintiff begin using a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ("CPAP") machine, which "provides a positive flow of air into Mr. Nelson's airway in order to keep it open while sleeping and prevent obstructions." [Declaration of Dr. Suzanne Ferree Turner ("Turner Dec.") ¶¶ 7, 10, 11]. Dr. Turner also testified that she "recommended that Mr. Nelson maintain a regular sleep schedule. . . ." [Turner Dec. ¶ 12]. Plaintiff testified: "Frequent interruptions to my sleep schedule have significant adverse effects upon my ability to sleep and general health." [Pla. Dec. ¶ 11; PSMF ¶ 45].
Defendant Ted Jackson was elected Sheriff of Fulton County, Georgia, in November 2008. [*8]  [PSMF ¶ 8]. In 2010, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office received federal financial assistance distributed through Fulton County, Georgia. [PSMF ¶ 1]. In late January 2010, Sheriff Jackson had a phone call with Plaintiff Nelson, rather than a face-to-face interview. [PSMF ¶ 10]. Sheriff Jackson made the decision to hire Plaintiff as Chief Jailer based solely on a single conversation with Plaintiff's sister, who is employed by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and his phone call with Plaintiff. [PSMF ¶ 11]. During the conversation in which Sheriff Jackson told Plaintiff that he was hiring him, the only information that Jackson gave Plaintiff regarding the required hours of work was that "we expect an honest day's work." [PSMF ¶ 12]. Sheriff Jackson expected Plaintiff Nelson to work hours necessary to fulfill the obligations of a Chief Jailer. [Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 5].
Plaintiff completed a Fulton County Personnel Board Application for Employment on January 22, 2010. [PSMF ¶ 13; Deposition of Sheriff Theodore Jackson ("Jackson Dep.") at 65-66, Doc. 55]. Paragraph 19 of the Application for Employment states: "Certain positions with Fulton County require shift work, [*9]  rotating shift work, some other departure from standard daytime operating hours or may require transfer to another location. If it is necessary of a position into which you are placed, would you accept these conditions?" [PSMF ¶ 14]. In response, Plaintiff indicated, "Yes." [PSMF ¶ 15]. Plaintiff was asked and testified to the following:
Q. When you completed your employment application for Fulton County Sheriff's Office, you indicated on page 4 that you could work any shift including a rotating shift, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So at the time that you applied for the job, you didn't disclose that you had sleep apnea and could not work a rotating shift?
A. No.
[Deposition of Plaintiff Dennis Nelson ("Pla. Dep.") at 62].
Plaintiff Nelson began his employment as Chief Jailer with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office in February 2010. [Pla. Dep. at 29-30, Doc. 60; DSMF ¶ 1]. The Chief Jailer is responsible for the operations of the jail 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [DSMF ¶ 10]. When Plaintiff was hired, Sheriff Jackson's main areas of concern were the safety of the jail, the Federal consent decree concerning the jail, and hiring someone as Chief Jailer with leadership and management abilities. [*10]  [DSMF ¶ 2]. The qualifications for Chief Jailer for the Fulton County Sheriff's Office are defined in a document captioned "Fulton County, Georgia; Class Specification; Class Title: Chief Jailer." [PSMF ¶ 17]. The "Essential Duties" listed in the Class Specification document do not include any reference to hours of work.3 [PSMF ¶ 18].
When Plaintiff was hired as Chief Jailer, the Fulton County Jail had more than 2500 inmates and 600 employees and operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [DSMF ¶ 3]. Most of the disruptive inmate activity occurs at the jail during the afternoons and evenings. [DSMF ¶ 11]. Sheriff Jackson testified that "92 percent [of the inmates at the Fulton County Jail] were violent offenders." [Jackson Dep. at 109]. However, Plaintiff testified that "the majority of the inmates were not charged with crimes of violence, but rather faced charges related to property crimes, drugs, theft, etc." [Plaintiff's Second Declaration ("Pla. 2nd Dec.") ¶ 2, Doc. 74-1].
The Fulton County Jail has three main shifts or watches: day shift/watch from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.; evening shift/watch from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.; and morning shift/watch from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. [DSMF [*11]  ¶ 4; PSMF ¶ 26]. Sheriff Jackson could not guarantee a set shift or only daytime hours for the Chief Jailer without compromising the usefulness of the Chief Jailer and the effective operation of the jail. [DSMF ¶ 6]. The Chief Jailer must be able to work at any time on any given day. [DSMF ¶ 14]. Sheriff Jackson "wanted [Plaintiff] to show up on all the shifts. . . ." [Jackson Dep. at 106]. Jackson testified:
We wanted him to be present at the jail. So we have three shifts; 3 to 11, 11 to 7, 7 to 3, and weekends are included. And people at the jail didn't know him. So we had to force him to do what a chief jailer does. I don't know if it worked or not. I didn't follow up on it. Take ownership of the jail. Walk the floors, talk to people, to listen to them, let them see you so they know you're the chief jailer. . . .
[Jackson Dep. at 105]. The current Chief Jailer, Mark Adger, testified: "As part of the day-to-day management of staff, a Chief Jailer has to be familiar with the staff and operations of each of the three main shifts at the jail. To accomplish this, the Chief Jailer should regularly rotate working each of the three main shifts, engaging employees on the different shifts and [*12]  being active in programs occurring at the jail." [Agder Affidavit ("Aff.") ¶ 6]. Adger testified that he has worked varying shifts, including the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift and the 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shift. [Adger Aff. ¶ 7].
In April or May 2010, Sheriff Jackson promoted James Carter to Chief Deputy. [PSMF ¶ 19; Jackson Dep. at 35]. As Chief Deputy, Carter was Plaintiff's immediate superior and reported directly to Sheriff Jackson. [PSMF ¶ 20]. On approximately June 10, 2010, Carter issued a performance appraisal for Plaintiff for the period through June 30, 2010. [PSMF ¶ 21; Doc. 57 at 16-26]. Carter appraised Plaintiff's job performance as "outstanding" and concluded that Plaintiff's "[p]erformance fulfills terms and conditions of employment." [PSMF ¶ 22]. In the performance appraisal, Chief Deputy Carter indicated that Plaintiff's punctuality and attendance were both "satisfactory." [PSMF ¶ 23].
Carter issued an "Addendum" to Plaintiff's performance appraisal dated June 29, 2010, less than three weeks after the original appraisal was issued. [Doc. 57 at 40-51]. Carter's addendum to the performance appraisal downgraded Plaintiff's appraisal for the period ending June 30, 2010, [*13]  from "outstanding" to "acceptable," but continued to rate Plaintiff's punctuality and attendance as "satisfactory." [PSMF ¶ 25; Doc. 57 at 49, 51]. Carter testified that he could not remember why he changed Plaintiff's performance appraisal 19 days after issuing the original one. [Carter Dep. at 182-87].
On or about July 19, 2010, Chief Deputy Carter provided Plaintiff a detailed, written directive of what was expected of him as Chief Jailer. [DSMF ¶ 29; Carter Dep. 165, Exhibit ("Ex.") 8]. Carter required Plaintiff to sign the document outlining the job requirements of the "Jail Administrator," which included the following purported "essential duty": "Work a full evening shift (3 p.m. - 11 p.m.) and morning shift (11 p.m. - 7 a.m.) at least twice a month for both shifts. You are required to walk the floors while working these shifts." [PSMF ¶ 27; DSMF ¶ 31; Carter Dep. 165, Ex. 8]. Carter also directed Plaintiff to communicate effectively with his staff, keeping emails to a minimum. [DSMF ¶ 30; Carter Dep. 165, Ex. 8]. Plaintiff testified that he immediately began working a minimum of two evenings shifts and two morning/night shifts per month. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 5; PSMF ¶ 28].
On or about [*14]  July 22, 2010, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Sheriff Jackson and explained that he arrives at work between 6:30 and 6:45 a.m. each day and typically leaves work between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m. [Pla. Dep. at 82, Ex. 18; DSMF ¶ 32]. Plaintiff stated that he often leaves between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. on Fridays. [Id.]. Plaintiff also recounted in the letter the occasions that he worked later than 4:00 p.m. [Pla. Dep. at 82, Ex. 18; DSMF ¶ 33]. In addition, Plaintiff explained that he takes only a ten minute lunch in his office. [DSMF ¶ 34].
On August 24, 2010, Sheriff Jackson and Chief Deputy Carter had a meeting with Plaintiff to discuss his job performance. [Jackson Aff. ¶ 18; Jackson Dep. 103, Ex. 24; Carter Dep. at 136; DSMF ¶ 35]. Jackson testified that Plaintiff was not getting to know employees and was not "walking through the jail, listening to folks, [and] being active." [Jackson Dep. at 98]. Jackson testified that Plaintiff sat in his office most of the day working on the computer, and "then he would take an occasional walk to the dining room, get his lunch, and sit in his office." [Jackson Dep. at 98]. During the meeting on August 24, Sheriff Jackson told Plaintiff that he had failed [*15]  to walk around the jail, had failed to sufficiently acquaint himself with jail staff, and had failed to be engaged as a Chief Jailer. [DSMF ¶ 36].
Plaintiff testified that on or around September 20, 2010, he gave a letter from his physician, Dr. Suzanne Ferree Turner, to Chief Deputy Carter explaining that Plaintiff "has a sleep disorder that requires him to maintain a consistent night time sleep schedule." [Pla. Dep. at 65-66, Ex. 9]. Dr. Turner's letter went on to state:
Constantly working different shifts, particularly evening and overnight shifts, would be very disruptive to his sleep cycle and could complicate this disorder. Since originally diagnosed with the disorder, and following prescribed sleeping directions he has been able to successfully and consistently work normal daytime hours, and experience normal nightly sleep patterns with no adverse effects. Please strongly consider him for daytime shifts only to maintain this wellness.
[Id.].
The next day, September 21, 2010, Chief Deputy Carter gave Plaintiff a four-week schedule that specified the shifts that Plaintiff was to work to familiarize himself with the staff and operations of the jail. [Jackson Dep. 105-06; Carter Aff. [*16]  ¶ 9, Exs. 1, 2; DSMF ¶ 38]. The document, titled "Tentative Schedule," indicated that Plaintiff was to work an irregular schedule of at least four evening shifts and four morning shifts, with the remainder being day shifts. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 6, Attachment A; PSMF ¶¶ 29, 30]. Because of Plaintiff's daytime duties, the Tentative Schedule prevented Plaintiff from maintaining a regular sleep schedule as recommended by his physician. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 9; PSMF ¶ 36]. Plaintiff testified: "I can and do occasionally perform work at night and outside of daytime working hours when required by exigent circumstances without adverse health consequences, so long as I can generally maintain a regular sleep schedule." [Pla. Dec. ¶ 12; PSMF ¶ 46].
Before hiring Plaintiff as Chief Jailer, Sheriff Jackson had never required a Chief Jailer to follow a specific schedule. [Jackson Dep. at 179; PSMF ¶ 33]. Sheriff Jackson was aware that some of Plaintiff's duties (such as meeting with county and city officials, vendors, and the Jail Monitor, and attending COMSTAT meetings) only could be performed during regular day shift hours, Monday through Friday, regardless of the shift that he was scheduled to work. [PSMF ¶ 31]. [*17]  Because of Plaintiff's daytime responsibilities, the Tentative Schedule, if left unmodified, would have required Plaintiff to work double shifts in varying combinations and to work long periods without a day off. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 8; Pla. Dep. at 77, Ex. 14; PSMF ¶ 32]. On September 24, 2010, Plaintiff sent an email to Chief Deputy Carter informing him that the Tentative Schedule conflicted with his attendance at a departmental retreat and would require him to work "10 days straight of varying morning watch, evening watch and day watch shifts before my scheduled day off." [PSMF ¶ 37]. Carter responded to Plaintiff's email the same day and stated that he would alter Plaintiff's schedule to allow him to attend the departmental retreat but that Plaintiff otherwise would be required to work according to the new schedule. [PSMF ¶ 38].
Three days later, on September 27, 2010, Plaintiff submitted an application for a reasonable accommodation to the Fulton County Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Disability Affairs ("Fulton EEO"). [PSMF ¶ 39; Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 39]. Plaintiff stated on the "Reasonable Accommodations Intake Form" that his sleep disorders and sleep apnea required [*18]  him to work daytime hours consistently while sleeping at night. [Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8]. Plaintiff reported that his conditions did not prevent him from performing any job-related tasks or duties if he is working a "consistent daytime schedule." [Id.]. Plaintiff also wrote, "If I were permitted to work daytime hours, as I was told I would be working when hired, I could work productively." [Pla. Dep. at 64-65, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 41]. On October 13, 2010, the Fulton EEO sent Sheriff Jackson a letter certifying that Plaintiff was a person with a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") who was entitled to the protections offered under the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"). [Doc. 59 at 58; PSMF ¶ 40].
Plaintiff testified that on October 19, 2010, Chief Deputy Carter changed Plaintiff's work schedule so that he was no longer required to work a rotating shift schedule; instead, Carter told Plaintiff that he was restored back to the day shift. [Pla. Dep. at 97]. The next day, October 20, 2010, the Fulton EEO conducted a meeting with Plaintiff and Chief Deputy Carter to discuss Plaintiff's accommodation request. [Pla. Dep. at 95-96; Doc. 59 at 73; PSMF ¶ 41]. Plaintiff testified: "At [*19]  the meeting we had discussed reasonable accommodations and I interjected and said as of the day before, Chief Carter told me that he was restoring me back to days, to day shift, and Mr. Stokes [the ADA coordinator] asked me if that satisfies as an accommodation and I said yes." [Pla. Dep. at 97]. As a result, the EEO determined that no reasonable accommodation was needed at that time. [Pla. Dep. at 97; Doc. 59 at 73; PSMF ¶ 43].
On October 21, 2010, the day after the EEO meeting, Sheriff Jackson and Chief Deputy Carter met with Plaintiff. [Jackson Dep. at 196-97]. Jackson testified:
The meeting went—generally, we went over—it's the same as August 24th and discussed what I thought his shortcomings were. And I made the comment again. We did our part—We've done our part, you didn't do your part. We did our part to keep him on. He just didn't seem interested in being chief jailer. He didn't take ownership. He spent more time in his office.
[Jackson Dep. at 197]. Jackson testified that, although he tried "to have a dialogue as to why we need to keep him on," Plaintiff "just sat there and looked at me like what are you going to do." [Id. at 198]. According to Sheriff Jackson, he made the decision to [*20]  terminate Plaintiff's employment at that point. [Id.].
Shortly after the meeting with Plaintiff, Sheriff Jackson wrote a letter to Plaintiff stating, "This letter serves as notice that I am no longer in need of your services. Your dismissal will be effective at the close of business Friday, October 29, 2010." [Pla. Dep. at 97-98, Ex. 23]. Plaintiff was given the letter the following morning on October 22. [Pla. Dep. at 98]. Plaintiff testified: "On the morning of the 22nd the sheriff and Chief Carter came to the jail and they said they wanted to speak with me in the conference room and Sheriff Jackson handed me this letter." [Id.]. After Sheriff Jackson left the room, Chief Deputy Carter instructed Plaintiff to hand over his keys, pager, and cellphone, and to gather his belongings. [Id. at 98-99]. Plaintiff was then escorted from the jail. [Id. at 99]. During Plaintiff's employment, Sheriff Jackson had the sole authority to hire and fire Plaintiff. [DSMF ¶ 45]. Chief Deputy Carter did not participate in the decision to terminate Plaintiff. [DSMF ¶ 46].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of Plaintiff's claims.

III. Summary Judgment Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides, "The court shall grant summary [*21]  judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (amended 2010). Rule 56(a) "mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the directed verdict standard under Rule 50(a), which requires the court to grant a directed verdict where there can be but one reasonable conclusion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The movant bears the initial burden of asserting the basis of his motion, and that burden is a light one. See Celotex, 106 S. Ct. at 2553. The movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. See id. Rather, the movant may discharge this burden merely by "'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 2554.
When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the nonmoving [*22]  party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)).
The court will apply these standards in ruling on the motions for summary judgment.

IV. Discussion
Plaintiff Dennis Nelson alleges that Defendant Sheriff Ted Jackson failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability and retaliated against him in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. [Doc. 6, Counts 1, 2; Doc. 31; Doc. 33]. "The Rehabilitation Act prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating against individuals with disabilities." Garrett v. University of Alabama at Birmingham Bd. of Trustees, 507 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 2202, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998)). Specifically, the Act provides, in pertinent part: "No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). "Discrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards used in ADA cases. . . ." Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing [*23]  29 U.S.C. § 794(d)). Therefore, "[c]ases decided under the Rehabilitation Act are precedent for cases under the ADA, and vice-versa." Id. at 1305 n.2 (citing Pritchard v. Southern Company Services, 92 F.3d 1130, 1132 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996)).

A. Failure to Accommodate Claim
In Count I of his complaint, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to make a reasonable accommodation to his disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. [Doc. 6, Count I]. Both Plaintiff and Defendant have moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim. [Docs. 63, 66]. "'When both parties move for summary judgment, the court must evaluate each motion on its own merits, resolving all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.'" Muzzy Products, Corp. v. Sullivan Industries, Inc., 194 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1378 (N.D. Ga. 2002) (quoting Gart v. Logitech, Inc., 254 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, [*24]  and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability.4 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity"). "Thus, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (emphasis in original).
"To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (i) he is disabled; (ii) he is a qualified individual; and (iii) he was discriminated against by defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." Williamson v. Clarke County Dep't of Human Resources, 834 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1319 (S.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). Defendant "Sheriff Jackson concedes that Plaintiff's [*25]  sleep apnea constituted a disability for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act."5 [Doc. 63-4 at 4 n.2]. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is unable to show that he is a "qualified individual." [Doc. 63-4 at 4-8].
The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the [*26]  amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257-58). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of his job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then he is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).
Defendant Sheriff Jackson argues in support of his summary judgment motion that the evidence in the record establishes that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because an essential function of the Chief Jailer's job is to work during all three shifts on a regular basis. [Doc. 63-4 at 4-8]. The Fulton County Jail has three main shifts or watches: day shift/watch from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.; evening shift/watch from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.; and morning shift/watch from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. [DSMF ¶ 4; PSMF ¶ 26]. When Plaintiff was hired as Chief Jailer, the Fulton County Jail had more than 2500 inmates and 600 employees and operated 24 hours a day, seven [*27]  days a week. [DSMF ¶ 3]. Most of the disruptive inmate activity occurs at the jail during the afternoons and evenings. [DSMF ¶ 11]. Sheriff Jackson "wanted [Plaintiff] to show up on all the shifts. . . ." [Jackson Dep. at 106]. However, Plaintiff's sleep apnea requires him to maintain a consistent sleep schedule at night. [Pla. Dep. at 65-66, Ex. 9].
With regard to Defendant's summary judgment motion, the court finds that when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he has offered sufficient evidence to establish that he was capable of performing the essential functions of the Chief Jailer position. When Sheriff Jackson told Plaintiff that he was hiring him, the only information that Jackson gave Plaintiff regarding the required hours of work was that "we expect an honest day's work." [PSMF ¶ 12]. Before hiring Plaintiff as Chief Jailer, Sheriff Jackson had never required a Chief Jailer to follow a specific schedule. [Jackson Dep. at 179; PSMF ¶ 33].
Other record evidence supports a finding that working all three shifts was not an essential function of the Chief Jailer job. The qualifications for the position are defined in a document captioned "Fulton County, [*28]  Georgia; Class Specification; Class Title: Chief Jailer." [PSMF ¶ 17]. Although the Chief Jailer Classification Specification does not include every single essential function that may be assigned to the Chief Jailer, it is significant to note that the "Essential Duties" listed in the Class Specification document do not include any reference to hours of work. [DSMF ¶ 8; PSMF ¶ 18]. Sheriff Jackson testified that he wanted Plaintiff to be present at the jail and talking with people so that the employees from all three shifts knew Plaintiff and recognized him as the Chief Jailer. [Jackson Dep. at 105]. Mark Adger, the current Chief Jailer, likewise testified that "a Chief Jailer has to be familiar with the staff and operations of each of the three main shifts at the jail" and that this is accomplished by regularly rotating his work schedule so that he works each of the three main shifts. [Agder Aff. ¶ 6]. However, even Sheriff Jackson testified that Plaintiff could have achieved the objective of becoming familiar with the evening and morning shifts without working those full shifts. [Jackson Dep. at 180; PSMF ¶ 34]. The court concludes that based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could [*29]  find that Plaintiff was capable of performing the essential functions of the Chief Jailer job. As a result, with respect to Defendant's summary judgment motion, Plaintiff is able to establish the "qualified individual" prima facie element and Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment based on this issue.
However, when analyzing Plaintiff's summary judgment motion, the court must resolve all reasonable inferences against Plaintiff and in favor of Defendant. The undersigned concludes that a reasonable jury, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Defendant, could find that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the Chief Jailer position. When Plaintiff applied for the Chief Jailer position, the Application for Employment stated the following: "Certain positions with Fulton County require shift work, rotating shift work, some other departure from standard daytime operating hours or may require transfer to another location. If it is necessary of a position into which you are placed, would you accept these conditions?" [PSMF ¶ 14]. In response, Plaintiff indicated, "Yes." [PSMF ¶ 15]. But as previously noted, Plaintiff's sleep apnea requires him [*30]  to maintain a consistent sleep schedule at night. [Pla. Dep. at 65-66, Ex. 9]. Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Suzanne Turner, wrote a letter saying that "[c]onstantly working different shifts, particularly evening and overnight shifts, would be very disruptive to his sleep cycle and could complicate" his sleep disorder. [Id.]. Dr. Turner asked that Plaintiff be assigned to work "daytime shifts only to maintain [his] wellness." [Id.]. Sheriff Jackson, however, could not guarantee a set shift or only daytime hours for the Chief Jailer without compromising the usefulness of the Chief Jailer and the effective operation of the jail. [DSMF ¶ 6]. The Chief Jailer is responsible for the operations of the jail 24 hours a day, seven days a week and must be able to work at any time on any given day. [DSMF ¶¶ 10, 14].
"Mandatory shift rotations are often considered an essential function of an employee's position, particularly in law enforcement and hospitals where safety is a primary concern." Mattingly v. University of South Florida Bd. of Trustees, 931 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1183 (M.D. Fla. 2013). Plaintiff acknowledges that most of the disruptive inmate activity occurs at the Fulton County Jail during the afternoons and evenings. [DSMF ¶ 11; Plaintiff's Response to DSMF ¶ 11]. Yet Plaintiff was unable [*31]  to consistently work evening and overnight shifts due to his disability. The court concludes that based on these facts, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of the Chief Jailer position. Defendant, like Plaintiff, has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual" under the Rehabilitation Act. Because Plaintiff is not entitled to judgment in his favor at this stage of the litigation, it is RECOMMENDED that Plaintiff Nelson's motion [Doc. 66] for partial summary judgment be DENIED on his failure to accommodate claim. [Doc. 6, Count I].
In response to Defendant's summary judgment motion, as discussed supra, Plaintiff is able to establish the first two prima facie elements because he is able to show that he is disabled and a qualified individual. The third and final element requires Plaintiff to show that he was subjected to disability discrimination by Defendant's failure to provide reasonable accommodations to his disability. See Williamson, 834 F. Supp. 2d at 1319 (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255). An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make a reasonable [*32]  accommodation for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson, 379 Fed. Appx. at 927 ("An employer impermissibly discriminates against a qualified individual when the employer does not reasonably accommodate the individual's disability."). A reasonable accommodation may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B).
An employer is not required, however, to provide an employee with "'the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1997)). Although the ADA lists types of possible accommodations, the fact that a particular accommodation may be included does not mean that such accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable" under the statute. See Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 1998). The accommodation must also be reasonable based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Id.; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. "An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the [*33]  ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60. "'In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job.'" Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citation omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of [his] job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Thus, "[t]he plaintiff bears the burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, and an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which the employee desires." Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285-86).
An employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee to identify his limitations and possible accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). But when a plaintiff fails to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable accommodation, "'the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant.'" Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (quoting Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any [*34]  duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Id.; see also Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. Appx. 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) ("where the employee failed to identify a reasonable accommodation, the employer had no affirmative duty to engage in an interactive process") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, Plaintiff contends that he requested to work daytime hours only as a reasonable accommodation to his sleep disorder. [Doc. 74 at 10-14]. Plaintiff testified that on or around September 20, 2010, he gave a letter from his physician, Dr. Turner, to Chief Deputy Carter explaining that Plaintiff "has a sleep disorder that requires him to maintain a consistent night time sleep schedule." [Pla. Dep. at 65-66, Ex. 9]. Dr. Turner's letter also stated: "Constantly working different shifts, particularly evening and overnight shifts, would be very disruptive to his sleep cycle and could complicate this disorder. . . . Please strongly consider him for daytime shifts only. . . ." [Id.]. Defendant, however, did not respond by engaging in an informal, interactive process with Plaintiff to identify his limitations and possible accommodations. Instead, [*35]  the next day, September 21, 2010, Chief Deputy Carter gave Plaintiff a four-week schedule indicating that Plaintiff was to work an irregular schedule of at least four evening shifts and four morning shifts, with the remainder being day shifts. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 6, Attachment A; PSMF ¶¶ 29, 30]. The schedule would have prevented Plaintiff from maintaining a regular sleep schedule as recommended by his physician. [Pla. Dec. ¶ 9; PSMF ¶ 36].
On September 27, 2010, Plaintiff submitted an application for a reasonable accommodation to the Fulton EEO. [PSMF ¶ 39; Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 39]. Plaintiff stated on the "Reasonable Accommodations Intake Form" that his sleep disorders and sleep apnea required him to work daytime hours consistently while sleeping at night. [Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8]. Plaintiff reported that his conditions did not prevent him from performing any job-related tasks or duties if he was working a "consistent daytime schedule." [Id.]. Plaintiff also wrote, "If I were permitted to work daytime hours, as I was told I would be working when hired, I could work productively." [Pla. Dep. at 64-65, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 41].
Although Plaintiff argues that his request to work daytime hours [*36]  only was a reasonable accommodation to his sleep disorder, Defendant argues that it was not reasonable. [Doc. 63-4 at 9-11]. Sheriff Jackson wanted Plaintiff to be present at the jail during various shifts so that the employees from all three shifts knew Plaintiff and recognized him as the Chief Jailer. [Jackson Dep. at 105]. Mark Adger, the current Chief Jailer, likewise testified that "a Chief Jailer has to be familiar with the staff and operations of each of the three main shifts at the jail" and that this is accomplished by regularly rotating his work schedule so that he works each shift. [Agder Aff. ¶ 6].
The problem with Defendant's argument, and the reason the court finds it unpersuasive, is that even Sheriff Jackson testified that Plaintiff could have achieved the objective of getting to know employees and becoming familiar with the evening and morning shifts without working those full shifts. [Jackson Dep. at 180; PSMF ¶ 34]. Plaintiff testified: "I can and do occasionally perform work at night and outside of daytime working hours when required by exigent circumstances without adverse health consequences, so long as I can generally maintain a regular sleep schedule." [Pla. [*37]  Dec. ¶ 12; PSMF ¶ 46]. Moreover, Defendant's response to Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request supports a finding that working various shifts was not an essential function of the Chief Jailer position. Plaintiff testified that on October 19, 2010, within a week after the Fulton EEO sent Sheriff Jackson a letter certifying that Plaintiff was a person with an ADA-defined disability, Chief Deputy Carter changed Plaintiff's work schedule so that he was no longer required to work a rotating shift schedule. Instead, Carter told Plaintiff that he was restored back to the day shift. [Pla. Dep. at 97; Doc. 59 at 58; PSMF ¶ 40]. The next day, October 20, 2010, the Fulton EEO conducted a meeting with Plaintiff and Chief Deputy Carter to discuss Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request. [Pla. Dep. at 95-96; Doc. 59 at 73; PSMF ¶ 41]. Plaintiff testified: "At the meeting we had discussed reasonable accommodations and I interjected and said as of the day before, Chief Carter told me that he was restoring me back to days, to day shift, and Mr. Stokes [the ADA coordinator] asked me if that satisfies as an accommodation and I said yes." [Pla. Dep. at 97].
As discussed above, "[a]n accommodation [*38]  is 'reasonable' and necessary . . . if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60. Plaintiff believed that working the day shift exclusively would still enable him to perform the essential functions of the Chief Jailer job. Given Plaintiff's testimony that Chief Deputy Carter scheduled Plaintiff to work only daytime hours, it is reasonable to infer that Carter likewise believed that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the Chief Jailer position without working a rotating shift schedule. A reasonable jury could view these facts and find that working the day shift was a reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff's sleep disorder. Plaintiff, however, was not permitted to continue his employment by working the accommodated schedule. The day after the EEO meeting, Sheriff Jackson made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. [Jackson Dep. at 196-98]. In light of these facts, the court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to show that he was subjected to disability discrimination by Defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to the disability. Because Plaintiff Nelson is able to establish all three prima facie [*39]  elements in support of his failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 6, Count I], the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 63] be DENIED on this claim.
B. Retaliation Claim
Plaintiff Nelson's next claim is that he was subjected to retaliation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. [Doc. 6, Count II]. "The Rehabilitation Act incorporates the anti-retaliation provision from § 12203(a) of the [ADA] . . . ." Burgos-Stefanelli v. Secretary, United States Dep't of Homeland Security, 410 Fed. Appx. 243, 245 (11th Cir. 2011). "Under the ADA's anti-retaliation provision, '[n]o person shall discriminate against an individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter.'" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)). Because this provision is similar to Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, courts "assess retaliation claims pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act under the framework . . . use[d] in assessing Title VII retaliation claims." Id. (citing Ellis, 432 F.3d at 1323-24; Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287).
In University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim "must establish that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer." The Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework continues to apply after Nassar. See Mealing v. Georgia Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 564 Fed. Appx. 421, 427 n.9 (11th Cir. 2014). Under this framework, [*40]  the allocation of burdens and order of presentation and proof are as follows: (1) the plaintiff has the burden of proving a prima facie case of retaliation; (2) if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden (of production) shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action taken against the employee; and (3) should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must have an opportunity to prove that the legitimate reason offered by defendant was a pretext for retaliation. See McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1824-25. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must prove that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. See Mealing, 564 Fed. Appx. at 427; Burgos-Stefanelli, 410 Fed. Appx. at 246.
Plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity when he submitted an application for a reasonable accommodation to the Fulton EEO on September 27, 2010. [PSMF ¶ 39; Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 39]. He was subjected to an adverse employment action when Defendant Sheriff Jackson terminated Plaintiff's employment on October 21, 2010. [Jackson Dep. at 196-97]. Plaintiff is also [*41]  able to establish the causal link element prima facie element. "If an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee shortly after becoming aware of the employee's protected expression, then the close temporal proximity between the two events is generally sufficient for a plaintiff to establish but-for causation." Stacey-Suggs v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 44 F. Supp. 3d 1262, 1287 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000) ("The general rule is that close temporal proximity between the employee's protected conduct and the adverse employment action is sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact of a causal connection."). In Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001), the Supreme Court stated that "mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action . . . must be 'very close[.]'" In the present case, Plaintiff is able to meet this standard. Less than a month elapsed between Plaintiff's submission of his application for a reasonable accommodation and his termination. Given these facts, Defendant Sheriff Jackson concedes that Plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. [Doc. 63-4 at 14].
"Once a prima facie case has been demonstrated, the defendant [*42]  must proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287). To satisfy his burden of production, "'[t]he defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.'" Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). "'[T]o satisfy this intermediate burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.'" Id. (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1096) (emphasis in original). "Defendant's burden at this stage is 'exceedingly light.'" EEOC v. Comcast of Ga., Inc., 560 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1310 (N.D. Ga. 2008) (quoting Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, N.A., 36 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (11th Cir. 1994)).
Defendant alleges that "Plaintiff was terminated because he had lost credibility, respect, confidence, trust and support of his subordinates and superiors." [Doc. 63-4 at 15]. Defendant Sheriff Jackson cites to three incidents which he says establish that Plaintiff was fired due to his poor job performance as Chief Jailer. First, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff's performance appraisal in June 2010 was downgraded after he requested a reevaluation. [Id.]. Defendant next asserts [*43]  that on July 19, 2010, Plaintiff was given a detailed, written description of what was expected of him as Chief Jailer. [Id.]. Finally, Defendant Jackson and Chief Deputy Carter met with Plaintiff on August 24, 2010, to discuss his job performance. [Id.]. Defendant argues that these incidents establish that for many months before his termination, Plaintiff's superiors were not pleased with his performance in his position as Chief Jailer and that his performance did not improve. [Id. at 15-16].
According to Defendant, Plaintiff consistently arrived for work late and left early, stayed in his office and resisted walking the floors of the jail, and resisted communicating directly with his employees. [Doc. 63-4 at 16]. In addition, Defendant asserts that in July 2010, when Plaintiff was directed to walk the floors of the jail and to work two evening watches and two morning watches, "he balked at the directive."6 [Id.]. Defendant Sheriff Jackson alleges that he had not made up his mind whether to terminate Plaintiff's employment until October 21, 2010, when Jackson and Chief Deputy Carter met with Plaintiff. [Id. at 17; Jackson Dep. at 196-97]. According to Sheriff Jackson, he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's [*44]  employment during the meeting. [Doc. 63-4 at 17]. Defendant writes, "Sheriff Jackson went to see Plaintiff, still with an open mind, to discuss once more Plaintiff's performance and to hear what Plaintiff had to say for himself. Plaintiff, however, had nothing to say. According to Sheriff Jackson, Plaintiff simply stared at him, as if to say, 'What are you going to do?'" [Id.]. In light of these facts, the court finds that Defendant has satisfied his exceedingly light burden of producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.
Once a defendant meets his burden of production, "the presumption of discrimination created by the McDonnell Douglas framework 'drops from the case,' and 'the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1528 (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1094-95 & n.10). The plaintiff then "has the opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1825). "[A] plaintiff may not in all cases merely rest on the laurels of [his] prima facie case in the face of powerful justification evidence offered by the defendant." Grigsby v. Reynolds Metals Co., 821 F.2d 590, 596 (11th Cir. 1987). Plaintiff's demonstration of pretext merges [*45]  with his "ultimate burden of showing that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff." Holifield, 115 F.3d at 1565 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). This task is a highly focused one.
The court "must, in view of all the evidence, determine whether the plaintiff has cast sufficient doubt on the defendant's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer's proffered 'legitimate reasons were not what actually motivated its conduct[.]'" Combs, 106 F.3d at 1538 (quoting Cooper-Houston v. Southern Ry. Co., 37 F.3d 603, 605 (11th Cir. 1994)). Plaintiff "'may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Jackson v. State of Alabama State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Burdine, 101 S. Ct. at 1095). In order to establish pretext through the indirect method, the plaintiff "must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff argues that sufficient record evidence exists for a reasonable jury to find that Defendant's proffered reasons are a pretext [*46]  for retaliation. As noted supra, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's job performance was deficient. In support of this contention, Sheriff Jackson notes that a detailed, written description of the Chief Jailer's duties and responsibilities was given to Plaintiff by Chief Carter on July 19, 2010. [Doc. 63-4 at 15]. Carter required Plaintiff to sign the document outlining the job requirements of the "Jail Administrator," which included the following purported "essential duty": "Work a full evening shift (3 p.m. - 11 p.m.) and morning shift (11 p.m. - 7 a.m.) at least twice a month for both shifts. You are required to walk the floors while working these shifts." [PSMF ¶ 27; DSMF ¶ 31; Carter Dep. 165, Ex. 8]. Defendant alleges that Plaintiff "balked at the directive." [Doc. 63-4 at 16]. Plaintiff testified that after being given the directive to work evening and morning watches, he "immediately began working those shifts as instructed." [Pla. 2nd Dec. ¶ 17].
Sheriff Jackson cites to evidence showing that he and Chief Deputy Carter had a meeting with Plaintiff on August 24, 2010, to discuss his job performance. [Jackson Aff. ¶ 18; Jackson Dep. 103, Ex. 24; Carter Dep. at 136; DSMF ¶ 35]. [*47]  Jackson testified that Plaintiff sat in his office most of the day working on the computer, and "then he would take an occasional walk to the dining room, get his lunch, and sit in his office." [Jackson Dep. at 98]. During the meeting on August 24, Sheriff Jackson told Plaintiff that he had failed to walk around the jail, had failed to sufficiently acquaint himself with jail staff, and had failed to be engaged as a Chief Jailer. [DSMF ¶ 36]. Although this evidence reveals that Defendant was not entirely pleased with Plaintiff's work performance in the summer of 2010, the court finds that when the relevant facts are viewed in their entirety, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant's proffered explanations are pretexts for retaliatory animus.
Plaintiff submitted an application for a reasonable accommodation to the Fulton EEO on September 27, 2010. [PSMF ¶ 39; Pla. Dep. at 64, Ex. 8; DSMF ¶ 39]. On October 13, 2010, the Fulton EEO sent Sheriff Jackson a letter certifying that Plaintiff was a person with a disability within the meaning of the ADA who was entitled to the protections offered under the ADAAA. [Doc. 59 at 58; PSMF ¶ 40]. Plaintiff testified that on October 19, 2010, [*48]  Chief Deputy Carter changed Plaintiff's work schedule so that he was no longer required to work a rotating shift schedule. [Pla. Dep. at 97]. The Fulton EEO conducted a meeting with Plaintiff and Chief Deputy Carter on October 20, 2010, to discuss Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request. [Pla. Dep. at 95-96; Doc. 59 at 73; PSMF ¶ 41]. The next day, October 21, 2010, Sheriff Jackson made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment. [Jackson Dep. at 196-98]. The extremely close temporal proximity between Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request, the Fulton EEO's actions in notifying Defendant of Plaintiff's disability and meeting with Chief Carter, and Defendant's termination decision is evidence of pretext. See Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care System, Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1298 (11th Cir. 2006).
While this temporal proximity, in itself, may not be sufficient to establish pretext, other evidence casts doubt on Defendant's proffered reasons. See id. Sheriff Jackson cites to Plaintiff's job performance in support of his termination decision. But Jackson acknowledges that even as late as October 20, the day of the EEO meeting, he had not determined that Plaintiff's job performance warranted termination. Sheriff Jackson testified that he only made the termination [*49]  decision during his meeting with Plaintiff on October 21, 2010. [Jackson Dep. at 198]. Jackson offered the vague assertion that he decided to fire Plaintiff because he "just sat there and looked at me like what are you going to do." [Id.].
Defendant also asserts that one of the factors contributing to Plaintiff's termination was his performance appraisal completed by Chief Deputy Carter in June 2010. The appraisal was downgraded allegedly after Plaintiff requested a reevaluation. [Doc. 63-4 at 15]. The amended performance appraisal, however, contradicts a number of Defendant's allegations. For example, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff consistently arrived for work late and left early. [Doc. 63-4 at 16]. But the amended appraisal dated June 30, 2010, reveals that Carter rated Plaintiff's punctuality and attendance as "satisfactory," not "unsatisfactory." [Doc. 57 at 51]. Furthermore, Chief Carter summarized Plaintiff's job performance in the amended appraisal by writing:
Generally, Chief Nelson is doing an acceptable job. What he lacks in supervision in [sic] based on size and complexity of the problems he is faced with. He demonstrates his ability to work and be successful in such a [*50]  complex environment. I do not foresee any reason as to why he will not achieve an exceptional level in all critical elements leading up to his next performance review.
[Doc. 57 at 49]. Although Defendant cites the amended performance appraisal in support of his decision to fire Plaintiff, Chief Carter's positive comments about Plaintiff's "ability to work and be successful" could support a reasonable factfinder's conclusion that Plaintiff's job performance was not what actually motivated the adverse employment action.
In summary, the court finds that Plaintiff has not only established that his protected activity was a "but-for" cause of his termination, he has also carried his burden of offering evidence sufficient to permit a jury to find that Defendant's proffered legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons are pretexts for retaliation. Defendant Sheriff Jackson made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment the day after the Fulton EEO met with Plaintiff and Chief Deputy Carter to discuss Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request. [Pla. Dep. at 95-96; Doc. 59 at 73; PSMF ¶ 41; Jackson Dep. at 196-98]. This was approximately a week after the Fulton EEO sent Sheriff Jackson a letter [*51]  certifying that Plaintiff was disabled and entitled to the protections offered under the ADAAA. [Doc. 59 at 58; PSMF ¶ 40]. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff consistently arrived for work late and left early, but the performance appraisal cited by Defendant shows that Plaintiff's punctuality and attendance were rated as "satisfactory," not "unsatisfactory." [Doc. 63-4 at 16; Doc. 57 at 51]. And in the same appraisal, Chief Carter wrote that Plaintiff was doing an acceptable job and that he had demonstrated an ability to work and be successful in a complex environment. [Doc. 57 at 49]. In addition, despite Defendant's claims that Plaintiff was terminated due to his poor job performance, Jackson testified that even as late as October 20, 2010, he had not yet decided that Plaintiff's job performance warranted termination. The court concludes that, in light of these facts, Plaintiff has demonstrated sufficient weaknesses and inconsistencies in Defendant's proffered reasons for terminating Plaintiff's employment that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that they are lacking in credence. See McCann, 526 F.3d at 1375-76. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 63] be [*52]  DENIED on Plaintiff's retaliation claim brought pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act. [Doc. 6, Count II].

V. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the court RECOMMENDS that Defendant Sheriff Jackson's motion [Doc. 63] for summary judgment be DENIED on Plaintiff Nelson's Rehabilitation Act claims for failure to accommodate [Doc. 6, Count I] and retaliation [Doc. 6, Count II]. The court further RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion [Doc. 66] for partial summary judgment be DENIED on his failure to accommodate claim [Doc. 6, Count I]. It is ORDERED that Defendant's motions [Docs. 71, 77] to strike be DENIED.
All pretrial matters have been concluded with the issuance of this Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), this Court's Local Rule 72.1, and Standing Order 08-01 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2008). The Clerk, therefore, is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO ORDERED AND RECOMMENDED THIS 18th day of May, 2016.
