Opinion



ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant School Board of Broward County's ("School Board" or "Defendant") Motion to Dismiss ("Motion") (DE [37]). For the reasons discussed below, the Motion to Dismiss is granted.
I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Brigette Bodie-Jernigan ("Bodie" or "Plaintiff"), has been employed as a teacher for the School Board since August 2007, most recently at the Dillard 6-12 School. (DE [33] ¶¶ 15, 17). Defendant School Board is a School District located in Broward County, Florida which has, amongst other things, the "authority to administer personnel practices and procedures, for employees, such as the Plaintiff." (DE [33] ¶ 16). Bodie has sued School Board asserting, under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation (Count I) and retaliation (Count II). [*2] 1
Bodie alleges that she suffers from "an auto-immune disorder with medical conditions, which additionally, include renal insufficiency post nephrectomy, s/p cardiac surgery/ASD-repair and prediabetes." (DE [33] at ¶ 2). These conditions, she claims, could result in "severe life-threatening complications" if she is exposed to either COVID-19 or other airborne pathogens. (DE [33] ¶ 2). Because of her conditions, Bodie requested an accommodation that would allow her to work from home. This request was initially granted for approximately two months (October 2020 through January 8, 2021). (DE [33] ¶ 18). Bodie's request to indefinitely work from home beyond January 8, 2021 was not granted. (DE [33] ¶ 26). Bodie asserts that her request to work from home amounts to a "reasonable accommodation" and the School Board's failure to grant it amounts to discrimination under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. 12112; (DE [33] ¶ 35).
Because the School Board did not grant her request to work from home, Bodie alleges that she was forced, in February 2021, to take a personal leave of absence without pay. (DE [33] ¶¶ 22, 31). She further claims this amounts to an adverse employment action in violation of the ADA's prohibition against [*3]  retaliation. 42 U.S.C. 12203. (DE [33] ¶ 49).
School Board moves to dismiss the Complaint with prejudice.
II. LEGAL STANDARD

a. Motion to Dismiss
To survive a motion to dismiss, "factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level" and must be sufficient "to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "The mere possibility the defendant acted unlawfully is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss." Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., 578 F.3d 1252, 1261 (11th Cir. 2009), abrogated on other grounds by Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U.S. 449, 132 S. Ct. 1702, 182 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2012).
In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court's review is generally "limited to the four corners of the complaint." Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., 555 F.3d 949, 959 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting St. George v. Pinellas Cty., 285 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2002)). The court must review the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and it must generally accept the plaintiff's well-pleaded facts as true. See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984). But "[c]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Jackson v. BellSouth Telecommunications, 372 F.3d 1250, 1262 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); see also Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 ("[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in [*4]  a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.").

b. ADA

i. Reasonable Accommodation
To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) [s]he is disabled; (2) [s]he is a qualified individual; and (3) [s]he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000)). A "qualified" individual is someone who "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). An employer must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with known disabilities unless such accommodations would result in undue hardship to the employer. See Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir.1996). "An 'accommodation' is 'reasonable'—and, therefore, required under the ADA—only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." See LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998). "[T]he ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted).
"The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such [*5]  accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000).

ii. Retaliation
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge . . . under [the ADA]." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To set out a prima facie case for retaliation, the plaintiff must show that "(1) [s]he engaged in a statutorily protected expression; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the adverse action and h[er] protected expression."
ADA retaliation claims are analyzed "under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims." Williams-Evans v. Advance Auto Parts, 843 F. App'x 144, 148 (11th Cir. 2021) (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997). Only tangible employment actions are actionable under these frameworks. See Hulsey v. Pride Restaurants, LLC, 367 F.3d 1238, 1244 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). Tangible employment actions include "significant change[s] in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits." Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 434 F.3d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998)).
III. DISCUSSION

a. Count I
To survive a motion to dismiss, Bodie—assuming she is disabled—needs to have sufficiently alleged that she is a qualified individual and if so, that the School Board [*6]  denied her a reasonable accommodation.2 Bodie's claim fails because she can sufficiently allege neither.
In the Amended Complaint, Bodie alleges that she can perform the essential functions of her job as an instructional staff member so long as she is able to work remotely from home. (DE [33] ¶ 5). But nowhere in the Amended Complaint does Bodie state the essential functions of her job position. Her conclusory statements that she can perform them, without stating what they are, are the exact types of statements that are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1262. Bodie claims that she has been an instructional staff member under Defendant's employ since August 2007. (DE [33] ¶ 17). She brings the instant claims alleging "severe life threatening complications, based on exposure to COVID-19, and or other airborne pathogens, in the workplace/school environment" after thirteen years at the school. The case is clearly premised upon COVID-19.
While reasonable accommodations in the context of various forms of employment have included remote work, one must be a "qualified individual" before the Court even reaches the accommodations question. Teachers have been found by Courts in the [*7]  11th Circuit to be not qualified if they cannot attend work.
Regular attendance and punctuality are essential functions of the job of a teacher. When a teacher is late or absent a substitute teacher must be found. The work of a teacher cannot merely be done after hours, or off site. Much of the work requires face to face interaction with, and regular supervision of, children. Because the tasks are of a kind which must be done at a certain time and at a certain location, regular and timely attendance at work are essential functions of the job of a teacher. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1366 (quoting Jackson, 22 F.3d at 279); Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir. 2000) (finding that mandatory overtime was an essential function of the job of a "Connect and Disconnect" employee). Mills has unquestionably failed to perform these essential functions of her job, and is therefore unqualified unless she is granted an accommodation, reasonable or unreasonable.
Mills v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., No. CV 03-AR-3087-S, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58584, 2005 WL 8158200, at *5 (N.D. Ala. July 27, 2005).
Even if this Court were to find Plaintiff to be a qualified individual, the Amended Complaint provides that Bodie's only accommodation request is that she be permitted to work from the home indefinitely.3 Based on the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint and the relevant caselaw, this request was not reasonable.
To start, Bodie does not [*8]  allege the essential functions of her job. Without them, it is impossible to evaluate whether her request to work indefinitely from home is reasonable—and that she can perform the essential functions of her job— if the court does not know what her job entails. Even if Bodie had alleged her essential job functions, a request for a teacher to work indefinitely from home, even back in December 2020, is not a reasonable request. It is hardly disputed that in-person learning provides a far superior learning experience for children. Indefinitely subjecting Bodie's students to this type of learning environment would be both unfair and unreasonable, especially once COVID-19 rates subsided or a vaccine was developed.4
On that point, Bodie's accommodation request was not reasonable because she did not tie her request to work from home to a rate of new COVID-19 infections or the timing of the flu season. To be sure, when Bodie requested to indefinitely work from home newly reported cases of COVID-19 were spiking.5 But a reasonable request, at this time, would have been for an accommodation to work from home until newly reported cases subsided. The Amended Complaint does not indicate that Bodie made [*9]  such a request; in fact, the Amended Complaint indicates her request was even broader. Bodie alleged that exposure to COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens would cause severe life-threatening complications. (DE [33] ¶ 3). Thus, her accommodation request was really to work from home until there were no airborne pathogens in the school that could cause her severe life-threatening complications. Since it is hard to imagine a school with no airborne pathogens, Bodie's request to work from home appears to have been a request to permanently work from home. Such a request is facially unreasonable.
Three charges in the Amended Complaint potentially indicate that Bodie's accommodation request was reasonable. Bodie, however, did not plead sufficient facts to be able to properly evaluate those claims. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1262.
First, Bodie argued that allowing her to work from home would not place an undue hardship on School Board because it could have allowed her to teach in the school's "Virtual School." (DE [33] ¶ 8). But Bodie does not plead sufficient facts to determine whether it is reasonable to have her teach in that program. To start, it is not clear if School Board has always operated a Virtual School [*10]  or if it was a temporary solution developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that Defendant intended to phase out as COVID-19 rates decreased. It is thus not clear that the Virtual School is a plausible indefinite accommodation. Even if the Virtual School is a core program that the School Board operates indefinitely, there are insufficient facts to determine whether Bodie can perform the essential functions of an instructional staff member of that program.6 In sum, the Amended Complaint contains insufficient facts to evaluate whether having Bodie teach in the Virtual School is a reasonable alternative.
Second, Bodie argued that her request to work from home could not be unreasonable since other employees were permitted to work from home. (DE [33] ¶ 23). Bodie alleged no other facts to support this point. Lacking from this allegation are any facts that (1) show that the employees who received this accommodation were similarly situated to Bodie, see Garrison v. City of Tallahassee, 664 F. App'x 823, 826 (11th Cir. 2016) (indicating that evidence that similarly situated individuals received the accommodation is proof that an accommodation is reasonable), or (2) that show these employees were permitted to indefinitely work from home. Without these facts, [*11]  Bodie's claim is conclusory and insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1262.
Third, Bodie argues that her request to work from home indefinitely could not impose an undue hardship on School Board since she was initially allowed to work from home from October 2020 through January 8, 2021. (DE [33] ¶¶ 8, 18). But a two-month accommodation is an entirely different scenario than an indefinite accommodation. Just because the school was able to manage an accommodation for two months does not mean that it could manage it for eternity.
In sum, Bodie's request to work indefinitely from home was not reasonable. It was her responsibility to present a reasonable accommodation to School Board, and she failed to do so, or at least allege so in her complaint. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. As such, Bodie's complaint that School Board violated 42 U.S.C. 12101 is dismissed without prejudice.

b. Count II — Retaliation
Bodie also claimed that School Board violated the retaliation provision of the ADA. (DE [33] ¶ 44). But, because of her disability, Bodie was not the recipient of any adverse action. She has thus not sufficiently set forth a prima facie case for retaliation; Count II is also dismissed.
Bodie's complaint alleges that she was [*12]  subjected to an adverse employment action because she was "compelled to take a prolonged period of leave of absence, without pay." (DE [33] ¶ 49). But School Board did not compel her to take this action; she elected to do so on her own. As far as the Amended Complaint indicates, School Board did not mandate that she take personal leave or fire her from her job. Nor is there any indication that School Board was not willing to provide Bodie her position once she decided to come off her personal leave. School Board's only action with respect to Bodie's employment was to deny her the ability to work remotely, and the denial of a request to work from home does not amount to an adverse employment action that is actionable under the ADA. See Cotton, 434 F.3d at 1231. As such, Bodie's complaint that School Board violated 42 U.S.C. 12203 is dismissed without prejudice. Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that School Board's Motion to Dismiss (DE [37]) is GRANTED. Count I and Count II of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (DE [33]) are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Plaintiff may file an Amended Complaint within 14 Days of entry of this order.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 8th day of August, 2023. [*13]
