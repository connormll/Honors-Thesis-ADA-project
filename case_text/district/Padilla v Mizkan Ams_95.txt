Opinion



Order Granting in part and Denying in part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment
On September 25, 2015, Defendant Mizkan Americas, Inc. ("Defendant") filed its Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"). (Doc. 22.) Plaintiff Jesus Padilla ("Plaintiff") filed his Opposition to the Motion ("Opposition"), a separate Declaration in support of his Opposition ("Padilla Declaration"), and a Statement of Disputed Facts ("SDF") on October 5, 2015. (Docs. 23, 24, 25.) Plaintiff's lawyer, Jihan Smaili, also filed a Declaration ("Smaili Declaration") along with several Exhibits in support of the Opposition. (Doc. 26.) Defendant replied to the Opposition on October 9, [*2]  2015. (Doc. 27.)
After considering the papers filed in support of, and in opposition to, the Motion, as well as the arguments advanced at the hearing on the Motion, the Court GRANTS the Motion IN PART and DENIES the Motion IN PART.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Allegations in the Complaint
Plaintiff began working for Defendant in 2006. (Compl. (Doc. 1-1) ¶ 7.) On January 23, 2013, Plaintiff sustained a work-related injury to his back while performing his duties as a Rice Saccharification1 Operator. (See id. ¶¶ 8, 10.) Thereafter, his doctors placed him off work, so that he could receive the appropriate medical treatment. (Id. ¶¶ 11-13.) Upon the advice of his physicians, Plaintiff also filed for workers' compensation in March 2013. (Id. ¶ 14.) Plaintiff later attended a meeting with his supervisor, Human Resources Manager Brian Jackson. (Id. ¶ 17.) Though it is unclear what they discussed, Jackson ultimately discharged Plaintiff for failing to attend work. (Id.)
Plaintiff now brings 11 claims against Defendant: (1) Disability Discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (2) Age Discrimination under FEHA; (3) Refusal to Accommodate under FEHA; (4) Refusal [*3]  to Engage in the Interactive Process under FEHA; (5) Failure to Prevent/Remedy Discrimination under FEHA; (6) Discrimination Based on Protected Activity under FEHA; (7) Retaliation under the California Labor Code; (8) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy; (9) Violation of Article I, § 8 of the California Constitution; (10) Unfair Competition; and (11) Failure to Pay Wages and Waiting Time Penalties.
Defendant moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. (See Motion at 1-4.)

B. Request for Judicial Notice
Along with its Reply, Defendant also filed a Request for Judicial Notice ("RJN"). (Doc. 27-5.) The RJN requests the Court take judicial notice of (1) Plaintiff's Petition for Discrimination Benefits, filed with the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board on May 14, 2014, and (2) the fact that it is still pending with the Board.
A court may take judicial notice of court filings and other matters of public record. See Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006). Padilla's Petition appears to be a court filing, and the fact that the Petition is still pending is a matter of public record, as Defendant obtained such information using a "public . . . search" engine. (Exhs. 1-2, Doc. 27-5.) Accordingly, the Court takes judicial notice of these exhibits. See [*4]  Grant v. Aurora Loan Servs., Inc., 736 F. Supp. 2d 1257, 1264 (C.D. Cal. 2010); Velazquez v. GMAC Mortg. Corp., 605 F. Supp. 2d 1049, 1057-58 (C.D. Cal. 2008).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication shall be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). The moving party must show that "under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.
Generally, the burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that it is entitled to summary judgment. Margolis v. Ryan, 140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir. 1998); Retail Clerks Union Local 648 v. Hub Pharmacy, Inc., 707 F.2d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir. 1983). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying the elements of the claim or defense and evidence that it believes demonstrates the absence of an issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).
Where the non-moving party has the burden at trial, however, the moving party need not produce evidence negating or disproving every essential element of the non-moving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Instead, the moving party's burden is met by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence supporting the non-moving party's case. Id.
"If a moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything, even if the nonmoving party would have the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. V. Fritz Co., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). "In such a case, the nonmoving party may [*5]  defeat the motion for summary judgment without producing anything." Id. at 1103.
If the moving party carries its burden of production, however, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256; Nissan Fire, 210 F.3d at 1103. The non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters in issue by the motion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. See also William W. Schwarzer, A. Wallace Tashima & James M. Wagstaffe, Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, § 14:144. "This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence." In re Oracle Corp. Secs. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252).
A genuine issue of material fact will exist "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir. 1991); T.W. Elec. Serv. Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).

III. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS
Before setting forth the uncontroverted facts, the Court examines the admissibility of the evidence offered by both sides in support of, and opposition to, the Motion for Summary Judgment. "A trial court can only consider admissible [*6]  evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Orr v. Bank of America, 285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir. 2002). At this stage, however, a district court should "focus on the admissibility of the [evidence's] contents," "not . . . on the admissibility of [its] form." See Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003); Block v. City of Los Angeles, 253 F.3d 410, 418-19 (9th Cir. 2001). Moreover, "objections to evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant, speculative, and/or argumentative, or that it constitutes an improper legal conclusion are all duplicative of the summary judgment standard itself" and thus need not be considered on a motion for summary judgment. Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1120 (E.D. Cal. 2006).

A. Defendant's Evidentiary Objections
Defendant has submitted 26 evidentiary objections ("Objections") to evidence submitted by Plaintiff in opposition to Defendant's Motion. (Doc. 27-4.) Many of the Objections are to Plaintiff's Declaration (Doc. 24). Others are to the Exhibits that his attorney filed in support of the Opposition. The Court considers each of Defendant's Objections, in turn, below.

1. Declaration of Jesus Padilla (Objections 1-13)
Defendant has lodged thirteen evidentiary Objections to Plaintiff's Declaration. (Objections at 2-8.)

a. Objection 1: English Translation
During his deposition earlier this year, Plaintiff testified through a Spanish Interpreter. (See Padilla Deposition [*7]  (Doc. 26-1) at 2.) He later submitted a Declaration to this Court that was entirely in English, without any reference to whether his testimony was translated by a "qualified" interpreter, per Fed. R. Evid. 604. Defendant now asks this Court to strike the Declaration in its entirety. For the reasons set forth below, the Court declines to do so.
Defendant argues that translations are subject to Fed. R. Evid. 604 and 901 -- "Witness testimony translated from a foreign language must be properly authenticated and any interpretation must be shown to be an accurate translation done by a competent translator." See Jack v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 854 F. Supp. 654, 659 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 605 and 901); Sun v. Governmental Authorities on Taiwan, No. C 94-2769 SI, 2001 WL 114443, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 2001). Nonetheless, as the Ninth Circuit stated in Fraser, the "form" of the evidence is irrelevant, so long as its "contents" would be admissible at trial. See Fraser, 342 F.3d at 1036.
Here, if Plaintiff's Declaration was translated from Spanish, he has not properly authenticated the English translation that he submitted to this Court. Nonetheless, "[t]he contents of [his Declaration] are mere recitations of events within [Plaintiff's] personal knowledge and, depending on the circumstances, could be admitted into evidence at trial in a variety of ways." See id. at 1037. Plaintiff declares, among other things, that he met with his doctor, [*8]  that he engaged in a conference call with Defendant on June 10, that he was fired, and that he could perform the essential functions of his job with certain accommodations. (Padilla Declaration (Doc. 24) ¶¶ 2, 9, 11, 12.) Presumably, Plaintiff "could testify to all the relevant portions of [his Declaration] from [his] personal knowledge," through a qualified interpreter in accordance with Fed. R. Evid. 604 and 901. See id. Indeed, he states in his Declaration that he "would and could testify under oath to the facts stated herein." (Padilla Declaration ¶ 1.)
Accordingly, Defendant's objection is OVERRULED.

b. Objection 2: Lacks Foundation
In his Declaration, Plaintiff states that "[b]etween January 24, 2013 and May 16, 2013, Defendant did not attempt to contact me to inquire about my disability and whether I was able to perform any work with or without reasonable accommodation." (Padilla Declaration ¶ 4.) Defendant claims that the assertion "lacks foundation, is argumentative, calls for a legal conclusion and is irrelevant." (Objections at 2.) Plaintiff has personal knowledge as to whether Defendant contacted him.
Accordingly, Defendant's objection is OVERRULED.

c. Objections 3-4, 6-13: Sham Declaration
In each [*9]  of Objections 3-4 and 6-13, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's Declaration is "inconsistent" with his deposition testimony. (Objections at 2-8.) As a result, Defendant contends that most of Plaintiff's Declaration is a "sham." (Reply at 3.)
A sham affidavit is a sworn declaration submitted in support of an opposition to a summary judgment motion that contradicts sworn deposition testimony in an attempt to create a genuine dispute of material fact. Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266 (9th Cir. 1991).
A party, however, "cannot create a genuine issue of material fact to survive summary judgment by contradicting his earlier version of the facts." Block, 253 F.3d at 419 n.2. This is because "if a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact." Van Asdale v. Int'l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, 998 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Kennedy, 952 F.2d at 266).
The sham affidavit rule is nonetheless subject to "two important limitations." See Asdale, 577 F.3d at 998. "First, . . . the district court must make a factual determination that the contradiction was actually a sham" before invoking the rule. Id. "Second, . . . the inconsistency between a party's deposition testimony [*10]  and subsequent affidavit must be clear and unambiguous to justify striking the affidavit." Id. at 998-99. Clarifications of prior testimony and "minor inconsistencies that result from an honest discrepancy, a mistake, or newly discovered evidence afford no basis for excluding an opposition affidavit." See id. at 999.
Here, the Court declines to apply the sham affidavit rule in this case because Plaintiff's Declaration is not a sham. A "district court may find a declaration to be a sham when it contains facts that the affiant previously testified he could not remember." See Yeager v. Bowlin, 693 F.3d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir. 2012). In Yeager, the Ninth Circuit upheld a district court's finding of a sham declaration, where "the deponent remembered almost nothing about the events central to the case during his deposition, but suddenly recalled those same events with perfect clarity in his opposition to summary judgment without any credible explanation as to how his recollection was refreshed." Id. (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, however, Plaintiff answered most of Defendant's questions during his deposition and does not now claim that he remembers new facts without explanation. Accordingly, the Court declines to find Plaintiff submitted [*11]  a sham declaration here.
Furthermore, Objections 3-4, and 6-13 all contain the same conclusory assertion that statements in Plaintiff's Declaration are "inconsistent" with Plaintiff's prior testimony. (Objections at 2-8.) Although Defendant has identified specifically the alleged inconsistencies, it has not further analyzed how they create a genuine issue of material fact. Defendant has also based some of these Objections on other grounds --that Plaintiff's statements lack foundation or are argumentative. Without more, all of these Objections are mere "boilerplate recitations of evidentiary principles or blanket objections without analysis applied to specific items of evidence." See Stonefire Grill, Inc. v. FGF Brands, Inc., 987 F. Supp. 2d 1023, 1033 (C.D. Cal. 2013). "On this basis alone, the Court will not scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of identical objections raised as to each fact." Id. Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES these Objections.
The Court, nonetheless, has reviewed each inconsistency and has found that none are "clear and ambiguous," as the Ninth Circuit has required. See Asdale, 577 F.3d at 998. For example, in Objection 13, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's statement that he "could have performed all of the essential functions of [his] job if . . . given [*12]  [certain] accommodations" is "inconsistent" with his previous statement that he could not do his current job "with his physical restrictions." (Objections at 7-8.) The statements are arguably consistent. Accommodations are meant to alleviate one's physical restrictions. Accordingly, Plaintiff's responses could be interpreted to mean that he could do his job with certain accommodations, but without them, he would not have been able to do so. The Court therefore OVERRULES Objections 3-4 and 6-13.

d. Objection 5: Best Evidence Rule
Defendant also objects to Plaintiff's Declaration as violating the Best Evidence Rule. (Objections at 3.) Under this Rule, "[a]n original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content." Fed. R. Evid. 1002. A "duplicate" will also suffice "unless a genuine question is raised about the original's authenticity or the circumstances make it unfair to admit the duplicate." Fed. R. Evid. 1003. Defendant claims that Plaintiff's statements concern a letter that Defendant sent to Plaintiff on May 30, 2013. Defendant's objection is OVERRULED because Plaintiff has produced a duplicate of the letter (Doc. 26-10), and there is no question as to the original's authenticity. See Fed. R. Evid. 1003 [*13] .

2. Exhibits (Objections 14-26)
The rest of Defendant's Objections are to the Exhibits Plaintiff's lawyer attached to his Declaration in Support of Plaintiff's Opposition ("Smaili Decl.") (Doc. 26). Defendant objects to Exhibits C and E through P on grounds they are not "properly authenticated," "lack[] foundation," and constitute "inadmissible hearsay." (Objections at 8-10.) As the Court has previously declined to consider "blanket objections without evidentiary analysis," it now OVERRULES Objections 14-26. See Stonefire Grill, 987 F. Supp. 2d at 1033.

B. Plaintiff's Evidentiary Objections
In its Statement of Disputed Material Facts, Plaintiff has objected as "irrelevant" to certain facts indicating his limited English capabilities and lack of education. (See Doc. 25 at 9.) As with many of Defendant's objections, the Court summarily OVERRULES Plaintiff's objections, as they are "without [any] evidentiary analysis." See Stonefire, 987 F. Supp. 2d at 1033.

IV. FACTS
To the extent certain facts or conclusions are not mentioned in this Order, the Court has not relied on them in reaching its decision. In addition to considering the evidentiary objections raised by the parties, the Court has independently considered the admissibility of the evidence that both parties [*14]  submitted and has not considered facts that are irrelevant or based upon inadmissible evidence.

A. Uncontroverted Facts
The following material facts are supported adequately by admissible evidence and are uncontroverted. They are "admitted to exist without controversy" for the purposes of this Motion. See L.R. 56-3.
In June 2006, Defendant hired Plaintiff as a Rice Saccharification Operator ("Operator") in the rice room department where Defendant made vinegar. (Padilla Dep'n 19:21-23; Jackson Declaration ¶ 5.)2 Plaintiff worked the night shift from 9 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. (Padilla Dep'n 34: 20-23.)
As an Operator, his duties3 included: (1) lifting various ingredients weighing more than ten pounds to prepare the rice vinegar (Id. 31:22-24, 33:19-20); (2) lifting enzyme bags on a daily basis (Id. 32:21-22); (3) moving and using, on a daily basis, a hose that weighed more than 20 pounds to wash the tanks and floors in the rice department (Id. 41:22-42:14); (4) standing and walking continuously (Id. 42:15-18); (5) climbing up and down stairs approximately 20 or 30 times per night (Id. 42:19-22); (6) moving a conveyor belt to receive rice deliveries and unload them from a truck (Id. 44:12-21); and (7) bending, [*15]  squatting, and kneeling to perform such duties (Id. 49:19-21; 50:11-15).
On January 23, 2013, Plaintiff felt a "crack in his back" while pushing the conveyor belt at work. (Id. 84:5-20.) Immediately thereafter, he became "very tired," began to sweat "a lot," and felt a numbness in his left leg. (Id. 85: 7-10.) Plaintiff reported his injury to the lead man, and left work about an hour early. (Id. 88:19-24.) Starting on January 24, 2013, Plaintiff's doctors placed him off work due to his injuries until May 16, 2013. (Id. 129:20-25; 130: 1-15; 133:15-19; 167:21-25; 168:5-8.) On May 16, 2013, he was released for work with the following restrictions: (1) no lifting over 10 pounds, (2) no forceful pulling or squeezing, (3) no overhead work, (4) no prolonged standing/walking, and (5) no repeated bending or stooping. ("May 16 Doctor's Note" (Doc. 22-2).)
On about April 19, 2013, Plaintiff met with his plant manager to discuss the possibility of filing a claim for workers' compensation benefits. (Id. 151:4-12.) At the meeting, the manager presented Plaintiff with the forms he needed to file a claim, but warned that if Plaintiff filed them, Defendant was "not going to give [Plaintiff] medical [*16]  attention . . . [or] any money." (Id. 98:6-9.) Two other employees present at the meeting told Plaintiff he would be "an enemy for the company" if he filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. (Id. 98:22-23.) Plaintiff nonetheless filed his claim on April 19, 2013. (See id. 155:12-18.)
On June 10, 2013, Plaintiff attended a meeting with Human Resources Manager Brian Jackson to discuss his current situation with the company. (Id. 63:3-4.) During the meeting, Plaintiff stated that he "was willing to work if [Defendant] gave [him] a job that would not violate [his] restrictions." (Id. 81:5-13.) Jackson stated that he was going to look for another job for Plaintiff, but no specific position was discussed during the meeting. (Id. 70:22-24; Jackson Dep'n 52:3-6.) The meeting lasted less than half an hour. (Padilla Dep'n 99:21-22.)
Without further discussion, Defendant discharged Plaintiff later that month4 because "no position or reasonable accommodation was identified." (Exhs. H and I (Docs. 26-8, 26-9)).

B. Disputed Facts
The parties dispute (1) whether they discussed Plaintiff's duties/responsibilities (Compare Padilla Dep'n 68:14-16 and Padilla Declaration ¶ 9 with Jackson Dep'n 45:21-24); [*17]  (2) whether Plaintiff and Jackson discussed accommodations for Plaintiff to perform in his current position as an Operator (Compare Padilla Declaration ¶ 9 with Jackson Dep'n 98:10-12); (3) whether there were any reasonable accommodations available that would allow Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of the Operator position (Compare Padilla Declaration ¶ 12 with Jackson Dep'n 98:10-12); (4) whether Plaintiff could perform other jobs within the company with or without reasonable accommodation (Compare Opp'n at 12 with Jackson Dep'n 111:23-25; 112:1-8.)

V. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)
"California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354 (2000).
"Under the three-part . . . test, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2011). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show that "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and, (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." See Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886 (2007) (citing Deschene v. Pinole Point Steel Co., 76 Cal. App. 4th 33, 44 (1999)); Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). "Once the plaintiff has [established a prima facie [*18]  case], the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. If the employer articulates a legitimate reason, the plaintiff must raise a triable issue that the employer's proffered reason is pretext for unlawful discrimination." See Earl, 658 F.3d at 1112.
"Although [Plaintiff] bears the burden of proving [a prima facie case] at trial, in the summary judgment context, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating there are no material triable issues of fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 962 (2008). In other words, "to prevail on summary judgment, the employer is required to show . . . that . . . plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of [the] FEHA claim." See Dep't of Fair Emp't and Hous. v. Lucent Techs, Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).

1. Whether Plaintiff is a "Qualified Individual" under FEHA
Here, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under FEHA and thus, whether he can establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination.
"[A] plaintiff asserting a disability employment discrimination claim under the FEHA must show that he is a 'qualified individual,' meaning that he 'can perform the essential duties of the employment [*19]  position with reasonable accommodation.'" Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 999 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 260 (2007)). "[W]hen an employee seeks accommodation by being reassigned to a vacant position . . . , the employee [is qualified if] he or she can perform the essential functions of the vacant position with or without accommodation." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 963.
"'Essential functions' refers to the 'fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires.'" Abara v. Altec Industries, Inc., 838 F. Supp. 2d 995, 1001 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Dark v. Curry Cty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1087 (9th Cir. 2006)). "Essential functions do not include the marginal functions of the position." Id. (citing Bates, 511 F.3d at 989). Given that "much of the information which determines [the] essential functions lies uniquely with the employer," an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim bears the "burden of production" to "put forth evidence establishing [such] functions." Bates, 511 F.3d at 991 (interpreting "qualified individual" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)).5

a. Rice Saccharification Operator
The essential functions of the Rice Saccharification Operator position included: (1) lifting and moving ingredients such as enzyme bags in the preparation of rice vinegar, (2) moving and using a hose, which weighed more than 20 pounds, to wash the tanks and the floors in the rice department, (3) constantly standing and walking, (4) climbing up [*20]  and down stairs approximately 20 or 30 times a shift, (5) moving a conveyor belt once or twice a week so that rice deliveries could be received and unloaded from a delivery truck, and (6) bending, kneeling, and squatting. (Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts (Doc. 22-5) 6-13 at 2-3.)6
During the June 10 meeting with Defendant, Plaintiff stated that he could not perform his job in accordance with the limitations and restrictions in his May 16 Doctor's Note. (See Padilla Dep'n at 78:16-24.) Plaintiff nonetheless claims he could have performed the essential functions of his position "if [he was] given more frequent breaks, assistance of a lifting machine/equipment which does the lifting of the bags, a different shift, or an extended leave of absence." (Opp'n at 9.) He also suggests that his lead, Erwin Cruz, could have helped him "carry[] bulk ingredients to weigh and add once or twice per month." (See id. at 4.)
Rather than disputing whether Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of his position with such accommodations, Defendant instead argues that Plaintiff did not testify about these accommodations during his deposition and only now mentions them in his [*21]  Declaration. (See Reply at 9.) To the extent Defendant claims Plaintiff's Declaration is a sham, the Court previously rejected the argument above and does so again here.
The Ninth Circuit has stated that a plaintiff who argues that she could "perform the essential functions of the job she holds" must make "at least a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible." Braunling v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 220 F.3d 1154, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, Plaintiff points to Jackson's admission that Plaintiff would "at times" work on the machine with the assistance of another. (Opp'n at 19; Jackson Dep'n 126:12-18.) Furthermore, in his Declaration, Plaintiff states that he could have done his job with "more frequent breaks" (Padilla Declaration ¶ 12), and his work restrictions indicate that he could still lift ten pounds or less (See Doc. 22-2).
The Court nonetheless finds Plaintiff's assertions regarding his ability to perform his job with reasonable accommodation fatally vague. For example, Plaintiff has not provided evidence about how frequently he would need a break during his shift or how long each break would be. Additionally, as Plaintiff admits in his deposition, one of the essential functions of the Operator position was to wash the tanks and floors [*22]  of the rice department every day using a hose that weighed more than 20 pounds. (Padilla Dep'n 42:1-14.) The record, however, lacks any evidence that Plaintiff could have performed this essential function with or without a reasonable accommodation.7 Plaintiff states that he could have performed this essential function if given "a different shift[] or an extended leave of absence." (See Padilla Declaration ¶ 12.) He does not explain which shift would better accommodate him or why, nor how long a leave of absence he would need. In sum, Plaintiff has failed to show that the "accommodations [he] suggests . . . could . . . have improved [his] situation." See Braunling, 220 F.3d at 1157.
Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing he could have performed the essential duties of the Operator position.

b. Other Positions as Reasonable Accommodations
Plaintiff also claims Defendant could have provided him with a different position as a reasonable accommodation. (See Opp'n at 11.) He further contends he was "clearly qualified" for certain vacant positions that were available when he was discharged. (See id.) Although it admits that some vacant positions were available, [*23]  Defendant asserts that Plaintiff "includes no evidence he was qualified to work in any of [them]." (Reply at 10.) Defendant claims that Plaintiff is not a "qualified individual" because he has not met his burden of showing that he was qualified for any vacant position. (See id.)
Defendant misplaces the burden.8 Under FEHA, an "employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts that . . . there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation." See Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263 (2000); Stoll v. The Hartford, No. 05CV1907 IEG (LSP), 2006 WL 395826, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2006). "'Although the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuading the fact finder that he can perform the job's essential functions . . . an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim . . . must put forth evidence establishing [these] functions.'" Taylor, 58 F. Supp. 3d at 1115 (citing Bates, 511 F.3d at 991).
The primary dispute between the parties is whether there was any "vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified." See Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263. Defendant claims that the "vast majority of [its] positions require the performance [*24]  of manual labor and [Plaintiff] was not qualified to perform clerical or office work because he could not read or write English." (Motion at 10.) Plaintiff, on the other hand, claims that the following positions were available and he was "clearly qualified to perform the essential functions of [these] positions with or without accommodation": "Shipper/Receiver, Bulk Vinegar Process Operator, Line 2 Inspector-2nd shift[,] and Quality Assurance Technician." (Opp'n at 11.) Defendant also provided Plaintiff with a list of "various job openings Defendant had available in May and June of 2013," which included all four positions. (Declaration of Jihad M. Smaili ("Smaili Declaration") (Doc. 26 at 4, Exhibit L).)
Defendant has not provided any description of the essential duties of the latter three jobs, nor any explanation why Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of such positions with or without reasonable accommodation.9 Its blanket statement that the "vast majority of [its] positions require the performance of manual labor" is unconvincing, as it fails to address specifically Plaintiff's physical restrictions. (Motion at 10.) Defendant "has not sufficiently demonstrated either [*25]  what the essential functions of the [vacant positions] are or that [Plaintiff] could not have performed the [jobs] with or without reasonable accommodation." See Taylor, 58 F. Supp. 3d at 1117.
Hence, as there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual" under FEHA, the Court DENIES summary judgment on this claim.

B. Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodations under FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)
In order to succeed on a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate, an employee must establish (1) "that he or she suffers from a disability covered by [the statute]," and (2) "that he or she is a qualified individual." See Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 256; Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 978 (holding that in asserting a claim under § 12940(m), "plaintiff bears the burden of proving he or she was able to perform the essential functions of the job with accommodation"); Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m).
Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot establish a claim under § 12940(m) because no reasonable accommodation existed for his physical restrictions. (See Motion at 8-10.) In other words, Defendant again claims that Plaintiff cannot establish the second element of his failure-to-accommodate claim, i.e., that Plaintiff is a "qualified individual" under the statute. (See Reply at 8-11.) The Court rejected this argument above [*26]  and does so again here. Accordingly, summary judgment is denied on this claim as well.

C. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)
"Under FEHA, an employer must engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability." See Nealy, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 379; Cal. Gov't Code §12940(n).
During the process, "[b]oth employer and employee have the obligation to keep communications open and neither has a right to obstruct the process." Scotch v. Art Institute, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018 (2009). "Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." See id. at 1013.
Finally, "to prevail on a claim under [§ 12940(n)] for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Id. at 1018. An employee "cannot . . . be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process itself because employees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have." Id. (citations [*27]  omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[O]nce the parties have engaged in the litigation process," however, the "employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." See id. (emphasis added).
Based on the evidence uncovered during discovery, Plaintiff has raised triable issues of material fact as to (1) whether Defendant obstructed the interactive process by failing to participate in good faith, and (2) whether a reasonable accommodation existed at the time of the interactive process. The Court has already discussed the second triable issue throughout this Order and will only discuss the first issue below.
Here, Jackson states in his deposition that he did not discuss with Plaintiff what other positions were available within the company during the June 10 meeting. (See Jackson Dep'n 41:14-25; 42:7-17.) Accordingly, a jury could find that Jackson "caused a breakdown in the interactive process by refusing to provide information about available positions." See Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 986.
Finally, although Jackson stated he would look for an alternative position, he did not ultimately find one, and Plaintiff was discharged without further discussion later [*28]  that month. As a jury "could . . . find it was unreasonable for [Defendant] to determine unilaterally that [Plaintiff] was unable to perform any available vacant position with or without accommodation," summary judgment is DENIED on this claim as well. See id. at 988.

D. Age Discrimination, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)
An employer may not discriminate against an employee based on age. See Cal Gov't Code § 12940(a). To assert a claim of age discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must show that he was "(1) a member of a protected class [age 40-70]; (2) performing his job in a satisfactory manner; (3) discharged; and (4) replaced by a substantially younger employee with equal or inferior qualifications." Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 917 (9th Cir. 1996). "The fourth element, however, has been treated with some flexibility," and a failure to make such a showing is "not necessarily fatal to an age discrimination claim." See id. (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Once an employee establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, "the employer must merely articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action." See id. If an employer makes this showing, the burden returns to the employee to "produce enough evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude either: (a) [*29]  that the alleged reason for [his] discharge was false, or (b) that the true reason for his discharge was a discriminatory one." See id. at 918.
Here, even assuming that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination, Defendant has offered a nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's discharge -- that Plaintiff could not perform the essential duties of his current position. (Jackson Dep'n 111:23-25; 112:1-3.) Plaintiff has not provided any evidence related to his age that this reason was "false" or "discriminatory." See Nidds, 113 F.3d at 918. He has not, for example, produced evidence that Defendant offered "shifting explanations" for the discharge; to the contrary, Defendant has maintained throughout this action that it discharged Plaintiff for failing to perform the essential duties of his position. See id. Moreover, there is no evidence here that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based on age. Plaintiff points to a potential inconsistency between Defendant's answer to an interrogatory and Jackson's declaration -- Defendant initially claimed that it did not "hire" anyone to replace Plaintiff but later stated that it "employed another employee in the rice room." (See Opp'n at 23; Interrogatory [*30]  No. 9 (Doc. 26-4); Jackson Declaration ¶ 6.) Given that a transfer is different from a new hire, it appears these statements are consistent. (See Reply at 2-3.)
As Plaintiff has not produced "evidence of a discriminatory motive," the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim of age discrimination. See Nidds, 113 F.3d at 918.

E. Failure to Prevent/Remedy Discrimination, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k)
Under FEHA, an employer must "take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). Ultimately, "[a]n actionable claim under [§ 12940(k)] is dependent on a claim of actual discrimination." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1021 (citing Trujillo v. North Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289 (1998)).
Here, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's § 12940(k) claim fails because he "cannot establish that discrimination under FEHA occurred." (Motion at 16.) As stated above, however, the Court finds there are triable issues of fact as to whether Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based on his disability. "Because a claim for failure to prevent discrimination is predicated on the existence of discrimination, a question this Court has determined should be submitted to a jury, it follows that this claim should also be submitted to a jury." Gardner v. Federal Express Corp., Case No. 14-cv-01082-TEH, 2014 WL 4192588, at *10 (N.D. Cal. July 10, 2015).
Accordingly, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to Plaintiff's § 12940(k) claim. [*31] 

F. Discrimination Based on Participation in Protected Conduct, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h)
FEHA makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h).
To prove such retaliation, a plaintiff must show "(1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042 (2005) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
"Once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation drops out of the picture, and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation." Id. (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiff contends that Defendant discharged him in retaliation for filing a worker's compensation claim. [*32]  (Opp'n at 12.) Defendant claims that requesting workers' compensation benefits does not constitute a "protected activity" under FEHA and that Plaintiff's retaliation claim therefore fails "as a matter of law." (See Reply at 1.) In support of its position, Defendant filed a Notice of Lodging of Case Law ("Notice") on October 27, 2015. (Doc. 32.) Defendant cites to two cases in its Notice, and the Court addresses each, in turn, below.
First, in Ungureanu v. A. Teichert & Son, the court found that "Plaintiff's repeated assertions that Teichert was angry at him because he had instituted workers['] compensation proceedings does not imply a Title VII retaliatory purpose -- just the opposite." No. CIV S-11-0316 LKK GGH PS, 2012 WL 1108831, at *6 (E.D. Cal. April 2, 2012). The district court never explained why such proceedings could not form the basis of a retaliation claim. Accordingly, the Court finds Ungureanu unpersuasive for purposes of this Motion.
Second, in City of Moorpark v. Superior Court., the California Supreme Court held that to the extent the workers' compensation statute and FEHA overlap, "equitable principles preclude double recovery for employees." 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1158 (1998). The Moorpark Court also held that the workers' compensation statute "does not provide an exclusive remedy [*33]  and does not preclude an employee from pursuing FEHA and common law wrongful discharge remedies." Id. Here, the Court previously took judicial notice of Plaintiff's pending workers' compensation claim. Neither party has alleged, however, that Plaintiff has recovered anything in that proceeding. Given that (1) the workers' compensation statute is not "an exclusive remedy" and (2) Plaintiff has not yet recovered anything in his workers' compensation proceeding, the Court is unpersuaded that Moorpark disposes of Plaintiff's retaliation claim under FEHA. See Moorpark, 18 Cal. 4th at 1158.
Furthermore, several federal courts have found that "a plaintiff's allegation that he filed a workers' compensation claim sufficiently pleads a 'protected activity'" under FEHA. See Vogel v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., No. CIV. 07-2274 WBS EFB, 2008 WL 149234, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 2008) (citing Rund v. Charter Comm'cns, Inc., No. 05-00502, 2007 WL 852035, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 20, 2007)); Violan v. On Lok Senior Health Servs., Case No. 12-cv-05739-WHO, 2013 WL 6907153, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 31, 2013) (holding that a "plaintiff's assertion that he filed a workers' compensaton claim sufficiently alleges a protected activity for purposes of a FEHA claim"). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has engaged in "protected activity" under FEHA when he filed a workers' compensation claim.
Plaintiff has also presented evidence that there was a causal link between his protected activity and his discharge in June. Plaintiff asserts that he filed [*34]  for benefits on April 19, 2013, and that Defendant became aware of his request on May 1, 2013. (Opp'n at 22.) The record indicates that he was discharged as early as June 11, 2013, or as late as June 20, 2013. (Opp'n at 23.) Thus, Defendant discharged Plaintiff about six weeks after Defendant learned he had a claim for workers' compensation benefits. Given that the gap between the protected activity and the adverse employment action was between "one [and] three months," the Court finds that Plaintiff has established a triable issue as to whether a causal link existed. See Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1181 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987)).
Defendant argues it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging Plaintiff: he could not perform his job functions, given his physical restrictions. (Motion at 13.) Even assuming Defendant gave a valid reason for the termination, the record contains evidence of "intentional retaliation." See Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042. For one, Plaintiff claims that during his April meeting regarding workers' compensation benefits, the plant manager told him that Defendant would "not give [Plaintiff] medical attention . . . [or] money," if he filed for workers' compensation benefits. (Padilla Dep'n 98:5-7.) The plant manager also allegedly [*35]  stated that Plaintiff would be "an enemy for the company," if he made his request for workers' compensation benefits. (Id. 98:22-23.) Furthermore, Plaintiff produced an email sent by Defendant's employee who warned the recipient that Plaintiff is "already trying to get some money from us so we have to make sure this is a smooth and seamless process." (Doc. 26-14.) A reasonable jury might find that the message evinces a reluctance to pay workers' compensation benefits and a motive to retaliate if a claim was filed. Given the conversation that Plaintiff had with his superiors, the email, and the timing of his discharge, the Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendant retaliated against Plaintiff for filing a workers' compensation claim.

G. Retaliation under Cal. Lab. Code § 6310
"Section 6310 makes it unlawful to fire or otherwise retaliate against an employee who makes a workplace safety complaint with government agencies." Lujan v. Minager, 124 Cal. App. 4th 1040, 1043 (2004). The statute also "applies to employers who retaliate against employees whom they believe intend to file workplace safety complaints." See id. at 1046.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's § 6310 claim fails as a matter of law because he "never complained about employee safety or health [*36]  prior to his separation" and has presented "no evidence that [Defendant] believed he intended to file a workplace safety complaint." (Motion at 14.) The Court agrees, as there is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff filed or intended to file such a complaint.10 Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on this cause of action.

H. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"The central assertion of a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy is that the employer's motives for terminating the employee are so contrary to fundamental norms that the termination inflicted an injury sounding in tort." Roby v. McKesson Corp., 47 Cal. 4th 686, 702 (2009). "To support a wrongful discharge claim, the policy must be (1) delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) public in the sense that it inures to the benefit of the public rather than serving merely the interests of the individual; (3) well established at the time of the discharge; and (4) substantial and fundamental." Phillips v. St. Mary Regional Med. Ctr., 96 Cal. App. 4th 218, 226 (2002). "FEHA's policy prohibiting disability discrimination in employment is sufficiently substantial and fundamental to support a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy." Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 660 (2013).
The Court previously found [*37]  triable issues of fact existed as to whether Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of his disability, in violation of FEHA. Given that disability discrimination under FEHA is a proper basis for a claim of wrongful termination, the Court DENIES summary judgment as to Plaintiff's wrongful discrimination claim. See Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1065 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (denying summary judgment as to wrongful termination claim because triable issues of material fact existed as to plaintiff's disability discrimination claim under FEHA).

I. Violation of Article I, § 8 of the California Constitution
Under Article I, § 8 of the California Constitution, "[a] person may not be disqualified from entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment because of sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin."
Here, Plaintiff has alleged age and disability discrimination -- neither class is mentioned within the text of § 8. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not claim protection under the other classes mentioned in the statute, and provides no authority for the proposition that § 8 protects against age or disability discrimination. The Court has also not found any support for these propositions. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's § 8 claims. See Haynal v. Target Stores, No. 96-1599-K(RBB), 1996 WL 806706, at *4 (S.D. Cal. 1996) (dismissing disability discrimination claim [*38]  under § 8 because there was "no authority" to support such a claim); Fonteno v. Equitable Real Estate Inv. Mgmt., Inc., No. C-94-3158 MHP, 1995 WL 125493, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 7, 1995) (dismissing age discrimination claim under California Constitution because there was "no authority" to support it).

J. Unfair Competition Law (UCL), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200
"The UCL prohibits, and provides civil remedies for, unfair competition, which it defines as 'any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.'" Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court, 51 Cal. 4th 310, 320 (2011). The purpose of the UCL "is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services." Id. (quoting Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal. 4th 939, 949 (2002)).
"To state a claim for unlawful or unfair business practices based upon a discrimination claim, a plaintiff is required to establish a viable discrimination claim." Gardner, 2014 WL 4192588, at *11 (citing Johnson v. Hertz Local Edition Corp., No. C 03-4439 MJJ, 2004 WL 2496164, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 3, 2004)).
Here, Plaintiff bases his UCL claim on his disability discrimination claimpadill under FEHA. (Complaint (Doc. 1-1) ¶ 130; Opp'n at 24.) As the Court has found triable issues of material fact exist with respect to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's UCL claim is DENIED.

K. Failure to Pay Wages and Waiting Time Penalties, Cal. Lab. Code § 202
In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that he "was not paid, and is owed, regular wages, overtime wages earned, plus interest [*39]  and penalties as applicable." (Compl. ¶ 136.) His Opposition, however, clarifies that he "has not been paid for promised bonuses," and is seeking them through this action. (Opp'n at 24.)
Plaintiff provides no legal authority that he is entitled to such bonuses. In his Complaint, he cites to various statutes, including Cal. Lab. Code § 202. (Compl. ¶ 135.) Under § 202, however, only "an employee . . . [who] quits his or her employment" is entitled to "his or her wages . . . not later than 72 hours thereafter." Plaintiff did not quit his employment; he was terminated.
Without any legal authority, this Court has no basis to award Plaintiff the relief he seeks, even though there may be a dispute as to whether he qualified under Defendant's bonus plan. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Plaintiff's § 202 claim.

VI. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court:
(1) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim under FEHA;
(2) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for a failure to accommodate under FEHA;
(3) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for a failure to engage in the interactive process under FEHA;
(4) GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's [*40]  claim for age discrimination under FEHA;
(5) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for a failure to prevent and/or remedy discrimination under FEHA;
(6) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for retaliation based on protected conduct under FEHA;
(7) GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for retaliation under Cal. Lab. Code § 6310;
(8) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy;
(9) GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim under the California Constitution;
(10) DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's UCL claim; and
(11) GRANTS Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claim for bonuses under Cal. Lab. Code § 202.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
