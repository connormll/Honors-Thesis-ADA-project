CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

Proceedings: (IN CHAMBERS) ORDER RE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, ALTERNATIVELY, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DKT. 43);

PLAINTIFF AND COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT MARK LANGSTON'S MOTION TO DISMISS COUNTERCLAIM (DKT. 71);

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO EXTEND DISCOVERY CUTOFF AND AMEND SCHEDULING ORDER (DKT. 84)

I. Introduction
On January 30, 2018, Mark Langston ("Langston" or "Plaintiff") brought this action in the Los Angeles Superior Court against T-Mobile US, Inc. ("T-Mobile" or "Defendant")1 Dkt. 1-2, Ex. A. The Complaint advances five claims under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940 et seq.: (i) disability discrimination; (ii) failure to provide reasonable accommodation; (iii) failure to engage in the interactive process; (iv) discrimination based on perceived disability; and (v) tortious termination and discrimination [*2]  in violation of public policy. Id. The claims arise from T-Mobile's termination of Langston's employment. See id. ¶¶ 9-24.
On January 23, 2019, T-Mobile filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (the "MSJ"). Dkt. 43. Langston filed an opposition on May 21, 2019 (Dkt. 79) which was amended to conform with length and citation requirements on June 2, 2019. Dkt. 81.2 T-Mobile filed a reply on June 6, 2019. Dkt. 83.3
On February 12, 2019, T-Mobile filed a Counterclaim. Dkt. 54. It advances three claims against Langston: (i) conversion; (ii) breach of contract; and (iii) violation of the Unfair Competition Law ("UCL"), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq. Id. On April 24, 2019, Langston filed a Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim (the "MTD"). Dkt. 71. T-Mobile filed an opposition to the MTD on May 8, 2019. Dkt. 77. Langston did not file a reply.
On June 26, 2019, Langston filed a Motion to Extend Discovery Cut-Off (the "MTE").4 Dkt. 84. T-Mobile filed an opposition to the MTE on July 3, 2019. Dkt. 86.5 Again, Langston did not file a reply.
A hearing the MSJ, MTD, and MTE (collectively, the "Motions") was held on July 15, 2019, and they were taken under submission. Dkt. 92. The parties then requested that [*3]  rulings be deferred until they engaged in further settlement efforts. Dkt. 93. On November 27, 2019, the parties reported that they had been unable to reach a settlement and requested that rulings be issued on the Motions. Dkt. 97.
For the reasons stated in this Order, the MSJ is GRANTED IN PART, the MTD is GRANTED IN PART with leave to amend, and the MTE is GRANTED IN PART.

II. Factual Background
A. Undisputed Facts Relevant to the MSJ
In June 2002, Langston was hired by VoiceStream6 as a Los Angeles-based Account Executive. Dkt. 83-2 ¶ 1; see also Dkt. 1-2, Ex. A ¶ 4. During his employment, Langston was provided with one or more handbooks regarding company policies. One was provided to him on August 4, 2015. Dkt. 83-2 ¶ 2. During Langston's employment, he was promoted several times, including to the following positions: Major Account Executive in 2006, Regional Account Manager, in 2010, Business Development Manager in 2012, and Senior Business Development Manager in 2014. Id. ¶ 3. Langston's job duties always included making sales on behalf of T-Mobile. Id. ¶ 4. He was paid a salary and sales commissions. id. ¶ 5. Commissions were tied to the number of "lines activated" through his sales [*4]  efforts. Id. ¶¶6-7.
In February 2009, Langston had a panic attack while he was traveling to a sales meeting. Id. ¶ 35. Thereafter, for a period of time, T-Mobile permitted Langston to work from home. Id. ¶ 36. In 2012, Langston was treated by a therapist who diagnosed him as having post-traumatic stress disorder. Id. ¶¶ 37-38. Around this time, Langston requested permission to work remotely from Monterey, California. Id. ¶ 39. This request was granted in 2012 or 2013. Id. ¶ 40.
Prior to 2014, Langston met his sales quotas in part through sales of T-Mobile services to companies who resold them to others. Id. ¶ 8. In early 2014, account executives were directed to shift away from such resale transactions and instead to make sales to "traditional accounts." Id. ¶¶ 10-11.7 By May 12, 2015, Langston had received updated "Performance Improvement" guidelines from T-Mobile. Id. ¶ 12. They provided that, in certain circumstances, based on job performance, a manager could be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP"). Id. ¶ 13.
On June 2, 2015, Langston's manager, Tomas Steinmetz ("Steinmetz"), sent Langston an email stating that Langston had not met his sales quota for February-May [*5]  2015. Id. ¶¶ 15-16. Steinmetz also provided expected sales targets for Langston to meet during upcoming months. Id. ¶ 17. That same day, William Kontur ("Kontur")8 stated that, in response to an email that he sent to Langston, he received an automated reply stating that Langston was on a leave of absence. Id. ¶ 41. T-Mobile approved a request by Langston for a leave of absence from May 30 through September 1, 2015,9 which had been supported by a certificate from his health care provider. Id. ¶¶ 43-45. The request had been confirmed by a letter dated June 4, 2015. Id. ¶¶ 43, 45.
Langston returned to work on September 28, 2015. Id. ¶¶ 46, 50. At that time, the following accommodations, which he had requested, were provided to him: he could work from home; he could work remotely from Monterey, California; he was excused from travelling for work during peak traffic hours; he was provided a flexible work schedule in light of his insomnia; he was excused from company meetings that could trigger his stress disorder; and he was not required to travel by airplane for work. Dkt. 83-2 ¶ 48; see also Dkt. 80-5 at 40; Langston Decl., Ex. 28, Dkt. 80-7 at 23. (September 25, 2015 e-mail from [*6]  Kontur granting certain accommodations "on a temporary basis"). Other accommodations that Langston had requested, including a step-by-step increase in his sales quotas and an exemption from PIP standards, were denied. Id. ¶ 49; see also Dkt. 80-7 at 23 (Kontur's denial of these accommodations as "not reasonable in nature and there is no indication that they are medically necessary.").
On September 30, 2015, Langston was assigned a new sales territory, which was in San Luis Obispo. Id. ¶ 18. He was told that the territory included 18,000 potential clients. Id. In October 2015, Langston was told that he had not met his expected sales quotas, i.e., that fewer new lines had been activated due to his efforts than had been expected. Id. ¶ 19. On November 9, 2015, he received a review of expectations, and was counseled regarding his sales compared to his quota for them. Id. ¶¶ 20-21. That month, he was told that he had again made sales that led to the activation of fewer than expected lines. Id. ¶ 22. In December 2015, he was given a "Formal Reminder" regarding his performance, which included the statements that he was no longer in good standing and was at risk of being terminated due to his [*7]  performance. Id. ¶¶ 23-25. Langston responded through an email dated December 14, 2015. In it, he asked to meet with his supervisor, Cabrina Miles-Hamilton ("Miles-Hamilton"), to discuss his job performance. Id. ¶ 26. He also raised concerns that T-Mobile's quotas were unattainable by any similarly-situated sales employees. Id. ¶¶ 27-28. He sent another, similar email on December 19, 2015. Id. ¶ 29.
On January 11, 2016, Langston received another performance review. It stated that he had failed to meet his December 2015 quotas. Id. ¶ 31. It also stated that a failure to meet his quota the next month could result in his termination. Id. ¶ 33. Around this time, other members of the same sales team were terminated, including one for fraud as to claims about meeting a quota. Id. ¶ 34.
On February 9, 2016, Langston's employment was terminated. Id. ¶ 51. Between February 9, 2016 and June 6, 2019, Langston did not seek any other employment. Id. ¶ 52, 62. Langston has testified that, since his termination, he has had difficulty in leaving his residence, has been totally disabled at certain times, and has been "on disability" for a period of time. Id. ¶¶ 53. He cites several reasons for his continuing [*8]  condition, including the loss of a parent, a break-up with his partner, being the victim of a robbery and a dispute with a neighbor. Id. ¶¶ 55-60. He also states that he has sought worker's compensation benefits. Id. ¶ 54.
B. The Allegations in the Counterclaim
T-Mobile alleges that during Langston's employment, he had access to confidential, proprietary information of T-Mobile, including Daily Sales Reports. Dkt. 54 ¶ 18. Langston allegedly acknowledged that he had received the T-Mobile rules regarding the handling of such information and signed a confidentiality agreement requiring their return upon the termination of his employment. Id. ¶ 19. T-Mobile allegedly did not authorize Langston to retain or use of this information for any purpose other than for making sales while employed by T-Mobile. Id. ¶ 23.
Langston was deposed in this matter on August 7, 2018. It is alleged that during the deposition, he admitted that "he had in his possession a hard drive containing T-Mobile information," which he "intended to mine" for confidential information. Id. ¶ 2. This information included Daily Sales Reports, which Langston allegedly admitted show "sales of various areas and employees and what [*9]  areas are more lucrative than others." Id. ¶¶ 2-4. In the course of this action, Langston also allegedly produced "hundreds of pages" of "highly-confidential and proprietary information of T-Mobile," including the Daily Sales Reports. Id. ¶ 5.
T-Mobile allegedly requested that Langston return the hard drive on August 13, 2018, or, in the alterative, that it be provided to a third-party vendor who would scan and retain it. Id. ¶¶ 6, 25.

III. Analysis
A. Motion for Summary Judgment
1. Legal Standards
a. Summary Judgment
A motion for summary judgment will be granted where "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden to show the basis for its motion and to identify those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Where the moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier [*10]  of fact could find other than for the moving party. Where the nonmoving parity will have the burden of proof on an issue, however, the movant need only demonstrate that there is an absence of evidence to support the claims of the nonmoving party. See id. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(e).
Only admissible evidence may be considered in connection with a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). However, in considering such a motion, a court is not to make any credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. All inferences are to be drawn in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 63031 (9th Cir. 1987). However, conclusory, speculative testimony in declarations or other evidentiary materials is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact. See Thornhill Publ'g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).
b. FEHA Claims
Under FEHA, it is unlawful "[f]or an employer, because of the . . . physical disability, mental disability, [or] medical condition . . . of any person . . . to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, [*11]  or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The employer's duties include, inter alia, "mak[ing[ reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability," of an employee, and "engag[ing[ in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Id. § 12940(m)-(n).
A claim for a violation of FEHA must first be brought by filing an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH"). Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal. App. 4th 341, 349, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 292 (1993), as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 20, 1993), overruled on other grounds by Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001). There is a one-year statute of limitations from the "date upon which the alleged unlawful practice or refusal to cooperate occurred" for a plaintiff to file a complaint with the DFEH. Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(d). If such a complaint is not timely filed, the underlying claims are barred in a later civil action. Hobson v. Raychem Corp., 73 Cal. App. 4th 614, 631, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 497 (1999), disapproved of on other grounds by Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc., 29 Cal. 4th 1019, 130 Cal. Rptr. 2d 662, 63 P.3d 220 (2003) ("[I]f an employee fails to file an administrative charge specifically identifying the alleged discrimination, and within one year of its occurrence, the subsequent lawsuit will be barred.").
Under the continuing violation doctrine, the limitations period may be tolled [*12]  when "an employer engages in a continuing course of unlawful conduct under the FEHA by refusing reasonable accommodation of a disabled employee or engaging in disability harassment." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823. A "persistent failure to reasonably accommodate a disability . . . is a continuing violation if the employer's unlawful actions are (1) sufficiently similar in kind. . . (2) have occurred with reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence." Id. However:
when an employer engages in a continuing course of unlawful conduct under the FEHA by refusing reasonable accommodation of a disabled employee . . . the statute of limitations begins to run . . . either when the course of conduct is brought to an end, as by the employer's cessation of such conduct or by the employee's resignation, or when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in vain.
Id. (emphasis in original).
Thus, "an employer who is confronted with an employee seeking accommodation . . . may assert control over its legal relationship with the employee . . . by making clear to the employee in a definitive manner that it will not be granting any such requests, thereby commencing the [*13]  running of the statute of limitations." Id. at 823-24. Such notice is given where "the employer has made clear in word and deed that the employee's attempted further reasonable accommodation is futile." Id. at 823. Thereafter, an employee's "hope that conditions will improve or that informal conciliation may succeed' is unreasonable, because he has been given notice "that litigation, not informal conciliation, is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights." Id. (citing Mullins, 15 Cal. 4th at 740).
Additionally, "[w]hile a claim of failure to accommodate is independent of a cause of action for failure to engage in an interactive dialogue, each necessarily implicates the other." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 54, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). Thus, as with a failure to accommodate claim, although "the employer's obligation to engage in the [interactive] process is continuous," Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009), once "the employee is on notice that litigation, not informal conciliation, is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights," it would be "contrary to the FEHA's statute of limitations and potentially prejudicial to the employer" to allow the cause of action to run "indefinitely." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823.
Often, the "particular context of individual employment situations requires a fact-specific inquiry by a [*14]  trial judge." Berry v. Bd. of Sup'rs of L.S.U., 715 F.2d 971, 982 (5th Cir. 1983) (adopted by Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 824). This standard has particular significance when there are conflicting arguments as to whether an employee "received mixed signals on her accommodation requests." Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 824.
2. Application
a) Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
T-Mobile contends that, because Langston did not properly present his claims to the DFEH, they are time barred in this action. Dkt. 44 at 17. On January 31, 2017, Langston filed a complaint with the DFEH. Ripke Decl., Ex. 4, Dkt. 46-1 at 145-46. It was amended on December 26, 2017. Id. at 150. The amended complaint alleged that "on or about February 9, 2016," T-Mobile "took the following adverse actions: . . . because of complainant's disability (physical or mental) and as a result of the discrimination [Langston] was terminated, denied a work environment free of discrimination and/or retaliation, denied reasonable accommodation for a disability, other." Id. It also alleges that "I was terminated based upon my disability and employer's failure to accommodate and engage in interactive process." Id.10 Because the DFEH complaint was filed on January 31, 2017, any FEHA claim based on alleged conduct by T-Mobile prior [*15]  to January 31, 2016 is time-barred unless it either constituted a continuing violation or had not otherwise accrued prior to that date.
Langston has presented evidence that on September 25, 2015, prior to his return from medical leave, Kontur granted certain requested accommodations "on a temporary basis," but denied others on the grounds that they were not reasonable, and had not been shown to be medically necessary. Langston Decl., Ex. 28, Dkt. 80-7 at 23. That same day, Langston sent to his physician a copy of T-Mobile's denial of two of his requested accommodations -- a "Quota Ramp," and "Leniency in the use of any PIP metrics." Langston Decl., Ex. 31, Dkt. 80-8 at 3. Langston's physician's office replied that the omission of such statements as to medical necessity was "an oversight," and that the doctor would provide Langston with the necessary statement to send to T-Mobile. Id. An edited version of the physician's statement, with an earlier date and signed by the physician, requests the quota ramp and leniency in the use of metrics under the heading of "other relevant information we should consider regarding any recommended accommodation." Id. at 6.
On November 3, 2015, Kontur [*16]  notified Langston that, with respect to the requested accommodations that previously had been denied, "[w]hile we appreciate that your doctor feels it is necessary, it has been determined that the request is unreasonable and is therefore denied." Langston Decl., Ex. 32, Dkt. 80-8 at 9 (emphasis in original); see also Ripke Decl., Ex. 23, Dkt. 46-2 at 33 (additional November 3, 2015 email from Kontur to Langston).
Thereafter, Langston continued to seek modifications of his quotas. On December 9, 2015, Langston stated that he wished to have his attorney attend his performance review, and on December 14, 2015 he stated his "hope and request . . . that T-Mobile participate in this [interactive] process." Langston Decl., Ex. 33-34, Dkt. 80-8 at 14, 17. On December 19, 2015, he wrote that the expectations given to him were "unreasonable," and asked that T-Mobile "confirm [its] intentions to participate in the interactive process." Langston Decl., Ex. 35, Dkt. 80-8 at 19. On January 11, 2016, he asked again whether "T-Mobile [will] be participating in the interactive process" regarding his disability. Langston Decl., Ex. 36, Dkt. 80-8 at 22. There is no evidence presented as to any response [*17]  by T-Mobile to any of these requests.
As noted, when an employee receives "mixed signals on her accommodation requests," Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 824, the claim may not accrue until the denial is clear. However, the record here shows that there is not a genuine issue of fact as to when Langston was told clearly that his requests for accommodation were denied. The first denial was on September 25, 2015, when in response to Langston's September 23, 2015 request that T-Mobile "explicitly state[] if denial has occurred" as to his requests for accommodation, Kontur replied that "accommodation requests are not being granted since they are not reasonable in nature and there is no indication that they are medically necessary." Dkt. 462 at 29-30. This denial was repeated on November 3, 2015, first when Kontur told Langston that the request had been denied as unreasonable, and later that same day after Miles-Hamilton forwarded Kontur an email from Langston that he had sent to her requesting clarification. In the second email, Kontur replied to Langston that "[y]our accommodation request . . . [w]as not granted due to it is not a reasonable request. I believe this was answered. You will be held accountable to the same metrics [*18]  as all other Senior Account Executives." Id. at 33.
Langston contends that T-Mobile never engaged in the interactive process to discuss the requested accommodations, and that its "words and actions did not constitute a level of permanence making Mr. Langston's efforts patently futile, until he was terminated because T-Mobile refused to consider his efforts at all." Dkt. 81 at 16. He also argues that an "employer fails to engage in the interactive process as a matter of law when it rejects the employee's proposed accommodations by letter and offers no practical alternatives." Id. at 19 (citing Humphrey v. Mem'l Hasps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001)). Thus, Langston argues that because "[t]here was no discussion at all," it was reasonable for Langston to "believe[] his ongoing efforts would result in fulfilling quotas so that T-Mobile would want to continue employing him despite his disabilities," thereby making timely all claims based on alleged conduct by T-Mobile that continued to occur up through his termination in February 2016. Id. at 14, 16, 20.
Notwithstanding these contentions, under Richards it was unreasonable for Langston to have believed after November 3, 2015 that T-Mobile would change its positions about either a further interactive [*19]  process or the accommodations themselves. By that date, T-Mobile had "made clear in word and deed" -- i.e., at least two written communications from a human resources executive -- that it would not provide the requested accommodations. See Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823; see also Gardner v. City of Berkeley, 838 F. Supp. 2d 910, 920 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (receipt of notification from human resources that an employer did not believe it was obligated to reinstate an employee should have put the employee-plaintiff "on notice that his rights were being violated and that his claim was ripe for adjudication"). That T-Mobile did not respond to Langston's subsequent, ongoing requests to reconsider this position only confirmed the original denial.
Accordingly, the statute of limitations for the failure-to-accommodate and failure-to-engage claims began to run prior to January 31, 2016. Therefore, Langston's January 31, 2017 DFEH claim was untimely as to what are now presented as the second and third causes of action, and the MSJ is GRANTED as to both.
b) Disability Discrimination Claims
(1) Legal Standards
"FEHA prohibits an employer from, among other things, discharging a person from employment because of a medical condition or physical disability." Sofia v. Univision Radio L.A., Inc., 5 Cal. App. 5th 570, 583, 210 Cal. Rptr. 3d 59 (2016), rev. denied (Mar. 1, 2017) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)). In the context [*20]  of FEHA, the term "physical disability:"
includes, but is not limited to . . . [h]aving any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that does both of the following:
(A) Affects one or more of the following body systems: neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine.
(B) Limits a major life activity.
Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(m)(1).
"In order to prevail on a discriminatory discharge claim under section 12940(a), an employee bears the burden of showing (1) that he or she was discharged because of a disability, and (2) that he or she could perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation," i.e. "that he or she is a qualified individual with a disability." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 962, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). A claim based on a perceived disability has similar elements, i.e., that the employee was (1) perceived as disabled; (2) was otherwise qualified; and (3) was discharged as a result of the perceived disability. Swonke v. Sprint, Inc., 327 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1133 (N.D. Cal. 2004).
"Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying [*21]  our own statutes." Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Accordingly, the three-step burden-shifting test of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies. Id. at 354-56. "This so-called McDonnell Douglas test reflects the principle that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially. Thus, by successive steps of increasingly narrow focus, the test allows discrimination to be inferred from facts that create a reasonable likelihood of bias and are not satisfactorily explained." Id. at 354.
Accordingly, if an employee makes a prima facie showing of a discriminatory discharge claim, the burden then shifts to the employer to state a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action. Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 354-55. If the employer does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to show through substantial evidence that the proffered reason is pretextual. Id. at 355-56. At summary judgment, the burden is reversed: the employer must show that employee cannot establish a prima facia case. Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 343-44, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) ("If the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiffs prima facie elements is lacking, or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors, the employer will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff [*22]  produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing.") (emphasis omitted).
(2) Application
(a) Timeliness
Unlike Langston's claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process, his claim for wrongful termination of employment is timely. T-Mobile terminated Langston on February 9, 2016. He filed the DFEH complaint less than a year later, i.e., on January 31, 2017. Further, the Complaint in this action alleges that, "during Plaintiffs employment, Defendants . . . intentionally engaged in actions that resulted in Plaintiff being treated less favorably because of his actual and/or perceived disability. . . . [and] because of his medical condition and because of his medical leave of absence, Defendants perceived him to be disabled and therefore terminated his employment." Dkt. 1-2, Ex. A ¶¶ 27-28. It also alleges that "his medical condition . . . was a substantial and motivating factor contributing to Defendants' discrimination against him and termination of his employment." Id. ¶ 29. The claim for perceived-disability discrimination is substantially similar. Id. ¶¶ 53-54. Where "on the face of then complaints [*23]  plaintiffs' claims at least include, if they do not rest largely or entirely on, the termination of their employment, which took place well within the one-year period," that discharge forms a valid basis for a cause of action. McCaskey v. Cal. State Auto. Assn., 189 Cal. App. 4th 947, 977, 118 Cal. Rptr. 3d 34 (2010).
Because Langston timely filed an administrative complaint with DFEH alleging termination based on his disability, the remaining causes of action -- i.e., (i) disability discrimination, (iv) discrimination based on perceived disability and (v) tortious termination and discrimination in violation of public policy -- are not barred for failure timely to exhaust potential administrative remedies.
(b) Prima Facie Case
T-Mobile assumes for purposes of the MSJ that Langston is disabled, and for this reason that he has satisfied the first element of a claim. Dkt. 44 at 19. However, it contends that Langston cannot establish the second element, i.e., that he was qualified to perform his job. Id. at 19-20. It also argues that Langston was terminated in February 2018 because he "consistently failed to meet his quotas," "[d]espite numerous counselings." Id. at 19. Langston argues that there is a fact question as to whether he was qualified, and that the reasons for his termination [*24]  were pretextual. Dkt. 81 at 22-23.
"A 'qualified individual with a disability is someone "'who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal. App. 4th 228, 235, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 830 (1997) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "To prevail on summary adjudication," the employer "must show there is no triable issue of fact about [an employee's] ability, with or without accommodation, to perform the essential functions of an available vacant position that would not be a promotion." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 963.
T-Mobile has introduced evidence that Langston "miss[ed his] quota significantly" between February and May 2015," prior to taking a FMLA leave of absence. Ripke Decl., Ex. 2, Dkt. 46-1 at 46-47, Langston Depo. Tr. at 105:2-106:5. id. There is also evidence that when Langston returned, he was told several times that he was not meeting his quotas for October, November and December 2015. Id. at 178:7-20; 179:11-180:8; 187:14-25; see also Exs. 10, 11, 14. T-Mobile contends that where an employee consistently underperforms on meeting a quota, no reasonable jury could find him qualified for the job. Dkt. 44 at 19 (citing Denczak v. Ford Motor Co., 215 Fed. App'x 442, 445 (6th Cir. 2007)).
T-Mobile has not cited any authority that supports these positions [*25]  in the context of a claim for discrimination like the one presented here. Moreover, Langston has introduced evidence that during his employment, he historically exceeded many of his quotas, including for the first quarter of 2015. Langston Decl., Ex. 10, Dkt. 80-4 at 15 (March 31, 2015 email to T-Mobile regional employees showing performance of team members, including that Langston achieved 118% of his quota for the quarter). Langston has also provided similar evidence showing his performance in late 2015 exceeded his quotas. See, e.g. id. Ex. 20, Dkt. 80-6 at 7 (a report through December 11, 2015, showing Langston's December sales at 132% of his quota).
The disparity in the parties' metrics is the result of "a new performance methodology" introduced by T-Mobile in 2015. Langston Decl., Dkt. 79-2 ¶¶ 158. It altered the manner in which line activations were calculated and set quotas based only on net line sales, exclusive of "reactivated" lines. See id. ¶¶ 158175. Langston declares that this methodology was selectively implemented "on targeted employees," and that T-Mobile's official policy "did not differentiate" which quota was to be used for measuring performance. Id. ¶ 180.
Even assuming, [*26]  as T-Mobile contends, that an employee's failure to meet quotas makes him or her unqualified, Langston's evidence of office-wide emails showing that he was consistently exceeding expectations is sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was qualified for his position.
T-Mobile next argues that Langston cannot show a triable issue as to whether he was discharged due to his disability. Dkt. 44 at 20. Langston contends that he can demonstrate causation by comparing T-Mobile's treatment of him and similarly-situated employees. Dkt. 81 at 23.
T-Mobile has the burden of showing that Langston cannot demonstrate that "discrimination was a substantial motivating factor, rather than simply a motivating factor" in the adverse employment decision. Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013) (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, Langston's "prima facie burden is light; the evidence necessary to sustain the burden is minimal." Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 235, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016). It is sufficient to "offer only sufficient circumstantial evidence to give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination," including by showing that other, similarly-situated employees were treated more favorably. Id.; see also McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.
T-Mobile has presented evidence that just prior to Langston's [*27]  termination, two other T-Mobile salespeople were discharged. Ripke Decl., Exs. 15-16, Dkt. 46-2 at 2, 4. At his deposition, Langston stated that one of these employees had been on a performance improvement plan. Ripke Decl., Ex. 2, Dkt. 46-1 at 77-78, Langston Depo. Tr. 206:13-207:7. Langston and T-Mobile each provided evidence that the other employee was terminated for quota-related fraud. Id., Ex. 16, Dkt. 46-2 at 4. T-Mobile argues that these other quota-related terminations preclude a finding that Langston's termination was discriminatory. Dkt. 44 at 13, 20. In response, Langston argues that his failure to meet the quotas was itself the result of disability discrimination, i.e., that other employees were given better opportunities to succeed:
As for whether or not Mr. Langston has shown whether similarly situated employees have been treated the same, we mention only Senior Account Agent Tracee, who was encouraged to poach his territory and Mr. Langston was not permitted to approach hers, or anyone else's. Indeed Mr. Langston has provided abundant evidence as to how he alone was confined to a single small geographic target for sales; and how his quota count was manipulated in a way [*28]  others were not.
Dkt. 81 at 23.
Langston contends that he was prevented from meeting the quotas due to both the discriminatory application of quota methodology, and the discriminatory imposition of limitations specific to him. Langston Decl., Dkt. 79-2 ¶¶ 107-117. In support of these positions, he presented evidence that when he returned from his FMLA leave, his pool of available company leads was significantly reduced, from at least 50,000 to fewer than 18,000, while other similarly-situated employees were not subject to such limitations. See id. ¶ 117; see also Langston Decl., Ex. 61, Dkt. 60-17 at 3; Ex. 63, Dkt. 60-17 at 12 (coworker's statement that he had not been limited to any specific territory and it was "[b]usiness as usual.").
Langston's evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether his termination was discriminatory in that, unlike similarly-situated employees, he was required to meet quotas that he could not reasonably achieve. Such actions could not form an independent basis for a discrimination claim because they were not administratively exhausted. However, "[t]he statute of limitations is a bar to liability, not a rule of evidence. The fact that [*29]  a plaintiffs discharge may be causally related to some earlier discriminatory conduct does not mean that the discharge cannot form the basis for a cause of action." McCaskey, 189 Cal. App. 4th at 977.
* * *
Because Langston's disability is uncontested for purposes of the MSJ, and there are triable issues of fact as to Langston's qualifications and the reason for his termination, T-Mobile has not carried its burden to show that there is not a triable issue as to whether Langston can establish a prima facia case.
(c) Reason for the Termination
As noted, the next step in the process is whether the employer can present evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. The burden of production is not onerous. Bd. of Trs. of Keene State Coll. v. Sweeney, 439 U.S. 24, 25 (1978). In considering an employer's proffered reason for terminating an employee, the truth or falsity of the stated reason is not at issue; rather, "courts 'only require that an employer honestly believed its reason for its actions, even if its reason is foolish or trivial or even baseless.'" Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Nordstrom, Inc., 260 F.3d 727, 733 (7th Cir. 2001)).
"[S]ummary judgment for the employer may . . . be appropriate where, given the strength of the employer's showing of innocent reasons, any countervailing circumstantial evidence of discriminatory [*30]  motive, even if it may technically constitute a prima facie case, is too weak to raise a rational inference that discrimination occurred." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 362; accord Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 890 (9th Cir. 1994) ("[I]n those cases where the prima facie case consists of no more than the minimum necessary to create a presumption of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact" as to pretext.). Thus, "an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000).
Langston does not dispute that T-Mobile has presented the basis for a non-discriminatory reason for termination, i.e., that he did not meet his quotas. See Dkt. 83 at 7 n.1. However, to prevail at summary judgment, T-Mobile must show that Langston cannot show a triable issue as to whether this proffered reason is pretextual. "A plaintiff may meet the burden to show pretext using either direct or circumstantial evidence." Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co. LLC, 413 F.3d 1090, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 2005). Direct evidence, "if [*31]  believed, proves the fact[ of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption." Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting Davis v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., 14 F.3d 1082, 1085 (5th Cir. 1994)) (alteration in original). "Direct evidence typically consists of clearly . . . discriminatory statements or actions by the employer." Coghlan, 413 F.3d at 1095 (citations omitted). Circumstantial evidence "requires an additional inferential step to demonstrate discrimination," and it can "take two forms." Id. A plaintiff can either "make an affirmative case that the employer is biased" or he "can make his case negatively, by showing that the employer's proffered explanation for the adverse action is 'unworthy of credence.'" Id. (quoting Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). An explanation is "unworthy of credence" if it is "internally inconsistent or otherwise not believable." Raad v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1194 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1220). "The distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence is crucial, because it controls the amount of evidence that the plaintiff must present in order to defeat the employer's motion for summary judgment." Coghlan, 413 F.3d at 1095. A plaintiff need only offer "'very little' direct evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact" because it is "so probative." Id. (quoting Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221). On the other hand, a plaintiff must present "specific and substantial" evidence "to defeat the employer's [*32]  motion for summary judgment" if it relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence." Id. (quoting Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1222).
T-Mobile contends that Langston has not produced "any evidence, much less 'substantial evidence' to demonstrate pretext." Dkt. 83 at 7. In his opposition, Langston in relies on "the same questions of fact" that supported his prima facie case, and argues that "it is abundantly clear, that [T-Mobile] wanted Mr. Langston out precisely because he needed so much FMLA leave," and that this is a "plan factual question as to a pretext." Dkt. 81 at 23. None of this evidence is direct. Thus, Langston is subject the "steep" burden of "present[ing] 'specific and substantial' evidence of intentional discrimination." Coghlan, 413 F.3d at 1096.
As discussed above, Langston has produced some evidence that not all similarly-situated employees were limited to certain territories, and that the quota methodology may have been unclear or inconsistently applied. However, this circumstantial evidence is based principally on his own declaration. For example, Langston has declared that there were no clear standards as to whether reactivated lines should be counted within performance metrics to "allow[] management to apply preferential [*33]  treatment, when desired," that he was subject to territorial limitations that were not applied to others, and that he was held to "harsher" standards "as a pretext for discharge.'" Langston Decl., Dkt. 79-2 ¶¶ 124, 180, 183.
There is limited evidence offered by both Langston and T-Mobile as to this issue, including about the manner in which quotas were set and how the corresponding performances of Langston and others were evaluated. There is also proffered evidence about the very serious health issues faced by Langston's prior counsel during the initial discovery period. Finally, for the reasons stated in Section III.C, infra, there is good cause to continue the non-expert discovery deadline by 60 days for certain other purposes. Therefore, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), limited, additional discovery on the pretext issue is appropriate prior to a complete determination of the MSJ. Consequently, rulings are DEFERRED IN PART as to the first, fourth and fifth causes of action, pending supplemental briefing following the limited, additional discovery.
As stated in Section III.C, infra, the discovery permitted there is through the depositions of Kontur, Miles-Hamilton and one or more Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness(es). To the [*34]  extent that one or more of these witness(es) are also the proper ones to address the claim of pretext, both areas shall be addressed at the same deposition(s). In sum, this limited, additional discovery -- i.e., beyond what is described in Section III. C., infra -- is to focus on the manner in which quotas were set, including as to the geographic areas within which employees could make sales, and how the corresponding performances by Langston and others were evaluated. Langston shall provide notice of such a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition as to pretext, including the specific issues to be addressed by the witness(es), within 10 days of the issuance of this Order.
Within ten days of the amended discovery cutoff, Langston shall file a supplemental brief, not to exceed ten pages, as well as any proffered evidence cited in that brief, addressing the issue of pretext. Within ten days thereafter, T-Mobile shall file any response, not to exceed ten pages, as well as any separate evidentiary objections and reply evidence. Upon receiving these filings, a determination will be made whether the MSJ will be taken under submission or a further hearing scheduled.
B. Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim
1. Legal Standards
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) provides [*35]  that a "pleading that states a claim for relief must contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief . . ." The complaint must state facts sufficient to show that a claim for relief is plausible on its face. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The complaint need not include detailed factual allegations, but must provide more than a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Id. at 555. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim. Such a motion may be granted when the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support one. Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008). In considering a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the challenged complaint are deemed true and must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996). However, a court [*36]  need not "accept as true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit. Nor is the court required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001)).
If a motion to dismiss is granted, the court should "freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Although this policy is to be applied "with extreme liberality," Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 1990), allowing leave to amend is inappropriate in circumstances where litigants have failed to cure previously identified deficiencies, or where an amendment would be futile. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962); Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 374 (9th Cir. 1990)
2. Application
a) Breach of Contract
The Counterclaim alleges that "Langston and T-Mobile entered into a contract," i.e., the June 12, 2002 Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement, and that Langston breached its terms. Dkt. 54 ¶ 37; see also Dkt. 63-1, Ex. 2. The Agreement is between Mark Langston and VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, and is signed only by Langston. Dkt. 63-1, Ex. 2 at 38. It includes the following provision: "In the event Employer shall transfer or assign this Agreement, such transferee of assignee shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement in full, [*37]  including without limitation, the noncompetition and confidentiality provisions contained herein." Id. at 37.
(1) Adequacy of the Allegations
The elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) performance by the plaintiff or excuse for non-performance; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) resultant injury to the plaintiff. Green Valley Landowners Ass'n v. City of Vallejo, 241 Cal. App. 4th 425, 433 (2015). Langston argues that T-Mobile "has not satisfied these elements because the evidence is there is [sic] no agreement alleged between T-Mobile and Langston. Dkt. 71 at 16.
"It is elementary that a party asserting a claim must have standing to do so. In asserting a claim based upon a contract, this generally requires the party to be a signatory to the contract, or to be an intended third party beneficiary." Berclain Am. Latina v. Baan Co., 74 Cal. App. 4th 401, 405, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 745 (1999) (citing E. Aviation Grp., Inc. v. Airborne Express, Inc., Cal. App. 4th 1448, 1452 (1992); Cal. Civ. Code § 1559). T-Mobile is not a signatory to the Agreement, and the Counterclaim does not allege a relationship between T-Mobile and VoiceStream. However, the California Supreme Court has long held that an obligation subject to an assignment clause are "for the benefit of the plaintiff or its assignors and is clearly enforceable . . . by virtue of the provisions of section 1559 of the Civil Code, which provides" [*38]  a right of enforcement to third-party beneficiaries. Pac. Venture Corp. v. Huey, 15 Cal. 2d 711, 718, 104 P.2d 641 (1940). It is "not tenable" for a defendant to contend unenforceability on the grounds that "there is nothing in either the complaint or findings to show any privity of contract between defendant and plaintiff," where the defendant "knew of plaintiffs claim, and the contract out of which it arose." Id. (quoting Washer v. Indep. Mining & Dev. Co., 142 Cal. 702, 707, 76 P. 654 (1904)).
The Counterclaim sufficiently alleges the following: the claim against Langston is based upon the Agreement, to which he is a signatory; T-Mobile has fulfilled its obligations under the contract; Langston's actions breached the contract; and T-Mobile has been injured as a result of those actions. Dkt. 54 ¶¶ 37-43. Although the Counterclaim does not allege that T-Mobile is the successor in interest to VoiceStream, the terms of the Agreement include that VoiceStream can assign its rights. Dkt. 63-1, Ex. 2 at 37. Moreover, at his deposition, Langston testified that he was employed by "VoiceStream . . . [w]hich eventually became T-Mobile." Daryanani Decl., Ex. B, Dkt. 77-1 at 16:11-13; see also id. Ex. C., Dkt. 77-1 at 20. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for a breach of contract under California law. Because T-Mobile [*39]  has demonstrated Langston's knowledge of its status as assignee, Pacific Venture and Washer do not require further allegations as to privity.
(2) Unconscionability
Langston next argues that the MTD should be granted because the Agreement is unconscionable. Dkt. 71 at 17. "Under California law . . . unconscionability is an affirmative defense." Rubio v. Capital One Bank, 613 F.3d 1195, 1205 (9th Cir. 2010). "Ordinarily affirmative defenses may not be raised by motion to dismiss." Scott v. Kuhlmann, 746 F.2d 1377, 1378 (9th Cir. 1984). Nevertheless, "the assertion of an affirmative defense may be considered properly on a motion to dismiss where the 'allegations in the complaint suffice to establish' the defense." Sams v. Yahoo! Inc., 713 F.3d 1175, 1179 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 215, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007)).
The California Supreme Court has explained unconscionability as follows:
[T]he doctrine of unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element, the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on overly harsh or one-sided results. The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability. But they need not be present in the same degree. . . . [T]he more substantively [*40]  oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.
Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC, 61 Cal. 4th 899, 910, 190 Cal. Rptr. 3d 812, 353 P.3d 741 (2015) (internal citations omitted).
Langston argues that the Agreement is unconscionable because the version offered is not signed by a representative of VoiceStream or T-Mobile. Dkt. 71 at 17. However, a contract is enforceable by a non-signing party, so long as it has "performed, or offer[ed] to perform . . . and the case is otherwise proper for enforcing specific performance." Cal. Civ. Code § 3388. Specific performance is the remedy sought by T-Mobile, and the Counterclaim sufficiently alleges that it has performed its obligations. Dkt. 54 ¶¶ 38, 43.
Langston next contends that specific circumstances in which he signed the Agreement, as well as its terms, show that it is unconscionable. Dkt. 71 at 18-23. These include VoiceStream's "superior bargaining power" and "unilateral" transfer rights, as well as Langston's "obligation to disclose any vague business opportunity,'" obligation to pay attorney's fees, and obligation to follow "broad, and exceptionally vague" confidentiality restrictions. Id. Langston contends that the employer had "superior [*41]  bargaining power," and that both the vagueness and "[t]he shocking nature of the terms becomes clear from reviewing them." Id. at 18.
A contract is oppressive only where a disparity in the relative bargaining powers of the parties led to "no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice." Poublon v. C.H. Robinson, Co., 846 F. 3d 1251, 1260-61 (9th Cir. 2017) (citing Gran Prospect Partners, L.P. v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc., 232 Cal. App. 4th 1332, 1347-48 (2015), as modified on denial of reh'g (Feb. 9, 2015)). "An evaluation of unconscionability is highly dependent on context." Sanchez, 61 Cal. 4th at 911 (citing Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 350 F.2d 445, 450, 121 U.S. App. D.C. 315 (D.C. Cir. 1965) ("The test is not simple, nor can it be mechanically applied.")). Both elements of the inquiry are fact-intensive. Marin Storage & Trucking, Inc. v. Benco Contracting and Eng'g, Inc., 89 Cal. App. 4th 1042, 1055, 107 Cal. Rptr. 2d 645 (2001). The extremity of terms also requires examining of "the mores and business practices of the time and place." Sanchez, 61 Cal. 4th at 912 (quoting Williams, 350 F.2d at 450). With respect to the claim of "vagueness," "[i]f a contract is ambiguous as applied to a particular set of facts, a court has insufficient data to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim." SEC v. Lee, 720 F. Supp. 2d 305, 332 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).
For these reasons, although "[u]ltimately, unconscionability is question of law to be decided by the Court, such a decision cannot be reached where there are disputed questions of fact." See McCollum v. XCare.net, Inc., 212 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1150 (N.D. Cal. 2002) ("In addition, because there is a 'sliding scale' relationship between procedural and substantive unconscionability, disputed questions of [*42]  fact with respect to either the procedural or substantive aspects of the contract will preclude a legal determination of unconscionability.").
(3) Damages
Langston argues that T-Mobile has failed to allege damages. Dkt. 71 at 25. The Counterclaim alleges that "T-Mobile has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm" through "Langston's continued possession of 1-Mobile's confidential, proprietary, and highly sensitive information . . . in that T-Mobile will lose the confidentiality of its own business information." Dkt. 54 ¶ 43. T-Mobile alleges that the breach of contract as injured it "in an amount to be proven at trial." Id. ¶ 42.
"Breach of contract claims are subject to the notice pleading standard of Rule 8(a), which requires only 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Artifex Software, Inc. v. Hancom, Inc., No. 16-CV-06982-JSC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6281, 2017 WL 1477373, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)). Although an allegation of "damages in an amount to be proved at trial" is inadequate unless a plaintiff "identif[ies] any damages it suffered," the Counterclaim does so. It alleges that T-Mobile "spent significant time, effort, and money to develop, acquire, maintain, and protect its confidential . . . business information," including compilations, and [*43]  that this data "is its most valuable asset," providing "T-Mobile with a competitive advantage." Dkt. 54 ¶¶ 15-16.
In California, a trade secret is "information . . . that: (1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy." Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.1(d). The allegation that Langston has retained such information, and that this jeopardizes its confidentiality and corresponding economic value, is "a specific form of damages," and "more than simply conclusory or speculative." Benedict v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. 13-CV-00119-LHK, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7331, 2014 WL 234218, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 21, 2014). Such "specific allegations of damage . . . are sufficient to satisfy the requirement to plead 'actual and appreciable' damages under California breach of contract law." 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7331, [WL] at *5.
* * *
For these reasons, the breach of contract counterclaim is adequately alleged. Therefore, the MTD is DENIED as to this counterclaim.
b) Conversion
It is alleged that "Langston took property belonging to T-Mobile, including but not limited to documents and computer files relating to T-Mobile's operations, procedures, and methods. This includes, [*44]  but is not limited to, proprietary and confidential information, including T-Mobile's Daily Sales Reports and related information." Dkt. 54 ¶ 28. T-Mobile seeks the return of "any other T-Mobile property that may be in his possession." Id. ¶ 30.
"In California, conversion has three elements: ownership or right to possession of property, wrongful disposition of the property right and damages." G.S. Rasmussen & Assocs., Inc. v. Kalitta Flying Serv., Inc., 958 F.2d 896, 906 (9th Cir. 1992). "[I]f the only property identified in the complaint is confidential or proprietary information, and the only basis for any property right is trade secrets law, then a conversion claim predicated on the theft of that property is preempted [by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act 'CUTSA']." Avago Techs. U.S. Inc. v. Nanoprecision Prod., Inc., No. 16-CV-03737-JCS, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13484, 2017 WL 412524, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2017). CUTSA includes a preemption provision that supersedes common law and statutory theories of recovery to the extent that they are predicated on the same facts upon which a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets could be advanced. Language Line Servs., Inc. v. Language Servs. Assocs., LLC, No. C 10-02605 JW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28170, 2011 WL 13153247, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2011); see also Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.7. CUTSA preemption also applies where "the confidential information at issue was written on a piece of paper or embodied in a model where there are no allegations suggesting that the tangible property . . . had any value apart from the confidential information disclosed [*45]  in it." Avago Techs., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13484, 2017 WL 412524, at *7.
The parties agree that CUTSA preempts a conversion claim for the misappropriation of trade secrets. T-Mobile argues that physical property, such as "a hard drive or other computer equipment," is not within the scope of CUTSA preemption. Dkt. 77 at 21-22. However, the only property identified in the Counterclaim is "documents and computer files," for which recovery is preempted. See Dkt. 54 ¶ 28. Although the Counterclaim does not identify any physical property, leave to amend would not be futile to the extent that T-Mobile can make good faith allegations as to the demand of the return of physical property, other than trade secrets, that has independent value. See Loop Al Labs Inc v. Gatti, No. 15-CV-00798-HSG, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117268, 2015 WL 5158461, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2015) (finding that a claim for conversion of a "work computer" was "fundamentally different," and not preempted.).
For these reasons, the MTD is GRANTED as to the counterclaim for conversion, with leave to amend.
c) Unfair Business Practices
The Counterclaim advances a cause of action for unlawful, unfair and/or deceptive business practices, on the basis of Langston's previously-alleged conduct. Dkt. 54 ¶¶ 44-46. As a remedy, it seeks disgorgement of any windfall Langston may have received. Id. at 10.
"[A] breach of contract [*46]  may form the predicate for a section 17200 claim, provided it also constitutes conduct that is unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent." Sybersound Records, Inc. v. UAV Corp., 517 F.3d 1137, 1152 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting (Nat'l Rural Telecomm. Co—op. v. DIRECTV, Inc., 319 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1074 (C.D. Cal. 2003)). However, where the "breaching conduct implicates CUTSA, and thus the 'unlawful' prong of the UCL," CUTSA preemption is warranted. Deerpoint Grp., Inc. v. Agrigenix, LLC, 345 F. Supp. 3d 1207, 1239 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (dismissing a UCL claim premised on a breach of contract, where the alleged breach related to trade secret misappropriation).11
Because the only viable claim is breach of contract, an essential element of which is the loss of economic value in confidential business information, the UCL claim arises out of the "same nucleus of facts" as a de facto trade secrets claim. "[A]ll state law claims based on the same nucleus of facts as the trade secrets claim are preempted under California's UTSA." Digital Envoy, Inc. v. Google, Inc., 370 F. Supp. 2d 1025, 1034 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (citing Callaway Golf v. Dunlop Slazenger Grp. Ams., 318 F. Supp. 2d 216, 219 (D. Del. 2004)). Thus, where a "statutory unfair competition claim rests squarely on its factual allegations of trade secret misappropriation. . . . this claim is preempted." K.C. Multimedia, Inc. v. Bank of Am. Tech. & Operations, Inc., 171 Cal. App. 4th 939, 962, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 247 (2009) (emphasis added).
For these reasons, the UCL claim as alleged is preempted by CUTSA. The MID is GRANTED as to the counterclaim for violation of the Unfair Competition Law. Because an amended claim for conversion could form the basis for a UCL claim, leave to amend is warranted. [*47]  See Loop Al Labs Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117268, 2015 WL 5158461, at *3.
C. Motion to Extend Discovery / Amend Scheduling Order

1. Legal Standards
A request for leave to amend made after the entry of a Rule 16 Scheduling Order is governed primarily by Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b). Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 608-09 (9th Cir.1992). "A schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge's consent." Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). This "'good cause' standard primarily considers the diligence of the party seeking the amendment." Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609. Although a court may take into account any prejudice to the non-moving party, "the focus of the [Rule 16(b)] inquiry is upon the moving party's reasons for seeking modification." In re W. States Wholesale Nat. Gas Antitrust Litig., 715 F.3d 716, 737 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609), aff'd sub nom. Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., 575 U.S. 373, 135 S. Ct. 1591, 191 L. Ed. 2d 511 (2015). "If that party was not diligent, the inquiry should end." Id. Thus, "[a] party's failure to act diligently is determinative." Manriquez v. City of Phoenix, 654 F. App'x 350, 351 (9th Cir. 2016). Prejudice to the non-moving party, the ability of that party to cure any such prejudice, the impact of the modification of the orderly conduct of trial, and bad faith may be considered as well. See Galdamez v. Potter, 415 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Byrd v. Guess, 137 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 1998)).
2. Application
The initial Scheduling Order set June 4, 2018 as the last day to amend pleadings, and November 20, 2018 as the non-expert discovery cut-off. Dkt. 21. On February 11, 2019, Langston's lead counsel was permitted to withdraw, and T-Mobile was given leave to file its Counterclaim. Dkt. 55. Langston's [*48]  other counsel was permitted to withdraw on March 11, 2019. Dkt. 58. The March 11 Order set a June 24, 2019 non-expert discovery cutoff as to the Counterclaim, and stated that if Langston retained new counsel, "new counsel may apply, for good cause shown, to extend one or more of the foregoing deadlines." Id. at 2. On April 26, 2019, Langston obtained new counsel. Dkt. 74.
On June 26, 2019, two days after the Counterclaim discovery cutoff, Langston moved to amend the Scheduling Order "to reopen the discovery period and continue all pretrial deadlines for 90 days, so that Mr. Langston's newly appointed counsel can serve written discovery, take depositions, file discovery motions if needed, designate experts, set mediation on a date certain, and amend his complaint, if discovery reveals evidence supporting an amendment." Dkt. 84 at 5-6. He argues that, due to the then near-term deadlines related to the MSJ, he had no meaningful opportunity to conduct discovery as to the Counterclaim. Id. at 8. He also states that he seeks a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition from T-Mobile as to both the agreements that are alleged in Counterclaim and damages. He also seeks to leave to depose Kontur and Miles-Hamilton. Id. at [*49]  8-10. Langston argues that the failure of his prior counsel to take any depositions was not his fault, and that "he should not now be prejudiced by it." Id. at 11.
T-Mobile responds that it has agreed to limited discovery on the Counterclaim. Dkt. 86 at 4-5. However, it argues that the decision by Langston's prior counsel to conduct limited discovery as to the Complaint should not be ignored. Thus, it contends that there is not sufficient good cause to reopen discovery deadlines that expired while Langston was represented by his original counsel. Id. at 5. T-Mobile argues that, although Langston's previous counsel elected not to take depositions, they took other pretrial actions: they "filed a motion to remand, attended mediation, entered into a protective order, defended Plaintiffs deposition, propounded and responded to discovery, produced and received documents in discovery, and addressed discovery disputes." Id. In light of this history, T-Mobile contends that the decision by Langston's prior counsel to forgo depositions does not constitute good cause "to again extend deadlines." Id.
Limited good cause has been shown to amend the Scheduling Order. The Counterclaim was filed on February [*50]  12, 2019, the day after Langston's lead counsel had withdrawn due to ill health, and while his other counsel was seeking to withdraw. Between appearing in this action and the close of the Counterclaim discovery period, Langston's new counsel had only two months to become familiar with the case, file an opposition to the MSJ, and file the MTD. Therefore, it was reasonable that he did not have the opportunity to conduct further discovery related to the Counterclaim. See Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609. Moreover, T-Mobile has agreed that the non-expert discovery deadline as to the Counterclaim should be extended at least "to take three depositions . . . as to the Counterclaim only," including one person most knowledgeable, Kontur, and Miles-Hamilton. Dkt. 86 at 9.
For these reasons, there is sufficient good cause to modify the scheduling order. Therefore, the MTE is GRANTED IN PART. The non-expert discovery deadline is continued by 60 days from the date of this order for the limited purpose of a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of the person(s) most knowledgeable as to the issues presented by the Counterclaim or any timely amended counterclaim, as well for the depositions of Kontur and Miles-Hamilton; provided, however, to the extent that [*51]  new factual issues are presented by an amended counterclaim, appropriate, corresponding discovery may also be permitted. The MTE is DENIED IN PART as to the general request to reopen discovery, except as to the question of pretext subject to the limitations discussed supra.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons stated in this Order, the MSJ is GRANTED IN PART; the MID is GRANTED IN PART with leave to amend; and the MTE is GRANTED IN PART. T-Mobile shall file any amended Counterclaim no later than January 21, 2020.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
