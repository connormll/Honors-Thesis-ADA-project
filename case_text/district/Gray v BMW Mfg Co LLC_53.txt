Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE
This matter is before the Court on a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant BMW Manufacturing Co. LLC ("BMW") and a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Management Analysis & Utilization Inc. ("MAU"). [Docs. 34, 35.] Plaintiff brings this case pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge for consideration.
Plaintiff filed this action on October 6, 2015. [Doc. 1.] On December 15, 2016, BMW and MAU each filed a motion [*2]  to dismiss. [Docs. 34, 35.] Plaintiff filed a joint response in opposition on December 29, 2016 [Doc. 36], and Defendants each filed a reply on January 5, 2017 [Docs. 38, 39]. Accordingly, the motions for summary judgment are ripe for review.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff has attention deficit disorder ("ADD"), for which he has been prescribed Adderall. [Doc. 36-1 at 45-46.] In November 2012, Plaintiff sought employment with MAU for a position at BMW.1 [Doc. 35-2 at 6.] Plaintiff was offered a position as a logistics associate with MAU and was sent for a pre-placement drug test. [Id. at 7.] Plaintiff completed a form consenting to the drug test and listed Adderall as a medication he had taken within the previous three months. [Doc. 35-4.] The results of Plaintiff's pre-placement drug test were negative. [Doc. 35-6.] Plaintiff was then hired by MAU and assigned to work at BMW. [Doc. 35-2 at 28.]
As part of his job duties, Plaintiff drove a forklift. [Doc. 35-29 at 4.] On January 22, 2013, Plaintiff was using a forklift to stack containers, and one of the containers struck a control panel, damaging the panel. [Doc. 35-11.] In accordance with its Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy, MAU required Plaintiff [*3]  to submit to a drug test following the accident. [Id.; Doc. 35-10.]
At the time of the accident, specimen for drug testing at MAU were collected by Industrial Health Services ("IHS") onsite at BMW. [Docs. 35-31 at 3; 35-26 at 6.] IHS was operated by Take Care Health. [Doc. 35-31 at 2.] The first step in the drug testing process was an instant urine test conducted onsite. [Doc. 35-26 at 6.] A urine specimen and hair specimen were also collected and sent offsite for testing. [Id.] The urine specimen was sent to LabCorp, and the hair specimen was sent to Psychemedics. [Id. at 7.] If these offsite results were positive, they were sent to Michael Alday, M.D. ("Dr. Alday"), the medical review officer ("MRO") for MAU.2 [Docs. 35-30 at 3-4; 35-27 at 5, 8.]
LaShaunna Brannon ("Brannon") was the drug screen coordinator at Regional Occupational Health who helped Dr. Alday verify drug test results. [Doc. 35-23 at 4.] In that role, if the results were negative, Brannon processed the results as negative. [Id.] If the results were positive for an illegal drug such as marijuana, cocaine, or heroin, Brannon did not attempt to contact the employee, and Dr. Alday signed off on the drug test results; however, if [*4]  the results were positive for amphetamines, methamphetamines, opiates, or benzos, Brannon attempted to contact the employee to obtain prescription information. [Id. at 4, 8.] Dr. Alday instructed Brannon to call the telephone numbers listed on the employee's chain of custody form and to introduce herself, explain why she was calling, and tell the employee what documents were needed to verify a prescription. [Id. at 6.] If no one answered the call, Brannon left a message. [Id. at 7.] If the employee identified himself by name on the voicemail greeting, she left a message stating her name, that she was calling about a drug screen result, and her number to call back. [Id.] If the voicemail greeting was generic, Brannon left a message with her name, that she was calling from Regional Occupational Health, and her number to call back. [Id.] If Brannon never heard back from an employee,3 she would mark the results as positive, and Dr. Alday would review and sign the results. [Id. at 9.] Once Dr. Alday signed the results, they were sent to MAU. [Doc. 35-27 at 4.]
On January 24, 2013, Plaintiff completed a form consenting to the drug test and listed Adderall and allergy medication as medications he had taken within the previous [*5]  three months. [Doc. 35-14.] The preliminary urine drug screen was negative. [Doc. 35-12.] The offsite hair test was also negative [Doc. 35-16 at 2]; however, the offsite urine test was positive [id. at 1]. A phone log indicates Brannon attempted to contact Plaintiff four times—on February 5, 2013; February 6, 2013; February 7, 2013; and February 8, 2013—and left a message each time. [Doc. 35-24.] However, Plaintiff testified that he received no messages regarding his drug screen results and that he never set up voicemail on the phone he was using at the time. [Doc. 35-2 at 15, 17, 19.] Plaintiff never answered nor returned any of Brannon's calls. [Doc. 35-24.] On February 8, 2013, Dr. Alday signed the results of Plaintiff's drug tests, indicating the results were positive for amphetamines. [Doc. 35-18.]
Plaintiff was terminated on February 15, 2013,4 because the MRO confirmed a positive drug test result. [Doc. 35-19.] On that day, Plaintiff met with Rice and another MAU supervisor. [Doc. 35-2 at 19.] Rice informed Plaintiff that he was being terminated based on the positive drug test result. [Id.] During the meeting, Plaintiff offered to provide proof of a prescription for Adderall, but Rice [*6]  told Plaintiff that because he had failed to respond to calls from the testing site or to provide a valid prescription, the results had been certified as positive. [Id.]
After the termination meeting, Plaintiff contacted MAU about submitting proof of a prescription for Adderall. [Id. at 20.] He spoke with someone at MAU, who told Plaintiff to call the testing center. [Id.] When Plaintiff called the testing center, he was told that MAU would have to give the testing center permission to accept a prescription. [Id. at 18.]
On June 13, 2013, Plaintiff signed a charge of discrimination ("Charge") with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). [Doc. 35-20.] The Charge alleged that Plaintiff had been discriminated against and retaliated against based on his disability. [Id.] On July 8, 2015, the EEOC issued a Notice of Right to Sue. [Doc. 35-21.]

APPLICABLE LAW

Summary Judgment Standard
Rule 56 states, as to a party who has moved for summary judgment:
The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect disposition [*7]  of the case under applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257. When determining whether a genuine issue has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and ambiguities against the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).
The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant has made this threshold demonstration, the non-moving party, to survive the motion for summary judgment, may not rest on the allegations averred in his pleadings. Id. at 324. Rather, the non-moving party must demonstrate specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine issue. Id. Under this standard, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-movant's position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory allegations or denials, without more, are insufficient to preclude granting the summary judgment motion. Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir.1985), overruled on other grounds, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1989). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing [*8]  law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Further, Rule 56 provides in pertinent part:
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Accordingly, when Rule 56(c) has shifted the burden of proof to the non-movant, he must produce existence of a factual dispute on every element essential to his action that he bears the burden of adducing at a trial on the merits.

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff alleges three causes of action against BMW and MAU—discrimination in violation of the ADA, failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA, and retaliation in violation of the ADA.5 [Doc. 1.] As discussed below, the undersigned recommends [*9]  that only Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim against MAU should survive the motions for summary judgment.

Claims Against BMW
As an initial matter, BMW's motion for summary judgment should be granted because Plaintiff has failed to establish any involvement by BMW in the decision to terminate Plaintiff or in the alleged failure to accommodate. Although BMW concedes for purposes of its motion for summary judgment that a joint employment relationship exists between MAU and BMW and, thus, BMW is Plaintiff's employer within the meaning of the ADA [Doc. 34-1 at 1 n.1], nothing in the record supports a finding that BMW had any involvement in the situation after it reported the forklift accident to MAU [Doc. 36-5 at 4]. See Burton v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., 798 F.3d 222, 228 (5th Cir. 2015) ("[E]stablishing a <joint employer' relationship does not create liability in the co-employer for actions taken by the other employer." (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Whitaker v. Milwaukee Cty., 772 F.3d 802, 811 (7th Cir. 2014); Torres-Negron v. Merck & Co., 488 F.3d 34, 41 n.6 (1st Cir. 2007); Llampallas v. Mini-Circuits, Lab, Inc., 163 F.3d 1236, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 1998)); Williams v. Grimes Aerospace Co., 988 F.Supp. 925, 937 (D.S.C. 1997) ("[W]hen an employee claims discrimination against two employers, she <must show that [each] defendant knew or should have known of the discriminatory conduct and that it failed to take those corrective measures within its control.'" (second alteration in Williams) (citations omitted)). Instead, Plaintiff [*10]  asserts only that members of MAU management—not BMW employees—knew about Plaintiff's positive drug test result and Adderall prescription as of February 11, 2013. [Doc. 36 at 12-13.] Rice testified that MAU informed BMW of Plaintiff's termination after the decision had been made. [Doc. 35-29 at 6.] Nothing in the record establishes that BMW participated in the meeting when Plaintiff was notified of the termination. Accordingly, BMW's motion for summary judgment should be granted.

Claims Against MAU

Discrimination and Retaliation Claims
The ADA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA's retaliation provision provides, in relevant part, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual . . . made a charge . . . under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Absent direct or circumstantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an impermissible factor motivated an employer's adverse employment action, [*11]  a plaintiff may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas "pretext" framework to establish a claim of employment discrimination or retaliation.6 Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 285 (4th Cir. 2004)); see Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'l of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995) (holding that "the McDonnell Douglas scheme of proof applies to appropriate claims under the ADA").
Under this framework, an employee must first prove a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation.7 McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. By providing such an explanation, the employer rebuts the presumption of discrimination or retaliation created by the prima facie case, and "[t]he presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the [employer] to come forward with some response, simply drops out of the picture." St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510-11, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). If the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the articulated reason was actually a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.
Here, even assuming that Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination and/or retaliation, [*12]  MAU has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment.8 Specifically, MAU maintains that Plaintiff's termination resulted from a confirmed positive drug test result. MAU's Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy states that if the MRO confirms a positive test result by the offsite laboratory, the employee will be terminated. [Doc. 35-10.] On February 8, 2013, Dr. Alday signed the results of Plaintiff's drug tests, indicating the results were positive for amphetamines. [Doc. 35-18.] Because MAU has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, the Court will consider whether Plaintiff has met his burden of demonstrating that MAU's proffered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination or retaliation, which would indicate whether Plaintiff could meet his ultimate burden of persuasion and demonstrate retaliation vel non. See Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294.
Generally, to prove an employer's articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination or retaliation, a plaintiff "must prove 'both that the reason was false, and that [retaliation] was the real reason' for the challenged conduct." Jiminez v. Mary Wash. Coll., 57 F.3d 369, 378 (4th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original) (quoting St Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 515). However, "a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the [*14]  trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully [retaliated]." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). Ultimately, to survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must demonstrate "a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make [the employer's] proferred justification a triable issue." Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Invs., LLC, 828 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir. 2016).
Plaintiff does not dispute that his offsite urine test result was positive. Rather, Plaintiff argues that MAU deviated from its established practice of having MAU management contact employees who had a positive drug test result to collect prescription information and, therefore, MAU sabotaged the post-testing process to engineer a positive result. [Doc. 36 at 20-25.] Plaintiff is correct that "[a] deviation from normal business practices can illustrate pretext." Palomino v. Concord Hosp. Enters. Co., 126 F. Supp. 3d 647, 655 (D.S.C. 2015). However, even assuming MAU had an established practice of assisting the MRO to contact employees who had a positive drug test result,9 nothing in the record suggests that MAU was notified that Brannon could not get in touch with Plaintiff nor does the record suggest that Brannon asked Somers or MAU to contact Plaintiff. Plaintiff has failed to direct the Court to any evidence establishing that anyone at MAU knew about Plaintiff's positive drug [*15]  test result before MAU received the certified results from the MRO. Indeed, Plaintiff contends that members of MAU management knew about Plaintiff's test result and Adderall prescription as of February 11, 2013 [Doc. 36 at 12-13 (citing Doc. 36-4 at 9-10)], three days after the MRO certified the drug test results as positive for amphetamines [Doc. 35-18]. MAU's Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy provides that if the MRO "confirms a positive test result by the off-site laboratory, then the associate's employment will be terminated." [Doc. 35-10.] Oakley testified that MAU relied on the MRO, as the medical expert, to inform MAU whether a drug test result was positive or negative. [Doc. 35-27 at 6.] Moreover, Oakley indicated to others that the MRO would have contacted Plaintiff to discuss medications before signing off on the results.10 [Doc. 36-4 at 9-10.] Thus, nothing in the record supports a finding that the decision to terminate Plaintiff was made for any reason other than a violation of MAU's Alcohol and Substance Abuse Policy.11 Regardless of this Court's opinion of whether Plaintiff's termination was fair, it is outside the Court's province to decide "whether the reason was wise, [*16]  fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination." Hawkins v. Pepsico, 203 F.3d 274, 279 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting DeJarnette v. Corning, Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating "a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make [the employer's] proferred justification a triable issue," see Guessous, 828 F.3d at 217, because the record does not support a finding that MAU's proferred reason for terminating Plaintiff is false. Accordingly, MAU's motion for summary judgment should be granted with respect to Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims.

Failure to Accommodate Claim
To establish a failure to accommodate claim, Plaintiff must show (1) he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) his employer knew of the disability; (3) with reasonable accommodations, he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job; and (4) his employer refused to make such reasonable accommodations. Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). Here, MAU does not argue Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, and Plaintiff has established a genuine dispute of material fact regarding each of the other elements.
On September 25, 2008, Congress enacted [*17]  the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), which took effect on January 1, 2009. Pub. L. No. 110-325; 122 Stat. 3553, 3553 (Sept. 25, 2008). The ADAAA expressed congressional concern that case law from the United States Supreme Court had "narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect." Id. The ADAAA "reject[ed] the standards enunciated" in previous Supreme Court cases and stated that "[t]he definition of disability [under the ADA] shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals." Id.; see Summers v. Altarum Inst., Corp., 740 F.3d 325, 329 (4th Cir. 2014). As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated:
The [ADAAA] was intended to make it "easier for people with disabilities to obtain protection under the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(c)(4). The regulation clarifies that "[t]he primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability." Id. "[T]he question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis." Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(5) (2008). In enacting the ADAAA, Congress abrogated earlier inconsistent caselaw. Summers, 740 F.3d at 331.
Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 572 (4th Cir. 2015) (some alterations in Jacobs).
The ADAAA defines "disability" [*18]  as: (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). "Major life activities" means:
(A) In general
For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
(B) Major bodily functions
For purposes of paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). The EEOC's regulations state that an impairment is a disability if it "substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). "An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in [*19]  order to be considered substantially limiting." Id. Congress enacted several rules of construction in the ADAAA, stating as follows: (1) the definition of disability shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals; (2) the term "substantially limits" shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes of the ADAAA; (3) an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities to be considered a disability; (4) an impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active; and (5) the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as, inter alia, medication and medical supplies. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4).
At his deposition, Plaintiff testified that his ADD caused a "[l]ack of focus." [Doc. 53-2 at 9.] In his affidavit,12 Plaintiff elaborates on the symptoms caused by his ADD, explaining that his ADD causes difficulty focusing on certain tasks, which causes him to take longer than an ordinary person to complete the tasks, and caused him to have difficulty listening [*20]  and understanding when he was in school. [Doc. 36-2 ¶¶ 4-5.] Plaintiff further avers that when he has not taken medication for ADD, he has had extreme difficulty concentrating for extended periods of time; has had conflicts with supervisors; has received written discipline at work; has had a hard time focusing and staying on task; and has been terminated from positions because he could not focus, stay on task, or complete his work quickly enough. [Id. ¶¶ 4, 11, 20, 21.] Applying the foregoing law to the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff is substantially limited by his ADD in the major life activities of concentrating and working and, thus, is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 574 ("We therefore find that a reasonable jury could conclude that Jacobs was substantially limited in her ability to interact with others and thus disabled within the meaning of the ADA.").
Moreover, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff requested an accommodation when he asked to be able to submit a prescription to explain his failed drug test, and a reasonable jury could conclude that MAU knew about Plaintiff's ADD at the time he asked to be able to submit a prescription. "Reasonable accommodation" may include:
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). Plaintiff testified that, during the termination meeting, he informed Rice that he had not received any missed calls related to his failed drug test. [Id.] Plaintiff also told [*22]  Rice that he took Adderall for his ADD, and he offered to show proof of a prescription for Adderall. [Doc. 35-2 at 19.] Although Plaintiff characterizes his accommodation request as being permitted to take his prescribed medication without being fired for doing so, Plaintiff's request to show proof of a prescription for Adderall could also be viewed as a request to extend the time during which he could provide proof of a prescription. Applying the foregoing law to the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff requested an accommodation when he asked to be allowed to provide proof of a prescription for Adderall.13 See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (including in the non-exhaustive examples of reasonable accommodations "appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations . . . or policies"); Hammel v. Soar Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14361, 2015 WL 505410, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2015) (holding that "a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff requested an accommodation when she asked whether she would be permitted to collect medication documentation to explain her failed drug test). Moreover, a reasonable jury could find that MAU knew about Plaintiff's ADD when he asked to be allowed to provide proof of a prescription [*23]  for Adderall.
Finally, a reasonable jury could conclude that MAU failed to engage in the interactive process with Plaintiff after he asked to be allowed to provide proof of a prescription for Adderall. The ADA regulations provide:
To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
Wilson, 717 F.3d at 346 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). Thus, the ADA imposes upon employers a good-faith duty "to engage [with their employees] in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Id. This duty is triggered when an employee communicates his disability and desire for an accommodation—even if the employee fails to identify a specific, reasonable accommodation. Id.
Plaintiff testified that when he offered to provide proof of a prescription for Adderall during the termination meeting, Rice told Plaintiff that because he had failed to respond to calls from the testing site or to provide a valid prescription, the [*24]  results had been certified positive. [Doc. 35-2 at 19.] Plaintiff also testified that he subsequently contacted MAU about submitting proof of a prescription for Adderall and was told to call the testing center. [Id. at 20.] When he contacted the testing center, he was told that MAU would have to give the testing center permission to accept a prescription. [Id. at 18.] Applying the foregoing law to the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Defendants failed to engage in the interactive process with Plaintiff and denied his request for an accommodation. Thus, MAU's motion for summary judgment should be denied with respect to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Wherefore, based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends that BMW's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 34] be GRANTED and MAU's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 35] be GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims and DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
