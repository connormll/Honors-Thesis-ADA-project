Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
WILKERSON, Magistrate Judge:
This matter has been referred to United States Magistrate Judge Donald G. Wilkerson by United States District Nancy J. Rosenstengel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), and SDIL-LR 72.1(a) for a Report and Recommendation on the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Coe (Doc. 64) and the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants Duncan, Tredway, Benton and Martin (Doc. 66). For [*2]  the reasons set forth below, it is RECOMMENDED Defendant Coe's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 64) be DENIED, that the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Duncan, Tredway, Benton and Martin (Doc. 66) be GRANTED as to Defendant Benton but DENIED as to Defendants Duncan, Tredway and Martin, and the Court adopt the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.

Findings of Fact
Plaintiff Bryant H. Harvey, Jr., brought this action for deprivations of his constitutional rights while housed at Lawrence Correctional Center in 2015. The Court conducted a preliminary review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A and Harvey was allowed to proceed on the following claims:
Count 1: Defendants Martin, Coe, Duncan, and Tredway failed to ensure Plaintiff received accommodations for his disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., and the Eighth Amendment;
Count 2: Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, specifically:
a. Defendant Benton's failure to respond to Plaintiff's July 26, 2015, letter regarding Warden Duncan's failure to respond to emergency grievances;
b. Defendant Coe's August 10, 2015, rejection of the recommendation [*3]  regarding a bone marrow transplant and hip replacement;
c. Defendant Coe's September 3, 2015, denial of effective pain medication, prescribing only Tylenol;
d. Defendant Gerrard's September 3, 2015, delay in providing Plaintiff with Tylenol;
e. Defendant Coe's September 4, 2015, refusal to treat Plaintiff's severe pain or otherwise treat Plaintiff;
f. Defendant James's September 16, 2015, failure to treat Plaintiff's priapism and pain stemming from a sickle cell attack;
g. Defendant Coe's October 16, 2015, insistence that Plaintiff either take a medication he is allergic to or go without pain relief; and
h. Defendants Duncan, Benton, and Tredway's knowingly allowing Plaintiff's serious medical needs to go untreated, whether by policy, practice or custom.
Harvey has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, seizures, and avascular necrosis (Doc. 70, p. 15; Doc. 77, p. 1).1 Harvey has been treated by multiple doctors throughout his life for his sickle cell anemia, and for avascular necrosis since 2008 (Doc. 70, p. 15; Doc. 77, p. 1). When Harvey first arrived at Lawrence Correctional Center, he was prescribed a wheelchair (Doc. 70-2, p. 14). He was subsequently [*4]  prescribed an ADA attendant, wheelchair cushion, air mattress, low bunk/gallery permit, and quad cane (Doc. 70-2, p. 15, 17, 18, 19 and 21). Plaintiff testified in deposition that he was placed in a cell that was not large enough to accommodate his wheelchair (Doc. 70-1, 55:3-18). Thus, his cell-mate was responsible for carrying him around the cell, including to the restroom, and into or out of the cell in emergencies (70-1, 94:4-10). When his cell mate was not present, Harvey would have to crawl to get to and from the toilet (Doc. 70-1, 96:20-23).
At some point, Harvey was moved to an ADA wheelchair accessible cell. When that happened, however, is unclear.2 The parties strongly disagree about who was responsible for determining whether Harvey needed placement in a wheelchair accessible cell. Defendant Coe argues it was the Assistant Warden who was responsible for cell assignments (Doc. 65, p. 10). Conversely, the Assistant Warden and ADA coordinator, Ann Tredway, testified that an inmate cannot be placed in an ADA cell without a doctor's order for an ADA accommodation (Doc. 68-5, 17:11-20, 28:21-29:13).
Harvey alleges that while he was at Lawrence medical staff did not follow the sickle [*5]  cell protocols he had experience throughout his lifetime (Doc. 70-1, 125:13-126:14). A few weeks after arriving at Lawrence, in the middle of June, Plaintiff endured a sickle cell crisis that required him to be transported to the hospital (See Doc. 68-2, 81:13-82:4). Defendant Coe saw Harvey immediately after he returned from the hospital and determined he did not need to be on any narcotic pain medication (Doc. 68-2, 81:13-82:4). Harvey had another crisis approximately three weeks later, on July 4, where he was completely immobilized on the floor of his cell for over an hour, before ultimately being taken to the Health Care Unit and then the emergency room (Doc. 70-9, p. 20).
Shortly before the second sickle cell crisis, on July 1, 2015, Dr. Zhang from the Department of Hematology/Oncology at Carle Cancer Center recommended Harvey be referred to Dr. John Cunningham of the University of Chicago to discuss a bone marrow transplant (Doc. 70-2, p. 9). Defendant Coe put in a request to get the referral to Dr. Cunningham approved (Doc. 70-2, p. 10), but it was denied because it was determined transplants are not covered by the IDOC-Wexford contract (Doc. 70-2, p. 11). Rather, Dr. Coe alleges [*6]  the IDOC Medical Director was responsible for approving bone marrow transplants (Doc. 68, p. 3).
Dr. Zhang also indicated in his report that Harvey would need surgery due to his avascular necrosis in approximately five to ten years. (Doc. 70-2, p. 5). Coe testified that Harvey's hips were doing well while he was at Lawrence and therefore there was no need to refer him to an orthopedist (Doc. 65-1, 56:22-57:9). Conversely, Harvey states his avascular necrosis got significantly worse while he was at Lawrence, resulting in daily difficulties (Doc. 68-3, 38:18-39:3).
It is undisputed that Harvey told Defendant Beth Tredway, the Assistant Warden and ADA Compliance Officer, he had been recommended for a hip replacement and bone marrow transplant but the referral for the transplant had been denied due to it not being covered under the contract. (Doc. 77, p. 5). It is also undisputed that Harvey filed an emergency grievance on August 1, 2015 regarding his need to see a bone marrow transplant specialist and orthopedist (Doc. 67, 25:12-26:7). Stephen Duncan's name is listed as the individual denying the emergency status of that grievance (Doc. 67-1, 27:3-7). Warden Duncan testified, however, that [*7]  his administrative assistant actually made the decision and simply signed on his behalf (Doc. 67-1, 27:9-29:15). He testified his assistant had authority to decide whether a grievance was an emergency without consulting him (Doc. 67-1, 27:9-29:15), although she would sometimes ask him questions about how to respond (Doc. 67-1, 29: 8-10). Duncan testified he could not remember whether he spoke with his administrative assistant regarding Harvey's grievance (Doc. 67-1, p. 360, 30:1-7).
Harvey further objects to Coe's refusal to treat his pain with narcotic medication. Coe testified that he took Harvey off all of his narcotic pain medication within three days of first seeing him (Doc. 68-2, 81:13-82:4). It is undisputed that Coe subsequently only prescribed non-narcotics to treat Harvey's sickle cell related pain, including Tylenol (Doc. 65, p. 12), despite Coe admitting that sickle cell episodes can be very painful (Doc. 68-2, 82:12-15). Coe argues that Harvey's pain was controllable by non-narcotics and that he didn't believe Harvey's statements about his level of pain, believing that he was simply seeking narcotics (Doc. 65-1, 74:22-75:14).
Conversely, Harvey presents evidence that before [*8]  he was incarcerated his treatment plan included narcotic pain medication during sickle cell episodes (Doc 68-3, 119:21-120:7). The Offender Health Status Transfer Summary indicates Harvey was being treated with Norco, a narcotic pain killer, at the time of his transfer to Lawrence (Doc. 68-1, p. 1). Further, after one of his emergency room visits for a sickle cell crisis while at Lawrence, his treating physician prescribed Norco to be taken every 4-6 hours, for pain (68-1, pp. 7-12).
Harvey's appealed several grievances regarding his medical treatment to the Administrative Review Board (Doc. 67-1, pp. 307-329), and sent a letter directly to Defendant Benton in her official capacity as Administrator of the ARB (Doc. 67-1, p. 325).

Preliminary Matters
Although discussed in more detail below, the Court starts by noting there are a substantial number of material facts with regard to the claims against Dr. Coe. In his motion for summary judgment, Coe lists twenty-two paragraphs worth of "undisputed" material facts; only six of which are admitted by Plaintiffs, with the rest being partially admitted to or outright denied (Doc. 65, pp. 2-5; Doc. 68, pp. 1-6). Similarly, Plaintiff list sixty-seven [*9]  paragraphs of "undisputed" facts, only seven of which were fully admitted by Coe with the rest being partially admitted or outright denied (Doc. 68, pp. 6-14; Doc. 72, pp. 1-23). The problem is further compounded by the fact that both parties accuse the other of mischaracterizing the record (Doc. 72, pp. 8, 14, 17, and 20; Doc. 68, pp. 2, 4, and 5). On that basis alone, the Court finds summary judgment in favor of Dr. Coe is improper. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court will review the specific claims and address some of the contested facts that make summary judgment in favor of Dr. Coe inappropriate.3

Conclusions of Law
Summary judgment is proper only if the moving party can demonstrate there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Ruffin-Thompkins v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc., 422 F.3d 603, 607 (7th Cir. 2005). Any doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue of fact must be resolved against the moving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 160, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Lawrence v. Kenosha Cnty., 391 F.3d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 2004).
A moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law where the non-moving party "has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden of proof." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A party asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed must [*10]  support that assertion by citing to particular materials in the record or by showing that the materials in the record do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. If the non-moving party does not show evidence exists that would reasonably allow a fact-finder to decide in their favor on a material issue, the court must enter summary judgment against them. Waldridge v. Am. Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir. 1994).
The Seventh Circuit has stated summary judgment is "the put up or shut up moment in a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events." Steen v. Myers, 486 F.3d 1017, 1022 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting Hammel v. Eau Galle Cheese Factory, 407 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2005)).

I. Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act (Count 1)
As a threshold issue, the Court must first decide whether Defendants Duncan, Martin and Tredway are amendable to suit under the ADA.4 The ADA claims are raised against these Defendants in their official capacities only. Defendants allege, however, that they are not subject to suit even in their official capacity (Doc. 67, p. 10). Defendants' briefing of this issue is wholly insufficient—encompassing a total of one paragraph and a single citation. The only case cited by Defendants is Jaros v. Illinois Department of Corrections, which they [*11]  contend stands for the proposition that employees of the IDOC are never subject to suit under the ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Doc. 67, p. 10, citing 684 F.3d 667, 670 (7th Cir. 2012)). The Court disagrees.
Official capacity suits are just another way of pleading an action against the government entity of which the official is an agent. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 160, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985). In United States v. Georgia, the Supreme Court held that a disabled inmate can sue a state for money damages under Title II of the ADA for "deliberate refusal of prison officials to accommodate [the inmate's] disability-related needs in such fundamentals as mobility, hygiene, medical care, and virtually all other prison programs." 546 U.S. 151, 157-59, 126 S. Ct. 877, 163 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2006). Thus, the holding in Jaros must be read in the context of the above referenced Supreme Court precedent, and can only be interpreted to bar ADA claims against IDOC employees in their individual capacity not their official capacity.5 Because Defendants Martin, Tredway and Duncan are all being sued in their official capacity, they are amenable to suit under the ADA.
Turning to the substantive issues, Title II of the ADA states "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from [*12]  participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits any agency that receives federal funds from excluding, subjecting to discrimination, or denying the benefits of any of their programs to otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Failure to make reasonable accommodations to ensure participation in the public entity's programs or services by a person with a disability qualifies as "discrimination." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Wis. Cmty. Servs. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 753 (7th Cir. 2006).
A plaintiff will make out a prima facie case of discrimination under both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act6 by showing they: (1) suffer from a disability as defined in the statutes, (2) are qualified to participate in the program in question, and (3) were either excluded from participating in or denied the benefit of that program based on a disability. Novak v. Bd. of Trustees of S. Ill. Univ., 777 F.3d 966, 974 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing Jackson v. City of Chicago, 414 F.3d 806, 810 (7th Cir. 2005)). Defendants make no argument suggesting Harvey is not qualified to participate in the programs at issue, thus that element in conceded for purposes of summary judgment.
A. Qualifying Disability
The United States Code defines "disability" to include "a physical or [*13]  mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual. 42 U.S.C. §12102(1)(A). Major life activities include, among other things, operation of a major bodily function. 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(B). Included in the Code is a non-exhaustive list of examples of bodily functions, such as functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(B). Here, it is uncontested Harvey suffers from sickle cell anemia (Doc. 70, p. 15; Doc. 77, p. 1), a condition where there are not enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body. Sickle Cell Anemia, Diseases and Conditions, The Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355 876 (last visited June 20, 2018). Thus, he suffers from a disease of the circulatory systems that qualifies as a major life activity. Further, because it is also uncontested that Harvey needed the use of a wheelchair or cane (Doc. 67, p. 11), and therefore had difficulty ambulating, he would also qualify under 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A) which recognizes walking as a major life activity.
B. Exclusion From or Denial of the [*14]  Benefit Based on Disability
Defendants must provide "meaningful access" to program that persons with disabilities are otherwise entitled to access." Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S. Ct. 712, 83 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1985). The Seventh Circuit has held the inability of a disabled inmate to access prison services on the same basis as non-disabled inmates means the prison had failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. 684 F.3d 667, 672 (7th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added). Failure to make reasonable accommodations to ensure participation in the public entity's programs or services by a person with a disability qualifies as exclusion from or denial of a program of services. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Wis. Cmty. Servs. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 753 (7th Cir. 2006).
Defendants claim they had no way of knowing Harvey needed an ADA accessible cell and no affirmative duty to determine whether he needed such an accommodation until Harvey brought it to their attention (Doc. 67, pp. 11-12). To begin with, the Court does not see how individual knowledge is relevant to an official capacity claim. As stated infra, official capacity suits are just another way of pleading an action against the government entity of which the official is an agent. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 160, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985). As a result, Defendants' argument that their lack of individual knowledge shields them from liability under the ADA is misplaced.
As to the question [*15]  of institutional knowledge, Defendants provide no authority for the contention that an obviously disabled inmate must put administrators on notice of his need to be accommodated in order to trigger the ADA. The only case law the Court could find on the issue holds quite the opposite. Pierce v. District of Columbia, 146 F.Supp.3d 197, 201 (D.D.C. November 25, 2015) (rejecting Defendants' claim they have no duty under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act to evaluate the needs of an obviously disabled inmate); Chase v. Baskerville, 508 F.Supp.2d 492, 504 (E.D.VA August 2, 2007)(Title II imposes an affirmative accommodation obligation in the administration of state prisons).
Here, the evidence shows that within the first three months Harvey was a Lawrence, he was issued a wheelchair (67-1, 54:17-21), was left prostrate on the floor of his cell for at least an hour, and had two emergency room visits for sickle cell crisis (Doc. 68-2, 81:13-82:4; Doc. 70-9, p. 20). Thus, evidence exists upon which a jury could find the prison had institutional knowledge of Harvey's disability, use of a wheelchair for mobility, and therefore his need for an accessible cell. Further, it is uncontested that the policy or practice at Lawrence was for the ADA coordinator to wait until she received a request for an ADA accommodation before acting (67-4, p. 219, 28:6-18). [*16]  As a result, a jury could find the institution's policy or practice of waiting for either a complaint or request before assessing an inmate's needs for ADA accommodations, resulted in Harvey being denied necessary accommodations for his disability.
Defendants further argue they are entitled to summary judgment because there is no evidence Harvey was denied any services of the prison (Doc. 67, p. 12). Defendants cite to Wagoner v. Lemon, where an inmate's long waits and humiliation, including crawling off a van that could not accommodate his wheelchair, did not amount to a denial of service. 778 F.3d 586, 593 (7th Cir. 2015). However, in Waggoner, much of the decision was based on how the claims were framed. The only claims in the case related to ongoing problems with repairing the plaintiff's wheelchair and his transportation in a vehicle not equipped for wheelchairs. Id. at 589. The Court in Wagoner specifically stated the claims were not about denial of access to a service or program. Id. The Court opined, however, that Wagoner could have claimed the wheelchair itself was a service under the act because it was necessary to accommodate his paraplegia. Id.
Here, Harvey testified that prior to placement in an ADA cell, his cell-mate [*17]  was responsible for carrying him around the cell, including to the restroom and into or out of the cell in emergencies (70-1, 94:4-10). When his cell mate was not present, Harvey would have to crawl to get to and from the toilet. (Doc. 70-1, 96:20-23). Defendant argue these facts are similar to Waggoner and while Harvey may have been inconvenienced or even humiliated by not having a wheelchair in his cell, and having to crawl or be carried to the toilet, such deprivations do not qualify as a denial of services (Doc. 67, p. 12). Unlike in Waggoner, however, Harvey is not simply arguing that he was humiliated or inconvenienced. Rather, he argues that he was literally unable to access parts of his cell, such as the toilet, or leave his cell because of the unavailability of his wheelchair; a claim the Court suggested in Waggoner would qualify as denial of a service.
Because there is evidence the prison's failure to provide Harvey with a wheelchair accessible cell meant he was unable to access the facilities within his cell on the same basis as non-disabled inmates, summary judgment is inappropriate.

II. Eighth Amendment Deliberate Indifference—Conditions of Confinement (Count 1)
Inmates are entitled to "humane [*18]  conditions of confinement. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994) (quotations marks and citations omitted). The Supreme Court has held that prison officials must ensure that inmates receive "adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates." Id. Conditions that do not fall below the contemporary standards of decency, however, are not unconstitutional. Caldwell v. Miller, 790 F.2d 589, 600 (7th Cir. 1986). Restrictive, or even harsh conditions, are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society. Id. Thus, the Eighth Amendment is only violated when:
(1) there is a deprivation that is, from an objective standpoint, sufficiently serious that it results in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities, and
(2) where prison officials are deliberately indifferent to this state of affairs.
Gray v. Hardy, 826 F.3d 1000, 1005 (7th Cir. 2016).
As to the deprivation prong,7 Harvey must show that conditions, individually or in combination, deprived him of an identifiable human need." Budd v. Motley, 711 F.3d 840, 842-43 (7th Cir. 2013). Thus, the question is whether placing Harvey in a cell that was not wheelchair accessible denied him one of life's necessities. The Seventh Circuit has held that sanitation and utilities qualify as identifiable human needs. Johnson v. Pelker, 891 F.2d 136, 139 (7th Cir. 1989); Jaros v. Ill. Dep't of Corr., 684 F.3d 667, 670 (7th Cir. 2012). As discussed  [*19] infra, there is evidence that the failure to provide a wheelchair accessible cell denied Harvey access to the toilet. Defendants cite to Jaros v. Illinois Department of Corrections, claiming that Harvey did not suffer a "total" deprivation and therefore there is no deliberate indifference (Doc. 67, p. 13).
In Jaros, the plaintiff complained he was only able to shower approximately once a week, and that although he could use the toilets and showers, he wanted an accommodation of grab bars to make access easier. Jaros v. Illinois Department of Corrections, 684 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir. 2012). The Court found that because Jaros only argued his access was more difficult due to the absence of grab bars, he was not actually denied access to the facilities. Id. The Court specifically focused on the fact that Jaros testified the existence of grab bars would not have made any difference to his access, because he still would experience the same level of pain. Id.
Unlike Jaros, where the plaintiff was able to access the toilet and showers even without the grab bars, here Harvey testified the toilet was literally unavailable to him unless he was carried by his cell mate or crawled across the floor of his cell (70-1, 94:4-10).8 Unlike in Jaros, therefore, the failure to accommodate [*20]  Harvey actually prevented him from accessing the toilet or being able to exit his cell. Thus, there is sufficient evidence of upon which a jury could find the Defendants' failure to accommodate Harvey by ensuring he had access to a wheelchair in his cell, denied him one of life's necessities.
The second, element requires a plaintiff show the Defendant knew about the condition and could have prevented it but did not. Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 649 (7th Cir. 2009). Defendants' arguments primarily focus on the second part of this element—ability to prevent. They all argue they could not be deliberately indifferent because they were not responsible for placement of Harvey into a wheelchair accessible cell. Coe argues it was the Assistant Warden who was responsible for cell assignments (Doc. 65, p. 10). Ann Tredway, the Assistant Warden and ADA coordinator, testified that a doctor must write an order for an ADA accommodation (Doc. 68-5, 17:11-20, 28:21-29:13) and therefore the IDOC Defendants could not prevent the deprivation (Doc. 67, p. 12). That the Defendants cannot agree about who was responsible for placement of Harvey into a wheelchair accessible cell means there is a material issue of fact as to who could have prevented the [*21]  alleged Constitutional deprivation. Thus, summary judgment is improper.

III. Eighth Amendment Deliberate Indifference—Serious Medical Need (Count 2)
The Supreme Court has recognized that deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners may constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976). In order to prevail on a claim for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, however, there are "two high hurdles, which every inmate-plaintiff must clear." Dunigan ex rel. Nyman v. Winnebago Cnty., 165 F.3d 587, 590 (7th Cir. 1999). First, the plaintiff must demonstrate he suffered from an objectively serious medical condition. Id. at 591-92. Here, Defendants have raised no argument that Harvey's sickle cell anemia does not qualify as a serious medical condition. That element is therefore conceded for purposes of summary judgment.
The second element a plaintiff must establish is that the individual prison officials were deliberately indifferent to that medical condition. Id. Proving deliberate indifference is difficult because prison medical professionals are entitled to deference unless no minimally competent professional would have responded similarly under the same circumstances. Pyles v. Fahim, 771 F.3d 403, 409 (7th Cir. 2014). Accordingly, a plaintiff must show more than simple medical malpractice. Whiting v. Wexford Health Sources, Inc., 839 F.3d 658, 662 (7th Cir. 2016).
Disagreement between [*22]  a prisoner and his doctor, or even between two medical professionals, about the proper course of treatment is generally insufficient, by itself, to establish deliberate indifference. Greeno v. Daley, 414 F.3d 645, 653 (7th Cir. 2005). In other words, federal courts will not interfere with a doctor's decision to pursue a particular course of treatment unless that decision represents so significant a departure from accepted professional standards or practices that it calls into question whether the doctor was actually exercising professional judgment. Pyles, 771 F.3d at 409.
However, choosing an easier and less efficacious treatment rather than exercising professional judgment, can also constitute deliberate indifference. Petties v. Carter, 836 F.3d 722, 730 (7th Cir. 2016). Medical personnel cannot simply resort to an easier course of treatment that they know is ineffective. Id.

A. Defendant Coe (Doc. 64)
Dr. Coe alleges entitlement to summary judgment on two of the four claims against him in Count 2 (Doc. 64, p. 1). For the reasons set out below, it is RECOMMENDED summary judgment be DENIED on both counts.

Bone Marrow Transplant and Hip Replacement—Count 2(b)
Dr. Coe argues he is entitled to summary judgment on Count 2(a) which alleges deliberate indifference based on a rejection of the recommendation from Dr. [*23]  Zhang regarding a bone marrow transplant and hip replacement (Doc. 65, pp. 1-2). In short, Coe's argument is that Dr. Zhang merely recommended Harvey be referred to a specialist to "discuss" a bone marrow transplant, not to have one (Doc. 65, pp. 10-11). Thus, because there is no evidence Harvey actually needed a bone marrow transplant, he could not have been deliberately indifferent for failing to refer him to the specialist (Doc. 65, p. 11). The Court is not convinced by Coe's verbal gymnastics. Coe's own documentation states Dr. Zhan "recommended referral for 'consideration' bone marrow transplant" (Doc. 68-1, p. 11). On its face, a jury could reasonably infer the recommendation to "discuss" or "consider" a bone marrow transplant was made because Dr. Zhang believed Harvey likely needed one.
Coe next argues he could not be deliberately indifferent because he attempted to make a referral to the specialist, by submitting it for collegial review to Wexford (Doc. 65, p. 11). He alleges, however, that because bone marrow treatment is not covered in the Wexford-IDOC contract the referral could not be approved (Doc. 70-2, p. 11). Rather, Coe claims the IDOC Agency Medical Director was responsible [*24]  for approving bone marrow transplants (Doc. 68, p. 3). There is a dearth of evidence presented by Coe as to how the need for such a transplant is supposed to be conveyed from medical providers such as him, to the IDOC Medical Director. Further, whether Coe took the necessary steps to ensure the IDOC had the opportunity to assess a bone marrow transplant for Harvey is highly contested (Doc. 68, p. 3). The decision to continue the current treatment based on financial reasons rather than Dr. Coe's medical opinion, is evidence upon which a jury could find deliberate indifference.
Finally, Coe argues that he was not deliberately indifferent when he failed to make a referral to an orthopedist to assess Harvey's need for a hip replacement as recommended by Dr. Zhang (Doc. 65, p. 12). The Court is not convinced Dr. Zhang's July 2015 report alone is a sufficient basis to find deliberate indifference given Dr. Zhang's statement that such a procedure would likely be necessary in five to ten years (Doc. 65-2, pp. 8-12; Doc. 70-2, p. 5). Whether the failure to independently refer Harvey to the orthopedist supports a finding of deliberate indifference, however, is a remaining issue of fact. Coe argues [*25]  Harvey's hips were doing well while he was at Lawrence and therefore there was no need to independently refer him to an orthopedist to address his avascular necrosis (Doc. 65, p. 12). Conversely, Harvey states his avascular necrosis got significantly worse while he was at Lawrence, resulting in increased immobility (Doc. 69, p. 7). Coe has admitted that subsequent to Dr. Zhang's report, he ordered a medical permit for a quad cane, a wheelchair cushion, wheelchair pusher, and air mattress for Harvey (Doc. 72, p. 16). Since being transferred to Dixon, Harvey states he has been recommended for hip injections and a hip replacement (Doc. 69, p. 7). Given the evidence of avascular necrosis of Harvey's femur head since 2008, combined with evidence of a decline in Harvey's mobility, a jury could find Coe's failure to independently refer Harvey for an orthopedic evaluation for hip replacement constitutes deliberate indifference.
Because material issues of fact remain with regard to Count 2(a), summary judgment is improper.

Denial of Effective Pain Medication—Count 2(c)
Dr. Coe also argues he is entitled to summary judgment on Count 2(c) which alleges he was deliberately indifferent to Harvey's [*26]  serious medical condition when he denied him effective pain medication by prescribing only Tylenol (Doc. 65, pp. 1-2). It is undisputed that Coe prescribed only Tylenol on September 3, 2015 (Doc. 65, p. 12). Coe argues that Harvey's pain was controllable by non-narcotics and he didn't believe Harvey's statements about his level of pain, believing that he was simply seeking narcotics (Doc. 65-1, 74:22-75:14).
Conversely, Harvey presents evidence that he in fact needed narcotic pain medication. Specifically, before he was incarcerated his treatment plan included narcotic pain medication during sickle cell episodes (Doc 68-3, 119:21-120:7). Harvey's Offender Health Status Transfer Summary indicates he was being treated with Norco, a narcotic pain killer, at the time of his transfer to Lawrence (Doc. 68-1, p. 1). Further, after one of sickle cell crisis at Lawrence, the Emergency Room physician treating Harvey prescribed Norco to be taken every 4-6 hours, for pain (68-1, pp. 7-12). Coe admitted in deposition that sickle cell episodes can be very painful (Doc. 68-2, 82:12-15). Thus, there is evidence upon which a jury could conclude that Coe's refusal to prescribe a narcotic pain killer [*27]  on September 3, 2015, was such a significant a departure from accepted professional standards or practices that it calls into question whether he was actually exercising professional judgment. Pyles, 771 F.3d at 409. As such, summary judgment is inappropriate.

B. Defendants Benton, Duncan and Tredway (Doc. 66)
In § 1983 claims an official is not liable simply because they are a supervisor. Shields v. Illinois Department of Corrections, 746 F.3d 782, 797 (7th Cir. 2014). Rather, in order to be deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need, non-treating officials must "know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health" by being "'aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists'" and "'draw[ing] the inference.'" Greeno, 414 F.3d at 653 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)). A prisoner's correspondence to a prison supervisor may "establish a basis for personal liability under § 1983 where that correspondence provides sufficient knowledge of a constitutional deprivation." Perez v. Fenoglio, 792 F.3d 768, 781-82 (7th Cir. 2015).

Sherry Benton—Counts 2(a) & 2(h)
The Seventh Circuit has rejected the idea that liability extends to every prison official who is aware of an inmate's complaints. Burks v. Raemisch, 555 F.3d 592, 595 (7th Cir. 2009). Something more than simple administrative review by the prison official is required to prove deliberate indifference. Burks, 555 F.3d at 595. The Court notes the examples of deliberate [*28]  indifference discussed by the Seventh Circuit in Burks all involve affirmative actions that interfere with the prisoner's ability to obtain medical care. Id. (examples of a complaint examiner shredding grievances without review or intervening to prevent delivery of medical care).
Here, the only basis for Benton's alleged liability are Harvey's appeals to the ARB regarding his medical treatment (Doc. 67-1, pp. 307-329), and a letter Harvey sent Benton in her official capacity as the Administrator of the ARB (Doc. 67-1, p. 325). The rejection of the grievances, whether on procedural or substantive grounds, would have been in the context of Benton's obligation to provide administrative review of the grievance process and cannot qualify as deliberate indifference. The only additional behavior Harvey alleges is that Benton failed to refer Harvey's grievances or letter to the IDOC medical director (Doc. 70, p. 19). While Benton testified that she sometimes would make such referrals (Doc. 70-8, 45:10-13), there is no evidence that she was required to do so or regularly did so. Further, unlike the examples provided by the Seventh Circuit in Burks, the behavior Harvey cites did not actually [*29]  interfere with Harvey's ability to obtain medical services—rather, his argument is that she should have done more to ensure them. As such, there is no behavior on the part of Benton that a jury could find evidenced deliberate indifference. It is therefore RECOMMENDED the Court GRANT Benton's motion for summary judgment.

Stephen Duncan—Count 2(h)
Defendant Duncan claims he cannot be liable for any deliberate indifference because he did not "know" of any problems with Harvey's medical treatment (Doc. p. 16). It is undisputed that Harvey filed an emergency grievance on August 1, 2015 regarding his need to see a bone marrow transplant specialist and orthopedist (Doc. 67, 25:12-26:7). It is also undisputed that Stephen Duncan's name is listed as denying the emergency status of that grievance (Doc. 67-1, 27:3-7). Duncan testified, however, that his administrative assistant signed on his behalf and that she had authority to decide whether a grievance was an emergency without consulting him (Doc. 67-1, 27:9-29:15).
Section 504.840 of the Illinois Administrative Code specifically identifies the Chief Administrative Officer as the individual responsible for determining whether a grievance shall be handled on [*30]  an emergency basis. 20 Ill. Adm. Code § 504.840. No other individual may routinely perform duties relating to emergency grievances, except that the CAO may designate someone to perform those duties during emergencies or periods of his or her temporary absence. 20 Ill. Adm. Code § 504.805.
Duncan presented no evidence to show there was an emergency or he was temporarily absent at the time Harvey filed his emergency grievance. Even assuming the decision regarding Harvey's complaint was properly delegated to Duncan's administrative assistant, Duncan testified his assistant would sometimes ask him questions about how to respond to an emergency grievance if she was unsure (Doc. 67-1, 29: 8-10) and he could not remember whether he spoke with his administrative assistant regarding Harvey's grievance (Doc. 67-1, p. 360, 30:1-7). Being unable to remember is not the same as having no knowledge. Thus, the Court cannot say it is impossible for a jury to conclude Duncan had knowledge of Harvey's grievance.
Counsel for Duncan additionally argues he reasonably relied on the judgment of medical professionals and therefore cannot be liable (Doc. 67, p. 19). The Court finds Duncan's claim he relied medical professionals' opinions to decide a grievance he [*31]  cannot remember reviewing, speculative at best. Further, it is unclear what medical judgment he claims to be relying on since the decision not send Harvey for a bone marrow transplant was admittedly made based on contractual or financial reasons (Doc. 70-2, p. 11), not medical judgment.

Count 2(h) — Beth Tredway
Defendant Tredway's argument is difficult to discern. She claims she "cannot be subjectively aware of Plaintiff's allegedly serious health need only because he wrote in a grievance that he was in pain and had difficulties, but was not scheduled for surgery or more extensive care by the doctors then treating him..." (Doc. 67, p. 17). In fact, being made aware through written correspondence that an inmate is in pain and not getting the proper treatment, is exactly the type of evidence upon which a jury could find an administrator had knowledge. Perez v. Fenoglio, 792 F.3d 768, 781-82 (7th Cir. 2015) (prisoner's correspondence to a supervisor can establish liability where the correspondence provides sufficient knowledge of a constitutional deprivation). Further, it is undisputed Harvey told Tredway in person he had been recommended for a hip replacement and bone marrow transplant but collegial had denied the transplant due to it not [*32]  being covered under the IDOC-Wexford contract (Doc. 77, p. 5). Thus, Tredway had knowledge of the possible constitutional deprivation.
As to whether Tredway disregard an excessive risk to Harvey's health, her argument appears to be that she did not have authority to overrule the treatment decisions of the doctors (Doc. 67, p. 17) and therefore it was her practice to simply forward all medical grievances to Wexford employees (Doc. 67, p. 17). As discussed above, the Court does not see how denying a medical procedure based on a contract provision qualifies as a "treatment decision." Further, Tredway's practice of simply forwarding all medical grievances is particularly troubling in this situation, where Harvey told her Wexford employees who were ignoring his medical needs based solely on financial and contractual reasons—reasons that implicated the IDOC as potentially responsible for his medical care. Turning a blind eye to the strong likelihood that a policy or practice is "likely [to] result in a violation of a federally protective right" is evidence of deliberate indifference. Phipps v. Sheriff of Cook County, 681 F. Supp. 2d 899, 918 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (citing Powers v. MJB Acquisition Corp., 184 F.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999); Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001). A jury could certainly conclude that because Tredway was aware Dr. Coe had already denied Harvey [*33]  a referral based on the IDOC-Wexford contract, and was likely to continue to do so regardless of his actual medical needs, that her response of simply forwarding his complaint to Wexford employees without determining whether the IDOC had any responsibility for Harvey's treatment, was deliberate indifference.

III. Qualified Immunity
Finally, Defendants argue they are entitled to qualified immunity (Doc. 67, pp. 21-23). Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages as long as their "conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009). To determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, the Court must consider two questions. First, do the facts alleged by the plaintiff state a violation of a constitutional right? Pearson, 555 U.S. at 232; Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001). As discussed above, Harvey has alleged facts sufficient to state a violation of the ADA and the Eighth Amendment. Thus, the first element is met.
The second question is whether the violated right was clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct. Id. In determining whether a right is clearly established, the relevant question is whether it would be clear [*34]  to a reasonable individual the conduct was unlawful in the situation. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202. As discussed above, the Seventh Circuit has held the inability of a disabled inmate to access prison services on the same basis as non-disabled inmates means the prison had failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. 684 F.3d 667, 672 (7th Cir. 2012). Thus, it should have been clear to the IDOC defendants that failing to provide Harvey with a cell in which he could use his wheelchair to access the toilet was a violation of the ADA.
As to the Eighth Amendment claims, it is clearly established that a non-treating officials can be liable for deliberate indifference where the official knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to an inmate's health. Greeno, 414 F.3d at 653 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994)). Further, an inmate's correspondence to a prison supervisor may "establish a basis for personal liability under § 1983 where that correspondence provides sufficient knowledge of a constitutional deprivation." Perez v. Fenoglio, 792 F.3d 768, 781-82 (7th Cir. 2015). Thus, Defendants Duncan and Tredway should have been aware that ignoring verbal and written grievances by Harvey regarding the denial of necessary medical care could violate the Eighth Amendment. As such, Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.
