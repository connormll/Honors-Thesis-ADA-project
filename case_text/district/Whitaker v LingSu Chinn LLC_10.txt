CIVIL MINUTES -- GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (IN CHAMBERS): ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [filed 11/9/2020; Docket No. 22];

ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT LING-SU CHINN, LLC'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION [filed 11/9/2020; Docket No. 24]
On November 9, 2020, Plaintiff Brian Whitaker ("Plaintiff") filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On November 16, 2020, Defendant Ling-Su Chinn, LLC ("Defendant") filed its Opposition. On November 23, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Reply.
On November 9, 2020, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication. On November 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed his Opposition. On November 23, 2020, Defendant filed [*2]  a Reply.
Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the Court found the matter appropriate for submission on the papers without oral argument. The matter was, therefore, removed from the Court's December 7, 2020 hearing calendar and the parties were given advance notice. After considering the moving, opposing, and reply papers, and the arguments therein, the Court rules as follows:

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff suffers from a C-4 spinal cord injury which substantially limits his ability to walk on his own. He uses a wheelchair for mobility.
On September 6, 2019, Plaintiff visited Planet Blue (the "Store"),2 located at 409 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, California, to shop as well as to investigate the Store for compliance with access laws. The Store has two dual-tiered transaction counters. The higher portions of the transaction counters were approximately 46 inches high. The lowered portions of the transaction counters were 36 inches long minimum and 34 inches high maximum above the floor. On the date of Plaintiff's visit, however, the lowered portions of the counters were being used to display merchandise, which took up most of the counter space. Because there was no usable lowered counter available [*3]  and because the thought of attempting to handle his transaction on a higher counter or a crowded lowered counter caused him difficulty and discomfort, Plaintiff left the Store without completing his purchases.
When Plaintiff's investigator visited the Store on September 18, 2019, the lowered portions of the counter were still being used to display merchandise, including a large rack of sunglasses and various accessories, leaving virtually no useable lowered counter space.
On September 23, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant alleging the following claims for relief: (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.; and (2) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51-53,
Likely as a result of this lawsuit, Defendant has now removed the merchandise and display items from the lowered transaction counters, and has promised to ensure that the lowered transaction counters remain free of any items. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper where "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the [*4]  burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Once the moving party meets its burden, a party opposing a properly made and supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere denials but must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 250; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e); see also Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989) ("A summary judgment motion cannot be defeated by relying solely on conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data."). In particular, when the non-moving party bears the burden of proving an element essential to its case, that party must make a showing sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the existence of that element or be subject to summary judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "An issue of fact is not enough to defeat summary judgment; there must be a genuine issue of material fact, a dispute capable of affecting the outcome of the case." American International Group, Inc. v. American International Bank, 926 F.2d 829, 833 (9th Cir. 1991) (Kozinski, dissenting).
An issue is genuine if evidence is produced that would allow a rational trier of fact to reach a verdict in favor of the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. "This requires evidence, not speculation." Meade v. Cedarapids, Inc., 164 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 1999). The Court must assume the truth of direct evidence set forth by the opposing party. See Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 507 (9th Cir. 1992). However, where circumstantial [*5]  evidence is presented, the Court may consider the plausibility and reasonableness of inferences arising therefrom. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50; TW Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631-32 (9th Cir. 1987). Although the party opposing summary judgment is entitled to the benefit of all reasonable inferences, "inferences cannot be drawn from thin air; they must be based on evidence which, if believed, would be sufficient to support a judgment for the nonmoving party." American International Group, 926 F.2d at 836-37. In that regard, "a mere 'scintilla' of evidence will not be sufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment; rather, the nonmoving party must introduce some 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.'" Summers v. Teichert & Son, Inc., 127 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir. 1997).

III. DISCUSSION
For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that Defendant violated the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act by failing to maintain the usability and accessibility of its lowered transaction counters.

A. Defendant's Failure to Maintain the Accessibility of the Lowered Counter Violated the ADA.
Title III of the ADA provides in relevant part: "No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of a disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of [*6]  public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). "The general anti-discrimination prohibitions of Title III . . . are supplemented by various, specific prohibitions, including requirements that entities providing public accommodations must (1) make 'reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary' to provide persons with disabilities full and equal enjoyment, id. §12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); (2) 'remove architectural barriers . . . in existing facilities . . . where such removal is readily achievable.' id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); and (3) 'design and construct facilities . . . that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,' id., § 12183(a)(1)." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 779 F.3d 1001, 1005-1006 (9th Cir. 2015).
In order to establish a prima facie case for discrimination under Title III of the ADA, the plaintiff must show that (1) he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the defendant denied public accommodations to the plaintiff because of his or her disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a); Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir. 2007); Vogel v. Winchell's Donut Houses Operating Co., LP, 252 F. Supp. 3d 977, 983 (C.D. Cal. 2017). It is undisputed that Plaintiff is disabled within the [*7]  meaning of the ADA and that Defendant is a private entity that operates a place of public accommodation. Accordingly, the only issue presented is whether Defendant denied public accommodations to Plaintiff because of his disability. "The third element -- whether [a plaintiff] is denied public accommodations on the basis of disability -- is met if there was a violation of applicable accessibility standards." Johnson v. Starbucks Corp., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126514, 2020 WL 4042965, at *2 (E.D. Cal. July 17, 2020) (quotations and citations omitted).
The parties agree that the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (the "2010 Standards") govern the transaction counters at issue in this case. Section 227.3 of the 2010 Standards provides, in relevant part:
227.3 Counters. Where provided, at least one of each type of sales counter and service counter shall comply with 904.4. Where counters are dispersed throughout the building or facility, counters complying with 904.4 also shall be dispersed.
2010 Standards, § 227.3. Section 904.4 provides, in relevant part:
904.4 Sales and Service Counters. Sales counters and service counters shall comply with 904.4.1 or 904.4.2. The accessible portion of the counter top shall extend the same depth as the sales or service counter top.
2010 Standards, § 904.4 (emphasis in original).
Section 904.4.1 specifies the requirements [*8]  for counters when wheelchair users have a parallel approach to the counter, and Section 904.4.2 specifies the requirements for counters when wheelchair users have a forward approach. In this case, Section 904.4.1 governs because there is a parallel approach to the transaction counters in the Store. Section 904.4.1 states, in its entirety:
904.4.1 Parallel Approach. A portion of the counter surface that is 36 inches (915 mm) long minimum and 36 inches (915 mm) high maximum above the finish floor shall be provided. A clear floor or ground space complying with 305 shall be positioned for a parallel approach adjacent to the 36 inch (915 mm) minimum length of counter.
EXCEPTION: Where the provided counter surface is less than 36 inches (915 mm) long, the entire counter surface shall be 36 inches (915 mm) high maximum above the finish floor.
2010 Standards, § 904.4.1. In this case, the exception to Section 904.4.1 does not apply because there were portions of the counter surface that were more than 36 inches above the floor. As such, the lowered portion of at least one of the counters was required to be at least 36 inches long. As built, the counters complied with Section 904.4.1., i.e., the lowered portion of the counters were at least 36 inches long.
However, because Defendant [*9]  covered almost the entirety of those lowered counters with merchandise and displays, Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a). 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a) provides in relevant part: "A public accommodation shall maintain in operable working condition those features of facilities and equipment that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities by the Act or this part." 28 C.F.R. §36.211(a) (emphasis added). The Court agrees with Plaintiff and concludes that Defendant violated 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a) by failing to maintain its lowered counters so that they were readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. As Judge Fischer of the Central District of California stated:
[T]the only reasonable interpretation of § 904.4, when read with the rest of the Standards and with 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a), is that the surface of an accessible sales or service counter must be kept mostly or entirely clear so that it can be effectively used by people with disabilities, not simply constructed properly and then covered with whatever the business sees fit to store there. In other words, it must actually be "accessible."
Whitaker v. ELC Beauty LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 226857, 2019 WL 7877347, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2019). She persuasively reasoned:
No one thinks that a business can park a dumpster in its disabled parking van access aisle or store supplies [*10]  in the accessible bathroom stall and be in compliance with the ADA as long as the access aisle and the stall are constructed to the Standards. This is because the various things in the Standards, including the sales and service counters of § 904.4., must be provided to people with disabilities.
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 226857, [WL] at *3.
The three unpublished Ninth Circuit cases cited by Defendant are inapposite. See Johnson v. Starbucks Corp., 818 Fed. App'x 657, 659 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020); Kong v. Mana Investment Co., LLC, 818 Fed. App'x 660, 662 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020); Lindsay v. Starbucks Corp., 815 Fed. App'x 152, 155 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020). Those cases concerned counters that were at a uniform accessible height of 36 inches or lower, not dual height or two-tiered counters like the counters at issue here. In those cases, where the counters were at a uniformly accessible height of 36 inches or lower, the Ninth Circuit reasoned:
The exception to Section 904.4.1 . . . clearly contemplates counters that are less than 36 inches long when, as here, the counter is at an entirely accessible height of 36 inches or lower. Because there are circumstances under which a counter built to be less than 36 inches long complies with Section 904.4.1, we hold that [the defendant] does not violate Section 904.4.1 by failing to provide 36 inches of usable counter space for disabled customers.
Johnson v. Starbucks Corp., 818 Fed. App'x 657, 659 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020); Kong v. Mana Investment Co.u, LLC, 818 Fed. App'x 660, 662 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020); Lindsay v. Starbucks Corp., 815 Fed. App'x 152, 155 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020). The Ninth Circuit then concluded that, because the exception to Section 904.4.1 expressly contemplates counters that are built to be less [*11]  than 36 inches long, "we do not read § 36.211(a) to require [the defendant] to 'maintain' 36 inches of usable counter space. This is not a case in which defendants have failed to maintain an accessible feature clearly required by the ADA. In sum, the maintenance requirements cannot be more stringent than the building requirements." Johnson, 818 Fed. App'x at 659-660; Kong, 818 Fed App'x at 662-663; Lindsay, 815 Fed. App'x at 154 (internal citations omitted).
In contrast, in this case, Section 904.4.1 clearly requires Defendant's lowered counters to be 36 inches long. Accordingly, the Court concludes that 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a) requires Defendant to maintain those 36-inch-long counters in a way that makes them usable for customers with disabilities.3 See Kalani v. Starbucks Coffee Co., 698 Fed. Appx. 883, 886 (9th Cir. June 28, 2017) (concluding that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on plaintiff's claim that the defendant failed to maintain a readily accessible thirty-six-inch long point of sale counter at the Store, as required under the ADA). Instead, Defendant almost entirely covered the transaction counter with display racks and merchandise, leaving virtually no counter space for wheelchair users and thus depriving wheelchair users of "full and equal access" to the use of the counters for their intended use -- placing items for purchase and transacting sales. [*12]  Cf. Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 779 F.3d 1001, 1009 (9th Cir. 2015) (concluding that the presence of various small items, i.e., a display of books in a basket, three coffee cups, and a movable store telephone on the otherwise accessible counter did not deprive wheelchair users of "full and equal access" to the use of the counters for their intended use when evidence showed that the items on the counter did not interfere with customers placing or purchasing merchandise.).
To the extent Defendant argues that the display or merchandise items were "isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or repairs" under 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(b), the Court rejects that argument. Plaintiff's undisputed evidence establishes that the items placed on the Store's sales counters, undoubtedly by Defendant's staff, were not "isolated or temporary interruptions," but rather were reoccurring barriers to access by customers in wheelchairs. Indeed, when Plaintiff's investigator visited the store almost two weeks later, the lowered counters continued to be obstructed by merchandise and display items. Moreover, Defendant fails to present any contrary evidence demonstrating that the merchandise and display items placed on the lowered counters were isolated [*13]  or temporary interruptions (other than that Defendant now has, likely as a result of this lawsuit, cleared the lower portion of its counters of merchandise and display items). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the display of merchandise and other items was not "isolated" or "temporary" within the meaning of 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(b). See Kalani, 698 Fed. Appx. at 886 (finding that the plaintiff's evidence established that the items placed on the point of sale counter were not "isolated or temporary interruptions," but rather "reoccurring barriers to access by patrons in wheelchairs."); Chapman, 779 F.3d at 1009 (concluding that the barriers the plaintiff repeatedly encountered in the Store's aisles were not "temporary" when the plaintiff encountered the barriers on eleven visits and at least some of the obstructions appear to have resulted from the affirmative actions of the defendant's employees); cf. id. at 1010 (finding that the clutter on the accessible sales counter caused only a temporary or isolated interruption in access, stating in relevant part that "unlike the shopping aisles, which were non-ADA-compliant for wheelchair users on all eleven visits Chapman made to the Store in 2011 and 2012, there were items on the sales counter on only two or three visits"). [*14] 
Finally, the Court rejects Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's ADA claim is moot because it has now removed the merchandise and display items from the lowered portions of its transaction counters and has promised to "ensure" that the lowered transaction counters remain clear and unobstructed. "[T]he test for mootness . . . is a stringent one. Mere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case; if it did, the courts would be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways." United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203-04, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968). A defendant's voluntary compliance only moots a request for prospective relief where the defendant meets the "formidable burden" or demonstrating that it is "absolutely clear the alleged wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000). "Such a burden will typically be met only by changes that are permanent in nature and that foreclose a reasonable chance of recurrence of the challenged conduct." Tandy v. City of Wichita, 380 F.3d 1277, 1291 (10th Cir. 2004). Given that merchandise and display items could easily be moved back to the lowered counters, the Court concludes that Defendant has not met this formidable burden.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes, based on the undisputed facts, that Defendant violated [*15]  the ADA by failing to maintain the usability or accessibility of its lowered counters for wheelchair users.

B. Defendant violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act.4
Under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ("UCRA"), a violation of the ADA also constitutes a violation of UCRA. See Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f) ("A violation of the right of any individual under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ... shall also constitute a violation of this section."). In order to recover damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he suffered difficulty, discomfort, or embarrassment as a result of his encounter with a barrier. Id. § 55.56.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to damages under the UCRA because he was not denied access and never encountered a barrier that caused him difficulty, discomfort, or embarrassment. Specifically, Defendant claims that "any items 'cluttering' the lower counters could have been easily removed by Defendant's employees within less than two minutes," and that Plaintiff would have received the necessary assistance had he asked. Defendant's Reply (Docket No. 30) at 3. While it may be true that Defendant's employees could have easily removed the displays and merchandise from the lowered [*16]  counters had Plaintiff asked, the Court concludes that Plaintiff was not required to request the employees to do so. Had the barrier to access been a truly temporary or isolated occurrence, which Defendant remedied on the day of Plaintiff's visit, there would be no liability under the ADA or the UCRA. See Chapman, 779 F.3d at 1010 (finding that the clutter encountered by the plaintiff caused, at most, temporary interruptions in access when there were only items on the sales counter on only two or three visits out of eleven visits, and where the employee promptly moved the obstructing items on those two or three visits). However, Plaintiff has established that the items placed on the Store's sales counters were not "isolated or temporary interruptions," but rather were reoccurring barriers to access by customers in wheelchairs. The ADA (and thus the UCRA) requires that lowered counters be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. See 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a). Because Defendant is required to maintain its lowered counters in a manner that makes them accessible to and usable by wheelchair users, the onus should not be on wheelchair users to request compliance on each occasion they patronize Defendant's Store.
Accordingly, [*17]  because Plaintiff encountered a barrier on his September 6, 2019 visit to the Store that caused him difficulty, discomfort, or embarrassment, the Court concludes he is entitled to statutory damages of $4,000 under the UCRA.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
The parties are ordered to meet and confer and agree on a joint proposed Judgment which is consistent with this Order. The parties shall lodge the joint proposed Judgment with the Court on or before December 28, 2020. In the unlikely event that counsel are unable to agree upon a joint proposed Judgment, the parties shall each submit separate versions of a proposed Judgment along with a Joint Statement setting forth their respective positions no later than December 28, 2020.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
