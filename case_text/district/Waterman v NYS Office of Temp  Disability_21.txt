Opinion


REPORT, RECOMMENDATION, AND ORDER
This case has been referred to the undersigned for all pre-trial matters, including preparation of a report and recommendations on dispositive motions. (Dkt. No. 29). Before the Court are two motions: (1) defendant New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance's ("OTDA's") second motion to dismiss the complaint under Rules 12(b)(5) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. No. 18), and (2) plaintiff Keith Waterman's motion for appointment of counsel (Dkt. No. 20). For the following reasons, it is recommended that OTDA's motion be granted in part and denied in part. Waterman's motion for appointment of counsel is denied without prejudice.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Keith Waterman commenced this employment discrimination action in 2013 against his former employer, OTDA. (Dkt. No. 1). Waterman is Native American and diabetic. (Id. at 7, 9).1 He alleges that OTDA discriminated against him on the basis of his disability and race,2 in violation of the Americans With Disabilities [*2]  Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §12112(a), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law ("HRL"), N.Y. Exec. Law §290 et seq. His complaint consists of an employment discrimination complaint form, a sixteen page, single-spaced "Description of Complaint," and various documentation relating to his administrative complaints with the State Division of Human Rights ("SDHR") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). For the purpose of resolving OTDA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in Waterman's complaint, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. Koch v. Christie's Int'l PLC, 699 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 2012). The relevant allegations from Waterman's complaint are as follows.
Waterman began working for OTDA in June 2000. (Dkt. No. 1 at 1). In June 2013, when he commenced this lawsuit, Waterman was a Grade 18 Information Technology Specialist II in OTDA's "Systems Unit." (Id.). Waterman is no longer employed with OTDA. (See Dkt. No. 23 at 2). Waterman alleges a litany of work-place incidents and difficulties, many of which on their face have nothing to do with his race or alleged disability. The incidents began in September 2011, when Waterman's "personal relationship" with his co-worker, Barb Jaffe, "deteriorated." (Dkt. No. 1 at 7). Around the end of September 2011, Waterman met with Debi Milley and Mario Musso, who directed Waterman to avoid Jaffe. (Id. at 9). Milley is a member of OTDA's personnel department (id. at 7); it is unclear who Musso is.
After Waterman met with Milley and Musso, "things started getting more hostile." (Id. at 9). One of Waterman's co-workers, Ed Ploski, began to harass Waterman for being Native American. Specifically, Waterman alleges that in October and November 2011,3 Ploski "kept singing 1 little, 2 little, 3 little, Indians," and told Waterman that he had "no reservations." (Id. at 10). [*4]  Ploski also told Shawnterio McIver, a sub-contractor from a temporary service, to ask Waterman what he sang when he was little. (Id.). Although Waterman asked Ploski to stop harassing him, the conduct continued "for weeks." (Id.).
Waterman alleges that Ploski "has a history of making inappropriate and discriminatory statements and false accusations." (Id. at 20). For example, on April 10, 2013, Ploski told Brenda Evans and others in the office that Evans should consider retiring due to her age. (Id.). Waterman further alleges that his co-worker, Stacy Niedziela, filed harassment charges against Ploski. (Id.). Waterman does not provide any details concerning these charges.
Ploski is not the only employee who allegedly harassed Waterman. Sometime before September 2011, Donna Weirtel asked Jaffe if she had "gotten a little Indian in her yet." (Id. at 7).4 Waterman complained about this comment to Milley, and Milley told Weirtel that Waterman had accused her of harassment. (Id. [*5] ). Weirtel then confronted Waterman, called him a liar, and threatened to pursue her own harassment charges against him. (Id.). Milley suggested to Waterman and Weirtel that they drop their respective complaints, which they did. (Id.). Afterward, Milley told Waterman "not to come to her anymore," and since that time, Waterman has been afraid to inform personnel of any workplace harassment. (Id.).
On November 22, 2011, Musso and Mike Bautz, the Assistant Regional Administrator in Buffalo, met with Waterman. (Id. at 11). Musso advised Waterman that OTDA had shut off his system access, that his hours were restricted from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and that he was to stay at his desk. (Id.). Waterman was not given any explanation for these changes. Around this time, Waterman experienced a tremendous amount of stress — he lost over thirty pounds, could not stop shaking, lost his appetite, and had to seek immediate medical treatment. (Id. at 12). Waterman went on leave and did not return to work until late January 2012. (Id.). Before returning to work, he attended a "fit for duty examination" that included both physical and psychological examinations. (Id.). When he returned to work, his stress was "still very high," and he experienced hearing loss, vertigo, and dizziness. (Id. at 21).
Also in November [*6]  2011, a note was placed on the mini-fridge Waterman owned and kept in the office stating that the fridge was "for medications only." (Id. at 15). Waterman used the mini-fridge to store insulin, snacks, and drinks. (Id.). Waterman alleges that during the SDHR proceeding, OTDA claimed that it posted the "medications only" sign because it planned to clean the mini-fridge. (Id.). Waterman disputes OTDA's explanation, arguing that he is the only one who ever cleaned the fridge. (Id. at 15-16).
When Waterman returned to work in January 2012, OTDA modified his ID badge to limit his access to the office from the minute his shift started to the minute it ended. (Id. at 13). All other employees had access to the office from 6:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (Id.). OTDA also denied Waterman "flex" time that would have allowed him to work late to make up for time he spent at a doctor's appointment. (Id.). Waterman was also told to relocate to a desk directly in front of his supervisor, Cindy Bialecki. (Id. at 15). Waterman complained that his new desk was too low for him and that he had been provided a reasonable accommodation for his old desk, thus, OTDA directed Waterman to move back to his old desk. (Id.).
Shortly after the desk incident, Bialecki [*7]  instructed Waterman to sit and watch a Xerox technician repair the document center in the office mailroom. (Id.). Mike Bautz, who was also in the mailroom, engaged Waterman in conversation. (Id.). Waterman provides the following account of the conversation:
Mr. Bautz told me that before I started working at O.T.D.A. there had been another Native American that used to work there. I was [a] little surprised as I had never heard about this and from what I knew I was the only Native to work there. Mr. Bautz went on to say that this other person had been assigned to sit at this desk located by the window. Everyday this individual would show up at work and sit there. Mike said that day after day this gentleman would sit there and his only job was to count the cars that drove by on the highway. I asked Mr. Bautz if this person was treated like this when he didn't even do anything. Mike didn't answer but I strongly believe this story was his way of telling me how I was going to be treated from that point forward.
(Id.).
OTDA also temporarily restricted Waterman's computer access and denied him access that would have allowed him to perform installation and computer configuration. (Id. at 16). At some point, [*8]  Waterman's computer was searched, his blackberry was confiscated, he was denied access to the server room, and OTDA instructed his co-workers not to speak with him. (Id. at 16, 18, 19). OTDA did not give Waterman work "for weeks," and his job duties were changed to maintaining inventory records and reimaging broken computers. (Id. at 16). This lack of "substantive technical work" is causing Waterman's skills to deteriorate. (Id. at 22).
In addition, even though Waterman has the most seniority with the Systems Unit, OTDA asked other employees to work overtime. (Id. at 17). The overtime was unpaid, but employees could convert overtime hours into "extra accrued time" for use at a later date. (Id.). In July 2012, OTDA finally offered Waterman overtime for a particular project, but Waterman declined the opportunity because he had a conflict and believed that the overtime would consist of manual labor, as opposed to technical work. (Id.). Waterman eventually filed a union grievance regarding the denial of overtime. (Id. at 18). Grace Hastings told Waterman that she would try to rectify the overtime situation because the allegations against Waterman were unfounded. (Id.). Hastings further told Waterman that OTDA withdrew his server room access [*9]  because he allegedly accessed and printed "managers files." (Id.). It is not clear from the complaint who Hastings is.
On January 31, 2012, Musso gave Waterman "a formal written counseling session concerning Barb Jaffe and threats, harassment, [and] intimidation in the workplace." (Id. at 13). The counseling was in response to a police report Jaffe filed against Waterman. (Id.). Musso told Waterman to stay away from Jaffe, but Jaffe made this impossible because she continued to taunt and harass Waterman. (Id. at 13-14).
Waterman's difficulties continued well into 2012. In particular, Ploski continued to harass him. The harassment was, on its face, unrelated to Waterman's race or disability. Among other things, Ploski told Waterman's co-workers that Waterman was being fired for hacking, warned others in the office to hide their food because Waterman would poison it, and told co-workers to lock up their valuables because Waterman was a thief. (Id. at 18). Further, in an email to Dan Romero requesting a promotion, Ploski attacked Waterman's "honesty and integrity." (Id.). Ploski also rummaged through Waterman's desk. (Id. at 20).
Waterman also alleges that he was wrongfully denied a promotion to three different positions. (Id. at 20-21). [*10]  First, he interviewed for a vacant systems supervisor position in OTDA's Binghamton office. Paul Ryan, Dan Romero, and Mary Thomas conducted the interview. (Id. at 20). The night before the interview (Waterman does not allege the date), Thomas told Waterman that Ryan accused him of being a drinker. (Id.). Waterman denied the accusation. (Id.). Even though Waterman was the "top candidate" and "the only candidate [who] was already familiar with the system," OTDA gave the position to a Disability Analyst III who was not interviewed and who did not hold a title within the "Systems title series." (Id. at 20-21). Second, when Waterman's supervisor, Ken Smith, retired, OTDA hired Cindy Bialecki, another Disability Analyst III, to replace him. (Id.). Waterman does not allege Smith's retirement date or the date Bialecki was hired. Third, in the summer of 2012, "a few more Information Technology Specialist III positions were being filled," and OTDA contacted Waterman for one of the positions. (Id.). Although OTDA gave Waterman an interview date, it later told him that he "was no longer reachable," which appears to mean he was not eligible for the position. (Id.). The position went to Joe Agars, a non-Native American [*11]  who performed the same duties as Waterman and had the same score on the employment exam. (Id.; Dkt. No. 23 at 11-12). OTDA offered Agars the position "before the closing date." (Dkt. No. 23 at 12).
On June 14, 2012, Waterman filed a discrimination complaint with the SDHR. (Id. at 27-42). According to Waterman, before filing his complaint, he discussed his "continued harassment and mistreatment" with Bautz, and Bautz handed him the necessary paperwork and instructed him to file the complaint. (Id. at 7). On November 28, 2012, the SDHR issued a determination finding no probable cause that OTDA discriminated against Waterman. (Id. at 50-51). On March 12, 2013, the EEOC adopted the SDHR's findings and mailed Waterman his right-to-sue letter. (Id. at 49).
On June 12, 2013, Waterman commenced this action. His complaint alleges failure to accommodate claims under the ADA and HRL as well as claims for race discrimination and hostile work environment under Title VII and the HRL. (Id. at 1-6). In July 2013, OTDA filed its first motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and failure to effect proper service. (Dkt. No. 3). Hon. H. Kenneth Schroeder (the Magistrate Judge initially assigned to this matter) issued a Report and Recommendation [*12]  recommending that OTDA's motion to dismiss for failure to effect proper service be granted but that Waterman be afforded an additional 120 days to serve his complaint. (Dkt. No. 12). Judge Schroeder did not reach the merits of OTDA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, although he did advise Waterman that he could amend his complaint to address any deficiencies identified by OTDA in its motion to dismiss. (Id. at 2-3). On December 11, 2013, Hon. Richard J. Arcara granted OTDA's motion to dismiss for failure to serve, but, pursuant to Judge Schroeder's Report and Recommendation, afforded Waterman an additional 120 days to effect proper service. (Dkt. No. 13).
On March 21, 2014, Waterman moved for an order directing the United States Marshals Service to serve the summons and complaint on OTDA. (Dkt. No. 14). While this motion was pending, Waterman moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (Dkt. No. 15). On November 14, 2014, Judge Schroeder granted Waterman's motion to proceed in forma pauperis, directed the Clerk of Court to cause the Marshals to serve the summons and complaint on OTDA, and denied as moot Waterman's motion for an order directing the Marshals to serve the summons [*13]  and complaint. (Dkt. No. 16).
Thereafter, on November 17, 2014, the Clerk's Office forwarded blank summons and Marshals forms to Waterman. In February 2015, Waterman returned the forms to the Clerk's Office, who then forwarded them to the Marshals. Waterman did not, however, properly fill out the Marshals forms. Instead of asking the Marshals to serve OTDA, Waterman requested service on counsel for OTDA. (Dkt. No. 17). Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 312-a (Personal Service By Mail), the Marshals mailed process and an acknowledgment form to OTDA's counsel on February 26. (Dkt. No. 17). On August 7, 2015, the Clerk of Court made a docket entry indicating that OTDA's counsel did not return the acknowledgment form. (Id.). The day before, August 6, the Marshals attempted to serve OTDA by mail, but OTDA likewise failed to return the acknowledgment form. (Dkt. No. 30.).
On September 14, 2015, OTDA filed the present motion seeking to dismiss Waterman's complaint for failure to effect proper service and failure to state a claim. (Dkt. No. 18). In support of its motion to dismiss for improper service, OTDA argues that Waterman failed to properly serve the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. ("Rule") 4(j)(2) or N.Y. C.P.L.R. 307(2), both of which govern service on a state [*14]  agency. Rule 4(j)(2) provides that service shall be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the agency's chief executive officer or serving a copy in the manner prescribed under state law. C.P.L.R. 307(2) provides, in turn, that service shall be made by delivering the summons to the agency's chief executive officer (or the person designated to receive service on behalf of the chief executive officer), or by mailing the summons by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the chief executive officer with the notation "URGENT LEGAL MAIL," and delivering the summons to an assistant attorney general at an office of the attorney general.
OTDA asserts several arguments in support of its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. With respect to Waterman's ADA claim, OTDA argues that the claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that Waterman has not alleged two required elements of his ADA claim, namely that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA and that OTDA refused to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. With respect to Waterman's Title VII race discrimination claim, OTDA argues that Waterman has not alleged an adverse employment action or that any such action was motivated by his race. [*15]  As for Waterman's Title VII hostile work environment claim, OTDA argues that any alleged harassment was neither severe nor pervasive, that the claim is untimely, and that Waterman has not alleged a basis for imputing liability to OTDA. Finally, OTDA argues that Waterman's HRL claims, like his ADA claim, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (Dkt. No. 18-1).
In opposition to OTDA's motion, Waterman filed a "Motion opposing defendant's motion to dismiss and to have defendant accept service in a reasonable manner or please allow me time to have defendant personally served." (Dkt. No. 23). Waterman argues that he made efforts to understand the service process by, for instance, conferring with attorneys from the Court's Pro Se Assistance Program, and that he was unaware that the Marshals would not properly serve OTDA.
On November 4, 2015, after Waterman filed his opposition, the Court entered an order directing the Clerk of Court to cause the Marshals to serve OTDA pursuant to C.P.L.R. 307(2). (Dkt. No. 24). OTDA was finally served on November 24, 2015. (Dkt. Nos. 26, 31). Thus, on December 1, 2015, OTDA withdrew its argument that Waterman failed to properly serve the complaint, but it did not withdraw its argument that [*16]  Waterman failed to timely serve the complaint. (Dkt. No. 32).
Waterman's motion also includes an opposition to OTDA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In opposition to dismissal of his ADA claim, Waterman argues that diabetes is a disability under the ADA and that OTDA impermissibly disclosed his confidential medical information when it posted the "medications only" note on his minifridge. In opposition to dismissal of his Title VII claims, Waterman lists several incidents that he believes support an inference of race discrimination and hostile work environment. Waterman's opposition does not address OTDA's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity arguments. (Dkt. No. 23).

DISCUSSION
The Court will address OTDA's motion to dismiss for untimely service before turning to its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
I. Motion to Dismiss For Untimely Service
OTDA argues that this action should be dismissed because Waterman did not serve his complaint within 120 days of Judge Arcara's order on OTDA's first motion to dismiss. Under Rule 12(b)(5), a defendant may move to dismiss for failure to timely serve the complaint under Rule 4(m). AIG Managed Mkt. Neutral Fund v. Askin Capital Mgmt., L.P., 197 F.R.D. 104, 107 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Rule 4(m) permits dismissal if the defendant is not served within 120 days after the [*17]  complaint is filed.5 However, if the plaintiff shows good cause for his failure to timely serve the complaint, the Court "must extend the time for service for an appropriate period." Rule 4(m). The burden of showing good cause belongs to the plaintiff, AIG Managed Mkt. Neutral Fund, 197 F.R.D. at 108, and the burden is a heavy one. Beauvoir v. U.S. Secret Serv., 234 F.R.D. 55, 56 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). Where, as here, the plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis, "reliance on the Marshals to effect service on a defendant constitutes good cause for extending the time for service if the plaintiff has provided the proper instructions for service and the Marshal has failed to comply." Rivera v. Warden of M.C.C., N.Y., No. 95 Civ. 3779(CSH), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8212, 2000 WL 769206, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2000) (emphasis added); see also Gonzalez v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 2d 181, 184 (N.D.N.Y. 2007) ("Although plaintiffs proceeding in forma pauperis are entitled to rely upon the United States Marshal to effect service, that reliance is not absolute; plaintiffs always retain the obligation to provide the process servers with the necessary information and to generally make diligent efforts.").
Here, within 120 days of the order directing him to serve the complaint on OTDA, Waterman moved for permission to proceed in forma pauperis. The Court granted his motion [*18]  and instructed the Clerk of Court to cause the Marshals to serve OTDA. However, when Waterman filled out the paperwork for Marshals service, he failed to properly instruct the Marshals to attempt service under Rule 4(j)(2) or C.P.L.R. 307(2), as required to serve a state agency. Waterman's failure to provide proper instructions does not satisfy the good cause requirement for an extension of time to serve the complaint. Rivera, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8212, 2000 WL 769206, at *4.
Even in the absence of good cause, however, district courts have broad discretion to grant an extension of time to serve the complaint. Zapata v. City of N.Y., 502 F.3d 192, 196 (2d Cir. 2007); Johnson v. DHS/ICE, No. 13-CV-0288A(Sr), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177787, 2013 WL 6669232, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2013) ("[W]hile plaintiff's ignorance of the manner in which he had to serve the federal defendants may not establish good cause under 4(m), the Court does have discretion to extend the time to serve the summons."). In deciding whether to exercise its discretion to extend the time for service, the Court considers four factors: "(1) whether the applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action; (2) whether the defendant had actual notice of the claims asserted in the complaint; (3) whether the defendant had attempted to conceal the defect in service; and (4) whether the defendant would be prejudiced by the granting of plaintiff's request for relief from the [*19]  provision." Beauvoir, 234 F.R.D. at 58 (quotation marks and citations omitted). These factors weigh in favor of extending the time for service here.
Turning to the first factor, the statute of limitations for Waterman's Title VII and ADA claims expired in 2013, ninety days after he received his right-to-sue letter. 42 U.S.C. §§2000e-5(f)(1), 12117(a). The statute of limitations for Waterman's HRL claims is three years, accruing from the time of the alleged discriminatory conduct, and almost all of the conduct Waterman complains of occurred more than three years ago.6 N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(2). The expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations strongly favors granting Waterman additional time for service. See Smith v. Ford Motor Co., No. 07-CV-422S, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69327, 2009 WL 2448472, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 7, 2009) (finding expiration of statute of limitations on Title VII claim supported an extension of time to serve the complaint).
The second factor, actual notice, also weighs in Waterman's favor because OTDA had notice of Waterman's claims no later than June 2012, when he filed his administrative complaint with the SDHR. OTDA also had prompt notice of Waterman's federal action, as shown by the fact that it filed [*20]  its first motion to dismiss one month after Waterman commenced the action. (Compare Dkt. No. 1, with Dkt. No. 3).
The third factor, whether OTDA attempted to conceal a defect in service, is neutral. While OTDA knew that Waterman was attempting to serve the complaint, nothing suggests that OTDA misled Waterman into believing that he had properly completed service.
The fourth and final factor weighs in Waterman's favor because any delay in service has not prejudiced OTDA. OTDA had notice of Waterman's claims in 2012, when he filed his administrative complaint, and it presumably investigated his claims at that time. OTDA also received prompt notice of this lawsuit, as it filed its first motion to dismiss a mere one month after commencement.
Finally, Waterman diligently attempted to serve OTDA by filing motions for Marshals service and to proceed in forma pauperis, respectively. After the Court granted the latter motion, Waterman provided the Marshals with paperwork requesting service. While the paperwork failed to properly instruct the Marshals on how to complete service, this was a legal mistake, not a lack of diligence on the part of Waterman. Waterman also met with attorneys from the [*21]  Court's Pro Se Assistance Program to discuss service. Therefore, for these reasons, the Court should exercise its discretion to extend Waterman's time to complete service, and it is recommended that OTDA's motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(5) be denied.
II. Motion to Dismiss For Failure to State a Claim
Under Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court accepts all factual allegations in the complaint as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Koch, 699 F.3d at 145. Application of the motion to dismiss standard is "a context-specific task that requires the reviewing [*22]  court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.
Where, as here, the plaintiff is proceeding pro se, the complaint, "however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1995)); see also Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006) ("It is well established that the submissions of a pro se litigant must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.") (quoting Pabon v. Wright, 459 F.3d 241, 248 (2d Cir. 2006)). That said, even a pro se complaint must be dismissed if it does not contain "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, 'to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).
A. ADA Claim
OTDA first argues that Waterman's ADA claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against a state brought by a private citizen in federal court unless the state consents to suit, or Congress has abrogated the state's sovereign immunity with regard to the specific claim at issue. See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98-99, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984). "An official arm of a state enjoys the same Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court as is enjoyed by the state itself." Posr v. Court Officer Shield No. 207, 180 F.3d 409, 414 (2d Cir. 1999). OTDA is an "arm of the state" for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. See Baez v. New York, 56 F. Supp. 3d 456, 464 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).
Waterman's complaint alleges discrimination in employment and, therefore, arises under Title I, [*23]  not Title II, of the ADA. Mary Jo C. v. N.Y. State & Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 171 (2d Cir. 2013). New York has not consented to suit in federal court under Title I of the ADA, and Congress has not validly abrogated state sovereign immunity as to suits for money damages under Title I. See Quadir v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 39 F. Supp. 3d 528, 536-37 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374, 121 S. Ct. 955, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2001)). Therefore, Waterman's ADA claim is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Baez, 56 F. Supp. 3d at 464 (dismissing ADA Title I claim against OTDA on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity grounds).7
Even if Waterman's ADA claim was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, it should be dismissed because Waterman has not adequately pleaded such a claim. To state a disability discrimination claim based on a failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must allege that: "(1) [he] is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) [*24]  the employer has refused to make such accommodations." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2004)). Waterman has failed to adequately plead the first and fourth elements of his failure to accommodate claim.
Under the ADA, a "disability" is "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual," "a record of such an impairment," or "being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. §12102(1). A medical condition, by itself, is not a per se disability under the ADA; rather, the medical condition must substantially limit a major life activity. See Anyan v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 192 F. Supp. 2d 228, 244-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). "[M]ajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. §12102(2)(A). "[A] major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." Id. §12102(2)(B).
Here, Waterman has failed to allege that his diabetes substantially limits one or more major [*25]  life activities. While Waterman does contend that if he does not eat he "could become weak, unable to stand, walk, think clear, [or] speak," or "become unconscious and not able to care for [himself] or communicate," he does not allege that he was unable to eat at work or that he ever experienced any of these ailments. (Dkt. No. 23 at 4). To the contrary, while working for OTDA, Waterman was on an "eating schedule" and "always" took his lunch around noon. (Dkt. No. 1 at 9). Waterman also does not allege that his diabetes limited his ability to perform his job in any respect. Accordingly, he has not alleged that he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Anyan, 192 F. Supp. 2d at 244 (dismissing ADA claim because plaintiff failed to show that his diabetes substantially limited one or more major life activities); see also Montalvo v. Lamy, No. 6:14-CV-6251EAW,   139 F. Supp. 3d 597, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137211, 2015 WL 6158122, at *10 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2015) ("Numerous federal courts have held that diabetes, even when accompanied by the use of medication and dietary restrictions, is not necessarily a disability under the ADA.").
Waterman has also failed to allege the fourth element of his claim, i.e., that OTDA refused to provide him with a reasonable accommodation. Waterman first disclosed his diabetes to OTDA [*26]  in 2003. (Dkt. No. 1 at 5). That same year, OTDA granted him permission to keep a personal mini-fridge in the office so that he could store his insulin. (Id. at 6). Waterman acknowledges that the mini-fridge was an "effective" accommodation. (Id.). In 2011, OTDA placed a note on his fridge directing that all food be removed because the fridge was for "medications only." (Id. at 15). OTDA later told Waterman that it posted this sign because the fridge was going to be cleaned. (Id.). Although it is unclear whether OTDA did in fact clean the fridge, Waterman does not allege that OTDA ever removed the fridge or precluded him from using it. Rather, Waterman alleges that he was "the only person with permission to have the mini fridge when the rest were removed," and that the fridge was an effective accommodation. (Id. at 6, 16). Thus, Waterman has not alleged that OTDA denied him a reasonable accommodation, and based on his allegation that the fridge was an effective accommodation, any such allegation would be implausible.
In his opposition, Waterman appears to argue that OTDA's posting of the "medications only" sign violates the ADA. (Dkt. No. 23 at 4-5). He cites EEOC Enforcement Guidance providing that:
An employer [*27]  may not disclose that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation because this usually amounts to a disclosure that the individual has a disability. The ADA specifically prohibits the disclosure of medical information except in certain limited situations, which do not include disclosure to coworkers.
EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans With Disabilities Act (Oct. 17, 2002), 2002 WL 31994335, at *27. The EEOC Guidance cites 42 U.S.C. §§12112(d)(3)(B), 12112(d)(4)(C), and 29 C.F.R. §1630.14(b)(1).8Id. at *27 n.111. Under §12112(d)(4), if an employer asks an employee about his ability to perform his job, and, as part of that inquiry, obtains information regarding the employee's medical condition or history, it must keep that information confidential. See Desano, 553 F. Supp. 2d at 251.
To the extent Waterman asserts a claim under §12112(d)(4), the claim should be dismissed. Even assuming OTDA asked Waterman about his ability to perform his job and obtained information concerning his medical condition or history, the "medications only" sign cannot be construed as a disclosure of Waterman's medical condition or history because it does not indicate that he has diabetes or that he used the fridge to store insulin. Moreover, Waterman has not alleged that he intended to keep his diabetes confidential. Accordingly, for all of these [*28]  reasons, it is recommended that Waterman's ADA claim be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
B. Title VII Race Discrimination Claim
At the pleading stage, the plaintiff is not required to allege facts sufficient to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). However, the elements of a prima facie case "provide an outline of what is necessary to render [the plaintiff's] claims for relief plausible." Sommersett v. City of N.Y., No. 09 Civ. 5916(LTS)(KNF), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71357, 2011 WL 2565301, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2011); Doverspike v. Int'l Ordinance Techs., 817 F. Supp. 2d 141, 148 (W.D.N.Y. 2010) ("[A]lthough Plaintiff need not plead sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination to survive Defendant's motion, the court considers the elements of a prima facie case in determining whether there is sufficient factual matter in the Complaint which, if true, give Defendant 'fair notice' of Plaintiff's employment discrimination claims and the grounds on which such claims rest."), aff'd, 445 F. App'x 399 (2d Cir. 2011). To establish a prima facie discrimination claim under Title VII, the plaintiff must show: "(1) he belonged to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he held; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference [*29]  of discriminatory intent." Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 435 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Brown v. City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir. 2012)). OTDA argues that Waterman has not adequately alleged an adverse action or that any purported adverse action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.
i. Adverse Action
"A plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a 'materially adverse change' in the terms and conditions of employment." Galabya v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Serv., 180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir. 1999)). "To be 'materially adverse' a change in working conditions must be 'more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.'" Id. (quoting Crady v. Liberty Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir. 1993)). "A materially adverse change might be indicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation." Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Crady, 993 F.2d at 136).
Liberally construing Waterman's complaint, it alleges that OTDA ostracized him within the office (Dkt. No. 1 at 17), gave him written counseling (id. at 13), denied him "flex" time (id.), severely curtailed his job duties (id. at 11, 13, 16, 18, 19), denied him overtime (id. at 17), and failed to promote him to three different positions [*30]  (id. at 21). The first three actions Waterman complains of — ostracism, written counseling, and denial of flex time — are not adverse actions under Title VII. Rodas v. Town of Farmington, 918 F. Supp. 2d 183, 191 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) ("Generally speaking, ostracism, 'shunning,' or the exclusion of an employee from non-essential office functions, cannot rise to the level of 'material adversity' . . . ."), aff'd, 567 F. App'x 24 (2d Cir. 2014); Bennett v. Watson Wyatt & Co., 136 F. Supp. 2d 236, 248 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding that "reprimands, threats of disciplinary action and excessive scrutiny," without more, are not adverse employment actions), aff'd, 51 F. App'x 55 (2d Cir. 2002); Walder v. White Plains Bd. of Educ., 738 F. Supp. 2d 483, 498 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that denial of late entry is not an adverse employment action).
The denial of overtime is an adverse action because, although overtime was technically "unpaid," Waterman could have used overtime hours as "extra accrued time off." (Dkt. No. 1 at 17). Thus, the denial of overtime could very well have negatively affected Waterman's compensation and benefits, thereby making it an adverse employment action. See Awad v. City of N.Y., No. 13 Civ. 5753(BMC), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63234, 2014 WL 1814114, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. May 7, 2014). Although Waterman turned down overtime on one occasion, he alleges that OTDA improperly denied him overtime on several other occasions. (Dkt. No. 1 at 17).
The stripping of Waterman's job duties also qualifies as an adverse employment action. After Waterman returned from leave in January 2012, OTDA did [*31]  not give him work "for weeks." (Id. at 16). Later, OTDA stripped Waterman of his job duties by assigning him non-technical tasks such as maintaining inventory records and reimaging broken computers. OTDA also restricted Waterman's access to the office and his computer, searched his computer, confiscated his blackberry, and denied him access to the server room. The change in Waterman's duties is alleged to have caused his skills to deteriorate, thereby threatening his IT career. These allegations state an adverse employment action. Awad, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63234, 2014 WL 1814114, at *3 ("[The] stripping of plaintiff's responsibilities, while perhaps not as extreme as termination or a decrease in salary or benefits, are [ ] enough to support an inference that plaintiff suffered a material adverse action.").
Finally, OTDA's failure to promote Waterman to three positions — the vacant systems supervisor position in the Binghamton office, the position vacated by his supervisor, Ken Smith, and the Information Technology Specialist III position available in the summer of 2012, are all adverse employment actions. Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 720 (2d Cir. 2002) ("[Plaintiff's] claim of discriminatory failure to promote falls within the core activities encompassed by the term 'adverse actions.'"). In [*32]  sum, Waterman has adequately alleged three adverse employment actions — denial of overtime, stripping of job duties, and failure to promote.
ii. Inference of Discrimination
To survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must also plead that the adverse employment actions he complains of occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. Tolbert, 790 F.3d at 435. Such an inference may arise from remarks reflecting discriminatory animus, disparate treatment, or other allegations from which a race-based motivation may be inferred. Patane v. Clark, 508 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2007). Waterman's conversation with Mike Bautz, along with his allegations of disparate treatment, create an inference of discrimination.
In or around January 2012, Bautz told Waterman that OTDA had stripped another Native American employee of his job duties. According to Waterman, because OTDA had just recently stripped him of his job duties, Bautz's comment signaled that OTDA was discriminating against him because of his race. A few months after their conversation, Waterman complained to Bautz about continued harassment, and Bautz instructed him to file a complaint with the SDHR, even going so far as to hand him the necessary paperwork to file his complaint. [*33]  Waterman has plausibly alleged that Bautz was a supervisor in OTDA's Buffalo Office, as shown by his title, "Assistant Regional Administrator in Buffalo," and his participation in a meeting during which Musso disciplined Waterman. As supervisor, Bautz was in a position to know whether OTDA was discriminating against Waterman on account of his race, and his conversation with Waterman and his instruction that he file a discrimination complaint suggest that the persistent mistreatment and adverse actions Waterman complains of may be causally connected to his race. Further, Bautz gave his instruction around the time OTDA denied Waterman the Information Technology Specialist III position. That position went to Joe Agars, a non-Native American who performed the same duties as Waterman and who earned the same score on the employment exam. (Dkt. No. 23 at 11-12).9 Liberally construed, Bautz's comments, along with Waterman's allegation that a position he applied for went to a non-Native American with similar credentials, create an inference that Waterman's race was a factor in OTDA's decisions to strip him of his job duties, deny him overtime, and not promote him. Although OTDA identifies non-discriminatory [*34]  reasons for taking these adverse actions, the Court is required to read the complaint in the light most favorable to Waterman and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor. Bearing in mind that the Court is deciding a motion to dismiss, not a motion for summary judgment, Waterman's allegations state a claim for relief under Title VII. Thus, it is recommended that OTDA's motion to dismiss Waterman's Title VII race discrimination claim be denied.
C. Title VII Hostile Work Environment Claim
To state a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, "a plaintiff must plead facts that would tend to show that the complained of conduct: (1) 'is objectively severe or pervasive — that is, . . . creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive'; (2) creates an environment 'that the plaintiff subjectively perceives as hostile [*35]  or abusive'; and (3) 'creates such an environment because of the plaintiff's [protected status].'" Patane, 508 F.3d at 113 (first alteration in original) (quoting Gregory v. Daly, 243 F.3d 687, 691-92 (2d Cir. 2001)). "[A] work environment's hostility should be assessed based on the 'totality of the circumstances.'" Id. (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, courts consider the following factors: "(1) the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; (2) its severity; (3) whether it is threatening and humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and (4) 'whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" Id. (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 23).
The conduct Waterman complains of would be viewed by a reasonable person as severe, hostile, and abusive. In October and November 2011, Ploski mocked Waterman for being Native American by singing "1 little, 2 little, 3 little, Indians" and stating that he had "no reservations." (Dkt. No. 1 at 10). Ploski also encouraged Shawnterio McIver, a sub-contractor from a temporary service, to harass Waterman by asking him what he sang when he was little. Ploski's conduct is alleged to have gone on "for weeks." (Dkt. No. 1 at 10).
In addition to these overtly discriminatory statements, Ploski engaged in harassment that [*36]  on its face is race-neutral. For example, Ploski told Waterman's co-workers that Waterman was being fired for hacking, warned others to hide their food because Waterman would poison it, and told his co-workers to lock up their valuables because Waterman was a thief. Given Ploski's alleged history of discriminatory comments, Waterman should have the opportunity to explore whether Ploski's facially neutral comments were in fact racially motivated. Kaytor v. Elec. Boat Corp., 609 F.3d 537, 547-48 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that facially "neutral" comments may be included among the "totality of the circumstances" that courts consider under a hostile work environment claim where there is some basis for inferring that the comments were in fact based upon the plaintiff's protected status).
Ploski is not the only employee who allegedly harassed Waterman. Donna Weirtel allegedly asked Barb Jaffe if she had "gotten a little Indian in her yet." (Dkt. No. 1 at 7). When Waterman complained to Milley in personnel about this comment, Milley told Weirtel that Waterman had accused her of harassment. Weirtel then confronted Waterman, called him a liar, and threatened to pursue her own harassment charges against him. Milley suggested to Waterman and Weirtel that they [*37]  drop their respective complaints, which they did. Afterward, Milley told Waterman "not to come to her anymore," and since that time, Waterman has been afraid to inform personnel of any harassment. (Id.).
The alleged harassment Waterman complains of was also subjectively hostile and abusive. Around the time Ploski began harassing him in October or November 2011, Waterman lost over thirty pounds, could not stop shaking, lost his appetite, sought medical treatment, and went on leave for approximately two months. When he returned to work, his stress was "still very high," and he experienced hearing loss, vertigo, and dizziness. (Id. at 21). While some of these symptoms may be attributable to Waterman's other workplace difficulties, Waterman's allegations make it plausible that, at a minimum, the alleged harassment contributed to his poor health. Moreover, Waterman requested that Ploski stop harassing him (a request that Ploski ignored), which demonstrates that Ploski's conduct upset Waterman and continued unabated. Accordingly, upon a review of the totality of the circumstances, Waterman has adequately pleaded that he was subjected to a hostile work environment on account of his race.
OTDA raises [*38]  two other arguments in support of dismissal of Waterman's hostile work environment claim. First, OTDA argues that the claim is time barred because any alleged harassment occurred more than 300 days before Waterman filed his administrative complaint. See 42 U.S.C. §2000e-5(e)(1); McGullam v. Cedar Graphics, Inc., 609 F.3d 70, 75 (2d Cir. 2010) ("Title VII's administrative exhaustion provision requires that any complaint be filed with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act."). Waterman filed his administrative complaint on June 14, 2012. Although OTDA argues that November 19, 2011 is 300 days before June 14, 2012 (Dkt. No. 18-1 at 22), the correct date is August 19, 2011.
Waterman alleges that Ploski harassed him in October or November 2011, well after the August 19, 2011 cut-off date. Weirtel allegedly made her offensive comment in November 2010, outside the limitations period. However, for purposes of a hostile work environment claim, an offensive comment made outside the limitations period may be considered by the Court so long as it is "sufficiently related" to offensive comments made within the limitations period. McGullam, 609 F.3d at 77 (citing Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 118, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002)). Drawing all reasonable inferences in Waterman's favor, the Court cannot say at this juncture that Weirtel's comment is unrelated [*39]  to Ploski's comments so as to preclude its consideration in this action. The Court notes, however, that even assuming Weirtel's comment is time barred, Ploski's harassment, standing alone, supports a hostile work environment claim.
Next, OTDA argues that it cannot be held liable for its employees' alleged harassment. Where, as here, the harassment is attributable to a non-supervisory co-worker, the employer will be held liable only for its own negligence. See Summa v. Hofstra Univ., 708 F.3d 115, 124 (2d Cir. 2013). The negligence standard may be satisfied by showing that the employer failed to take reasonable steps to remedy the alleged harassment. Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 638 (2d Cir. 1997). Waterman has met this requirement by alleging that the harassment continued up until the time he filed his SDHR complaint, even though he had complained about it. (Dkt. No. 1 at 7). Further, Waterman alleges that when he brought a harassment complaint to Milley, a member of OTDA's personnel department, Milley warned him not to make any more complaints. (Id.). Since that time, Waterman has been afraid to bring complaints to the attention of the personnel department. (Id.). These facts plausibly allege that OTDA was aware of the alleged harassment, but failed to remedy it. Keeping in mind that [*40]  this is a motion to dismiss, not a motion for summary judgment, Waterman has set forth a basis for imputing liability to OTDA. Therefore, it is recommended that OTDA's motion to dismiss Waterman's Title VII hostile work environment claim be denied.
D. Human Rights Law Claims
New York State has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity for suits in federal court under the HRL. Baez, 56 F. Supp. 3d at 464; Quadir, 39 F. Supp. 3d at 537. Therefore, Waterman's HRL claims against OTDA, an arm of New York State, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and it is recommended that they be dismissed.
E. Leave to Amend
When a pro se complaint fails to state a cause of action, the Court generally "should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated." Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000). Conversely, leave to amend is not required where "[t]he problem with [the plaintiff's] causes of action is substantive" such that "better pleading will not cure it." Id. The claims for which dismissal is recommended here — Waterman's ADA and HRL claims — cannot be cured by better pleading because they are plainly barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Therefore, it is recommended that Waterman's ADA and HRL claims be dismissed with prejudice.
III. Motion for Appointment [*41]  of Counsel
There is no constitutional right to appointed counsel in civil cases. However, under 28 U.S.C. §1915(e)(1), the Court may appoint counsel to assist indigent litigants. See, e.g., Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Charles W. Sears Real Estate, Inc., 865 F.2d 22, 23 (2d Cir. 1988). The decision to appoint counsel lies clearly within the Court's discretion. In re Martin-Trigona, 737 F.2d 1254, 1260 (2d Cir. 1984). The Court must consider the issue of appointment careful, for "every assignment of a volunteer lawyer to an undeserving client deprives society of a volunteer lawyer available for a deserving cause." Cooper v. A. Sargenti Co., 877 F.2d 170, 172 (2d Cir. 1989).
The factors to be considered in deciding whether to appoint counsel include: (1) whether the indigent's claims seem likely to be of substance, (2) whether the indigent is able to investigate the crucial facts concerning his claims, (3) whether conflicting evidence implicating the need for cross-examination will be the major proof presented to the fact finder, (4) the indigent's ability to present the case, (5) whether the legal issues involved are complex, and (6) whether there are any special reasons why appointment of counsel would be more likely to lead to a just determination. Hendricks v. Coughlin, 114 F.3d 390, 392 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Hodge v. Police Officers, 802 F.2d 58 (2d Cir. 1986). The Court must first consider the likelihood of merit of the dispute, and "even though a claim may not be characterized as frivolous, counsel should not [*42]  be appointed in a case where the merits of the indigent's claim are thin and his chances of prevailing are therefore poor." Carmona v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 243 F.3d 629, 632 (2d Cir. 2001).
Having reviewed Waterman's request for counsel in light of the above factors, the Court concludes that appointment of counsel is not warranted at this time. With respect to the threshold merits requirement, although this case has been pending for nearly three years, it is still in its early stages, making it difficult to assess the merits of Waterman's claims. Therefore, Waterman's motion for appointment of counsel is denied without prejudice to his ability to re-apply for appointment of counsel at a later date. It remains Waterman's responsibility to retain an attorney or to prosecute this action pro se.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that OTDA's second motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 18) be granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, it is recommended that the Court dismiss Waterman's ADA and HRL claims, but not his Title VII race discrimination or hostile work environment claims. Waterman's motion for appointment of counsel (Dkt. No. 20) is denied without prejudice.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1), it is hereby ORDERED that this Report, Recommendation, [*43]  and Order be filed with the Clerk of Court.
Unless otherwise ordered by Judge Arcara, any objections to this Report, Recommendation, and Order must be filed with the Clerk of Court within fourteen days of service of this Report, Recommendation, and Order in accordance with the above statute, Rules 72(b), 6(a), and 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Local Rule of Civil Procedure 72. Any requests for an extension of this deadline must be made to Judge Arcara.
Failure to file objections, or to request an extension of time to file objections, within fourteen days of service of this Report, Recommendation, and Order WAIVES THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE DISTRICT COURT'S ORDER. See Small v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 892 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1989).
The District Court will ordinarily refuse to consider de novo arguments, case law and/or evidentiary material which could have been, but were not, presented to the Magistrate Judge in the first instance. See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1988).
Pursuant to Local Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), written objections "shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings and recommendations to which objection is made and the basis for each objection, and shall be supported by legal authority." Failure to comply with these provisions may result in the District Court's refusal to consider the [*44]  objection.
SO ORDERED.
