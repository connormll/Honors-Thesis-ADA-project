ORDER RE

1) DEFENDANT DEAN TRANSPORTATION INC.'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' FAC PURSUANT TO 12(B)(6) [33];

2) DEFENDANT DEAN FOODS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LLC'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' FAC PURSUANT TO 12(B)(6) [34]

3) PLAINTIFF'S MOTION OF SUBSTITUTION OF PROPER PARTY FOLLOWING DEATH PURSUANT TO 25(A) [55]
In this putative class action, Plaintiff Scott Parker alleges various violations of California's wage and hour laws against Defendants Dean Transportation, Inc. ("DTI"); Dean Foods of Southern California, LLC (dba Heartland Farms) ("Heartland"); SBM Dairies, Inc. ("SBM"); and Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, LLC ("Alta-Dena") (collectively "Defendants"). Plaintiff also alleges individual claims against DTI for disability discrimination, wrongful termination, and related causes of action.
Dean Transportation, Inc. ("DTI") filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs First Amended Complaint ("FAC") (the "DTI Motion"). (Dkt. No. 34.) Additionally, Heartland filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's FAC  [*2] (the "Heartland Motion"). (Dkt. No. 33.) Finally, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Substitute Plaintiff Scott Parker for Plaintiff Cari Parker as Representative of Estate Scott Parker. (Dkt. No. 55.) The Court will discuss the Motions in that order.

I. Background

A. The Parties
From approximately February 2009 through October 2009, Scott Parker ("Plaintiff") worked as a commercial driver for SBM. (FAC ¶ 3.) In October 2009, Heartland acquired SBM and Plaintiff became a driver for Heartland.1(FAC ¶ 3; Ball Supp. Decl. ¶ 5.) In January 2011, Heartland transferred its drivers to its sister corporation, DTI, and Plaintiff worked as a DTI driver from January 1, 2011 until March 2012. (FAC ¶ 3; Ball Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.) Plaintiff's job duties were the same at each of these companies: he delivered Heartland products to Heartland's customers or to other locations in Southern California. (FAC ¶ 3.)

B. General Allegations
Plaintiff alleges a number of wage-and-hour violations by Defendants on behalf of a class of drivers. The FAC defines the class as follows: "All persons who were employed by defendants Santee Dairies,2[Heartland], and DTI as a 'Driver' (including, but not limited to Delivery Driver, Route Driver, Relay/Shuttle Driver, Wholesale Driver, Shipping Driver, etc.) in California from February 2009 to the present."3(FAC ¶ 7.) The core allegations of Plaintiff's class claims are that Defendants had a policy or practice that did not permit drivers to take meal or rest breaks as required by the California Labor Code. (FAC ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges that drivers were assigned set routes for making deliveries and that they were required to remain within one-half to one mile of their routes at all times. (FAC ¶ 13.) This restriction thus meant that drivers could not take a truly duty-free meal or rest break. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that because drivers were required to finish their deliveries before taking a meal break, they were unable to take such breaks before their sixth hour on duty, and they were not authorized to take a second meal break  [*4] when working longer than ten hours. (FAC ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges that, consequently, drivers were paid less than what was due to them on their paychecks. (FAC ¶ 13.)
Plaintiff passed away on June 23, 2013 in Victorville, California, after filing this action. (Dkt. No. 55-1, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 3). Plaintiff died intestate. (Dkt. No. 66-1, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 2.) After Parker's death, Plaintiff's wife, Ms. Cari Parker ("Ms. Parker") filed a Motion to Substitute Plaintiff that will be considered in conjunction with the Motions to Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 55.) Ms. Parker and Plaintiff filed for divorce in April 2011, though it was not finalized. (Dkt. No. 59-1, Decl. Cari Parker ¶ 2.) Plaintiff is survived by three children.4(Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B at 65.)

C. Class Claims
Plaintiff brings the following class claims: (1) failure to provide meal and/or rest breaks in  [*5] violation of California Labor Code sections 226.7, 512; (2) failure to pay all wages due upon termination of employment in violation of California Labor Code sections 201-204; (3) failure to pay all wages earned in violation of California Labor Code sections 221-224; (4) failure to pay minimum wage and/or overtime in violation of California Labor Code sections 510, 511, 1182.12, and 1194; (5) failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements in violation of California Labor Code section 226; and (6) unfair business practices pursuant to California Business & Profession Code sections 1700 et seq. (FAC ¶¶ 22-58.)

D. Individual Claims
Plaintiff also alleges DTI discriminated against him after he was injured in a work-related accident in November of 2011. (FAC ¶ 20.) Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim for his injuries and took disability leave. (FAC ¶ 20.) In March 2012, while Plaintiff was on disability leave, DTI terminated his employment for "stealing time"—taking unrecorded breaks. Plaintiff alleges that the breaks were meal and rest breaks. (FAC ¶ 20.)
Plaintiff alleges DTI failed to follow its own discipline policies or to engage in an interactive process as required by  [*6] law. (FAC ¶ 20.) Plaintiff filed discrimination charges with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing in February 2013; the Department issued Plaintiff a right-to-sue notice. (FAC ¶ 21.) Based on these allegations, Plaintiff brings the following individual claims in his FAC: (1) disability discrimination in violation of California Government Code § 12900 et seq. ("FEHA"); (2) failure to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of FEHA section 12940(m); (3) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA section 12940(n); and (4) wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. (FAC ¶¶ 59-83.)

II. Procedural History
On February 28, 2013, Plaintiff filed his complaint in Los Angeles County Superior Court. On, April 15, 2013, Defendants DTI and Heartland removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 ("CAFA"). On May 13, 2013, Plaintiff moved to remand the case to state court. (Dkt. No. 14.) Plaintiff filed a FAC on May 31, 2013. (Dkt No. 25.) On June 26, 2013, the Court denied Plaintiff's motion to remand. (Dkt. No. 46.)
On June 17, 2013, both Heartland (Dkt. No. 33) and DTI (Dkt. No. 34) filed Motions to Dismiss. Together  [*7] they filed a Request for Judicial Notice. (Dkt. No. 36.) Plaintiff filed an Opposition on June 24, 2013 to both Heartland's Motion (Dkt. No. 39) and DTI's Motion. (Dkt. No. 38.) Heartland and DTI filed Replies. (Dkt. Nos. 42, 43.)
On July 10, 2013, Heartland and DTI informed the Court of Scott Parker's death on June 23, 2013. (Dkt. No. 50.) Subsequently, the Court issued an OSC requesting Plaintiff's counsel to submit information on the status of the case. (Dkt. Nos. 51, 52.) On July 31, 2013 Plaintiff's counsel filed a response requesting to substitute Plaintiff's wife, Ms. Parker. (Dkt. No. 53.) On August 1, 2013, the Court issued an Order for Plaintiff to file a Motion for Substitution of the Proper Party in this matter. (Dkt. No. 54.) On September 9, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Substitute Plaintiff Scott Parker for Plaintiff Cari Parker as Representative of the Estate of Scott Parker ("Motion to Substitute"). (Dkt. No. 55.) On September 16, 2013, Heartland and DTI joined in an Opposition to the Motion to Substitute (Dkt. No. 57) and a Request for Judicial Notice. (Dkt. No. 58.) On September 23, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Reply. (Dkt. No. 59.)
Following this on October 1, 2013,  [*8] Heartland and DTI filed an Ex Parte Application, requesting leave to file a response to Plaintiff's Reply. (Dkt. Nos. 60, 61.) On October 2, 2013, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to Heartland and DTI's Ex Parte Application. (Dkt. No. 62.) The Court granted Heartland and DTI's Ex Parte Application on October 3, 2013. (Dkt. No. 63.) Thereafter, Heartland and DTI filed a Response. (Dkt. No. 64.) The Court then issued an OSC on October 3, 2013, ordering Plaintiff to show why Ms. Parker is the appropriate representative of Plaintiff's estate. (Dkt. No. 65.) On October 4, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Statement in response to the OSC with accompanying exhibits and a declaration. (Dkt. Nos. 66, 67.) Heartland and DTI filed a final Response to Plaintiff's Statement re OSC. (Dkt. No. 69.)

III. Requests for Judicial Notice
Federal Rule of Evidence 201 empowers a court to take judicial notice of facts that are either "(1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); Mullis v. United States Bankruptcy Court, 828 F.2d 1385, 1388 n. 9 (9th Cir.1987).  [*9] According to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court "must take judicial notice if a party requests it and supplies the court with the necessary information." Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2).
In ruling on the Motion to Dismiss, the Court cannot generally "consider material outside of the complaint, such as facts presented in briefs, affidavits, or discovery materials." Zella v. E.W. Scripps Co., 529 F. Supp. 2d 1124, 1128 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (citation omitted). The Court may consider exhibits submitted with the FAC and "documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the plaintiff's pleading." Kennedy v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 12CV372-WQH-WMC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43882, 2013 WL 1285109 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2013) (quoting Parrino v. FHP, Inc., 146 F.3d 699, 705-06 (9th Cir.1998)) (quotation marks omitted).

A. Motion to Dismiss
To support their individual Motions to Dismiss, DTI and Heartland filed a joint request for judicial notice. The Court grants their joint request. (See Dkt. No. 36.) The documents provided in the exhibits were either (1) filed in the related action Miguel de la Cueva v. Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc., et al., Case  [*10] No. 12-CV-1804-GHK-CW (C.D. Cal.) or (2) are publicly available filings with state or federal agencies not subject to reasonable dispute.5 The Court may "take notice of the records of state agencies or other undisputed matters of public record." Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., 375 F.3d 861, 866 n.1 (9th Cir. 2004).

B. Motion to Substitute Plaintiff
In conjunction with Plaintiff's Motion to Substitute, both parties filed documents to be judicially noticed. (See Dkt. No. 58; Dkt. No. 66.) Heartland and DTI ask the Court to judicially notice the state court records from Plaintiff and Ms. Parker's divorce proceedings entitled Cari Cartwright Parker v. Scott Parker, Case File No. FAMVS1101147 (Cal. Sup. Ct.). The Court grants judicial notice as they are records from a state agency, which are capable of accurate and ready determination within the meaning of Rule 201(b).6
Plaintiff did not file a formal request for judicial notice, but attached a 2012 tax return form, documentation regarding the purchase of a car, and documentation from insurance providers. The Court grants judicial notice of these documents as well.7

IV. Motions to Dismiss

A. Legal Standard
A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable" for the alleged  [*13] conduct. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "[A] plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusion, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Assuming that all of the allegations in a complaint are true, "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id.
To determine whether a complaint states a claim sufficient to withstand dismissal, a court considers the contents of the complaint and its attached exhibits, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters properly subject to judicial notice. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322-24, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 668 (9th Cir. 2001). The court must accept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint. That principle, however, "is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory  [*14] statements, do not suffice." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
Where a motion to dismiss is granted, a district court should provide leave to amend unless it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by any amendment. Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).

B. DTI's Motion to Dismiss

1. Plaintiff's Class Allegations against DTI
Plaintiff brings class allegations against all Defendants.8 The class allegations are based on and derive from Plaintiff's underlying allegation whether Defendants failed to comply with California's meal and rest break laws. In its Motion, DTI argues that the state laws are preempted by federal law. The Court will examine first if DTI qualifies as a motor carrier, and second whether federal law preempts the California meal and rest break laws and Wage Order No. 9.

i. DTI is a Motor Carrier.
The Court agrees that DTI qualifies as a motor carrier. A motor carrier is defined as "a person providing motor vehicle transportation for compensation." 49 U.S.C.A. § 13102(14)  [*15] (West). In contrast, a motor private carrier is
a person, other than a motor carrier, transporting property by motor vehicle when— (A) the transportation is as provided in section 13501 of this title; (B) the person is the owner, lessee, or bailee of the property being transported; and (C) the property is being transported for sale, lease, rent, or bailment or to further a commercial enterprise.
49 U.S.C.A. § 13102(15)(A)-(C) (West). Plaintiff urges the Court to find DTI is a motor private carrier, however, this allegation is not supported by Plaintiff's FAC. In the FAC, Plaintiff does not allege DTI is the "owner, lessee, or bailee of the property being transported." Plaintiff attempts to make alter-ego arguments in its Opposition calling DTI a "shell" company whose legal status should be disregarded, but these allegations are absent from the FAC. (Dkt. No. 38 at 2.) Further, Plaintiff does not cite a single case supporting his contention that a motor carrier registered as such with the Department of Transportation should be treated instead as a motor private carrier because it provides transportation services to sister corporations within the same corporate family. Defendants, however,  [*16] point to Schenley Distillers Corp. v. United States, 326 U.S. 432, 436-37, 66 S. Ct. 247, 90 L. Ed. 181 (1947). In Schenley, the Court held that appellant was not necessarily a private carrier because its "operations were to be performed for its parent and for other corporations owned or controlled by the parent." Id. Plaintiff attempts to distinguish the case at hand from Schenley by arguing the Court also ruled that "corporate entities may be disregarded where they are made the implement for avoiding a clear legislative purpose." Id. at 437. Again, Plaintiff did not make allegations in the FAC to support the contention that DTI was created to avoid a clear legislative purpose.9
Further, Plaintiff has made several concessions in his brief, which demonstrate that DTI is appropriately categorized as a motor carrier. First, Plaintiff concedes, DTI does not deliver its "own goods," but rather delivers dairy products that a different legal entity "manufactures and sells." (Dkt. No. 38 at 2.) Second, Plaintiff acknowledges that Heartland "created DTI to deliver" Heartland's dairy products and DTI does nothing more than "handle deliveries for its sister corporation." (Dkt. No. 38 at 2.) Finally, Plaintiff does not refute the fact that DTI is registered with the Department of Transportation as a motor carrier and not a motor private carrier. (Dkt. No. 38 at 3.) The Court finds that DTI qualifies as a motor carrier.

ii. DTI's claims under sections 226.7, 512 are preempted.
DTI's Motion argues the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act ("FAAAA"), preempts California Labor Code sections 226.7, 512, as well as Wage Order No. 9, as applied to motor carriers. Therefore, according to DTI, it is not required to provide meal and rest breaks to its drivers,  [*18] nor is it subject to any penalties for not providing them. For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees.
It is a basic principle that federal law may preempt state law. Indeed, Article VI of the United States Constitution provides that "the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land." U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. And ever since the Supreme Court's decision in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819), "it has been settled that state law that conflicts with federal law is 'without effect.'" Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S. Ct. 2608, 120 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1992). But when deciding an issue of preemption, a district court must "start[] with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 516. Hence, "the ultimate touchstone" of a court's preemption analysis is congressional intent, id. (internal quotation marks omitted); accordingly, a court should find preemption where congressional intent is either "explicitly stated in the statute's language or implicitly is contained in its structure and purpose," Shaw v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 95, 103 S. Ct. 2890, 77 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1983).  [*19] Nevertheless, a court should not find preemption based merely on "general expressions of 'national policy.'" Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609, 634, 101 S. Ct. 2946, 69 L. Ed. 2d 884 (1981).
In English v. General Electric Co., 496 U.S. 72, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 110 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1990), the Supreme Court identified three ways a federal law might preempt state law: (1) by express preemption, where Congress explicitly defines the extent to which its provisions are intended to preempt state law; (2) by field preemption, where the state law in question regulates activity in a field that Congress intends the federal government to exclusively regulate; and (3) by conflict preemption, where it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law, or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. English, 496 U.S. at 78-79.
Here, DTI asserts that Congress expressly intended the FAAAA to preempt certain state laws (Dkt. No. 35 at 14), and they are correct in their assertion. Indeed, 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1) is unequivocal: "[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of  [*20] any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property." 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1) (emphasis added).10 Therefore, Defendant's motion turns on the answer to the following question: do California Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512, and Wage Order No. 9, when applied to motor carriers, fall within the preemption language of § 14501(c)(1)? In the Court's view, they do indeed.11
In "identify[ing] the domain expressly pre-empted" by a federal statute, a court must "focus first on the statutory language, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress' pre-emptive intent." Dan's City Used Cars Inc. v. Pelkey, 133 S. Ct. 1769, 1778, 185 L. Ed. 2d 909 (2013). As the statutory language here clearly conveys, to be preempted by § 14501(c)(1), a state provision must (1) be "related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property." 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1).12"[T]he key phrase, obviously, is 'relating to.'" Morales, 504 U.S. at 383. And "[t]he ordinary meaning of ['relating to'] is a broad one . . . and the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose."  [*22] Id. Therefore, for preemption, State laws need only "a connection with, or reference to" a motor carrier's "price, route, or service . . . with respect to the transportation of property." See Rowe, 552 U.S. at 370. The Supreme Court has also emphasized that "preemption may occur even if a state law's effect on [prices], routes or services is only indirect," and "it makes no difference whether a state law is consistent or inconsistent with federal regulation." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, "pre-emption occurs at least where state laws have a 'significant impact' related to Congress' deregulatory and pre-emption-related objectives." The Court has described this objective as "helping assure transportation rates, routes, and services that reflect 'maximum reliance on competitive market forces,' thereby stimulating 'efficiency, innovation, and low prices.'" Id. (emphasis added). As the Ninth Circuit has articulated, in borderline cases, "the proper inquiry is whether the provision, directly or indirectly, 'binds the . . . carrier to a particular price, route or service and thereby interferes with competitive market forces within the . . . industry." Am. Trucking Ass'ns v. City of L.A., 660 F.3d 384, 397 (9th Cir. 2011)  [*23] overruled on other grounds by Am. Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. City of L.A., 133 S. Ct. 2096, 186 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2013).
Having articulated the proper lens through which the Court must look for its preemption analysis, the Court will now consider those regulations: California Labor Code section 226.7(a) forbids an "employer [from] requir[ing] any employee to work during any meal or rest period mandated by an applicable order of the Industrial Welfare Commission." Order No. 9-2001, mandated by the Industrial Welfare Commission, applies to all employers and employees in the transportation industry. The order provides, "No employer shall employ any person for a work period of more than five (5) hours without a meal period of not less than 30 minutes." Indus. Welfare Comm'n Order  [*24] No. 9-2001, section 11(A), available at www.dir.ca.gov/IWC/ WageOrders2005/IWCArticle9.html. It also requires employers to "permit all employees to take rest periods, which insofar as practicable shall be in the middle of each work period. The authorized rest period time shall be based on the total hours worked daily at the rate of ten (10) minutes net rest time per four (4) hours." Id. at section 12(A). Moreover, concerning the meal period, the California Supreme Court has recently concluded that a first meal period must be provided "no later than the end of an employee's fifth hour of work, and a second meal period no later than the end of an employee's 10th hour of work." Brinker Rest. Corp. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal. 4th 1004, 1041, 139 Cal. Rptr. 3d 315, 273 P.3d 513 (2012). Nevertheless, the Court noted that, under Order No. 9-2001, depending on the total number of hours worked, an employee may waive a meal period. Indus. Welfare Comm'n Order No. 9-2001, section 11(B).
In its motion, DTI asserts that "complying with California's meal and rest breaks would [significantly] impact DTI's prices, routes, or services thereby rendering those claims preempted by the FAAA[A]." (Dkt. No. 43 at 8.) The Court agrees. As indicated  [*25] above, the laws may be preempted if they have a connection to prices, routes, or services, a significant impact on Congress' deregulatory and preemption-related objectives, see Rowe, 552 U.S. at 371, or "bind[] the . . . carrier to a particular price, route or service and thereby interfere[] with competitive market forces within the . . . industry." Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 660 F.3d at 397. It is undeniable that, pursuant to the regulations, Defendant must provide five separate breaks during a twelve-hour period, and must strive to provide them at specific intervals: a ten-minute break within the first four hours, a thirty-minute meal break within the first five hours, then another ten-minute rest break within the second four-hour period, followed by another thirty-minute meal break between the fifth and tenth hour, and finally another ten-minute rest break within the third four-hour period.
Five separate times, Defendant's drivers must pull their trucks off the road, find a place to park, and then rest or eat without any job-related duties. Not only must the drivers stop hauling cargo for a total of ninety minutes throughout the day, they also are forced to travel only on routes that have  [*26] access to five different locations where they can find a place to park their truck throughout the workday. Common sense dictates that an eighteen-wheeled vehicle cannot simply park on the side of any given road. Consequently, these required meal and rest breaks certainly add a layer of complexity to a motor carrier's schedule planning, undoubtedly limit the number of routes available, and absolutely reduce the total time a driver can possibly be on the road actually hauling cargo. This impact strikes the Court as significant. Indeed, although Defendant's drivers would not be bound to a single route, they would certainly be bound to fewer routes than otherwise, absent the meal and rest break requirements. See Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 660 F.3d at 397. Moreover, the restrictions would also unavoidably impact prices and hinder the full extent of competitive market forces within the transportation industry: Defendant would be unable to select the most efficient routes if they did not accommodate the required breaks, could not deliver cargo as quickly as it could if not bound by the scheduling requirements, and would be at a disadvantage to carriers located near but yet outside of California.  [*27] Accordingly, the Court holds as a matter of law that California Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512, and Wage Order No. 9, as applied to motor carriers, are related to a motor carrier's prices, routes, or services;13 therefore, Plaintiff's claims that are based on those provisions are preempted under 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1). For this reason, the class allegations against DTI are DISMISSED with prejudice.
In coming to this conclusion, the Court is mindful that the Supreme Court has cautioned district courts concerning the scope of preemption by the FAAAA, explaining, "the breadth of the words 'related to' does not mean the sky is the  [*28] limit." Dan's City Used Cars, 133 S. Ct. at 1778. Therefore, the FAAAA's preemption clause should not be read "with an 'uncritical literalism,'" nor should it be ready to "preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and services in only a tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner." See Dan's City Used Cars, 133 S. Ct. at 1778 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, in the Court's view, the state laws at issue here do not affect a motor carrier's prices, routes, or services in merely a tenuous, remote, or peripheral manner; they significantly impact the routes a driver may travel, and reduce the number of miles a driver may possibly travel in a single day. Furthermore, the regulations undoubtedly put California-based motor carriers at a disadvantage as compared with out-of-state carriers who provide services in California.
The Court is not alone in its holding. Defendant points to the court's decision in Dilts v. Penske Logistics LLC, 819 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (S.D. Cal. 2011), whose reasoning several other courts have found persuasive.14(See Dkt. No. 35 at 14.) In Dilts, the court held as a matter of law that California's meal and rest break laws were preempted  [*29] by the FAAAA because they "significantly impact[] the routes or services of [motor] carrier's transportation." Id. at 1120. It explained that "[w]hile the laws do not strictly bind [the defendant's] drivers to one particular route, they have the same effect by depriving them of the ability to take any route that does not offer adequate locations for stopping, or forcing them to take shorter or fewer routes." Id. at 1118. The court also reasoned that California's meal and rest break laws have a significant impact on a motor carrier's services, which the Ninth Circuit has identified as "the frequency and scheduling of transportation, and to the selection of markets to or from which transportation is provided." Id. at 1119 (citing Charas v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 160 F.3d 1259, 1265-66 (9th Cir. 1998)).15 The Dilts court explained that this is because the laws affect the "number of routes each driver[] may go on each day . . . the types of roads [the defendant's] drivers[] may take and the amount of time it takes them to reach their destination." Id. The Court finds this reasoning persuasive.
Plaintiffs attempts to discount the applicability of Dilts to this case. (See Dkt. No. 38 at 8.) They emphasize that Dilts was criticized by Mendez v. RL Carriers, Inc., for failing to analyze the full flexibility California meal and rest break laws offer employers. C 11-2478 CW, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165221, 2012 WL 5868973 *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 19, 2012) certificate of appealability denied, C 11-2478 CW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34945, 2013 WL 1004293 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2013). In Mendez, the court held that the FAAAA does not preempt California's meal and rest break laws because "an employer may comply with section 226.7's rest break requirement by simply paying its employees an additional hour of wages." Id. According to California's Supreme Court, however, "section 226.7 does  [*31] not give employers a lawful choice between providing either meal and rest breaks or an additional hour of pay." Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc., 53 Cal.4th 1244, 1256, 140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 173, 274 P.3d 1160 (2012). The Court held that "an employer's provision of an additional hour of pay does not excuse a section 226.7 violation." Id. The Court finds Plaintiff's other arguments countering preemption equally unavailing. The class allegations against DTI thus are preempted by the FAAA.

2. Plaintiff's Individual Claims against DTI
Plaintiff brings four disability discrimination claims on an individual basis against DTI. (FAC ¶¶ 59-83.) In its Motion, DTI argues Plaintiff has inadequately pled the causes of action and moves to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 34.)

i. Seventh Cause of Action
In the seventh cause of action, Plaintiff has adequately pled a claim for a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), sections 12900 et seq. To bring a claim of disability discrimination under FEHA section 12940(a), Plaintiff must show that "(1) plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) plaintiff is a qualified individual; and (3) plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability."  [*32] Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted); see Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a). DTI argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged the third element. The Court does not agree.
Plaintiff pled he was fired "while he was still on his leave of absence for false and/or trivial reasons, which were merely pretextual." (FAC ¶ 61.) Plaintiff supports this legal conclusion with factual assertions. According to the FAC, DTI did not "follow its progressive discipline policy — or even conduct a fair, impartial, adequate, and thorough investigation." (FAC ¶ 61.) According to Plaintiff "the claimed reason for termination was not even lawful and/or legitimate because Plaintiff was actually entitled to take breaks as a matter of law and, therefore only further evidences pretext." (FAC ¶ 61.) The Court has determined that the California meal and rest break laws are preempted by the FAAAA, but this does not dispose of Plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff still may have been discriminated against for his disability, and the references to his meal and rest breaks may have been purely pretextual.
Plaintiff has adequately pled disability discrimination  [*33] by the alleging that standard procedures were not followed and he was only terminated once he required disability leave.
DTI's motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action is DENIED in part. DTI's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part as Plaintiff's claim for emotion distress is no longer actionable and must be dismissed.16

ii. Eighth Cause of Action
In the eighth cause of action, Plaintiff has adequately pled that DTI violated FEHA by refusing to provide him with a reasonable accommodation after he became disabled in violation of section 12940(m). To do so, Plaintiff  [*34] must identify a "specific, available reasonable accommodation that the employer could have provided but did not." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1017, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). DTI argues "Plaintiff's own Complaint pleads himself out of these claims because the reasonable accommodation he claims would have accommodated his disability was the exact accommodation he also alleges DTI offered: a leave of absence." (Dkt. No. 35 at 18.) The Court does not agree.
Plaintiff does allege he requested and ultimately received a leave of absence (FAC ¶¶ 67-68.); however, Plaintiff also alleges he was unlawfully terminated while on said disability leave. Therefore he was deprived of a reasonable accommodation. (See FAC ¶ 68) ("Defendant did not ultimately provide the accommodation requested (a leave of absence) because it terminated Plaintiff while he was still on leave without talking to him at all about his disability status or ability to return to work.") Next, DTI argues an employer's duty to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee "does  [*35] not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-27, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, (Ct. App. 1999). Plaintiff alleges that his disability leave was not supposed to last indefinitely; rather he "had provided DTI with a date for his return." (FAC ¶ 68.) Plaintiff avers he was on leave for five months. See, Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parentals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 649 (1st Cir. 2000) (leave of absence of one year or more can be reasonable).
DTI's motion to dismiss the eighth cause of action is DENIED in part. DTI's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part as Plaintiff's claim for emotional distress is no longer actionable and must be dismissed.

iii. Ninth Cause of Action
In the ninth cause of action, Plaintiff has adequately pled that DTI failed to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA section 12940(n). Accordingly, "it is unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good-faith interactive process with a disabled employee to determine if a reasonable accommodation exists." Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(n).
Plaintiff alleges DTI did not explore alternatives for him, such as a desk  [*36] job or part time employment. (FAC ¶ 75). According to Plaintiff, DTI instructed him to accept a leave of absence or nothing, and subsequently was unlawfully terminated while on said leave of absence. (FAC ¶ 75.) Plaintiff argues the termination caused a breakdown in whatever interactive process there had been. See e.g., Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 989, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (Ct. App. 2008) ("decision to terminate [plaintiff] without advance warning or further discussion was unreasonable and caused a breakdown in the interactive process, i.e., because it was unreasonable for [defendant] to determine unilaterally that [plaintiff] could not perform any available vacant position and would not be able to do so in the foreseeable future.") Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process.
DTI's motion to dismiss the ninth cause of action is DENIED in part. DTI's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part as Plaintiff's claim for emotional distress is no longer actionable and must be dismissed.

iv. Tenth Cause of Action
In the tenth cause of action, Plaintiff alleges DTI violated public policy and committed the tort of wrongful termination.  [*37] (FAC ¶ 81.) Plaintiff predicates his claim on DTI's violations of FEHA sections 12940(a), (m), and (n), which are pled in the seventh, eight, and ninth causes of action. (FAC ¶ 80.) Plaintiff alleges DTI terminated him because of his disability, failed to accommodate him, and failed to engage in the interactive process. (FAC ¶ 80.) Because Plaintiff has stated a claim for relief in the seventh, eight, and ninth causes of action, the Court finds he has stated a claim for relief in the tenth cause of action. Plaintiff has adequately pled the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.
DTI's motion to dismiss the tenth cause of action is DENIED in part. DTI's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part: (1) Plaintiff's claim for emotional distress is no longer actionable and must be dismissed; and (2) Plaintiff's claims that DTI violated public policy for violating California Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512 are dismissed because of FAAAA preemption.
DTI's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part with regards to the class allegations of California's meal and rest break law violations and DENIED in part with regards to the individual allegations of disability discrimination.

C. Heartland  [*38] Motion to Dismiss
Plaintiff brings class allegations against Heartland. (FAC ¶¶ 22-58.) In its Motion, Heartland argues that as a non-existing legal entity lacks the capacity to be sued. It also accuses Plaintiff of engaging in undifferentiated pleading. (Dkt. No. 33.)

1. Capacity to be Sued
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b)(3), whether a limited liability company ("LLC") has the capacity to be sued is determined by "the law of the state in which the district court is located." Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(b)(3). The federal court must follow the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits. Paracor Fin., Inc. v. GE Capital Corp., 96 F.3d 1151, 1164 (9th Cir.1996). Under California law, "[t]he laws of the state or foreign country under which a foreign limited liability company is organized shall govern its organization and internal affairs and the liability and authority of its managers and members." Cal. Corp. Code § 17450; see CM Record Corp. v. MCA Records, Inc., 168 Cal. App. 3d 965, 967, 214 Cal. Rptr. 409 (Ct. App. 1985).
According to governing Delaware law, Heartland lacks the capacity to be sued. Heartland was a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on April 27,  [*39] 2009. (Dkt. No. 36, Ex. 2 at 10.) Subsequent to this, on January 1, 2013, Heartland merged with Alta-Dena. (Dkt. No. 36, Ex. 1 at 7.) According to the agreement, the surviving limited liability company is "Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, LLC." (Dkt. No. 36, Ex. 1 at 7.) Under Delaware law,
all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity . . .
Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-209(g) (West). Plaintiff did not file his Complaint until February 28, 2013 at which point Heartland had ceased to be a separate corporate legal entity.17 Heartland cannot be sued in its pre-merger form.
Heartland's Motion is GRANTED in part. All claims against Heartland are DISMISSED with prejudice.

2. Undifferentiated Pleading
Heartland also argues there is undifferentiated pleading with regard to the class allegations. Rule 8(a)(2) requires that plaintiffs allege the basis of their claim as to each defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); Gauvin v. Trombatore, 682 F. Supp. 1067, 1071 (N.D. Cal. 1988). The Court finds that pleading is sufficient to put the remaining Defendants on notice as to the allegations against them.18 Heartland challenges Plaintiff's use of the plural "Defendants," arguing that Plaintiff has not provided each party adequate notice as to the allegations against  [*41] them. Though Plaintiff uses the plural "Defendants" in his allegations, it is apparent he is alleging DTI, Heartland,19 and SBM "had a corporate policy and/or practice that did not permit 'drivers' (such as Plaintiff) to take meal and/or rest breaks." (FAC ¶¶ 3, 8, 9, 13.) After listing the dates Plaintiff worked for each Defendant, Plaintiff states "all of Defendants' drivers had the same duties- delivering Defendants' products within the state of California. While the corporate entity employing Plaintiff changed, Plaintiff's duties did not." (FAC ¶ 3.) While the class members are unidentified, they are readily identifiable. Heartland's request that the Court dismiss the FAC in its entirety with prejudice because of undifferentiated pleading is DENIED.
Heartland's Motion is GRANTED in part with regards to its dismissal from the action, but DENIED in part with regards to the dismissal of the FAC in its entirety.

V. Motion to Substitute Plaintiff

A. Legal Standard
According to Rule 25, "[a] motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent's successor or representative." Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1). If a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, a court may order substitution of a party. Id. However, "[i]f the motion [for substitution] is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent must be dismissed." Id.

B. Discussion
The moving party bears the burden to demonstrate they are the proper party for substitution under Rule 25. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25. Ms. Parker argues "she is the successor in interest to all of the causes of action in this case because they are claims regarding [Plaintiff's] wages (i.e., wrongful termination, meal/rest breaks, overtime, etc.) and, thus, community property." (Dkt. No. 55); See Cal. Prob. Code § 6401(a). In California, there is a general presumption that property acquired during marriage by either  [*43] spouse is community property unless traceable to a separate property source. In re Marriage of Rossin, 172 Cal. App. 4th 725, 731, 91 Cal. Rptr. 3d 427 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing Cal. Fam. Code § 760). The intestate share of the surviving spouse is the one-half of the community property that belongs to the decedent under California Probate Code section 100. Cal. Prob. Code § 6401 (West). Determining whether Ms. Parker is the appropriate successor in interest is complicated by the couple's impending divorce proceedings.
In April of 2011, Ms. Parker filed for divorce and moved out of their share residence. The potential earnings in dispute for the Motion to Substitute are those connected to Plaintiff's individual disability discrimination claims.20 Plaintiff was not injured on the job until November 2011, and he was not terminated from his position until March 2012. (FAC ¶ 20.) The couple's divorce was never finalized, but they may have been "separated" under California law. After a couple decides "to liv[e] separate and apart from the other spouse" their earnings and accumulations are considered separate property. Cal. Fam. Code § 771(a) (West); see In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th 1152, 1158, 126 Cal. Rptr. 2d 148 (Ct. App. 2002).  [*44] If separated, Plaintiff's claim for wages after the date of separation would no longer be considered community property and Ms. Parker's interest would be decreased significantly. Under California Probate Code section 6401, separate property of a decedent who dies intestate is divided among the surviving spouse and the decedent's children. Cal. Prob. Code § 6401(c)(3)(A) (West). Ms. Parker would be entitled to "[o]ne-third of the intestate estate" because the decedent had three children. Id. As such, the issue of "separation" will be determinative of whether Ms. Parker is the proper successor in interest. The Court will examine whether the couple was separated.

1. Definition of "Separated"
Although it is a critical factor in determining property rights, "the Legislature has neither defined 'date of separation' nor specified a standard for determining it." In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1158. California Family Code section 771 provides, "'[t]he earnings and accumulations of a spouse,... while living separate and apart from the other spouse, are the separate property of the spouse.'" Id. (quoting In re Marriage of Hardin, 38 Cal. App. 4th 448, 450-51, 45 Cal. Rptr. 2d 308 (Ct. App. 1995). The phrase "living separate and apart is itself a term of art." In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1158 (quoting 1 Kirkland et al., Cal. Family Law: Practice and Procedure (2nd ed. 2002) Characterization  [*46] Division in General § 20.06[2][a] at 20-21) (internal quotation marks omitted). Case law has established that "'living separate and apart' ... means that the parties' physical separation is the result of a breakdown in the marital relationship." In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1158 (internal quotation marks omitted).
California state courts have established two relevant factors as prerequisites to separation. "First, at least one spouse must entertain the subjective intent to end the marriage; second, there must be objective evidence of conduct furthering that intent." Id.; see also In re Marriage of Manfer, 144 Cal. App. 4th 925, 930, 50 Cal. Rptr. 3d 785 (Ct. App. 2006) ("[T]he date of separation . . . occurs when either of the parties does not intend to resume the marriage and his or her actions bespeak the finality of the marital relationship.")
Courts have assessed intent and conduct to determine when the date of separation occurs. See In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1159 (2002) ("The ultimate test is the parties' subjective intent and all evidence relating to it is to be objectively considered by the court.")

i. Intent
"As noted above, the first prerequisite to separation  [*47] is subjective intent. All factors bearing on either party's intentions to return or not to return to the other spouse are to be considered." Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); see also In re Marriage of Hardin, 38 Cal. App. 4th at 452. On April 21, 2011, Ms. Parker filed papers requesting the dissolution of marriage, satisfying the intent requirement. (Dkt. No. 58 at 58-61.) The couple then became embroiled in a custody dispute lasting until at least August 2012, thereby demonstrating a continued intent for dissolution.

ii. Conduct
The fact that the couple filed to divorce in April 2011, and began living separately is not entirely dispositive. "The ultimate question to be decided in determining the date of separation is whether either or both of the parties perceived the rift in their relationship as final. The best evidence of this is their words and actions." In re Marriage of Manfer, 144 Cal. App. 4th at 930 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted); see also In re Marriage of Baragry, 73 Cal. App. 3d 444, 448, 140 Cal. Rptr. 779 (Ct. App. 1977) ("The real dispute in this case is "whether the parties' conduct evidences a complete and final break in the marital relationship.")  [*48] Courts have focused on the disputed time of separation and assessed relevant evidence of conduct. See In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1159.

a. Timing
"[S]eparation cannot occur until intent and conduct are present simultaneously." In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1160. On April 21, 2011, Ms. Parker filed a petition for dissolution of marriage. (Dkt. No. 58 at 58.) In an accompanying declaration to the dissolution papers filed on April 26, 2011, Ms. Parker stated, "[Plaintiff] and I separated on April 6, 2011 when I moved out of the family residence. [Plaintiff] has anger issues and I could no longer handle his out of control rages." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) By April 26, 2011, Ms. Parker had evidently moved out of the residence. Further, Ms. Parker's declaration expressed intent to remain apart. She stated, "I am currently residing with my parents but wish to get my own place for me and my son." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) This suggests she did not plan to reconcile. Additionally, in her declaration, Ms. Parker provides evidence that the couple no longer commingled funds as of April 26, 2011. Ms. Parker stated, "[o]n April 7, 2011,  [*49] [Plaintiff] called me and informed me he had reported our bank card stolen and if I use it I will be arrested. He also informed me he had also changed the password on the card." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) Finally, Ms. Parker provided evidence on April 26, 2011, showing that the situation had become acrimonious, signifying a final break in the marriage. Ms. Parker claimed, "[Plaintiff] has changed the locks on the residence and refuses to allow me and my family to pick up my items. I further request that [Plaintiff] nor his current girlfriend be at the residence during me retrieving my items." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) She added, "I am on felony probation for embezzlement and [Plaintiff] keeps threatening that he will make sure I violate my probation and be arrested." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) Whether or not Plaintiff changed the locks, had a girlfriend, or tried to get Ms. Parker's probation violated is not important. Ms. Parker's statements indicate that by April 26, 2011, the couple had reached a point where they were physically and emotionally separated, and were not working towards reconciliation.
On April 26, 2011, the couple filed a joint stipulation  [*50] regarding custody for their child. Accordingly, Plaintiff was instructed not to "dispose of or cause harm to any of the many separate property items owned by [Ms. Parker] currently located at the marital home." (Dkt. No. 58, Jt. Stip. at 56.) Plaintiff was also instructed to "avoid confusion as to which items are claimed as separate property items" and to preserve and protect "any community property items in his possession." (Dkt. No. 58, Jt. Stip. at 56.)

b. Evidence of Requisite Conduct
Ms. Parker argues that the Court should not wholly rely on the sworn testimony of the divorce proceedings, essentially arguing, "actions speak louder than words." In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1160 (internal quotation marks omitted). In an attempt to provide evidence of reconciliation, however, Ms. Parker provides insufficient evidence. In conjunction with her Reply and OSC, Ms. Parker filed contradictory declarations and inconclusive pieces of evidence.21
In a supplemental declaration attached to the Reply, Ms. Parker claims "[b]y approximately February 2012 we agreed to reconcile and later returned to sharing a residence. At no time did I intend to permanently separate." (Dkt. No. 59-1, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 2.) Additionally, Ms. Parker claims, "during all of 2012, we socialized as a couple. We had dinner together, took trips (such as taking our son to Disneyland), went to museums, and attended social events as a couple (including his work functions at the time)." (Dkt. No. 67, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 3.) In addition to being contradictory to sworn statements in the divorce record, there no supportive evidence to show there was a reconciliation much less a congenial relationship between Ms. Parker and Plaintiff.
In December of 2011,  [*53] Ms. Parker filed an application to limit Plaintiff's custodial time with their child in which she expressed concerns that Plaintiff's ex-wife was spending time with her son. (Dkt. No. 61, Cari Parker Decl. at 66.) Ms. Parker claims the couple had begun reconciling during this time; however her application to limit Plaintiff's custody with their son was still pending in April 2012. (Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B at 34-36.) Further, according to the state court records, Mr. and Ms. Parker continued to engage in a custody battle until at least May 2012 when they filed a joint stipulation for a visitation plan. (Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B. at 21.) In August 2012, the state court discussed the visitation schedule that was in place, providing Plaintiff with visitation rights on the "1st, 3rd, and 5th weekends of the month from Saturday 9 am to Sunday 5 pm." (Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B at 16-20.) By May of 2013, the court records maintain that the two parties had separate residences.22(Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B at 4.) The state court records clearly demonstrate continued intent to dissolve the relationship and enduring physical separation.
Ms. Parker cites to case law holding that physical separation is not dispositive of "living separate and apart." The cases cited by Ms. Parker, however, are inapposite to the current situation. The couples had generally carried on as married couples though they lived apart, and they had not endured such a decisive break as is present here. See In re Marriage of Norviel, 102 Cal. App. 4th at 1161-62 ("[I]n each of those cases, the court concluded that the parties had not separated within the meaning of the statute, despite living in separate residences.") In re Marriage of Marsden, the couple sought the help of a marriage counselor, traveled together, spent holidays as a family, and ultimately restored a shared residence. 130 Cal. App. 3d 426, 435, 181 Cal. Rptr. 910 (Ct. App. 1982). Marsden relied on In re Marriage of Baragry in making its ruling, which held "[d]uring the period that  [*55] spouses preserve the appearance of marriage, they both reap its benefits, and their earnings remain community property." 73 Cal. App. 3d at 449. In Baragry, the wife of twenty-years continued to do her husband's laundry and attend social engagements as a couple. Id. Meanwhile, the husband lived apart with his girlfriend. Id. Finally, in In re Marriage of von der Nuell, though the parties lived apart the "husband maintained close contact with his wife including frequent visits to the home, taking his wife on vacations, going out socially, and sending cards and gifts on special occasions and holidays." 23 Cal. App. 4th 730, 733, 28 Cal. Rptr. 2d 447 (Ct. App. 1994). Throughout the period before final separation, the couple maintained joint checking accounts and credit cards, and considered consulting a marriage counselor. Id.
Ms. Parker attempts to provide financial information to show that the couple comingled funds though they were living apart. This is inconclusive as well. In 2012, the couple filed a joint tax return and financed a car together. (See Dkt. No. 67 at 14.) Ms. Parker noted in her declaration dated April 26, 2011, that she was not given authorization to use Plaintiff's bank account. (Dkt.  [*56] No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) Importantly, she was unable to obtain employment "due to the terms of [her] probation which mandate[d] that [she] participate in work release." (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.) In light of the fact that the couple had continued to live separately and engage in a contentious custody battle, it is unclear how this evidence demonstrates a move toward reconciliation. The inference from the financial assistance is unclear. Plaintiff may have provided financial support relating to the car because of the shared custody of their son. According to Ms. Parker, she "only received $533.00 in cash and $349.00 in food stamps" per month. (Dkt. No. 58, Cari Parker Decl. ¶ 6.)
Finally, Ms. Parker provides a lease agreement for 15434 Sequoia Road #35, Hesperia, CA 92345, which was to be occupied by the following listed individuals "Cari Parker, Scott Parker, and Jayden Parker." Both parties signed the agreement on April 12, 2013, for one year lease beginning in April 2013. (Dkt. No. 67 at 8.) If anything, this lease agreement shows that the couple reconciled sometime in late 2012 or 2013. Assuming the couple did reconcile in April 2013, the claims arising from April  [*57] 2011 until April 2013 would be Plaintiff's separate property. Ms. Parker would have at best a minority interest in the disposal of that property. (Dkt. No. 64 at 6.) The Court finds that Ms. Parker has not met her burden to prove she is the proper successor in interest.
The Court denies Plaintiff's Motion to Substitute, and provides leave to file a Motion to Substitute Plaintiff after identifying the proper successor(s) in interest. The Motion must be filed by November 4, 2013.

VI. Conclusion
In light of the foregoing, the Court orders the following:
(1) DTI's Motion (Dkt. No. 34) is GRANTED as follows:
