CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (IN CHAMBERS): ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS [33]
Before the Court is Defendant the Regents of the University of California's ("the Defendant") Motion to Dismiss ("Motion" or "Mot.") (Dkt. 33). The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; C.D. Cal. R. 7-15. Having reviewed the moving papers submitted by the parties, the Court GRANTS the Motion and VACATES the hearing scheduled for June 27, 2022.

I. Background

i. Facts
Plaintiff Noah Aria Saeedy ("Plaintiff") matriculated at the University of California, Irvine ("UCI") in 2007 to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. First Amended Complaint ("FAC") (Dkt. 32) ¶ 5. Prior to matriculation, Plaintiff [*2]  was diagnosed with Dyscalculia, which is a disorder that affects 3-6% of the population and manifests as difficulty in performing mathematical calculations Id. ¶¶ 6, 8. Dyscalculia does not affect other cognitive abilities. Id. ¶ 6.
In 2007, Plaintiff approached disability services and was told by the Director that she did not believe Dyscalculia was a disabling condition. Id. ¶ 7. In 2008, Plaintiff provided Defendant with a report, which demonstrated Plaintiff performed mathematics at about a fourth-grade level. Id. ¶ 8.
The Order granting the previous Motion to Dismiss ("Order") (Dkt. 30) found that the initial Complaint ("Compl.") (Dkt. 1-1) "alleged [Plaintiff] requested, and was continually denied, waiving the departmental mathematics requirement as a reasonable accommodation." Order at 2.
According to the FAC, "on October 6, 2017[,] Mr. Saeedy was first provided with written correspondence by the Dean of the School of Social Sciences which served as a written denial of the requested accommodation, but which 'instructed' Plaintiff to pursue the interactive process by inquiring into 'appropriate equivalents to the required math course'" FAC ¶ 13. The initial Complaint did not mention [*3]  this correspondence on October 6, 2017. October was only mentioned in reference to the emails described in the following paragraph. Compl. ¶ 23.
Plaintiff alleges that on October 6, 2017, "then-Associate Dean Mark Petracca wrote an email to then-Dean William Mauer that Plaintiff was the 'kid who claims to be the bastard grandson of the former Shah of Iran,' to which then-Dean William Mauer responded in a denigrating manner and ended with 'let's just hope he leaves us alone.'" FAC ¶ 26. This claim was also included in the initial Complaint. Compl. ¶ 23.
Plaintiff was again denied waiver on April 30, 2018 in a meeting with the Department of Humanities. FAC ¶ 14. Plaintiff has completed all other degree requirements, except the departmental mathematics requirement. Id. ¶ 15. Plaintiff is still enrolled at UCI. Id. ¶ 16.

ii. Procedural History
On April 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in Orange County Superior Court alleging that Defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act § 12131, et seq. and California Education Code § 220. See generally, Compl. Defendant then removed the action on November 19, 2021. Notice of Removal (Dkt. 1).
On December 17, 2021, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss ("First Motion") (Dkts. 11, 21), which Plaintiff opposed (Dkt. 21) [*4]  on March 7, 2022. Defendant then replied on March 14, 2022 (Dkt. 22). This Motion to Dismiss was granted on April 12, 2022.
Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint on April 22, 2022. Defendants subsequently filed this current Motion to Dismiss on May 6, 2022. Plaintiff filed their Opposition ("Opp'n") (Dkt. 37) on May 20, 2022. Defendant did not file a reply.

II. Legal Standard

A. Motion to Dismiss
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must be dismissed when a plaintiff's allegations fail to set forth a set of facts that, if true, would entitle the complainant to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (holding that a claim must be facially plausible in order to survive a motion to dismiss). The pleadings must raise the right to relief beyond the speculative level; a plaintiff must provide "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)). On a motion to dismiss, a court accepts as true a plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and construes all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008). A court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, review is ordinarily [*5]  limited to the contents of the complaint and material properly submitted with the complaint. Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2002); Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990). Under the incorporation by reference doctrine, the court may also consider documents "whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading." Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). The court may treat such a document as "part of the complaint, and thus may assume that its contents are true for purposes of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)." United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003).
When a motion to dismiss is granted, the court must decide whether to grant leave to amend. The Ninth Circuit has a liberal policy favoring amendments, and thus leave to amend should be freely granted. See, e.g., DeSoto v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 957 F.2d 655, 658 (9th Cir. 1992). However, a court need not grant leave to amend when permitting a plaintiff to amend would be an exercise in futility. See, e.g., Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 729, 738 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding "[d]enial of leave to amend is not an abuse of discretion where the pleadings before the court demonstrate that further amendment would be futile.").

B. Supplemental Jurisdiction
28 U.S.C.A. § 1367(c)(3) provides that a district court may decline to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims if the court has dismissed all claims over which it [*6]  has original jurisdiction. Although the district court may retain jurisdiction over the state-law claims remaining after a dismissal, especially where judicial resources have been expended, in the usual case in which all federal law claims are eliminated before trial, the factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity weigh in favor of declining supplemental jurisdiction. Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988).
The Ninth Circuit has affirmed that this Court may decline jurisdiction and dismiss without prejudice state law claims "[w]here [the] district court dismisses a federal claim, leaving only state claims for resolution . . . ." Wade v. Reg'l Credit Assn., 87 F.3d 1098, 1101 (9th Cir. 1996).

III. Discussion
Plaintiff alleges the Defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") § 12131, et seq. and California Education Code § 220. See generally FAC.
Defendant argues (1) both claims are time barred and the "law of the case" doctrine precludes the Court from reexamining the issue of accrual; (2) waiving the math requirement is an unreasonable accommodation that would fundamentally alter its program standards; and (3) Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for both causes of action. See generally Mot.
On the other hand, Plaintiff argues that (1) both claims are timely, and Defendant misconstrues the "law of the case" [*7]  doctrine; (2) waiving the math requirement is an affirmative defense not appropriate for a motion to dismiss; and (3) Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a cause of action for both claims. See generally Opp'n.
First, the Court will determine whether Plaintiff's claims are time barred by the relevant statute of limitations.

A. Plaintiff's ADA Claim
The Order granting the previous Motion to Dismiss found the initial complaint alleged Plaintiff was first denied his request for accommodation in 2008. Order at 4-5. However, Plaintiff argues his allegations in the FAC create a factual issue and/or create the inference that the interactive process was ongoing; therefore, Plaintiff argues accrual began on April 30, 2018, when Plaintiff met with the Department of Humanities. Opp'n at 6-9.

i. The "Law of the Case" Doctrine Does Not Bar This Court from Determining the Date of Accrual
Defendant argues the "law of the case" doctrine precludes this Court from reexamining time of accrual for the ADA claim. Mot. at 8-9. Defendant therefore argues the Court's previous finding that the ADA claim accrued in 2008 bars this claim. Id. Plaintiff contends that Defendant misconstrues "the law of the case" doctrine [*8]  and that the FAC is now the only operative pleading such that the Court must reexamine the new allegations. Opp'n at 13.
The "law of the case" doctrine generally bars courts from "reconsidering an issue that has already been decided by the same court or a higher court in the same case." Mendenhall v. National Transp Safety Bd, 213 F.3d 464, 469 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir. 1997)). The court may reconsider, "the law of the case when (1) the first decision was clearly erroneous; (2) an intervening change in the law has occurred, (3) the evidence on remand is substantially different, (4) other changed circumstances exist, or (5) a manifest injustice would otherwise result." Id.
After examining the initial Complaint, the Court previously held that the ADA claim accrued in 2008; however, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the FAC is currently the only operative pleading. According to the FAC, Plaintiff's communications with UCI disability services in January of 2008 initiated the interactive process to explore alternatives to the math requirement. FAC ¶ 8. Plaintiff received written correspondence from an UCI employee in October of 2009, stating "the issue remain[ed] pending and unresolved." Id. ¶ 10. Throughout 2010 to 2017, communications surrounding accommodation continued [*9]  and Dr. Ceasar Sereseres, the Assistant Dean at the time, represented in writing there was still potential for waiver on May 6, 2017. Id. ¶¶ 12-13.
The FAC further alleges Plaintiff first received written denial of his request for accommodation on October 6, 2017 by the Dean of the School of Social Sciences. Id. ¶ 13. This denial also "instructed" Plaintiff "to pursue the interactive process" of looking for appropriate alternatives. Id. Plaintiff argues he relied on the representation that appropriate alternatives might be identified, claiming to believe interactive process was ongoing. Id. On April 30, 2018, Plaintiff had a meeting with the Department of Humanities where he was again advised there was no "appropriate equivalents," and the math requirement would not be waived. Id. ¶ 14.
Accordingly, the FAC, and the new facts therein, constitute "changed circumstances," which the Court must examine in the context of accrual.

ii. The ADA Claim Accrued in October of 2017
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's ADA claim accrued in 2006, at the earliest, and October 6, 2017, at the latest. Mot. at 9-10. Defendant claims the letter from October 6, 2017 shows "Plaintiff was repeatedly advised that [*10]  the math requirement would not be waived." Id. Plaintiff argues the claim did not accrue until April 30, 2018, when the interactive process ended. Opp'n at 6-9. In the alternative, Plaintiff claims his allegations are sufficient to create factual issues as to if the Regents truly denied his request for an accommodation in 2008. Id.
The statute of limitations to bring an ADA claim is three years. See Sharkey v. O'Neal, 778 F.3d 767, 773 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that the statute of limitations for claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 is generally three years). In the Ninth Circuit, "an act must be 'discrete' or 'independently wrongful' to cause a new claim to accrue. If the act is merely the 'delayed, but inevitable, consequence' of a prior discriminatory act, it will not cause a new statute of limitations to run." Ervine v. Desert View Reg'l Med. Ctr. Holdings, LLC, 753 F.3d 862, 870 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal citation omitted). "Under federal law, a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action." Knox v. Davis, 260 F.3d 1009, 1013 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
Examining the initial Complaint, the Court previously held the ADA claim had accrued in 2008 because "Plaintiff first engaged in the interactive process by requesting the departmental mathematics requirement be waived in 2008 and continued [*11]  to make the same request for approximately thirteen years." Order at 5.
However, in accepting the new facts in FAC as true, the Court now finds the ADA claim accrued in 2017, but is still barred by the statute of limitations. Here, Plaintiff "was first provided with written denial of the requested accommodation by the Dean of the School of Social Sciences on October 6, 2017." FAC ¶ 13. Thus, it is evident Plaintiff had reason to know the basis of this action since October 6, 2017. This makes the initial filing of this action on April 22, 2021 beyond the three-year statute of limitations. Plaintiff's claim that he was invited to procure "appropriate equivalents" for his math requirement, Opp'n at 12, does not overcome the clear denial of his request for accommodations.
The Court finds Plaintiff's ADA claim accrued on October 6, 2017 and is, therefore, time barred by the statute of limitations, assuming equitable estoppel does not apply. The Court will now address the issue of equitable estoppel based on the FAC.

iii. Equitable Estoppel Does Not Apply
Previously, "Plaintiff argue[d] that meeting with the Defendant's representatives in April 2018 'provide[d] a sufficient basis to equitably [*12]  estop [Defendant] from arguing' the statute of limitations ha[d] long passed." Order at 5.
Plaintiff argues that his reliance on "written communication in October of 2017 which instructed him to look into appropriate equivalents" equitably estops Defendant from arguing the statute of limitations has passed. Opp'n at 12. On the other hand, Defendant argues that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable because Plaintiff has not adequately pled that Defendant made any affirmative misrepresentations. Mot. at 12. They further claim agents of Defendant specifically told Plaintiff the math requirement would not be waived and outlined alternative courses to the math course at issue in this case. Id.
The traditional elements of equitable estoppel are: "(1) the party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended; (3) the latter must be ignorant of the true facts; and (4) he must rely on the former's conduct to his injury." Gabriel v. Alaska Elec. Pension Fund, 773 F.3d 945, 955 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Greany v. W. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 973 F.2d 812, 821 (9th Cir. 1992)).
The Court previously held the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply because the initial Complaint did not adequately [*13]  allege affirmative misrepresentations or reasonable reliance. Order at 6. Specifically, the Court found the "Complaint simply state[d] that Defendant 'consistently' denied Plaintiff's request for accommodation since 2008" and that "[t]his bare factual statement alone does not support a finding that Plaintiff reasonably relied on the waiver being granted." Id.
Based on the FAC, the Court concludes equitable estoppel still does not apply. Plaintiff has failed to allege the elements of estoppel. Even after amending the initial Complaint, there is nothing in the FAC suggesting the Defendant would waive the math requirement. The October 6, 2017 written correspondence between Plaintiff and the Dean of Social Sciences specifically states, "on October 6, 2017 Mr. Saeedy was first provided with written correspondence by the Dean of the School of Social Sciences which served as a written denial of the requested accommodation." FAC ¶ 13. There was also no "conduct" by Defendant that could be interpreted to suggests that waiver was still possible. Plaintiff claims Defendant "continu[ed] to engaged in the interactive process[,]" yet fails to allege any factual support. The claim of "back-and-forth [*14]  communications" is not accompanied by any further explanation of fact and suggests no reason to assume the previous denial is not definitive. Id. Moreover, any communications made after Defendant explicitly denied Plaintiff's waiver request should be read in the context of that denial. Thus, it is unreasonable to interpret the mere instruction to "pursue the interactive process by inquiring into 'appropriate equivalents'" to suggest that waiver of the math requirement was still possible. Opp'n 2-3. Instead, the reasonable interpretation is that because the request for waiver was denied, Defendant was instructing Plaintiff to find another math course as an appropriate substitute. Accordingly, the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply based on the amended pleadings in the FAC.

B. Declining Supplemental Jurisdiction of Cal. Ed. Code § 220
Because the Court dismisses the only federal claim, the Court declines to grant supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining state law claim and dismisses the claim without prejudice. Wade v. Reg'l Credit Assn., 87 F.3d 1098, 1101 (9th Cir. 1996).
Therefore, because equitable estoppel does not apply and Plaintiff has surpassed the statute of limitations, the Court grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff here [*15]  does not demonstrate that filing another amended complaint would allege different or improved facts. Orion Tire Corp. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 268 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir. 2001). Since amending the pleadings would be futile at this stage, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's Complaint.

IV. Disposition
For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE Plaintiff's claims.
The hearing scheduled for June 27, 2022, is VACATED.
The Clerk shall serve this minute order on the parties.
