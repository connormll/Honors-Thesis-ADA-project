MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court on a Motion to Dismiss filed by Peachtree Hospice of Georgia, LLC d/b/a BridgeWay Hospice ("BridgeWay"). [Doc. 8]. For the reasons provided below, the Court RECOMMENDS that said motion be DENIED.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND1
Plaintiff has Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ("POTS") and Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia ("IST"), cardiac conditions that she alleges, without explanation, "cause substantial limitations in one or more major life activities." [Doc. 6, pp. 3, 5, ¶¶10, 20]. BridgeWay hired Plaintiff as a Registered Nurse Case Manager on August 29, 2017. [Id. p. 4, ¶15]. Plaintiff told her supervisor, [*2]  Carol Peters, and BridgeWay's Chief Executive Officer, Barbara Rasmussen, of her conditions when she was hired. [Id. pp. 4-5, ¶¶17-18, 21].
Within two-and-a-half months of being hired, Plaintiff "collapsed while at home and was taken to the emergency room." [Id. p. 6, ¶29]. Plaintiff was placed on bed-rest until she could attend a follow-up appointment with her heart surgeon. [Id. ¶30]. Plaintiff informed her supervisor of her need for medical leave and "contacted BridgeWay every day" during the ten days between her medical incident and her appointment with the heart surgeon. [Id. pp. 6-7, ¶¶31-32]. Plaintiff told her supervisor and BridgeWay's human-resources director that she might need to use short-term disability ("STD"), but "that she would not take more leave than provided by BridgeWay's STD policy which was either 11 or 13 weeks, because she could not afford to be out of work." [Id. p. 7, ¶¶34-35].
During her appointment with a heart surgeon on November 20, 2017, Plaintiff was told "that he would need to see her again in two weeks to determine the next steps in her treatment." [Id. ¶38]. The surgeon also stated that he planned to take "a conservative approach and hoped that she [*3]  could be released in two weeks." [Id. p. 8, ¶40]. If that approach did not work, Plaintiff would need to undergo surgery, which would have required her to be "out an additional two weeks for recovery." [Id. ¶¶41-42]. Plaintiff shared all this information with her supervisor and BridgeWay's human-resources director. [Id. ¶43]. That same day, Plaintiff provided BridgeWay with STD paperwork in which she stated that the date she expected to return to work was "unknown." [Id. ¶44]; see also [Doc. 8-1, p. 2].
According to Plaintiff, she did not tell anyone at BridgeWay "that she would need medical leave indefinitely," and she told BridgeWay that "she planned to return much sooner" than the 11 to 13 weeks allowed under the STD policy. See [Doc. 6, pp. 8-9, ¶¶47-49]. Nevertheless, after Plaintiff's communications with BridgeWay regarding her doctor's appointment and leave request, BridgeWay's human-resources director contacted Plaintiff and "terminated her employment for allegedly violating BridgeWay's attendance policy." [Id. p. 8, ¶46].

LEGAL STANDARD
When deciding whether to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes [*4]  them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Speaker, 623 F.3d at 1379. A complaint fails to state a claim when the facts as pled do not state a claim that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Because the purpose of Rule 8(a) is to provide notice to the defendants of the nature of the claims and the grounds on which those claims rest, pleadings are given a liberal reading when addressing a motion to dismiss. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
In order to state a plausible claim, a plaintiff need only plead "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "[W]hile notice pleading may not require that the pleader allege a specific fact to cover every element or allege with precision each element of a claim, it is still necessary that a complaint contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory." Fin. Sec. Assur., Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., 500 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal quotations omitted). "[C]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002).

LEGAL ANALYSIS
Based on the above factual allegations, Plaintiff brings three claims under the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"). [Doc. 6, pp. 9-14, ¶¶54-81]. [*5]  First, Plaintiff alleges BridgeWay terminated her "because it regarded her as disabled." [Id. pp. 9-11, ¶¶54-61]. Second, Plaintiff contends that BridgeWay failed to accommodate her disability by refusing to allow her to take short-term medical leave "to cope with symptoms stemming from her POTS and IST." [Id. pp. 11-12, ¶¶62-72]. Last, Plaintiff asserts BridgeWay terminated her in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation, namely STD leave. [Id. pp. 13-14, ¶¶73-81]. In its Motion to Dismiss, BridgeWay argues Plaintiff fails to state a claim because (1) she is not a "qualified individual," (2) she did not request a "reasonable accommodation," and (3) she did not engage in "protected activity." [Doc. 8-2, pp. 10-22]. The Court addresses each argument in turn.

I. Qualified Individual
"To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he is disabled; (2) he is a qualified individual; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of his disability." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2007). A "qualified individual" within the meaning of the ADA is someone "with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the [*6]  employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The ADA only protects individuals still able to perform the essential functions of a job, and as such "a plaintiff who is totally disabled and unable to work at all is precluded from suing for discrimination thereunder." Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., 432 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir. 2005).
BridgeWay does not dispute that Plaintiff has a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA. See [Doc. 8-2]. Rather, Defendant contends Plaintiff is not a "qualified individual" because she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination, and she does not "allege facts demonstrating with any reasonable certainty when she would again be able to perform the essential functions of her job." [Id. pp. 11-13]. While Plaintiff "hoped she would be released [to return to work] within weeks, it was possible that she would remain incapacitated pending surgery at an unspecified time in the future," Defendant argues. [Id. p. 13] (emphasis in original). Plaintiff responds that she "was only seeking leave of a limited duration" and at no time did she tell BridgeWay "she would need medical leave indefinitely." [Doc. 9, pp. 14-15]. In its reply, BridgeWay contends Plaintiff was not [*7]  a "qualified individual" because she could not perform her job on "the date of her termination" and she did not know "with any reasonable certainty when she would again be able to perform the essential functions of her job." [Doc. 10, pp. 7-9].
This matter turns on the subtle but important distinction between "indefinite" and "indeterminate." When an employee cannot "perform the essential functions of his job either presently or in the immediate future" because of "uncertainty about when," if ever, he will be able to return to work, he is "not a 'qualified individual' under the ADA." See Billups v. Emerald Coast Utilities Auth., 714 F. App'x 929, 936 (11th Cir. 2017); see also Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) ("The ADA covers people who can perform the essential functions of their jobs presently or in the immediate future."). When an employee has "no way of knowing when his doctor would allow him to return to work in any capacity," then his need for leave can be said to be "indefinite." See Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997). But if an employee needs "just a month or two" to recover—say from abdominal surgery—then his leave is not necessarily indefinite, though his exact date of return is indeterminate. See id.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") recognizes that "indefinite leave—meaning that an employee cannot [*8]  say whether or when she will be able to return to work at all—will constitute an undue hardship, and so does not have to be provided as a reasonable accommodation." EEOC Publication: Employer-Provided Leave and the Americans with Disabilities Act, available online at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada-leave.cfm (published May 9, 2016; last visited January 13, 2020). But just because an employee cannot "provide a definitive date on which the employee can return to work" does not "necessarily result in undue hardship"—such situations "must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis." Id.
To the extent Defendant contends Plaintiff "was not a 'qualified individual' with a disability when she was terminated" merely because she could not "work in any capacity at the time of termination," such an argument is without merit. See [Doc. 10, pp. 7-8] (emphasis omitted). An employee does not have to be capable of working on the exact day she is terminated to be a "qualified individual." If she can return to work "in the immediate future," she is still a "qualified individual" under the ADA. See Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314; Billups, 714 F. App'x at 936. The crux of Defendant's argument seems to be that neither Plaintiff "nor her physician could determine [*9]  when she would be able to return to work." See [Doc. 10, p. 8] (emphasis omitted). But the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint do not support Defendant's contention.
Plaintiff's physician planned to take "a conservative approach and hoped that she could be released [to return to work] in two weeks." [Doc. 6, p. 8, ¶40]. If that approach did not work, Plaintiff would need to undergo surgery, which would have required her to be "out an additional two weeks for recovery." [Id. ¶¶41-42]. BridgeWay knew this information. [Id. ¶43]. Thus, Plaintiff planned to return within two weeks, though she might need a few more weeks for surgery and a subsequent recovery. Plaintiff did not tell BridgeWay "that she would need medical leave indefinitely," and instead told them "she planned to return much sooner" than the 11 to 13 weeks allowed under the STD policy. See [id. pp. 8-9, ¶¶47-49].
Defendant argues Plaintiff's requested leave is indefinite because "it was possible that she would remain incapacitated pending surgery at an unspecified time in the future." See [Doc. 8-2, p. 13]. But at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court must construe the allegations in a complaint in the light most favorable [*10]  to the plaintiff. Speaker, 623 F.3d at 1379. Thus, the "possib[ility]" that Plaintiff's surgery might have been delayed or that Plaintiff might have been incapacitated after her surgery for longer than anticipated is not enough to support a motion to dismiss.
Likewise, the fact that Plaintiff wrote "unknown" for her expected date of return does not warrant dismissal. See [Doc. 8-1, p. 2]. Defendant would have the Court construe this fact to mean that Plaintiff did not know "with any reasonable certainty when she would again be able to perform the essential functions of her job." See [Doc. 8-2, p. 12]. Construing the fact in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, however, it simply means that Plaintiff did not know the exact day on which she expected to return. That an employee can only provide "an approximate [return] date" or a "range of dates" does not necessarily mean the employee's leave request is "indefinite." EEOC Publication: Employer-Provided Leave and the Americans with Disabilities Act, available online at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada-leave.cfm (published May 9, 2016; last visited January 13, 2020).
Each of the cases Defendant relies on are readily distinguishable. Plaintiff did not apply for long-term disability [*11]  benefits by claiming she is now "totally disabled and unable to work at all." See Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., 432 F.3d 1271, 1280 (11th Cir. 2005); Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 945 (N.D. Ga. 1995); see also Kurzweg v. SCP Distributors, LLC, 424 F. App'x 840, 843-44 (11th Cir. 2011) (addressing a social security disability recipient asserting an ADA claim); Counts v. WenMarr Mgmt. Co., LLC, No. 1:03-CV-2775-TWT, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11845, 2005 WL 1404792, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 3, 2005) (plaintiff conceded he was "totally disabled from work"). Nor did Plaintiff take leave for months and months with no end in sight. See Wood, 323 F.3d at 1314 (employee "had been granted years of discretionary leave and had been on a discretionary leave for over one month at the time of his termination" and could not confirm when he might be able to return to work); Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1226 (employee "had already been on medical leave for ten months" and "could not represent that he likely would have been able to work within a month or two"); Billups, 714 F. App'x at 936 (employee "received over six months of medical leave to allow recovery" and was still "uncertain[ ] about when [he] could perform the essential functions of his position in the future"); Santandreu v. Miami Dade Cty., 513 F. App'x 902, 906 (11th Cir. 2013) (employee "received a total of fifteen months of leave, and still had no way of knowing when his doctor would allow him to resume full-time work").
Indeed, this case seems to present the kind of "more compelling facts" contemplated in Duckett. See 120 F.3d at 1226 n.2. The Eleventh Circuit's holding in that case was predicated on the fact that the employee [*12]  "could not represent that he likely would have been able to work within a month or two." Id. at 1226. Yet, the Eleventh Circuit noted that "ADA regulations may possibly be violated if an employee was terminated immediately upon becoming disabled without a chance to use his leave to recover." Id. at 1226 n.2.
Here, construing Plaintiff's allegations in the light most favorable to her, she did "represent that [s]he likely would have been able to work within a month or two." See id. at 1226; see also [Doc. 6, pp. 8-9, ¶40-49]. Thus, Plaintiff sufficiently pled that she was incapacitated for a temporary, if indeterminate, amount of time. Plaintiff never told BridgeWay she was permanently or even indefinitely incapable of working. [Doc. 6, p. 8, ¶47]. To the extent there was uncertainty about when Plaintiff would be able to return, the uncertainty was partly due to Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff before she could have a follow-up appointment with her cardiologist. See [id., p. 7, ¶38]. While Plaintiff was not "terminated immediately upon becoming disabled," she was fired a scant ten days after her cardiac event. See Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1226 n.2; [Doc. 6, p. 8, ¶46]. Under the circumstances, Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient [*13]  to demonstrate that she is a "qualified individual" at this stage of the proceeding.

II. Reasonable Accommodation
The term "discrimination" as used in the ADA includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical . . . limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). BridgeWay acknowledges that "a leave of absence may in some circumstances be a reasonable accommodation," but reiterates its argument that "neither Plaintiff nor her physician provided a limit on the duration of Plaintiff's inability to perform the essential functions of her job." [Doc. 8-2, pp. 17-19].
Again, construing Plaintiff's allegations in the light most favorable to her, she requested leave of less than 13 weeks, and both Plaintiff and her physician believed she could return far sooner. See [Doc. 6, pp. 8-9, ¶40-49]. Plaintiff did not advocate for leave with "no temporal limit," as Defendant suggests. See [Doc. 8-2, p. 17] (quoting Carroll v. City of Stone Mountain, 544 F. App'x 926, 927 (11th Cir. 2013)). Indeed, the fact that Plaintiff's doctor took a conservative, wait-and-see approach—as opposed to recommending immediate surgery—leads to the reasonable inference that Plaintiff's condition was not as severe as it could have been and that her recovery [*14]  should proceed relatively quickly. That Plaintiff might not have qualified for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") or BridgeWay's standard procedures does not, standing alone, make her leave request unreasonable. See EEOC Publication: Employer-Provided Leave and the Americans with Disabilities Act, available online at https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada-leave.cfm (published May 9, 2016; last visited January 13, 2020). Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that she requested a "reasonable accommodation."

III. Protected Activity
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff "must show (1) that he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot assert a retaliation claim "based on simple failure to accommodate" and that she did not engage in statutorily protected activity because her request for "indefinite leave" is not a reasonable accommodation. [Doc. 8-2, pp. 21-22]. The Court has already addressed the second argument and held that, taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, Plaintiff requested a reasonable accommodation and has satisfied the first [*15]  prong of her prima facie case. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328 (holding that a plaintiff satisfies the first element of the prima facie case if he has "a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that his activity is protected by the statute").
As for Defendant's other argument, the cases it cites are inapposite. Plaintiff is not arguing that Defendant retaliated against her simply by denying her leave request, like the plaintiffs in the cases cited by Defendant. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1261 (11th Cir. 2001) (asserting retaliation because the employer "refus[ed] to maintain him on light duty work"); Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir. 1997) (urging a retaliation claim based on the fact plaintiff was denied "the right to take accrued vacation time to extend her breaks"); Calvo v. Walgreens Corp., 340 F. App'x 618, 625 (11th Cir. 2009) (contending the "failure to accommodate her upon her request amounted to retaliation"); Santacrose v. CSX Transp., Inc., 288 F. App'x 655, 658 (11th Cir. 2008) (claiming the employer "retaliated against him . . . by continually failing to reasonably accommodate him").
Instead, Defendant went beyond merely denying Plaintiff's leave request and decided to terminate her. [Doc. 6, p. 7, ¶38]. Termination is indisputably an adverse employment action, and as such Plaintiff has satisfied the second prong of her prima facie case as well. See Long v. Alabama Dep't of Human Res., 650 F. App'x 957, 968 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding the plaintiff "suffered a materially adverse action [*16]  when his employment was terminated"). Plaintiff was fired the very day she sent Defendant her STD paperwork and such close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is sufficient to satisfy the final prong of Plaintiff's prima facie case of retaliation. See Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1457 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding the plaintiff demonstrated a causal connection when "the series of adverse employment actions commenced almost immediately after" the plaintiff's protected activity). Thus, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint plausibly pleads all the elements needed to make out a prima facie case of retaliation. See Standard, 161 F.3d at 1328.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons explained above, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss ([Doc. 8]) be DENIED.
SO REPORTED AND RECOMMENDED, this 14 day of January, 2020.
