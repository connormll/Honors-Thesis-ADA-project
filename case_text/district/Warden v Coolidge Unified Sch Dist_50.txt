Opinion



ORDER
Pending before this Court is Defendant Arizona Education Association's (hereinafter "AEA")Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. #62), supported by its Statement of Facts (Doc. #63). Pro Se Plaintiff John Warden has filed a Response (Doc. #68), supported by Plaintiff's Declaration of Statements (Doc. #70) and Plaintiff's Separate Statement of Disputed and Undisputed Facts (Doc. #69). AEA has filed a Reply (Doc. #71).

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (hereinafter the "Complaint") on May 1, 2008 (Doc. #33) alleging "[v]iolation of ADA; Title VII; Section 501 Rehabilitation Act, Section 1983, 1985." (Id., at 1.) Because the Complaint is rambling, it is difficult to discern precisely what conduct AEA engaged in that forms the basis of the action. Plaintiff complains that during the time he worked as a teacher for the Coolidge Unified School District (hereinafter "CUSD"), two students complained of "inappropriate touching."1 (Doc. #33 at 13.) Plaintiff complains of the actions CUSD took during the investigation [*2]  and resolution of the complaints, including his ultimate involuntary transfer to another school within the school District with a different teaching assignment. (Id., at13-16.) He claims that he is disabled, in that he suffers from "Bi-polar depression since [he] was a teenager with attendant Clinical Depression." (Id., at 10.) He complains that CUSD and AEA discriminated against him by not offering an accommodation to his disability instead of ordering the transfer, and discriminated against him based upon his gender and race (white). (Id.)
The specific allegations Plaintiff makes of improper conduct by AEA, the teachers' Union to which Plaintiff belonged, are as follows:
(I) that "AEA attorney Denise Bloomel, failed to fulfill [her] responsibility to supplement the requirements of the ADA and section 504 within the CUSD and Denise Bloomel and the agents of CUSD intentionally discriminated against plaintiff. This responsibility included, the plaintiff, reasonable interexchanges: making reasonable modifications in departmental policies, practices, and procedures that were necessary to avoid discriminating against the plaintiff on the basis of his disability, and training administrative agents in the proper handling of Bi-Polar [*3]  individuals, like the plaintiff." (Id., at 13.)
(ii) that "[w]hen [Plaintiff] presented the fact that [he] was considered disabled and that this administrative leave should take into consideration [his] disability both AEA attorneys, Denise Bloomel, and Alice Gartell remained aloof and passive. Ms. Bloomel at one point however, went totally irrational, when [Plaintiff] ask her to make her negotiations to also include an accommodation just flatly told [him] [he] had no disability case and if [he] persisted she would resign and recommend to the AEA that they not get [him] another lawyer." (Id., at 14.)
(iii) that the "AEA head attorney was also aware that [Plaintiff] wanted an accommodation." (Id.)
(iv) and that "CUSD's and AEA's efforts to limit employer liability to the acts of "actual decision-makers" and to employer negligence is inconsistent with agency principles." (Id., at 22.)
On July 23, 2007, Plaintiff ultimately filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC and named CUSD as the "Employer, Labor Organization, Employment Agency, Apprenticeship Committee or State or Local Agency" that he believed discriminated against him. (Doc. #33, Exh. 16.) The particulars he related in his charge of discrimination based [*4]  upon his disability, gender and race were as follows:
Respondent implements a double standard for male and female teachers, in that, female teachers are allowed to touch male students and male teachers are not allowed to touch female students. On or around April 19, 2007, I was falsely accused by two female students of inappropriate touching. I was immediately placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. I have taken two lie detector tests that exonerate me from these charges; however, the Respondent has indicated that I will be transferred to the High School. I have also been burdened with approximately $13,000 in attorney's fees. I believe that Respondent has retaliated against me because I filed a previous EEOC complaint against another school district in California.
(Doc. #33, Exh. 16.)
The EEOC was "unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes," and notified Plaintiff of his right to sue. (Doc. #33, Exh. 14.)

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
A court must grant summary judgment if the pleadings and supporting documents, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material [*5]  fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Jesinger v. Nevada Federal Credit Union, 24 F.3d 1127, 1130 (9th Cir. 1994). Substantive law determines which facts are material. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Jesinger, 24 F.3d at 1130. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. The dispute must also be genuine, that is, the evidence must be "such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.; see Jesinger, 24 F.3d at 1130.
A principal purpose of summary judgment is "to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24. Summary judgment is appropriate against a party who "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Id. at 322; see Citadel Holding Corp. v. Roven, 26 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir. 1994). The moving party need not disprove matters on which the opponent has the burden of proof at trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24. The party opposing summary judgment need not produce evidence "in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment." Id. at 324. However, the nonmovant "may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [the party's] pleadings, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there [*6]  is a genuine issue for trial." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); see Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.);
In order to establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must offer evidence that "give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." Cordova v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 124 F.3d 1145, 1148 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).

ADA & Title VII Claims
Plaintiff makes federal claims for disability discrimination under the American with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213 ("ADA"), and discrimination due to gender and race under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) ("Title VII") and Section 1983. AEA contends that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that those claims must therefore be dismissed.
To bring a claim in federal court under Title VII, or the ADA, a plaintiff must first exhaust administrative remedies by filing a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") or the state agency to whom investigative authority has been delegated. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)-(f) (Title VII); 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a) (ADA). "[T]he administrative charge requirement serves the important purposes of giving the charged party notice of the claim and narrowing the issues for prompt adjudication and decision." B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep't, 276 F.3d 1091, 1099 (9th Cir. 2002).
When a plaintiff [*7]  seeks judicial relief for claims not listed in the original charge, the complaint "nevertheless may encompass any discrimination like or reasonably related to the allegations of the ... charge." Oubichon v. North Am. Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir.1973). Subject matter extends over allegations that fell within the scope of the agency's actual investigation or an investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the allegation of discrimination. B.K.B., 276 F.3d at 1100; see also Sosa v. Hiraoka, 920 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir.1990) (the court "must inquire whether the original EEOC investigation would have encompassed the additional charges made in the court complaint but not included in the EEOC charge itself").
A plaintiff's claims are reasonably related to allegations in the charge "to the extent that those claims are consistent with the plaintiff's original theory of the case." B.K.B., 276 F.3d at 1100. While also considering the principles of notice and fair play, the court construes the language of the charges "with utmost liberality since they are made by those unschooled in the technicalities of formal pleading." Id. (internal quotations omitted). "It is appropriate to consider such factors as the alleged basis of the discrimination, dates of discriminatory acts specified within the charge, perpetrators of discrimination [*8]  named in the charge, and any locations at which discrimination is alleged to have occurred." Id.
The "crucial element of a charge of discrimination is the factual statement contained therein." Id. The question of whether a claim has been sufficiently exhausted "must focus on the factual allegations made in the charge itself, describing the discriminatory conduct about which a plaintiff is grieving." Freeman v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist., 291 F.3d 632, 637 (9th Cir. 2002). That inquiry will reveal the actual focus of the administrative charge and the scope of the claims exhausted.

I. Plaintiff's Discrimination Claims.
Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against the AEA. In his EEOC charge of discrimination Plaintiff named only his employer, CUSD: in addition, his narration of facts in support of the charge did not refer to any action on the part of AEA. CUSD is a completely separate entity from the AEA. An EEOC investigator was not put on notice that Plaintiff's discrimination claims encompassed actions taken on the part of his Union during the Union's representation of him. Likewise, there is no reason to believe that the alleged discriminatory conduct on the part of the Union would be uncovered during the EEOC investigation. The natural [*9]  scope of the EEOC investigation was Plaintiff's employer's actions in responding to the students' allegations of inappropriate touching.
An ADA claim against the plaintiff's union is barred where the plaintiff alleges only that he filed an EEOC charge against the employer, and the EEOC then issued a right-to-sue letter based upon that charge. Lillien v. M.A.B.S.T.O.A. (MTA) (T.W.U.), 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18419, 1996 WL 711495 (S.D. N.Y.). Plaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies against AEA deprives this court of jurisdiction over his discrimination claims.
Furthermore, any claim against AEA under 42 U.S.C. §12131 fails because Plaintiff does not establish, or even allege that AEA is a "public entity" as defined by the statute. Plaintiff also fails to state any particular acts committed by AEA that caused or contributed to his "unlawful transfer" or that resulted in a failure to accommodate his disability.
In his Complaint, Plaintiff refers, generally, to disability and sex discrimination. (See Doc. #33, at 7, and ¶ 73.) He also makes a conclusory accusation that CUSD's Superintendent is "gender driven," and that she wrote a letter that was "stereotyping male behavior toward female pre-teens." (See Doc. #33 ¶¶ 46, 54.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff [*10]  fails to point to any particular discriminatory employment decision, or any facts to support his assertion that CUSD based any of its decisions on Plaintiff's sex or his alleged disability. Although he complains about his transfer from San Tan Middle School to Coolidge High School, Plaintiff does demonstrate that the decision to transfer him was based on his sex or disability. (Doc. #69, at 9-132.) As such, Plaintiff fails to state a claim of discrimination under Title VII or the ADA. See, e.g., Ivey v. Board of Regents, 673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir. 1982) (vague and conclusory allegations of discrimination do not state a claim). He also fails to present any facts to establish the liability of AEA, even if he were successful in prosecuting a claim against CUSD.
Plaintiff also makes a "reasonable accommodation" claim under the ADA. The ADA requires that employers provide "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii). An ADA "failure to accommodate" claim, therefore, involves an assertion that a defendant wrongfully interfered [*11]  with a plaintiff's ability to perform his or her job by refusing a request for reasonable accommodation.
Here, Plaintiff provides no support for this assertion. Although Plaintiff claims that he was refused an accommodation for his alleged disability (see Doc. #33 ¶¶ 44, 72-74), he does not allege that he was unable to perform the essential functions of his job without such accommodation, or that such accommodation was necessary to enable him to perform his job. (Doc. #69 at 6-14.) Indeed, Plaintiff asserts that while he has "limited impaired cognitive ability," his condition affects his job performance "only in a limited way." (See Doc. #33 ¶ 37.) He claims that he has won awards, that he has passed various "educational" tests, that he has been fully credentialed, and that he has "successfully past [sic] the first year of law school." (See Doc. #33 ¶ 37.) From the face of his Complaint, and the facts presented in support of his Response to AEA's Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff appears to be entirely capable of performing his duties. The ADA does not require that employers provide accommodations that are not related to the individual's ability to perform the job. In any event, [*12]  Plaintiff presents no facts to establish how AEA played any role in CUSD's decision to transfer Plaintiff.

II. Plaintiff's §1983 Claim.
Liability under 42 U.S.C. §1983 requires proof of "state action." AEA is Plaintiff's Union and not his employer. Nonetheless, in a Section 1983 action against an employer and Union, a plaintiff fails to state a claim if plaintiff does not "allege specific facts showing an agreement and concerted action" amongst the defendant employer and union. Montgomery v. City of Ardmore, 365 F.2d 926, 939-40 (10th Cir. 2004). An ostensibly private organization may be treated as the government's action "if, but only if, there is such a close nexus between the state and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the State itself." Single Moms, Inc. v Montana Power Co. 331 F.3d 743, 747 (9th Cir. 2003). Plaintiff avers no facts sufficient to demonstrate any concerted or collusive actions on the part of AEA and CUSD and thus any claim under Section 1983 must fail.

CONCLUSION
Plaintiff's claims against AEA under the ADA and Title VII fail for the reason that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Even if Plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies, the pleadings and supporting documents, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material [*13]  fact and that [AEA] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)
Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED that AEA's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. #62) is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case against Defendant AEA is DISMISSED with prejudice.
DATED this 30th day of June, 2009.
