CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE: MOTION TO DISMISS [21]
Before the Court is Defendants PC Matic, Inc. and Rob Cheng's Motion to Dismiss (the "Motion") filed on March 7, 2023. (Docket No. 14). Plaintiff Mary James filed an Opposition on April 3, 2023. (Docket No. 21). Defendants filed a Reply on April 10, 2023. (Docket No. 22).
The Motion was noticed to be heard on April 24, 2023. The Court read and considered the papers on the Motion and deemed the matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15. The hearing was therefore VACATED and removed from the Court's calendar.
The Motion is GRANTED in part in part and DENIED in part as follows:
• The Motion is DENIED [*2]  as to Plaintiff's FEHA sexual harassment and discrimination claims (Claims 1, 2, and 3) and derivate wrongful termination claim (Claim 12). Plaintiff sufficiently alleges the existence of a hostile work environment, the failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, and disparate treatment on the basis of sex.
• The Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Plaintiff's Labor Code claims (Claims 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14). Plaintiff does not adequately allege whether her comparators' roles required the substantially same skill, effort, and responsibility as her role. Plaintiff also fails to set forth at least one specific week she was forced to work uncompensated overtime, not provided with meal and rest breaks, or provided an inaccurate wage statement. Plaintiff also does not make sufficient factual allegations to support her retaliation claim related to these alleged Labor Code violations.
• The Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's FEHA disability discrimination claims (Claims 9, 10, and 11). Plaintiff's allegations support an inference that Defendants terminated Plaintiff because of her disability, denied her a reasonable accommodation, and did not engage in an interactive process.
• The [*3]  Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's claim pursuant to California Labor Code section 246.5 (Claim 15) because Plaintiff adequately alleges that she was retaliated against for the use of accrued sick days.
• Additionally, Plaintiff's request to voluntarily dismiss Claim 8 is GRANTED.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff commenced this action on January 26, 2023, in Los Angeles Superior Court. (Notice of Removal ("NoR") (Docket No. 1), Ex. 1 (Complaint)). Defendants removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on March 1, 2023. (Id.).
Plaintiff is an individual residing in Los Angeles, California, who was hired to work at PC Matic in September 2017. (Id. ¶ 5, 12). PC Matic, Inc., is a South Dakota corporation with its principal place of business in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. (Id. ¶ 6). Rob Cheng is an individual residing in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina who is, and all times mentioned in the Complaint, was PC Matic's CEO. (Id. ¶ 7).
Plaintiff alleges that Cheng fosters a toxic culture of discrimination, harassment, and humiliation toward PC Matic's female employees. (Id. ¶ 1). Plaintiff alleges that PC Matic refuses to compensate female employees at the same rate as their male counterparts and that women who Cheng [*4]  deems are not physically attractive enough for advancement are not afforded the same opportunities as their male counterparts. (See id.).
Plaintiff alleges that during her tenure with PC Matic, Cheng:
• vetted female candidates by looking at photographs to make sure they were not "ugly" or "fat";
• told Plaintiff that she "wasn't good in front of people" because of her weight;
• stated that a female former employee who had sued the company for sexual harassment "wasn't hot enough to get hit on";
• refused to believe that Plaintiff did yoga because Cheng's wife did yoga and she was "slender";
• for years, denied Plaintiff a pay raise despite her excellent performance and despite substantially expanding her job duties;
• refused to consider Plaintiff for promotion based on her gender, eventually deciding to hire a male from outside the company;
• failed to pay Plaintiff and other female employees as much as their male counterparts;
• accused Plaintiff and other female employees of lying when they informed him that they were overworked and experiencing job-related stress;
• denied Plaintiff and other female salespersons the opportunity to travel to make sales and earn commissions;
• proposed a degrading [*5]  and chauvinistic marketing campaign concerning PC Matic's spokeswoman in which the public would be asked whether she was "hotter" than female spokespersons from other companies (PC Matic's management refused to run the campaign);
• humiliated Kimi Matthews, a female salesperson, at a restaurant, causing her to quit the following day, then lied about the reason for her departure, claiming it was because she was "too affectionate" with Cheng;
• allowed PC Matic's male supervisors to verbally abuse female employees, including Plaintiff; and
• in August 2022, terminated Plaintiff for being late on an assignment while she dealt with a serious medical issue.
(Id. ¶ 2). Plaintiff also alleges that PC Matic violated various California wage and hour laws by misclassifying her as exempt from overtime and denying her the opportunity to take meal or rest breaks. (Id. ¶ 3).
The Complaint assert fifteen claims for relief: (1) sexual harassment, Cal. Gov't Code § 12490(j), against all Defendants; (2) failure to prevent sexual harassment, Cal. Gov't Code § 12490(k), against PC Matic; (3) disparate treatment on the basis of gender, against PC Matic; (4) violation of the Equal Pay Act, Cal. Lab. Code § 1197.5, against all Defendants; (5) failure to pay overtime wages, Cal. Lab. Code §§ 510, 558, 1194 and IWC Wage Orders, [*6]  against all defendants; (6) failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statements, against all Defendants; (7) failure to provide meal and rest periods, Cal. Lab. Code §§ 226.7, 512 and IWC Wage Orders, against all Defendants; (8) failure to provide notice of available sick leave, Cal. Lab. Code § 246(i), against PC Matic; (9) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), against PC Matic; (10) failure to provide reasonable accommodation, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m), against PC Matic; (11) failure to engage in interactive process, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n), against PC Matic; (12) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, against PC Matic; (13) retaliation in violation of FEHA, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h), against PC Matic; (14) retaliation in violation of Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5, against PC Matic; (15) retaliation, Cal. Lab. Code § 246.5, against PC Matic. (Id. ¶¶ 54-161).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
"Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when the complaint either (1) lacks a cognizable legal theory or (2) fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory." Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 959 (9th Cir. 2013).
In ruling on the Motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court follows Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter . . . to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). The Court must disregard allegations that are legal conclusions, even when disguised [*7]  as facts. See id. at 681 ("It is the conclusory nature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth."); Eclectic Properties E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 996 (9th Cir. 2014). "Although 'a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof is improbable,' plaintiffs must include sufficient 'factual enhancement' to cross 'the line between possibility and plausibility.'" Eclectic Properties, 751 F.3d at 995 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57) (internal citations omitted).
The Court must then determine whether, based on the allegations that remain and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, the Complaint alleges a plausible claim for relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 2011). "Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is 'a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.'" Ebner v. Fresh, Inc., No. 13-56644, 2016 WL 5389307, at *2 (9th Cir. Sept. 27, 2016) (as amended) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). Where the facts as pleaded in the Complaint indicate that there are two alternative explanations, only one of which would result in liability, "plaintiffs cannot offer allegations that are merely consistent with their favored explanation but are also consistent with the alternative explanation. Something more is needed, such as facts tending [*8]  to exclude the possibility that the alternative explanation is true, in order to render plaintiffs' allegations plausible." Eclectic Properties, 751 F.3d at 996-97; see also Somers, 729 F.3d at 960.

III. DISCUSSION
Defendants request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff's entire complaint. (Motion at 6). However, the Court notes that Defendants did not move to dismiss Claim 13, retaliation in violation of FEHA. Accordingly, Claim 13 survives the Motion.

A. FEHA Claims

1. Exhaustion
As an initial matter, Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to allege exhaustion of her FEHA administrative duties and that she is operating within the scope of her administrative complaint. (Motion at 21).
Plaintiff argues that the Complaint does allege that Plaintiff complied with this procedure and attached a copy of the right-to-sue letter issued by the California Civil Rights Department ("CRD"). (Opposition at 4 (citing Complaint ¶ 11, Ex. A)).
In order to be entitled to file a civil action in court based on FEHA violations, an employee must first exhaust administrative remedies. See Blum v. Superior Court, 141 Cal. App. 4th 418, 422, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 902 (2006). An employee exhausts administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the CRD within one year of the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful act, and obtaining a notice of the right to sue [*9]  from the Department. Blum, 141 Cal. App. 4th at 422, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 902 (citing Medix Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. Superior Court, 97 Cal. App. 4th 109, 116, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 249 (2002)); see also Rao v. Amerisource Bergen Corp., No. CIV S-08-1527 DAD PS, 2010 WL 3767997, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 22, 2010) ("The timely filing of an administrative complaint is a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil action for damages under the FEHA."). It is the plaintiff's burden to plead and prove timely exhaustion of administrative remedies. See Kim v. Konad USA Distribution, Inc., 226 Cal. App. 4th 1336, 1345, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 686 (2014) (citing Garcia v. Los Banos Unified School Dist., 418 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1215 (E.D. Cal. 2006)).
"Under the FEHA, the scope of the [CRD] complaint defines the scope of the subsequent civil action." Keever v. Mediation Ctr. of San Joaquin, No. 2:13-cv-00029-KJM-KJN, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1102, 2015 WL 75194, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 6, 2015). Thus, "[a]llegations in the civil complaint that fall outside of the scope of the administrative charge are barred for failure to exhaust." Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 897 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 51 Cal. App. 4th 345, 381, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 747 (1996). However, a plaintiff may bring a civil action based on conduct not specifically included in a CRD complaint if it is "like or reasonably related" to the allegations in the administrative complaint, or "can reasonably be expected to grow out of an administrative investigation." Lelaind v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1091 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2008); Okoli v. Lockheed Tech. Operations Co., 36 Cal. App. 4th 1607, 1615, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57 (1995).
In determining whether the exhaustion requirement has been met, California law dictates that FEHA provisions are to be liberally construed to accomplish their purposes, including the resolution of potentially meritorious claims on the merits. Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 819, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001); 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 10003 ("The department shall liberally construe all complaints to effectuate the purpose of the laws the department enforces to safeguard [*10]  the civil right of all persons to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination."); see also Stearns v. Fair Emp't Practice Comm'n, 6 Cal.3d 205, 214, 98 Cal. Rptr. 467, 490 P.2d 1155 (1971) (holding that CRD charges should be construed liberally for same reasons that federal EEOC complaints should be construed liberally). California courts have held that when submitting allegations to the CRD, "claimants are not held to specify the charges with literary exactitude." Soldinger, 51 Cal. App. 4th at 381; See Baker v. Children's Hosp. Med. Ctr., 209 Cal. App. 3d 1057, 1064, 257 Cal. Rptr. 768 (1989). The Ninth Circuit has held that to do otherwise, requiring employees to return to the CRD to amend the administrative complaint, would impose a "needless procedural barrier" to FEHA's enforcement. Oubichon v. N. Am. Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973).
In reviewing the exhaustion question in this case, the Court is required by Ninth Circuit law to construe Plaintiff's CRD complaint liberally. In light of this directive, the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded administrative exhaustion under FEHA, and declines to dismiss her FEHA claims on the basis of failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Plaintiff's CRD complaint alleges, among other things, that she was harassed and discriminated against based on her gender and disability, faced sexual harassment — hostile environment, denied equal pay and work opportunities, and was retaliated [*11]  against. (See Reply, Ex. A (Plaintiff's CRD complaint)).
The Court declines to impose a higher degree of specificity on to Plaintiff's CRD complaint for the purposes of administrative exhaustion because to do so would defy the well-established directive to interpret CRD complaints liberally. The purpose of filing a charge with an administrative agency prior to filing a civil lawsuit is merely to enable that agency to investigate the charges and attempt to obtain voluntary compliance with the law. Soldinger, 51 Cal. App. 4th at 381. The FEHA administrative exhaustion requirement is not to be construed as an impediment to judicial vindication of employees' right to work free from discrimination. Oubichon, 482 F.2d at 571; Richards, 26 Cal.4th at 821.
Defendants argue that at a minimum, Plaintiff's claim centered on failure to engage in the interactive process should be dismissed because no mention of it exists on the Plaintiff's CRD complaint. (Reply at 2). However, the Court determines that Plaintiff's interactive process claim is "like or reasonably related" to her disability discrimination allegation in the CRD complaint. See Lelaind, 576 F. Supp. 2d at 1091 ("Because the factual allegations in the administrative charge are like or reasonably related to claims for hostile work environment, retaliation, [*12]  and disparate treatment [although the charge did "not invoke magic words"], and such claims could be reasonably expected to grow out of an investigation based on the facts alleged, the court concludes that Lelaind has exhausted her administrative remedies as required under . . . FEHA."). Although Plaintiff's CRD complaint was sparsely pleaded, given the legislative directive to liberally construe CRD complaints, the Court determines that it was sufficient for exhaustion purposes.
Defendants are correct that Plaintiff improperly attached only the CRD right-to-sue letter to her Complaint and excluded her CRD complaint. However, given that Defendants and the Court have Plaintiff's CRD complaint (Reply, Ex. A), requiring Plaintiff to refile her Complaint with the CRD complaint attached would only impose a "needless procedural barrier" to FEHA's enforcement. See Oubichon, 482 F.2d at 571.

2. Non-Actionable Conduct
Defendants contend many of Plaintiff's FEHA allegations are barred by the three-year statute of limitations (Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(e)(5)) or involve conduct that is non-actionable because it occurred outside of California. (Id. at 6, 12 (citing Anderson v. CRST Int'l, Inc., 685 F. App'x 524, 526 (9th Cir. 2017)).

a. Extraterritoriality
State law embodies a presumption against extraterritorial application [*13]  of its statutes. Diamond Multimedia Sys., Inc. v. Superior Court, 19 Cal. 4th 1036, 1059, 80 Cal. Rptr. 2d 828, 968 P.2d 539 (1999) (citing North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 174 Cal. 1, 162 P. 93 (1916)). Applying this presumption, FEHA does not "apply to nonresidents where . . . the tortious conduct took place out of this state's territorial boundaries." Campbell v. Arco Marine, Inc., 42 Cal. App. 4th 1850, 1852, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 626 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996). In an unpublished decision, the Ninth Circuit has determined that FEHA also did not apply to California residents when the offending conduct happens outside of California. Anderson v. CRST Int'l, Inc., 685 F. App'x 524, 526 (9th Cir. 2017).
Defendants argue that Anderson suggests that the Court should dismiss all claimed conduct that occurred outside of California. (Reply at 3). Plaintiff argues that the alleged harassing and discriminatory conduct falls within the scope of FEHA because Plaintiff worked in California. (Opposition at 5-6).
In Anderson, a California resident and female commercial truck driver who departed from her employer's Fontana, California, facility with a male colleague who was the "lead driver" for the trip. Anderson v. CRST Int'l, Inc., No. CV 14-368 DSF (MANx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, 2015 WL 1487074, at *1, *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2015). The employee claimed she was repeatedly sexually harassed by her male colleague on out-of-state trips in December 2012 and January 2013. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, [WL] at *1-*2. For example, her male colleague repeatedly talked about his alleged time in the porn industry and drove with his pants unzipped and unbuttoned, and they would fall down when he stood up. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, [WL] at *2. The employee had [*14]  asked him to stop talking about these subjects and wear his pants properly, but her male colleague refused. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, [WL] at *1-*2. On December 31, 2012, their truck broke down in Pennsylvania, and the company would only pay for one hotel room despite the employee's requesting a separate room. Id. *2. On the night of January 1, 2012, Ms. Anderson awoke to find her male colleague "naked and 'coming up off his bed toward' her." Id. When he saw that Ms. Anderson was awake, "he stopped rising and rolled back to his bed and sat on the far side of the bed with his head in his hands." Id. After a few minutes, he stood up "'completely naked,' picked up his pants from the floor and put them on." Id. On January 3, the employee alerted her supervisor, who was located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that she woke up in the middle of the night to find her male colleague naked on the side of the bed. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, [WL] at *3. The employee brought claims for sexual harassment and failure to prevent under FEHA. Id. *4-*5.
Despite the egregious conduct, and the fact that the employee was a California resident, the court found that FEHA did not apply. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, 2015 WL 1487074, at *4. ("The Court concludes that FEHA is inapplicable when the challenged conduct occurs outside of California."). [*15]  The district court rejected Anderson's argument that "FEHA was enacted to protect California residents against [harassment] in connection with their employment in California." 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45161, [WL] at *5 (alteration in original). The Court found "[t]his proposition misapprehends the concept of extraterritoriality, which concerns legislation that regulates conduct that occurs in a foreign jurisdiction-regardless of the plaintiff's residency." Id. (citing Diamond Multimedia Sys., Inc. v. Superior Ct., 19 Cal. 4th 1036, 1060, 80 Cal. Rptr. 2d 828, 968 P.2d 539 (Cal. 1999)). The Ninth Circuit affirmed this decision. Anderson v. CRST Int'l, Inc., 685 F. App'x at 526 ("Thus, Anderson's claims under the FEHA fail because they are based on conduct that occurred outside the state.").
Plaintiff argues Anderson is inapt because Plaintiff, unlike the Anderson employee, worked in California. (Opposition at 6). Plaintiff argues her case is therefore more akin to the situation in Davis v. Inmar, Inc., 21-cv-3779-SBA, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155126, 2022 WL 3722122 (2022), which involved employees who lived and worked in California at the time of the alleged unlawful conduct. (Id.).
In Davis, employees who worked in the Daly City, California, office of a company with headquarters in North Carolina asserted, among other claims, violation of FEHA on the basis of gender discrimination. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155126, 2022 WL 3722122 at *1-*2. The employees alleged that the "male dominated" and "male oriented" work culture became an obstacle [*16]  to establishing a role at the company. Id. Allegations included open discussions about male leaders having a 'type' in regard to women they preferred to work with and that it was well known amongst female employees that senior leaders only wanted to hear from male colleagues (i.e., female employees would be most effective if they passed information through straight, white, male colleagues). Id. Within weeks of one employee raising her concerns about the work culture, she and another female in the office were fired. Id. Other allegations included observations of senior male leaders having intimate relationships with women within the organization, women being regularly demoted or kept in positions not commensurate with their contributions and experience, and women being paid less. Id.
The Davis defendant argued, citing Anderson, that the employees failed to allege that any unlawful conduct occurred in California and therefore the employees could not state a claim under FEHA. See 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155126, [WL] at *4. The Davis court disagreed, reasoning that Anderson and other cases cited did not involve situations where a plaintiff worked and lived in California. Id. The Davis court reasoned that because the plaintiffs were employed in [*17]  California and subjected to discriminatory and retaliatory acts while performing work for the defendant in California, the employees' allegations were sufficient to plead a claim within FEHA's reach. Id. (citing Gonsalves v. Infosys Techs., Ltd., No. 09-CV-4112-MHP, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44401, 2010 WL 1854146, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2010) (explaining that a plaintiff may plead a claim within FEHA's reach by alleging he was employed in California or performed some work in California with a connection to the misconduct at issue).
Here, Plaintiff alleges she was employed in California and subjected to a discriminatory work culture and retaliatory acts while performing work for Defendants. As in Davis, this allegation is sufficient to plead a claim within FEHA's reach. Accordingly, the Court will consider allegations of conduct that allegedly contributed to a hostile work environment while Plaintiff worked and lived in California.

b. Conduct before January 26, 2020
Defendants argue that the Court should disregard Plaintiff's allegations of conduct that occurred before January 2020 because such conduct is outside the statute of limitations. (Motion at 6-7 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(e)(5)). Plaintiff argues that Defendants' conduct before January 26, 2020, is actionable under the continuing violation doctrine. (Opposition at 6-9).
"A continuing [*18]  violation exists if (1) the conduct occurring within the limitations period is similar in kind to the conduct that falls outside the period; (2) the conduct was reasonably frequent; and (3) it had not yet acquired a degree of permanence." Dominguez v. Washington Mut. Bank, 168 Cal. App. 4th 714, 721, 168 Cal. Rptr. 3d 705 (2008) (citing Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (2001)).
Defendants argue that the alleged actions have acquired permanence. (Reply at 3-4). Plaintiff argues that none of the allegedly discriminatory conduct ever stopped, so the actions did not achieve permanency. (Opposition at 9).
"Permanency" is achieved when the harassing conduct stops, when the employee resigns, or when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end the harassment will be futile. Dominguez, 168 Cal. App. 4th at 724 (citing Richards, 26 Cal. 4th at 823).
Plaintiff lists a series of alleged actions that she contends fostered a workplace culture in which a woman's appearance dictated her success and prospects for advancement. (Opposition at 7-8). Defendants do not address most of these allegations but argue that alleged conduct related to issues with Plaintiff's assignments, job duties, or pay became permanent when Plaintiff was told in September 2020 that her request for a pay raise would be futile and her salary would be converted to an hourly rate if she raised the issue again. [*19]  (Reply at 4 (citing Complaint ¶ 29)). Even if the Court accepted Defendants' argument that permanency was established in September 2020, Plaintiff alleges enough to suggest the conduct before January 26, 2020, is arguably similar and frequent enough to the September 2020 conduct to constitute a single course of conduct until that point. Cf. Leiland v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1096 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (determining at summary judgment stage that close temporal relationship, frequency of conduct, and perpetuating of conduct by same two managers would permit reasonable jury to find the under FEHA there is a continuing court of unlawful conduct).
Accordingly, at this early stage, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that the pre-limitations period conduct is part of the same course of conduct as the post-limitations period conduct. The Court will therefore consider this conduct in determining whether Plaintiff states claims under FEHA.

3. Sexual Harassment and Disparate Treatment Claims
Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not plausibly allege actionable conduct to state a claim upon which relief may be granted for sexual harassment or disparate impact. (Id. at 10).

a. Claims 1 and 2: Sexual Harassment and Failure to Prevent Sexual Harassment
Under FEHA, it [*20]  is unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . or any other person, because of . . . sex [or] gender . . . to harass an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(j)(1). To establish a prima facie case of a hostile work environment, the plaintiff must show that: (1) plaintiff is a member of a protected class; (2) plaintiff was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on plaintiff's protected status; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with plaintiff's work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) defendants are liable for the harassment. Ortiz v. Dameron Hosp. Assn., 37 Cal. App. 5th 568, 581, 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2019).
Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to allege a concerted pattern of sexual harassment severe and pervasive enough to create an abusive work environment. (Motion at 12). Defendants argue that Plaintiff's allegations amount to only occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial incidents that "do not constitute pervasive conduct." (Id. at 13 (citing Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Prods., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 284, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006)). Defendants contend Plaintiff's allegations at most claim that Plaintiff either witnessed or heard second or third hand that Cheng spoke chauvinistically about women to others, which is not enough for a hostile work environment claim. (Id. 13-14 (citing Lyle, 38 Cal. 4th at 282 (no hostile work [*21]  environment claim "where a supervisor or coworker simply uses crude or inappropriate language in front of employees . . . without directing sexual innuendos or gender-related language toward a plaintiff or toward women in general.")).
Plaintiff argues that Defendants miss the point of Lyle, which expressly held that "it is the disparate treatment of an employee on the basis of sex—not the mere discussion of sex or use of vulgar language—that is the essence of a sexual harassment claim." (Opposition at 9-10 (citing Lyle, 38 Cal. 4th at 280)). Plaintiff argues that she need only allege that she was subject to unwelcome harassment on the basis of gender, which she does by detailing numerous comments made by Cheng and others because Plaintiff is a woman. (Id. (citing Ortiz, 37 Cal. App. 5th at 581)). Plaintiff additionally points out that she does not need to allege that sexual comments or conduct were directed towards her. (Id. at 10 (citing Beyda v. City of Los Angeles, 65 Cal. App. 4th 511, 519, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 547 (1998) (holding that "a reasonable person may be affected by knowledge that other workers are being sexually harassed in the workplace, even if he or she does not personally witness that conduct).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim is not based on any sexual advances or comments that [*22]  are sexual in nature. (Reply in 6). Defendants suggest most of Plaintiff's allegations involve behavior that is not gender-based, including incident where male supervisor Corey Munson yelled at her. (Id. at 6). With respect to allegations about Cheng, Defendants point out that Plaintiff did not witness, but was only told about, certain comments during or after her employment.
At the pleading stage, Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to make out a claim of sexual harassment. Beyda v. City of Los Angeles makes clear that a plaintiff's awareness of comments or situations that they did not witness is probative of their experience of a hostile work environment. 65 Cal. App. 4th at 519. In Beyda, the plaintiff pursued a claim for sexual harassment and "sought to introduce the acts suffered by other employees as further evidence of the hostile environment." Id. at 551. The court determined "incidents of sexual harassment directed toward other employees in the work environment [were] relevant to th[e] evaluation" of a hostile environment. Id. Importantly, the court noted these situations are only relevant where the plaintiff is aware of them. Id.
Here, it is not entirely clear from the Complaint when the Plaintiff knew the facts [*23]  alleged and the situations described. Still, while each incident may not have been pleaded with exact specificity, Plaintiff's pleadings do describe a number of situations which would be relevant to her perception of the hostility of her work environment.
First, Plaintiff describes learning, after growing suspicious that she had not been considered for a promotion or a raise because of her weight, that Cheng did not hire "fat" or "ugly" female candidates. (Complaint ¶ 21). Plaintiff pleaded that she learned from Kayla Elliot, a supervisor in PC Matic's marketing department, that Cheng screened female candidates to ensure they were not overweight or in his opinion "ugly" and directed an employee in the Human Resources department to find female applicants' social media profiles prior to hiring them. (Id.). Plaintiff specifies she specifically learned of this other incident while working at PC Matic.
Second, Plaintiff pleaded that at a company meeting in Pittsburgh, around October 2017, Cheng described a lawsuit filed by a former female employee for sexual harassment and while drunk, he said "[the female employee] isn't even hot enough to get hit on so I don't know what she's talking about." [*24]  (Id. ¶ 16). While Plaintiff does not plead exactly when she learned of this demeaning comment, she did plead that she attended the Pittsburgh meeting and was encouraged to go out with fellow employees including Cheng to drink and bond. (Id. ¶ 16-17). It is a reasonable inference that she either witnessed it first-hand or heard from another attendee.
Third, the Complaint contains a detailed account of Cheng's interaction with Kimi Matthews, a female sales representative, who Cheng allegedly forced to quit and then claimed she was fired for being too affectionate. (Complaint ¶¶ 42-47). Plaintiff claims in April 2022 at a meeting with Mr. Molden, he gave a vague explanation about the interaction, but the Complaint then goes on to describe the interaction with sufficient detail. (Id.). It is unclear from the Complaint when Plaintiff knew of the events involving Ms. Matthews and Cheng. Plaintiff did ask Mr. Molden about Ms. Matthew's abrupt departure and she had an intimate knowledge of company workings as she knew personal details about individuals at the company like that the person with the most sick days was undergoing preventative chemotherapy. (Id. ¶ 41). Giving all favorable inferences [*25]  to Plaintiff, it is reasonable that she obtained more information after her meeting with Mr. Molden about Ms. Matthews departure.
While Plaintiff does not say exactly when she learned of each event, reasonable inferences based on the given timeline and Plaintiff's knowledge of discussions or attendance at different events, do support a finding that she knew of the discussed events. At the pleading stage, Plaintiff meets her burden to show she knew of events that would permit a reasonable person in her position to both perceive a hostile workplace and be affected by it.
Further, Plaintiff also alleges a number of gender-based comments and incidents directed towards her. In particular, Plaintiff alleges that Cheng expressed surprise that she did yoga because Cheng's wife did Yoga and she was slender. Plaintiff also alleges that after complaining to Kayla Elliot about not being considered for a promotion or receiving a pay raise, Elliot confirmed that Plaintiff was not considered because of her weight. The collection of specific instances Plaintiff alleges give rise to a reasonable perception of the poor treatment of women at PC Matic and support a determination at the pleading stage that [*26]  Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that her work environment was hostile.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Plaintiff's FEHA sexual harassment and failure to prevent harassment claims. See Rutledge v. ADP Inc., No. 22-CV-0898-L-BLM, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 209171, 2022 WL 17069839, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 17, 2022) ("having already determined that Plaintiff adequately pled the requisite foundation of discrimination and harassment, it follows that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for failure to prevent discrimination and harassment.").
Additionally, because Plaintiff adequately pleads her FEHA discrimination claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiff can maintain her derivative claim for wrongful termination. See Ayala v. Frito Lay, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 3d 891, 913 (E.D. Cal. 2017) ("Having found that plaintiff has adequately pled her FEHA claims for discrimination and retaliation, the court concludes that plaintiff may maintain derivative claims for wrongful termination.").
Accordingly, the Motion is therefore also DENIED as to Claim 12.

b. Claim 3: Disparate Treatment
To establish a disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the employee's membership in a classification protected by the statute; (2) discriminatory animus on the part of the employer toward members of that classification; (3) an action by the employer adverse to the employee's [*27]  interests; (4) a causal link between the discriminatory animus and the adverse action; (5) damage to the employee; and (6) a causal link between the adverse action and the damage. Arnold v. Dignity Health, 53 Cal. App. 5th 412, 424-25, 266 Cal. Rptr. 3d 253, 263-64 (2020).
Defendants argue Plaintiff's disparate impact allegations are not plausible because she has not alleged discriminatory animus or a link between discriminatory animus and an adverse action. (Motion at 15). Defendants argue that Plaintiff's allegations that male colleagues got to travel on sale trips or were given second chances to cure work are conclusory. (Id.). Further, Defendants contend Plaintiff's allegations suggest her weight, not her gender, was the prominent basis for being treated differently. (Id.).
The Court disagrees. At this stage, Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient allegations to raise a plausible FEHA disparate treatment claim. Plaintiff alleges that she was prevented from traveling to trade shows based on her weight (Complaint ¶¶ 13-15, 30), refused a raise for years despite her heavy workload (id. ¶¶ 18-22), paid significantly less than her male counterparts (id. ¶ 29), and terminated without the opportunity to cure late work that was afforded to her male counterparts (id. ¶ 52). Plaintiff [*28]  adequately pleads discriminatory animus as she alleges that she was told she was denied a raise because she was overweight and that Cheng would vet female job candidates by looking at their photographs to make sure they were not "fat" or "ugly." (Id. (citing Complaint ¶ 21)). Plaintiff's allegations of Cheng's comments and treatment of female employees is sufficient to raise an inference that Cheng's discriminatory animus against women caused Plaintiff to be treated more harshly, be subjected to weight-related restrictions that did not apply to male employees, and be passed over for commission-earning opportunities, promotions, raises, and the chance to cure the issue which led to her termination. Moreover, Defendants do not cite and the Court did not find any cases where a court dismissed a FEHA disparate treatment claim on similar or more detailed allegations.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Claim 3.

4. California Labor Code Claims
Defendants first argue that Plaintiff's California Labor Code claims should be dismissed because Plaintiff does not plead compliance with the Private Attorneys General Act ("PAGA"). (Motion at 16). Plaintiff contends Defendants' argument is irrelevant [*29]  because Plaintiff does not bring any claim pursuant to PAGA and does not seek civil penalties under PAGA. (Opposition at 5); see also Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, 142 S. Ct. 1906, 1914, 213 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2022) (describing PAGA as statutory scheme allowing a plaintiff to bring a representative action on behalf of California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency to collect civil penalties). Defendants appear to agree and do not contest Plaintiff's argument. The Court therefore does not address this argument.
Defendants next argue that Plaintiff's California Labor Code claims should be dismissed on the merits.

a. Claim 4: Violation of Equal Pay
Under California Labor Code section 1197.5, it is unlawful to pay any employees less than employees of the opposite sex for "substantially similar work." Courts have required a plaintiff asserting a claim under section 1197.5 to "plead facts showing that a comparator employee's roles required substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and were performed under similar working conditions." Davis v. Inmar Inc., 2022 WL 3722122 at *5 (citing Werner v. Advance Newhouse P'ship, LLC, No. 13-CV-01259-LJO, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117285, 2013 WL 4487475, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2013)).
Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to state a claim under section 1197.5 because she makes no allegations that show that her male colleagues do substantially similar work. (Motion at 16-17). Plaintiff argues that she has stated a claim because the alleges that she was told that [*30]  she was denied a pay raise because she was overweight, a characteristic with which Defendants were concerned only in regard to their female employees. (Opposition at 12).
The Complaint includes allegations that male sales representatives were given different commission-earning opportunities then her (Complaint ¶ 30); that she was told that she was denied a pay raise because of her weight (id. ¶ 21); and that she was performing work substantially similar to that of her male counterparts (id. ¶ 79). Stating that unidentified comparators perform "substantially similar work" is a legal conclusion. See Werner, WL 4487475, at *5 (dismissing claim for violation of nearly identical Equal Pay Act provision where the plaintiff alleged only that she was paid less than similarly situated male employees). Without facts that show that comparators' roles required substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that these same comparators received raises or opportunities that she did not, Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim under section 1197.5. See Davis v. Inmar Inc., 2022 WL 3722122 at *5 (dismissing section 1197.5 claim where complaint did not allege adequate facts comparing plaintiff to opposite-gender coworkers).
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED [*31]  with leave to amend as to Claim 4.

b. Claim 5: Failure to Pay Overtime
California Labor Code section 510 states that "[a]ny work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee." To plead an overtime wages claim, "a plaintiff asserting a claim to overtime payments must allege that she worked more than forty hours in a given workweek without being compensated for the overtime hours worked during that workweek." Landers v. Quality Commc'ns, Inc., 771 F.3d 638, 644-45 (9th Cir. 2014); Carter v. Rasier-CA, LLC, 724 F. App'x 586, 587 (9th Cir. 2018) (affirming district court's application of Landers to the plaintiff's claims arising under state and federal law). "A plaintiff may establish a plausible claim by estimating the length of her average workweek during the applicable period and the average rate at which she was paid, the amount of overtime wages she believes she is owed, or any other facts that will permit the court to find plausibility." Id. at 645. While Rule 8 does not require an especially high degree of detail, "with the pleading of more specific facts, the closer the complaint moves toward plausibility." Id.
Defendants argue Plaintiff [*32]  fails to state a claim for overtime wages because she does not specify any specific date of overtime or actions taken by Defendants to force uncompensated overtime. (Motion at 17). Defendants also argue that Cheng cannot be held liable because Plaintiff does not make any specific allegations the Cheng personally violated the overtime provision. (Id.).
The Court agrees that the Complaint falls short of federal pleading standards for her overtime wage claim. Plaintiff alleges that her job duties expanded between September 2017 and 2019 (Complaint ¶ 18-21) and that she worked over 10 hours per day after February 2020 when her job duties expanded again. (id. ¶¶ 22, 29). Landers states that allegations that fail to "provide sufficient detail about the length and frequency of [a plaintiff's] unpaid work to support a reasonable inference that [the plaintiff] worked more than forty hours in a given week" will not survive a motion to dismiss. Landers, 771 F.3d at 646. While plaintiffs cannot be expected to allege "with mathematical precision the amount of overtime compensation owed by the employer" or the hours for which their employer did not pay them, Landers sets forth a pleading standard requiring that a plaintiff set forth [*33]  at least one specific week as to when overtime work occurred. Id; see also Sanchez v. Ritz Carlton, No. 15-cv-3484-PSG (PJWx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119770, 2015 WL 5009659, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2015) (dismissing claim where plaintiff failed to factually allege schedules to substantiate that his shifts would trigger overtime pay). Plaintiff fails to meet that standard here. See also Pruitt v. Swift Pork Co., No. CV 15-00187 MMM (MANx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 199988, 2015 WL 13916670 at *11 (C.D. Cal. May 4, 2015) (dismissing an overtime claim that relied on "threadbare recitals" of elements and insufficient factual allegations).
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Claim 5.

c. Claim 7: Failure to Provide Meal and Rest Breaks
California Labor Code section 512(a) prohibits employers from requiring employees to work a "period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than 30 minutes," unless the total workday lasts six or fewer hours. Additionally, California Labor Code section 226.7(d) provides that "[a]n employer shall not require an employee to work during a meal or rest or recovery period mandated pursuant to an applicable statute, or applicable regulation, standard, or order." Where "an employer fails to provide an employee a meal or rest or recovery period in accordance with a state law," an employee is owed one additional hour's wages at the regular rate "for each workday that the meal or rest or recovery period is not provided." [*34]  Cal. Lab. Code § 226.7(c).
Courts have applied the Landers pleading standards to California meal and rest period claims. See, e.g., Reyna v. WestRock Co., No. 20-cv-01666-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153575, 2020 WL 5074390, at *7-8 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2020); Guerrero v. Halliburton Energy Servs. Inc., No. 1:16-CV-1300-LJO-JLT, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152141, 2016 WL 6494296, at *5-6 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2016); Byrd v. Masonite Corp., No. EDCV 16-35 JGB (KKx), 2016 WL 756523, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2016).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claim fails because Plaintiff does not identify any specific instance where Defendants denied a meal or rest. (Motion at 18).
The Court agrees. Plaintiff alleges that "due to the volume of work she was assigned, [she] lacked the opportunity to take meal or rest breaks." (Complaint ¶ 3). Plaintiff does not point to specific workdays or instances she was forced to work through meal or rest breaks. Cf. Landers, 771 F.3d at 646 ("However, at a minimum the plaintiff must allege at least one workweek when he worked in excess of forty hours and was not paid for the excess hours in that workweek, or was not paid minimum wages."). Plaintiff does not provide the number of hours she worked on a specific day, the amount of meal or rest time she was entitled to or the amount of pay she is owed. Plaintiff's allegations are "so threadbare or speculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory and the factual." Id., 771 F.3d at 642.
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Claim 7.
Similarly, Plaintiff's related failure to provide an accurate wage statement claim (Claim 6) [*35]  also fails. See Duley v. Centerra Grp., LLC, No. 2:19-cv-08754-AB (JCx), 2020 WL 6526369, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2020) (dismissing wage statement claim where plaintiff "fails to provide any factual allegations as to at least one specific wage statement that was deficient in the alleged ways").
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Claim 6.

d. Claim 14: Retaliation
California Labor Code section 1102.5(b) is "California's general whistleblower statute." Hawkins v. City of Los Angeles, 40 Cal. App. 5th 384, 392, 252 Cal. Rptr. 3d 849 (2019). It provides:
An employer . . . shall not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information . . . to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance . . . if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee's job duties.
Cal. Lab. Code § 1102.5.
The California Supreme Court recently clarified that claims brought under section 1102.5 follow a two-step burden-shifting process prescribed by section 1102.6. See Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc., 12 Cal. 5th 703, 718, 289 Cal. Rptr.     3d 572 (2022). First, plaintiff must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that retaliation for an employee's protected activities was a contributing factor in a contested [*36]  employment action. Id. Second, and only if Plaintiff has made the required showing, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the action in question for legitimate, independent reasons even had the plaintiff not engaged in protected activity. Id.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege a retaliation claim because she does not specify to whom in management she complained or when she made the complaint. (Motion at 18-19 (citing Killgore v. SpecPro Pro. Servs., LLC, 51 F.4th 973, 986 (9th Cir. 2022); Reply at 10-11).
Plaintiff argues that she is not required to allege the who, what, where, when, and how of a retaliation claim. (Opposition at 15). Plaintiff argues that she sufficiently pleads her retaliation claim by alleging that she complained to PC Matic about her inability to take breaks, PC Matic's failure to provide reasonable accommodations, and PC Matic's gender-based discrimination.
"Although there is some split of authority, the majority of courts require plaintiffs bringing section 1102.5(b) claims to allege the specific rule, regulation or statute they reasonably believed had been violated, and the factual basis for their reasonable belief." La v. San Mateo Cty. Transit Dist., No. 14-CV-01768-WHO, 2014 WL 4632224, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2014) (citations omitted). Indeed, the Court [*37]  notes that the majority of decisions issued by California district courts in recent years seem to require such specificity in order to state a claim for violation of section 1102.5(b). See, e.g., Clevland v. Ludwig Inst. for Cancer Rsch. Ltd., No. 21-CV-871-JM (JLBx), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3983, 2022 WL 80265, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2022) (dismissing portion of section 1102.5 claim premised on the plaintiffs' belief that the "[d]efendant violated some provision of 2 CFR Part 200" as insufficiently pleaded because "[their] citation to a 'whole statutory framework does not serve this purpose [of giving the defendant fair notice of the grounds on which the claim rests]'"); Fleeman v. Cty. of Kern, No. 20-cv-321-NONE-JLT, 2021 WL 1221469, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2021) (granting motion to dismiss section 1102.5 claim because, inter alia, "Plaintiff's complaint also fails to identify what statute, rule, or regulation that he believed the County violated"); Chan v. Canadian Standards Ass'n, No. 19-SACV-2162-JVS (JDEx), 2020 WL 2496174, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2020) (concluding that, to state a section 1102.5 claim, "[a] plaintiff must be able to identify a specific state or federal statute, rule, or regulation which he believed was being violated")
Here, while Plaintiff includes a number of factual allegations that permit a plausible inference that she believed Defendants were breaking the law, it is not entirely clear which violations of the law Plaintiff reported or to whom.
Plaintiff alleges that she complained to Kayla Elliot, a supervisor in PC Matic's marketing department that she had neither been [*38]  considered for a promotion nor received a pay raise in two years. (Complaint ¶ 21). Plaintiff also alleges that Elliot, at one point, mentioned to Cheng that Plaintiff was working long hours and was under extreme stress. (Id. ¶ 22). Neither of these allegations clearly state that Plaintiff reported what she believed was a violation of law to Elliot or identifies what the believed violation was.
Plaintiff additionally alleges that she complained "to PC Matic and/or its agents" that she was unable to take her meal and rest breaks as required under California law. Id. ¶ 148). The Court determines that this allegation is conclusory. Without more factual allegations, Plaintiff does not adequately put Defendants on notice of the protected activity for which they allegedly subjected Plaintiff to an adverse employment action. See Fleeman v. Cty. of Kern, 2021 WL 1221469, at *5 (dismissing claim with leave to amend where, inter alia, "there are no allegations in plaintiff's complaint regarding what statements were allegedly made or to whom. . ."); Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555) (a court is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.").
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Claim 14 as well.

5. Disability [*39]  Discrimination and Related Claims
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims—Claim 9 (disability discrimination), Claim 10 (failure to provide reasonable accommodation), and Claim 11 (failure to engage in interactive process)—should be dismissed because Plaintiff's related allegations are conclusory. (Motion at 19). In particular, Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to allege a causal nexus between Plaintiff's disability and an adverse employment action. (Reply at 11).

a. Claim 9: Disability Discrimination
Section 12940(a) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of a physical disability. The elements of a disability discrimination claim are that the employee (1) suffered from a disability or was regarded as suffering from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of a job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability. Price v. Victor Valley Union High Sch. Dist., 85 Cal. App. 5th 231, 239, 301 Cal. Rptr. 3d 177 (2022). A plaintiff must prove that the disability "was a substantial motivating reason" for the adverse action. Id. at 244.
Plaintiff alleged that she "suffers from celiac disease, a fact that she disclosed to PC Matic upon her [*40]  hire and on numerous occasions thereafter." (Complaint ¶ 115). Plaintiff alleges that after she accidentally ingested wheat, resulting in an adverse reaction, she informed PC Matic that she was using a half sick day and was fired the next day. (Id. ¶ 115, 117).
Defendants argue there are no allegations that show that her separation was because of her disability. (Motion at 18).
At the pleading stage, the Court determines that the close proximity of Plaintiff's onset of celiac disease symptoms and her termination gives rise to a plausible inference that she was terminated "because of" her disability. Alejandro v. ST Micro Elecs., Inc, 129 F. Supp. 3d 898, 910 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiff who was terminated for missing work sufficiently alleged that absence was the result of his disability); cf. Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 507 (9th Cir. 2000) ("[W]hen adverse decisions are taken within a reasonable period of time after complaints of discrimination have been made, retaliatory intent may be inferred.").
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Claim 9.

b. Claim 10: Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation
FEHA makes it an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer ... to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee." [*41]  Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). In order to state a claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff must allege that he suffers from a physical or mental disability, that he is a qualified individual, and that Defendants failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability. Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000).
Defendants argue Plaintiff's claim fails because she does not allege what a reasonable accommodation would be and how PC Matic thwarted her ability to treat her symptoms. (Motion at 19-20).
Plaintiff argues that Defendants failed to accommodate her by firing her for taking a sick day related to her celiac disease symptoms. (Opposition at 16 (citing Complaint ¶¶ 117-18)).
"An employee cannot demand clairvoyance of his employer." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal.App.4th 426, 443, 60 Cal.Rptr.3d 359 (2007). "It is an employee's responsibility to understand his or her own physical or mental condition     well enough to present the employer at the earliest opportunity with a concise list of restrictions which must be met to accommodate the employee." Id. (quoting Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 266). At the same time, "[e]mployees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have," so employees do not bear the entire burden of identifying reasonable [*42]  accommodations. Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 262. "Holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Id. at 263. The Ninth Circuit has held in reference to a Washington statute similar to FEHA, that "[a]s long as at the time of [the plaintiff's] termination, there were plausible reasons to believe that the handicap could have been accommodated by [a] leave of absence, [the employer] is responsible for its failure to offer such a leave." Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 878 (9th Cir. 1989) (brackets omitted).
Here, Plaintiff alleges that she informed Defendants of her symptoms related to her disability. (Complaint ¶ 116). This triggered an affirmative duty for Defendants to provide reasonable accommodation to Plaintiff. See Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 950-51, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997). Plaintiff alleges that she submitted a half sick day, meeting her responsibility to alert Defendants to the type of accommodation she required. Permitting Plaintiff to take the time off when she experienced incapacitation due to her disabilities would have been a form of reasonable accommodation, see Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 262, yet Plaintiff alleges [*43]  she was terminated soon after submitting her sick day. (Complaint ¶ 117). Plaintiff therefore adequately alleges a claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Claim 10.

c. Claim 11: Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Employers must engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with an employee to determine reasonable accommodations for the employee's disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To state a claim under this section, Plaintiff must show that she "tendered a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007). So long as the employee is disabled and qualified to perform his job duties, the employer has an affirmative duty "to explore further methods of accommodation before terminating [the employee]." Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege that she tendered a specific request for a necessary accommodation. (Motion at 20).
As discussed above, the Court determines Plaintiff sufficiently alleged that she tendered a request for an accommodation when she submitted her half sick day on July 31, 2022, to Sheila Molden on Defendants' Human Resources team. (Complaint ¶¶ 50, 116). Despite Plaintiff's explanation of her disability and need [*44]  for accommodation, the Complaint alleges that Defendants terminated Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 117). These allegations adequately show that Defendants failed to meet its duty "to explore further methods of accommodation before terminating [Plaintiff]." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1137
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Claim 11.

6. Remaining Claims
Defendants argue Claim 8, failure to provide notice of available sick leave, must be dismissed because California Labor Code section 246 does not provide a private cause of action. (Motion at 20); see Carralez v. Satellite Healthcare, Inc., No. 2:22-cv-01613-KJM (DB), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 215784, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2022) (discussing state court dismissal of claims under § 246 because the statute provides no private cause of action).    
Plaintiff states she will dismiss this claim without prejudice. (Opposition at 17 n. 2). That representation is deemed a voluntary request for dismissal under Rule 41, which is GRANTED, and therefore that claim should not be included in the First Amended Complaint.
Defendants next argue that Claim 15, retaliation under Labor Code section 246.5, should be dismissed because it is derivative of Plaintiff's other sick leave claim. (Motion at 20). Plaintiff argues Claim 15 is not derivative because she alleges that Defendants terminated her because she used accrued sick time and was fired the next day. (Opposition at 17).
California Labor Code section 246.5(c) provides that: [*45] 
"(1) An employer shall not deny an employee the right to use accrued sick days, discharge, threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for using accrued sick days, attempting to exercise the right to use accrued sick days, filing a complaint with the department or alleging a violation of this article, cooperating in an investigation or prosecution of an alleged violation of this article, or opposing any policy or practice or act that is prohibited by this article."
Plaintiff alleges that she used an accrued sick day (a half-day) on August 1, 2022, and was terminated that same day in substantial part because of her use of the sick day. (Complaint ¶¶ 156-158). Plaintiff therefore sufficiently alleges a violation of Cal. Lab. Code section 246.5.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED as to Claim 15.

IV. CONCLUSION
The Motion is GRANTED with leave to amend as to Claims 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14.
The Motion is DENIED as to Claims 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15.
The request for voluntary dismissal without prejudice of Claim 8 is GRANTED.
Plaintiff may file a First Amended Complaint, if any, on or before June 12, 2023. Failure to file a First Amended Complaint shall be deemed a decision to [*46]  stand on the remaining portions of the Complaint, which Defendant should then answer by July 3, 2023. If Plaintiff files a First Amended Complaint, then Defendants shall likewise respond on or before July 3, 2023.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
