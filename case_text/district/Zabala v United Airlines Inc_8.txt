ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant United Airlines, Inc. ("Defendant" or "United")'s Motion for Summary Final Judgment [DE 89], filed on March 27, 2020. The Court has carefully considered the Motion, pro se Plaintiff Maria Zabala ("Plaintiff" or "Zabala")'s Response [DE 106], Defendant's Reply [DE 112], Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [DE 90], Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Statement of Facts [DE 107], Defendant's Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Its Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [DE 113], the evidence submitted in the record, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.

I. BACKGROUND
On October 17, 2018, Plaintiff Zabala filed the instant action against Defendant United, her former employer. [*2]  See [DE 1]. Plaintiff asserted two claims against Defendant based on its alleged failure to accommodate her disability and its alleged discriminatory termination on the basis of her disability: violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1210, et seq. ("ADA") (Count I); and violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. § 760.10, et seq. ("FCRA") (Count II).
On March 27, 2020, Defendant filed the instant motion, arguing that it is entitled to summary judgment. The Motion is now ripe for review.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Rule 56(a), "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant bears "the stringent burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Sauve v. Lamberti, 597 F. Supp. 2d 1312, 1315 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)).
"A fact is material for the purposes of summary judgment only if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law." Kerr v. McDonald's Corp., 427 F.3d 947, 951 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted). Furthermore, "[a]n issue [of material fact] is not 'genuine' if it is unsupported by the evidence or is created by evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly probative.'" Flamingo S. Beach I Condo. Ass'n, Inc. v. Selective Ins. Co. of Southeast, 492 F. App'x 16, 26 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). "A mere [*3]  scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party's position is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment; there must be evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party." Id. at 26-27 (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252). Accordingly, if the moving party shows "that, on all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, no reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party" then "it is entitled to summary judgment unless the nonmoving party, in response, comes forward with significant, probative evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact." Rich v. Sec'y, Fla. Dept. of Corr., 716 F.3d 525, 530 (11th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).

II. UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS1
On May 1, 2008, United hired Zabala as an Airport Administrative Specialist. DSOF ¶ 1; PSOF ¶ 1.2 Plaintiff was terminated by United on July 18, 2008 and was rehired on August 20, 2008. DSOF ¶ 2; PSOF ¶ 2.3 On August 1, 2011, Plaintiff assumed a role as an Airport Operations Station Support Coordinator. DSOF ¶ 3; PSOF ¶ 3. A written job description for the Airport Operations Station Support Coordinator at Ft. Lauderdale, FL stated that responsibilities associated with the position included performing administrative activities and functions [*4]  associated with scheduling payroll, accounts payable, report preparation and wellness administration associated with office and personnel functions. It further specified that the position's responsibilities included: "performs personnel-related duties including filing, process payroll in accordance with provisions of union agreements and company policy," and "provide support for management by coordination and preparation of reports associated with personnel functions." DSOF ¶ 4; PSOF ¶ 4.4 Plaintiff was unable to perform payroll-related tasks, with or without accommodation. DSOF ¶ 5; PSOF ¶ 5. Performing payroll-related tasks was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. DSOF ¶ 5; PSOF ¶ 5.5
At all times material, United's written unpaid medical leave policy contained the following provisions:
a. The length of leave is the shortest of the period of incapacity (certified by a doctor), three years (off work consecutively in any leave status), or a period of time equal to the employee's total length of service as long as the appropriate medical reports are submitted to and approved by the United Medical Department.
b. In extenuating circumstances, extensions beyond the maximum leave [*5]  period may be requested. The request must be submitted 30 to 60 days before the expiration of leave. An extension requires review by United Medical and approval by Human Resources. An employee who does not return to work prior to exhausting the maximum leave period (including any approved extension) is separated.
DSOF ¶ 7; PSOF ¶ 7.6
In January 2015, Plaintiff requested and was approved for medical leave. DSOF ¶ 8; PSOF ¶ 8.7 For the purposes of the three-year United Unpaid Medical Leave Policy, although Plaintiff ceased activity duty with United in January 2015, she was not designated as being on unpaid medical leave until June 1, 2015. DSOF ¶ 9; PSOF ¶ 9.8 United sent Plaintiff more than thirty requests for medical documentation to support her absence between June of 2015 and March of 2018. DSOF ¶ 10; PSOF ¶ 10; see [DE 91-2 at pp. 10-49].9 The requests invited Plaintiff to engage in United's Reasonable Accommodation program by contacting the Employee Service Center. DSOF ¶ 10; PSOF ¶ 10.
On March 28, 2018, United sent Plaintiff a letter stating that her condition would be reviewed at least sixty days prior to the expiration of her unpaid leave status. DSOF ¶ 11; PSOF ¶ 11. [*6]  On April 20, 2018, Plaintiff emailed United to inquire about the letter and request that her employment dates be modified so she could be terminated and receive lifetime flight benefits, which accrue after ten years of employment with United. DSOF ¶ 12; PSOF ¶ 12. On April 27, 2018, United sent Plaintiff a letter to notify her that her unpaid medical leave would expire on June 1, 2018. DSOF ¶ 13; PSOF ¶ 13.10 On May 18, 2018, Plaintiff sent United another facsimile asking if it would change her employment dates to allow her to receive lifetime flight benefits from United without ever returning to work. DSOF ¶ 14; PSOF ¶ 14. On May 18, 2018, Plaintiff sent United a facsimile asking United to explain how to participate in the Reasonable Accommodation Process. DSOF ¶ 15; PSOF ¶ 15.
In a call with Plaintiff on May 30, 2018, United provided an overview of the reasonable accommodation program to Plaintiff. DSOF ¶ 16; PSOF ¶ 16.11 During that call, Plaintiff again asked about administratively changing her dates of employment so that she could receive lifetime flight benefits. DSOF ¶ 16; PSOF ¶ 16. Later on May 30, 2018, Plaintiff sent an email to United stating she wanted to administratively [*7]  change her dates of employment so that she could receive lifetime benefits from United without ever returning to work. DSOF ¶ 17; PSOF ¶ 17; [DE 92-4].12
On May 31, 2018, United emailed Plaintiff stating that it had left telephone messages about United's reasonable accommodation program on May 30, 2018 and May 31, 2018, and requesting that Plaintiff contact United to discuss. DSOF ¶ 18; PSOF ¶ 18.13
Plaintiff responded on May 31, 2018 that she was aware her termination date was June 1, 2018. DSOF ¶ 19; PSOF ¶ 19. United responded on May 31, 2018 by email and June 1, 2018 by letter, informing Plaintiff that United would like to speak with her about a reasonable accommodation, that a reasonable accommodation program meeting was scheduled for June 8, 2018, and asking her to supply medical records to support her request for a reasonable accommodation by June 7, 2018. DSOF ¶ 19; PSOF ¶ 19.
On June 4, 2018, United sent Plaintiff another letter confirming that the reasonable accommodation program meeting would take place on June 8, 2018 and asking for her medical records by June 7, 2018. DSOF ¶ 20; PSOF ¶ 20.14 It further informed her that the parties would "discuss [*8]  possible reasonable accommodations which the company may be able to provide in your current position, or job opportunities outside your classification consistent with your restrictions." DSOF ¶ 20; PSOF ¶ 20. It closed by providing a telephone number that she could call if she could not attend the meeting or otherwise had any questions. DSOF ¶ 20; PSOF ¶ 20.
On June 4, 2018, Plaintiff sent an email to United indicating that she was out of state. DSOF ¶ 21; PSOF ¶ 21. United responded the same day with an email stating it would still hold the reasonable accommodation meeting on June 8, 2018, and that Plaintiff should send medical documentation to United by June 7, 2018. DSOF ¶ 21; PSOF ¶ 21.
On June 6, 2018, Plaintiff emailed United acknowledging that she receiving an email notifying her that United was attempting to engage her in its reasonable accommodation program on May 31, 2018, notifying United that she would not be attending the reasonable accommodation program meeting on June 8, 2018, and acknowledging that her failure to participate in the reasonable accommodation program would likely lead to her termination. DSOF ¶ 22; PSOF ¶ 22.
Plaintiff never requested any specific and [*9]  identifiable reasonable accommodation from United to return to work in 2018. DSOF ¶ 23; PSOF ¶ 23.15 Plaintiff never identified how any reasonable accommodation would allow her to return to work and perform as an Airport Operations Station Support Coordinator. DSOF ¶ 24; PSOF ¶ 24.16
On June 8, 2018, Plaintiff did not show up to the reasonable accommodation program meeting or provide any medical information in response to United's request. DSOF ¶ 25; PSOF ¶ 25.17 On June 8, 2018, after Plaintiff refused to participate in United's reasonable accommodation program, Lascola made the decision to terminate Plaintiff and United sent Plaintiff a letter advising her that her employment had been terminated because she had exhausted her leave benefits by failing to return to work before the end of her three-year medical leave of absence. DSOF ¶ 26; PSOF ¶ 26.
Plaintiff is unaware of anyone that was not terminated after failing to return to work before exhausting their three years of United's approved unpaid medical leave. DSOF ¶ 27; PSOF ¶ 27.18
On June 13, 2018, United decided to give Plaintiff another chance, and emailed and mailed her a letter apprising her of a second reasonable accommodation [*10]  meeting on June 22, 2018 and asking her to provide medical records by June 21, 2018. DSOF ¶ 28; PSOF ¶ 28.19
On June 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed a charge against United with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). The EEOC found no cause. DSOF ¶ 29; PSOF ¶ 29.20
A medical note from Plaintiff's psychiatrist dated June 19, 2018 stated, "I have her out of work due to a psychiatric illness." DSOF ¶ 30; PSOF ¶ 30.21
On June 22, 2018, Plaintiff failed to provide any medical documents in response to United's request, to show up at the reasonable accommodation program meeting. DSOF ¶ 31; PSOF ¶ 31. On July 12, 2018, United sent Plaintiff a letter stating that because she did not submit any medical documentation in response to United's request or appear for the June 22, 2018 reasonable accommodation program meeting, she would remain separated from the company as of June 8, 2018. DSOF ¶ 32; PSOF ¶ 32.

III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff brings claims against Defendant under the ADA and the FCRA based on its alleged failure to accommodate her disability and its alleged discriminatory termination on the basis of her disability. In its summary judgment motion, Defendant submits [*11]  that there are no disputed issues of material fact as to these claims and that it is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.
Under the controlling law in the Eleventh Circuit, "[t]he burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000)). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA22, a plaintiff must show: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. See Adigun v. Express Scripts, Inc., 742 F. App'x 474, 476 (11th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 1604, 203 L. Ed. 2d 759 (2019), reh'g denied, 139 S. Ct. 2711, 204 L. Ed. 2d 1105 (2019); Garrison v. City of Tallahassee, 664 F. App'x 823, 825-26 (11th Cir. 2016); Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56. In this case, Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Defendant does contest the other two required prongs. The Court will address each, in turn.

1. Whether Plaintiff is a Qualified Individual
First, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination on the basis of her disability under the ADA or FCRA because Plaintiff fails to establish the second prong — that she was a "qualified individual" under the relevant statutes. A "qualified individual" is statutorily defined as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, [*12]  with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
As the Eleventh Circuit explained in D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., if an individual is unable to perform an essential function of his job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a qualified individual and, therefore, not covered under the ADA:
The ADA prohibits employment discrimination against a "qualified individual with a disability," defined as an "individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff "must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform [*13]  the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." Davis, 205 F.3d at 1305. If the individual "is unable to perform an essential function of his ... job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a 'qualified individual' and, therefore, not covered under the ADA. In other words, the ADA does not require [the employer] to eliminate an essential function of [the plaintiff's] job." Id. (citation omitted).
D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005). In this case, the undisputed facts establish that performing payroll-related tasks was an essential function of Plaintiff's job, and that Plaintiff was unable to perform payroll-related tasks, with or without accommodation. See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶ 5.23 Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot establish that she is a "qualified individual" within the meaning of the ADA., and Defendant therefore is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims that United failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability and Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory termination on the basis of her disability. See Siudock v. Volusia Cty. Sch. Bd., 568 F. App'x 659, 663 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer where plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" under the ADA because he could not perform an essential [*14]  function of the job with or without accommodations); Fornes v. Osceola Cty. Sheriff's Office, 179 F. App'x 633, 636 (11th Cir. 2006) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment to defendant on grounds that plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" because he could not perform all of the essential functions of the position).
On this ground alone, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment in its favor. However, the Court will nevertheless analyze the third prong, whether Plaintiff was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability.

2. Whether Plaintiff was Subjected to Unlawful Discrimination because of Her Disability
Second, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination on the basis of her disability under the ADA or FCRA because Plaintiff fails to establish the third prong -- that she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "One way a plaintiff may establish [*15]  the third prong is by showing that her employer failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability." Adigun, 742 F. App'x at 476 (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262). In this case, Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability under the ADA or FCRA in two ways: (1) failure to accommodate her disability and (2) discriminatory termination. The Court will first address Plaintiff's claims that United failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability. The Court will then analyze Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory termination on the basis of her disability.

A Failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability
As stated above, a plaintiff may establish the third prong by showing that her employer failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 see also Montgomery v. Georgia Power Co., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216281, 2017 WL 5244175, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 28, 2017) ("[A]n employer's failure to accommodate is one of several separate acts of discrimination giving rise to a separate cause of action under a separate theory of liability under the ADA."). The ADA requires an employer to provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose undue hardship to the employer. [*16]  See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001);.Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot establish a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA or the FCRA because she did not identify or request a reasonable accommodation, did not engage in the interactive process with United, and admits that no reasonable accommodation existed that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job.
Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment on the failure to accommodate claims because "Plaintiff has not met [her] evidentiary burden to show that he made a specific request for an accommodation as the ADA requires." Salem v. City of Port St. Lucie, No. 2:17-CV, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186341, 2018 WL 5631305, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2018), aff'd, 788 F. App'x 692 (11th Cir. 2019) (granting summary judgment to defendant on this basis). The Court agrees. "Before Defendant has a duty to provide such an accommodation, Plaintiff must make a specific request." D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 15-62065-CIV, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228229, 2017 WL 10379493, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2017). "An employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, however, "is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). See also Avena v. Imperial Salon & Spa, Inc., 740 F. App'x 679, 682 (11th Cir. 2018) ("Despite the clear case law requiring her to allege that she had made a specific request for accommodations, Avena failed to do so. Thus, the district court did not [*17]  err in dismissing this claim."); Gil v. Broward Cty., Fla., No. 18-60282-CIV, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 225828, 2018 WL 4941108, at *3 (S.D. Fla. May 7, 2018) (dismissing failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim where plaintiff failed to allege that he made a specific demand for an accommodation). The undisputed facts demonstrate that Plaintiff never requested any specific and identifiable reasonable accommodation from United to return to work in 2018. In April of 2018, when Plaintiff's three years of medical leave was near the June 1, 2018 expiration, Plaintiff inquired into how to engage in United's reasonable accommodation process but then never participated in that process despite multiple invitations to do so, and failed to request any specific accommodation. See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶¶15-25. Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See, e.g., Cazeau v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 614 F. App'x 972, 982 (11th Cir. 2015) (affirming district court's entry of summary judgment for Defendant and holding that "[b]ecause no specific demand for an accommodation was made, Wells Fargo had no duty to provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA."). While this alone merits summary judgment as to this claim, the Court [*18]  also briefly addresses Defendant's other arguments below.
Defendant is also entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's failure to provide reasonable accommodation claim on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to present record evidence demonstrating that at or around the time of her termination a reasonable accommodation was available that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001) ("An accommodation is reasonable, and hence required by the ADA, "only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job."); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the employee bears the burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her job); Zalezhnev v. Wonderworld Montessori Acad. Corp., No. 19-CIV-60268-RAR, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220494, 2019 WL 7633182, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 23, 2019) (granting summary judgment to defendant on grounds that the "Plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation that would permit Plaintiff to perform the essential duties of his job is fatal to his ADA claim."). It is undisputed that Plaintiff was unable to perform payroll-related tasks, an essential function of her job, with or without accommodation. See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶¶5. Additionally, [*19]  "reasonable accommodation is by its terms most logically construed as that which, presently, or in the immediate future, enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job in question." Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.1995)). However, around the end of her three year unpaid medical leave period, Plaintiff was being kept out of work entirely by her psychiatrist. See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶¶30. Furthermore, the Court notes that where, as here, the employee fails to meet her burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her job, the employer has no affirmative duty to engage in an "interactive process"24 or to show undue hardship. Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 948 (11th Cir. 2015). Here, the undisputed material facts demonstrate that United attempted to begin an interactive process but that Plaintiff's "actions caus[d]e a breakdown in the interactive process." Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997) (affirming entry of summary judgment for employer on ADA discrimination claim). See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶¶19-31.

B. Discriminatory termination on the basis of her disability
As stated above, a plaintiff may satisfy the third prong of a claim for discrimination on the basis of a disability under the ADA or [*20]  FCRA by establishing that she was terminated on the basis of her disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case that she was terminated on the basis of her disability through circumstantial evidence using the McDonnell Douglas25 burden-shifting analysis. See Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn v. Murata Electronics North America, Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.1999); Morgan v. GEO Grp., Inc., No. 18-62774-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20406, 2020 WL 948466, at *13 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 5, 2020). "Under that framework, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by proving, among other things, that she was treated differently from another 'similarly situated' individual—in court-speak, a 'comparator.'" Lewis v. City of Union City, Georgia, 918 F.3d 1213, 1217 (11th Cir. 2019). Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to meet this initial burden. The Court agrees. Plaintiff did not identify a similarly situated comparator that incurred differential treatment. Rather, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is unaware of anyone that was not terminated after failing to return to work before exhausting their three years of United's approved unpaid medical leave. See supra, Undisputed Material Facts at SOF ¶ 27. Where, as here, Plaintiff has presented no evidence that she was treated differently than other similarly situated individuals, Defendant is [*21]  entitled to summary judgment. See Payne v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 760 F. App'x 803, 810 (11th Cir. 2019) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer where plaintiff did not meet his burden to identify any similarly-situated comparator who was not terminated); Morgan v. GEO Grp., Inc., No. 18-62774-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20406, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20406, 2020 WL 948466, at *14 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 5, 2020) (granting summary judgment for defendant where plaintiff "has adduced no evidence that he was treated differently than other similarly situated individuals"). Lastly, while the Court need not reach the issues of Defendant's proffered reason for termination — that she exhausted her three year leave under United's leave policy — is pretextual, as the burden never shifted to Defendant,26 the Court notes that Plaintiff has also has failed to "come forward with evidence . . . sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision, also entitling Defendant to summary judgment. See Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1243.

IV. CONCLUSION
