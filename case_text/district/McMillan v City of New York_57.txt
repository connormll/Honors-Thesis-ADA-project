MEMORANDUM ORDER
JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.
Plaintiff Rodney McMillan, a caseworker employed by the New York City Human Resources Administration ("HRA"), brings this action against defendant the City of New York for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12112 et seq. ("ADA"); the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Executive Law §§ 290, et seq. ("SHRL"); and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Administrative Code §§ 8-101, et. seq. ("CHRL"). Plaintiff alleges that defendant discriminated against him on the basis of his disabilities. Plaintiff further alleges that defendant failed to accommodate his disabilities by, inter alia, refusing to allow him to change his work schedule, failing to provide him with a personal printer, failing to train him in voice-recognition software, and refusing to reduce his case load.
On January 14, 2011 defendant  [*2] moved for summary judgment on all of plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff filed opposition papers on February 4, 2011; defendant filed reply papers on February 11, 2011; and the Court heard oral argument on February 17, 2011. After careful consideration, the Court hereby grants summary judgment to the defendant, and dismisses plaintiffs' complaint, in its entirety, with prejudice.
The relevant facts, either undisputed or, where disputed, taken most favorably to the plaintiff, are as follows. Plaintiff is a 52-year old man who was born without a left arm and who suffers from schizophrenia. Deposition of Rodney McMillan, dated November 30, 2010 ("Pl. Dep.") at 23:20, 45:15-19, 52:11-13.2. In December 1987, plaintiff was appointed to the position of case worker at the New York City Human Resources Administration ("HRA"). Id. at 30:1-2, 31:4-10. In 1997, plaintiff was assigned to work as a case manager for HRA's Community Alternative Systems Agency ("CASA"), in which capacity he administers home care services to elderly and disabled clients. Id. at 34:3-10, 100:24-101:5.
Plaintiff's unit works on a "flex time" schedule that allows employees to arrive to work within certain designated one-hour windows  [*3] of time. Deposition of Loshun Thornton, dated December 8, 2010 ("Thornton Dep.") at 116-121. Plaintiff's flex time schedule allows him to report to work any time between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, with a 15-minute grace period. Pl. Dep. at 66:6-68:23. Accordingly, the latest plaintiff can arrive at work without being considered late is 10:15 AM. Id. Plaintiff is expected to work thirty-five hours a week and to take an hour for lunch, see Deposition of Daphne Vinson, dated December 16, 2010 ("Vinson Dep.") at 54:16-56:24; Declaration of Michael G. O'Neill in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, dated February 4, 2011 ("O'Neill Decl.") ¶ 26, which means that if he arrives to work at 10:00 AM he is expected to stay until 6:00 PM, with a one-hour lunch break.
Plaintiff avers that he has great difficulty arriving at work on time on a consistent basis because the medication he takes to treat his schizophrenia interferes with his natural sleep cycle. Pl. Dep. at 52:16-17; 63:12-64:8; 67:7. Plaintiff is required to take additional medications to go to sleep at night and to help him wake up in the morning, and these medications can make him very drowsy. Id. at 52:16-17; 63:12-64:8;  [*4] 67:7. As a result, it is undisputed that during the year-long period from September 2, 2008 to September 30, 2009 plaintiff was late without authorization 182 times for a total of 7,638 minutes (about 127 hours or about 18 seven-hour work days). See Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment ("Def. Mem.") at 6; Pl. Dep. at 130:5-9; Declaration of Andrea O'Connor, dated January 14, 2011 ("O'Connor Decl.") Ex. L ("Charges and Specifications," dated March 15, 2010); O'Connor Decl. Ex. R (plaintiff's time records).
Plaintiff summarizes the defendant's policies regarding tardiness as follows:
At plaintiff's workplace, a lateness can be approved or disapproved. Vinson Dep. 43:22-44:25. When a lateness is approved, an employee may apply accumulated annual leave or sick leave or other banked leave to the lateness and be paid for that time. Vinson Dep. 43:22-44:25. Alternatively, if the employee has no banked time, or simply does not want to use banked time, the lateness will be unpaid. Vinson 65:16-66:13. In addition, an approved lateness (whether paid or not) will not be the basis for any disciplinary action against the employee. Vinson Dep. 117:19-118:14. In  [*5] contrast, a lateness that is not approved is always unpaid and can result in disciplinary action against the employee.
Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment ("Pl. Mem.") at 8 (footnote omitted). Up until 2008, plaintiff's supervisor generally approved plaintiff's tardiness. Pl. Dep. at 144-148. That year, however, Jeanne Belthrop — the supervisor of plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Lashun Thornton — instructed Thornton to disapprove plaintiff's instances of lateness "because [plaintiffs' lateness had] been an ongoing problem for years" and was "excessive." Thornton Dep. at 135-149.
To avoid being disciplined for lateness, plaintiff made verbal requests for a later "flex time" window. Id. at 116-121. On June 9, 2008, Belthrop and Thornton held a "supervisory conference" with plaintiff concerning his lateness, which Belthrop memorialized in a November 5, 2008 memorandum. O'Neill Decl. Ex. G. The memorandum indicates that plaintiff and his supervisors discussed the impact of plaintiff's medication on his ability to arrive to work on time and the possibility of adjusting his medication. 1 In the fall of 2008, plaintiff provided his supervisors  [*6] with letters from Dr. Kenneth M. Berc, his treating psychiatrist, describing the extent of plaintiff's disability, the impossibility of adjusting plaintiff's medication schedule, and plaintiff's need for an accommodation. See O'Neill Decl. Ex. F (letter from Kenneth M. Berc, dated October 1, 2008); O'Neill Decl. Ex. H (letter from Kenneth M. Berc to J. Belthrop and Hazel C. Stewart, dated December 20, 2008); Thornton Dep. at 203-205. On August 21, 2008, plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC.
On May 8, 2009, plaintiff was fined 8 days pay. O'Neill Decl. Ex. I. On December 8, 2009, Belthrop forwarded a memo concerning plaintiff's excessive lateness to Denise Heyward, the Director of CASA V (plaintiff's work unit) for disciplinary action. O'Neill Dec. Ex. K (memorandum from Jeanne Belthrop to Denise Heyward, dated December 8, 2009). In April 2010, Charges and Specifications of "Misconduct and/or Incompetence" were brought against plaintiff. O'Connor Decl. Ex. L. Following an informal conference on April 22, 2010, Michael Fitzpatrick, defendant's "Informal Conference Holder," recommended that plaintiff's employment be terminated. O'Connor Decl. Ex. M. Plaintiff's union representative,  [*8] Reuben Adeshuko, accompanied plaintiff to the Step II hearing and stated that although plaintiff was guilty of the charges, his lateness was due to mitigating circumstances. O'Connor Decl. Ex. N. The Office of Labor Relations therefore took the possibility of termination off the table and administered a sixty-day suspension without pay, id., a penalty which was later reduced to a 30-day suspension without pay, O'Connor Decl. Ex. O.
On March 23, 2010 and again on April 22, 2010, plaintiff submitted formal requests for reasonable accommodations, including a request for a later flex starting time. O'Connor Decl. Exs. D, K. These requests were forwarded to Donald Lemons, defendant's Deputy Director of Equal Employment Opportunity. Deposition of Donald Lemons, dated December 20, 2010 ("Lemons Dep.") at 43-45.11. Lemons spoke with plaintiff's supervisor and determined that plaintiff's request for an accommodation could not be granted because there would be no supervision for plaintiff after 6:00 PM. Lemons Dep. at 43:19-21, 68. Plaintiff's time records, however, indicate that he has stayed after 6:00 PM on many occasions. O'Connor Decl. Ex. R.
In addition to his requests for a later "flex"  [*9] starting time, plaintiff made various other requests for accommodation. First, plaintiff requested voice-operated software to help compensate for his slower typing times. Pl. Dep. at 17:4-13. In 2003 or 2004, defendant installed a voice-operated software program called Dragon Naturally Speaking on plaintiff's computer. Affidavit of Verna Blake, dated January 12, 2011 ("Blake Aff.") ¶ 3; Pl. Mem. at 5. However, the requisite headset was not provided to plaintiff, rendering the software useless. Pl. Dep. at 15:21-32. Plaintiff made numerous requests for a headset between 2004 and 2010, but his requests were either ignored or denied. Pl. Dep. at 15:21-32. Following plaintiff's March 23, 2010 "Request for a Reasonable Accommodation," the defendant did provide plaintiff with a headset; however, the system remains non-functional and plaintiff has never been trained in its use. Pl. Dep. at 12:9-15; 116:18-121:9-21.
Second, the personal printer plaintiff had on his desk for about ten years broke in late 2009. Pl. Dep. at 124:1-2. His requests for a new printer were ignored until this lawsuit was filed. Pl. Dep. at 125:22-24. On December 13, 2010, a new printer was installed on plaintiff's desk.  [*10] O'Connor Decl. Ex. J.
Third, plaintiff requested a reduced caseload in April 2010. Plaintiff testified that the greatest number of clients he ever had at one time was over 200. Pl. Dep. at 39:4-7. In 2009, plaintiff approached Heyward with a copy of his August 21, 2008 EEOC complaint, and his caseload thereafter became lighter. Id. at 43:24-45:11. 2 After plaintiff made his formal request for a reduced caseload in April 2010, Donald Lemons inquired as to whether CASA V could accommodate this request. O'Connor Decl. Ex. I. In response, Heyward advised Lemons that plaintiff's caseload was already reduced. Id.
With these facts in mind, the Court now turns to plaintiff's claims. To sustain his cause of action for disability discrimination under the ADA, plaintiff must show that: "(1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he suffers from a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he could perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability."  [*11] McDermott v. New York City Hous. Dev. Corp., 10 Civ. 2029 (HB), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4349, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2011). Courts analyze ADA discrimination claims under the same burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Platt v. Inc. Vill. of Southampton, 391 Fed. Appx. 62, 64 n.1 (2d Cir. Aug. 30, 2010) (summary order). The Second Circuit summarizes this framework as follows:
Under this analysis, the plaintiff first bears the burden of setting out a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the plaintiff demonstrates a prima facie case, that gives rise to a presumption of unlawful discrimination or retaliation, and the burden of production shifts to the defendant, who is required to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for its actions. See id. at 802-03. If the defendant offers such a rationale, the presumption of unlawful discrimination drops out and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, at which point "[i]n order to defeat summary judgment . . . , the plaintiff's admissible evidence must show circumstances that would be sufficient to permit a rational  [*12] finder of fact to infer that the defendant's employment decision was more likely than not based in whole or in part on discrimination [or retaliation]." Stern v. Trustees of Columbia Univ. in the City of N.Y., 131 F.3d 305, 312 (2d Cir. 1997).
Rosinski v. Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc., No. 09-4569-cv, 402 Fed. Appx. 535, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 18310, at *2 (2d Cir. Aug. 31, 2010).
In this case, the parties do not dispute that the City of New York is an employer that is subject to the ADA, that plaintiff suffers from a disability within the meaning of the ADA, and that plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action when he was disciplined for lateness. Defendant argues, however, that plaintiff cannot make out a prima facie case because he cannot demonstrate that he could perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation. Def. Mem. at 5. In support of this argument, defendant cites a long line of cases holding that it is "axiomatic that an employee who cannot show up for work cannot perform an 'essential function' of h[is] job." Davis v. Bowes, No. 95 Civ. 4765 (LAP), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16258, at *49 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 1997), aff'd without opinion, 159 F.3d 1346 (2d Cir. 1998).  [*13] Defendant argues, therefore, that an employee is not "otherwise qualified" for his position when he "is unable to report work at the time required, because []he is not able to perform one of the essential functions of h[is] job." Guice-Mills v. Derwinski, 772 F. Supp. 188, 199 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (finding that employee unable to report to work because of depression and effects of sedating medication was not "otherwise qualified" for position sought), aff'd, 967 F.2d 794 (2d Cir. 1992). 3
Defendant further argues that plaintiff cannot show that he could arrive to work on time with the accommodation he requested, i.e., a flex time which would allow him to arrive at work by 11:00 A.M., because plaintiff  [*15] arrived to work after 11:00 A.M. 67 times in 2008, 54 times in 2009, and 62 times from January 1 through September 10, 2011. O'Connor Decl. Ex. R. Additionally, even after plaintiff formally requested an 11:00 A.M. start time on March 23, 2010, he continued to arrive to work after 11:00 A.M. a total of 36 times. Id. Defendant therefore argues that plaintiff's request for an accommodation was, as a matter of law, unreasonable, as plaintiff demonstrated he was unable to arrive at work by the requested start time of 11:00 A.M. See, e.g., Querry v. Messar, 14 F. Supp. 2d 437, 445 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (an employer need not consider a request for an accommodation that is unreasonable); Kotlowski v. Eastman Kodak Co., 922 F. Supp. 790, 798 (W.D.N.Y. 1996) ("The ADA does not require an employer to accommodate an employee who cannot get to work."); Abato v. New York City Off-Track Betting Corp., No. 03 Civ. 5849 (LTS)(HPB), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41846, at *3 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2007) ("[p]laintiff has not provided evidence, except his own assertions, that a flexible start time . . . would have accommodated his disability") (internal citations omitted). 4
Plaintiff acknowledges  [*17] that that there is a line of cases suggesting that excessive absences render an employee unqualified for purposes of the prima facie case. Pl. Mem. at 18 (citing Ramirez v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 481 F. Supp. 2d 209, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 2007)). He argues, however, that these cases are distinguishable because they deal with absences from work, not lateness. Id. He also maintains the Second Circuit has never endorsed the line of cases relied upon by the defendant. Id. The Court is unpersuaded by these arguments. The Second Circuit has in fact affirmed the decision of at least one district court holding that an employee is not otherwise qualified for the position when he is unable to arrive at work at a designated time. See Guice-Mills v. Derwinski, 772 F. Supp. 188, 199 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), aff'd, 967 F.2d 794 (2d Cir. 1992). Moreover, the broad language of the opinions upheld by the Second Circuit may be applied equally to absence and tardiness. See, e.g., Misek-Falkoff v. IBM Corp., 854 F. Supp. 215 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) ("Some degree of regular predictable attendance is fundamental to most jobs"), aff'd, 60 F.3d 811 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 134 L. Ed. 2d 484, 116 S. Ct. 1333, 517 U.S. 1111 (1995). Furthermore,  [*18] the Court cannot discern a principled distinction between total absence from work on certain days and partial absence from work on most days. In both cases, the fundamental problem is that the employee is not physically present at the job site, an essential requirement of virtually all employment.
Plaintiff also argues, with more force, that "there is a contrary line of cases holding that absenteeism is an 'impermissible pretext for the employee's disability' where the employer is aware that the employee's 'absences were related to a disability . . . .'" Ramirez v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 481 F. Supp. 2d 209, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Morris v: City of New York, 153 F. Supp. 2d 494, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)). See also Barnett v. Revere Smelting & Ref. Corp., 67 F. Supp. 2d 378, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) ("excessive absenteeism . . . cannot analytically be considered apart from the alleged disability causing the absenteeism"); Greene v. New York, No. 95 Civ. 6580 (DAB), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7650, at *22-23 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (finding basis for inference of discrimination where employer made overt reference to employee's illness as motive for termination and supervisors knew employee's absences  [*19] were closely related to disability). The Court concludes, however, that these cases are distinguishable. For example, the Ramirez court in fact concluded that the plaintiff was unqualified for his position when he "did not provide documentation for eighteen of the sick days he took during the school year." Ramirez, 481 F. Supp. 2d at 222. In Morris, defendants did not dispute that plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, having "uniformly positive performance evaluations; won two departmental awards for excellent police work, passed the sergeant's exam, and received a recommendation from his commanding officer." Morris, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 502. Moreover, there was no evidence in the case to suggest that plaintiff's sick days were not approved by the NYPD. Id. at 503. Similarly, it was important to the court's holding in Barnett that the employee in that case "was absent only nine times during a span of one year," in specific contrast to cases involving "plaintiffs with far longer periods of absence that could only be found by a reasonable fact-finder to have impeded their ability to effectively perform their essential job functions." Barnett, 67 F. Supp. 2d at 391.  [*20] Finally, the employee's absences in Greene were approved by the employer, and the court highlighted the "absence of any allegations that Plaintiff's leave was illegitimate, or beyond the allotment approved by Defendants." Greene, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7650, at *24.
In this case, it is undisputed that plaintiff's consistent tardiness was not approved by the defendant. Indeed, during his disciplinary hearing, plaintiff did not contest the fact that his conduct violated the HRA Code of Conduct (Executive Order No. 726), Section III (No. 5), which requires that employees comply with all departmental time and leave regulations and also prohibits excessive lateness and/or absenteeism; HRA Procedure No. 03-03, Section II-G (pertaining to lateness); HRA Code of Conduct (Executive Order No. 726), Section III (No. 1); and HRA Code of Conduct (Executive Order No. 725), Section III (No. 37). See O'Connor Decl. Exs. L, M, N, O. Furthermore, in determining whether the ability to arrive at work within a designated time period with some degree of consistency is an essential function of plaintiff/s job, the Court is required to give considerable deference to the employer's judgment and its general policies.  [*21] See also Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) ("[C]onsiderable deference [must be given] to an employer's judgment regarding what functions are essential for service in a particular position.") (quotation and citation omitted); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3) ("Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to: (i) [t]he employer's judgment as to which functions are essential . . . ."); Ramirez, 481 F. Supp. 2d at 222 ("In determining whether plaintiff could perform the essential functions of his job, the Court is also required to take into account the policies of his employer with regard to absences."). In this case, it is undisputed that the City of New York has a neutral flextime policy that requires employees to report to work within a one-hour designated window of their choosing. Consistent with the long line of cases holding that an employee's presence at work is an essential function of employment, the City has determined that an ability to consistently arrive at work within a one-hour time frame is a fundamental requirement of plaintiff's position. Plaintiff has demonstrated over the course of many years that he  [*22] is simply unable to satisfy this basic prerequisite of employment. Accordingly, the Court hereby grants summary judgment to the defendant on the ground that plaintiff cannot state a prima facie case of disability discrimination because he has failed to demonstrate that he could perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodation.
As an alternative basis for granting summary judgment on this claim, the Court concludes that, even if plaintiff could state a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the defendant has offered a legitimate business reason for its decision to discipline the plaintiff. Again, plaintiff does not dispute that he was late on the dates listed in the Charges and Specifications and that he was disciplined for those latenesses." Having articulated a legitimate business reason for imposing discipline, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer's action was a pretext for discrimination. In this case, plaintiff has offered no evidence of pretext. Indeed, the evidence indicates that plaintiff was in fact treated more favorably than other employees. Although plaintiff did not dispute the charges against  [*23] him, HRA's Office of Labor Relations reduced the recommended penalty of termination to a 30-day suspension without-pay in light of the mitigating circumstances in plaintiff's case. Plaintiff has offered no evidence that defendant's action was motivated by animus against the plaintiff based on his disability. See McDermott v. New York City Hous. Dev. Corp., No. 10 Civ. 2029 (HB), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4349, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2011). Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to defendant on this basis as well.
The Court now turns to plaintiff's claims against defendant for failure to provide reasonable, accommodation. Discrimination in violation of the ADA includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "[A] plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of disability discrimination arising from a failure to accommodate by showing each of the following: (1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the  [*24] essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations." McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks, textual alterations, and citations omitted). Reasonable accommodation may include, inter alia, "modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, acquisition of devices to assist the performance of job duties, and, under certain circumstances, 'reassignment to a vacant position.'" Id. at 97 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (9) (B)). "The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment . . . ." Id. Once plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, "[t]he employer can defeat the claim if it shows (a) that making a reasonable accommodation would cause it hardship, and (b) that the hardship would be undue. The burden of proof on these two issues is on the employer." Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997).
As noted above, plaintiff submitted a form entitled "Request for Reasonable Accommodation"  [*25] to HRA's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity ("OEEO") on March 23, 2010. O'Connor Decl. Ex. D. In this request, plaintiff stated that he was "requesting voice activated equipment to do my work," "a later flex time," and "a printer to go with my specialized computer that I have had for many years." Id. On April 22, 2010, plaintiff submitted a second request for a reasonable accommodation that included, along with the requests listed above, a request for a reduced caseload. O'Connor Decl. Ex. K. Plaintiff has indicated that he made similar requests, including verbal requests to his supervisors, at various times during his employment.
With respect to plaintiff's request for a later flex starting time, the Court finds this request unreasonable as a matter of law because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he would be able to arrive at work on time even if he were granted a later flex starting time of 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM. See Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., No. 1:03-CV-266 (GLS/RFT), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26263 at *16 (N.D.N.Y Mar. 27, 2009) ("[A] requested accommodation is unreasonable if the objective circumstances demonstrate that even if granted, there is no likelihood that it  [*26] will facilitate a successful return to work."), aff'd, 353 Fed. Appx. 558, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 25142 (2d Cir. Nov. 17, 2009)). As defendant has pointed out, plaintiff arrived to work after 11:00 A.M. 67 times in 2008, 54 times in 2009, and 62 times from January 1 through September 10, 2011. O'Connor Decl. Ex. R.
In the face of this undisputed evidence, plaintiff argues that "[t]he issue is not exclusively whether plaintiff's specifically requested accommodation could be granted, but whether any reasonable accommodation could have been offered to plaintiff that would have permitted him to perform the essential functions of his job." Pl. Mem. at 28 (citing McBride, 583 F.3d at 101). Plaintiff contends that defendant failed to engage in an adequate interactive process with the plaintiff, and therefore "risk[ed] not discovering a means by which an employee's disability could have been accommodated." McBride, 583 F.3d at 101. For example, plaintiff argues that defendant could have accommodated his disability by, among other things: (1) treating all of plaintiff's lateness as approved; (2) shifting the focus of the accommodation from the time plaintiff arrives at work to whether he completes a full 35 hours  [*27] of work each week; (3) allowing plaintiff to work until 7:00 PM on the days he manages to arrive at 11:00 AM; and (4) allowing plaintiff to work through lunch and apply banked overtime to cover those days when he fails to arrive by 11:00 AM. See Pl. Mem. at 28-31.
Assuming for the purposes of this motion that it is true defendant failed to engage in a sufficiently extensive interactive process with the plaintiff, the Second Circuit held in McBride that "an employer's failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process does not form the basis of a claim under the ADA and evidence thereof does not allow a plaintiff to avoid summary judgment unless she also establishes that, at least with the aid of some identified accommodation, she was qualified for the position at issue." McBride, 583 F.3d at 101. See also Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 353 Fed. Appx. 558, 561 (2d Cir. 2009) ("Even assuming that Finch did not engage in the interactive process, however, we recently held that an employee may not rely on a company's failure to engage in an interactive process if he cannot also make a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation existed at the time of the adverse employment action.")  [*28] (citing McBride, 583 F.3d 92, at 99-101). In this case, the Court has already determined that it was an essential aspect of plaintiff's job to be able to show up at work on time. Accordingly, approving plaintiff's lateness would not be a reasonable accommodation as it would require defendant to eliminate an essential function of plaintiff's employment. See Gilbert v. Frank, 949 F.2d 637, 644 (2d Cir. 1991); Davis v. Bowes, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16258, at *49 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 1997), aff'd, 159 F.3d 1346 (2d Cir. 1998)). See also Fink v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Personnel, 53 F.3d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1995) (reasonable accommodation "does not require a lowering of standards . . . nor that the employer 'make fundamental or substantial modifications' in order to eliminate the disadvantages flowing from the disability"). Summary judgment is therefore appropriate on this ground alone. 5
Plaintiff's claim that defendant violated the ADA by refusing to reduce his caseload is meritless for the simple reason that the only competent evidence in this case suggests that plaintiff was granted a reduced caseload in 2009. See Pl. Dep. at 43:24-25; 44 (testifying that the reduction in his caseload was "substantial" and  [*30] that he was "happy" with the reduction). Although plaintiff submitted an affidavit dated February 4, 2011 stating that his caseload has increased "tremendously" since his deposition was taken, see Declaration of Rodney McMillan, dated February 4, 2011 ("McMillan Decl.") ¶ 3, "a party may not create an issue of fact by submitting an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion that, by omission or addition, contradicts the affiant's previous deposition testimony." Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Hayes v. New York City Dep't of Corrections, 84 F.3d 614, 619 (2d Cir. 1996)).
Similarly, plaintiff's request for a personal printer was granted on December 13, 2010. O'Connor Decl. Ex. J. ¶ 7. Although plaintiff acknowledges that defendant granted his request, he argues that defendant's belated accommodation was untimely. Pl. Mem. at 27. However, plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that an employee's request must be granted within any specific timeframe. This is especially true given that plaintiff does not dispute that he was able to use one of the office printers while his personal printer was in disrepair. Pl. Dep. at 123:8-17. Accordingly,  [*31] the Court grants summary judgment, to the defendant on this claim.
Finally, plaintiff claims that defendant violated the ADA by failing to train him in the voice-recognition software Dragon Naturally Speaking. 6 This claim must fail because plaintiff testified that he never contacted HRA's OEEO to advise that office that he required training on the use of the software. Pl. Dep. at 119:12-17. "[I]f the employee causes the interactive process to collapse, an employer will not be liable for failing to make an accommodation under the ADA." Julius v. Department of Human Res. Admin., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33259, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2010) (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment on this claim as well.
For essentially the same reasons stated above, the Court grants defendant summary judgment on plaintiff's claims under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. See Kinneary v. City of New York, 601 F.3d 151, 158 (2d Cir. 2010) ("Kinneary concedes  [*32] that the same elements that must be proven to establish an ADA claim must be also demonstrated to prove claims under NYSHRL and NYCHRL."). Although it is true that "[t]he Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005 ('Restoration Act'), N.Y.C. Local Law No. 85 (2005), requires that claims brought under the NYCHRL be evaluated separately from counterpart claims brought under Title VII," Kaur v. N.Y. City Health & Hosps. Corp., 688 F. Supp. 2d 317, 339 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 19, 2010) (quoting Kolenovic v. ABM Indus. Inc., No. 09-0601-cv, 361 Fed. Appx. 246, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1266, 2010 WL 227660, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan. 21, 2010)), in this case plaintiff has not explained how the analysis of his claims under the NYCHRL would differ in any way from the above analysis under the ADA. By failing to submit any argument on this point, plaintiff has conceded the issue.
The Court has considered plaintiff's additional arguments and finds them without merit. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to the defendant, and the Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.
SO ORDERED.
