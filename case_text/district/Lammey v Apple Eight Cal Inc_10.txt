CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

Proceedings: IN CHAMBERS - COURT ORDER
Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss filed by defendant Apple Eight California, Inc. (Dkt. No. 21 ("Mot.").) Plaintiff Dwain Lammey ("Plaintiff") filed an Opposition (Dkt. No. 22.), and Defendant filed a Reply (Dkt. No. 23.) Pursuant to Rule 78 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 7-15, the Court finds this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument. The hearing calendared for April 26, 2021 at 1:30 p.m., is vacated, and the matter taken off calendar.

I. Background
According to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), Plaintiff has "physical disabilities" and is "substantially limited in his ability to walk." (FAC ¶ 1.) Plaintiff is a "quadriplegic" and "uses a wheelchair for mobility." (Id. ¶ 2.) "Due to Plaintiff's condition, he is unable to, or seriously challenged in his ability to, stand, ambulate, reach objects, transfer from his chair to other equipment, and maneuver around fixed objects." (Id. ¶ 14.) Thus, Plaintiff alleges he needs an "accessible [hotel] guestroom and he needs to be given information about accessible [*2]  features in hotel rooms so that he can confidently book those rooms and travel independently and safely." (Id. ¶ 15.)
Plaintiff alleges he "planned on making a trip in October of 2020 to the Burbank, California area." (Id. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff allegedly "went to the Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles Burbank/Downtown reservation website . . . seeking to book an accessible room." (Id. ¶ 16.) The reservation system is allegedly owned and operated by Defendant. (Id. ¶ 17.)
According to Plaintiff, "[t]here are very few, if any, accessible details identified" on the hotel website. (Id. ¶ 18.) The website allegedly "mentions a host of common areas, but merely states that they are 'accessible' without any further details." (Id.) Plaintiff alleges "[t]hese scant details are nowhere near enough to permit a profoundly disabled wheelchair user to have any confidence or come to any conclusions about whether any given hotel room works for him or her." (Id. ¶ 19.) According to Plaintiff, "there was insufficient information about the accessible features in the 'accessible rooms' at the Hotel to permit him to assess independently whether a given hotel room would work for him." (Id. ¶ 21.) For example, [*3]  Plaintiff alleges that "other than mentioning the hotel room doors are 32", [that the rooms contain] an adjustable shower wand, bathtub grab bars, doors with lever handles, and that the toilet seat is at 'wheelchair height,' . . . there are no specifics mentioned for mobility features in the accessible rooms." (Id. ¶ 21.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that the website only mentions "bathroom grab bars," but "does not provide any information about the existence of grab bars for the accessible guestroom toilets." (Id. ¶ 22.) Further, Plaintiff alleges the website "simply states 'vanities accessible,'" but does not describe what that means. (Id. ¶ 23.) "As another example, Plaintiff [allegedly] [h]as had tremendous difficulty using desks and tables that did not provide knee and toe clearance for wheelchair users," and here the "Hotel reservation website provides no information about the accessibility of the table/desk in the accessible guestroom."
According to Plaintiff, "[c]laiming something is 'accessible' is a conclusion or opinion," and that under the ADA, "the hotel must not only identify but 'describe accessible features in the hotels and guest rooms offered through its reservations [*4]  service in enough detail to reasonably permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given hotel or guest room meets his or her accessibility needs.'" (Id. ¶ 20 (emphasis omitted) (citing 28 C.F.R. 36.302(e)(1)(ii)).) Plaintiffs allege the "small list of items [above] are the bare necessities that Plaintiff must know to make an independent assessment of whether the 'accessible' hotel room works for him." (Id. ¶ 26.)
Plaintiff brings causes of action for (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. (Id. ¶¶ 34-37) and (2) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Id. ¶¶ 38-41.) Defendant now seeks to dismiss Plaintiff's FAC pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

II. Legal Standard
For purposes of a Motion to Dismiss brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), plaintiffs in federal court are generally required to give only "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). While the Federal Rules allow a court to dismiss a cause of action for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted," they also require all pleadings to be "construed so as to do justice." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 8(e). The purpose of Rule 8(a)(2) is to "'give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon [*5]  which it rests.'" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). The Ninth Circuit is particularly hostile to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See, e.g., Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., 108 F.3d 246, 248-49 (9th Cir. 1997) ("The Rule 8 standard contains a powerful presumption against rejecting pleadings for failure to state a claim.") (internal quotation omitted).
However, in Twombly, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that "a wholly conclusory statement of a claim would survive a motion to dismiss whenever the pleadings left open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some set of undisclosed facts to support recovery." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation omitted). Instead, the Court adopted a "plausibility standard," in which the complaint must "raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the alleged infraction]." Id. at 556. For a complaint to meet this standard, the "[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id. at 555 (citing 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1216, pp. 235-36 (3d ed. 2004) ("[T]he pleading must contain something more . . . than . . . a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right of action") (alteration in original)); Daniel v. County of Santa Barbara, 288 F.3d 375, 380 (9th Cir. 2002) ("'All allegations of material fact are [*6]  taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.'") (quoting Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust, 200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir. 2000)). "[A] plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations omitted). In construing the Twombly standard, the Supreme Court has advised that "a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).

III. Judicial Notice
Defendant asks the Court to take judicial notice of the following documents (Dkt. No. 21-2 ("RJN"):
1. A copy of the "Landing Page" and Accessibility Tab of Defendant's website referred to in Plaintiff's Complaint (Ex. 1);
2. A copy of the relevant pages from Defendant's website showing the various accessible room descriptions [*7]  (Ex. 2);
3. A list of Plaintiff's cases filed in California federal court from PACER (Ex. 3);
4. The Consent Decree in U.S. v. Hilton Worldwide, Inc., No. 10-1924, ECF No. 5 (D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2010) (Ex. 4);
5. A copy of the Accessibility Page of Anaheim Marriott's website filed in Arroyo v. JWMFE Anaheim, LLC, 8:21-cv-00014-CJC-KES (C.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2021) (Ex. 6)
6. A copy of several orders dismissing other accessibility cases brought against hotels based on website disclosures (Arroyo v. JWMFE Anaheim, LLC, Case No. 8:21-cv-00014-CJC-KES (C.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2021) (Ex. 5); Salinas v. Apple Ten SPE Capistrano LLC, 20-cv-02379-CJC-DFM (C.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2021) (Ex. 7); Arroyo v. AJU II Silicon Valley, LLC, 20-cv-08218-JSW (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2021) (Ex. 8); Lammey v. Spectrum Gateway Hotels, LLC, 8:21-cv-00104-DOC-KES (C.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2021) (Ex. 9); and Lammey v. Spectrum Gateway Hotels, LLC, 8:21-cv-00104-DOC-KES (C.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2021) (Ex. 10)).
Plaintiff does not object to Defendant's RJN. (See Opp. at 5.) The Court takes judicial notice of Exhibits 1 and 2, which are both referenced in Plaintiff's Complaint. See Daniels-Hall v. National Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding district court correctly took judicial notice of information available [*8]  on websites where "Plaintiffs directly quoted the material posted on these web pages, thereby incorporating them into the Complaint.").
The Court takes judicial notice of Exhibits 5-10, which are court records and decisions from previous cases. See Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n. 6 (9th Cir. 2006) ("We may take judicial notice of court filings.").
The Court does not rely on Defendant's Exhibit 3 or Exhibit 4 in reaching it's decision on this Motion. Thus, the Court denies Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice as to Exhibits 3 and 4 as moot.

IV. Analysis
To succeed on a discrimination claim under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act "(ADA"), a plaintiff must show that "(1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodation by the defendant because of his disability." Arizona ex rel. Goddard v. Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc., 603 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir. 2011). The third element is satisfied when the plaintiff can show a violation of accessibility standards. Rodriguez v. Barrita, Inc., 10 F. Supp. 3d 1062, 1073 (N.D. Cal. 2014). The ADA applies to websites that "impede[] access to the goods and services of . . . places of public accommodation." Robles v. Domino's Pizza LLC, 913 F.3d 898, 905 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied 140 S. Ct. 122, 205 L. Ed. 2d 41 (2019).
Here, Plaintiff argues Defendant's reservation system violates 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e). That section states:
a place of lodging shall, with respect to reservations made by any means ... (i) Modify its policies, practices, or procedures to ensure that individuals with disabilities can make reservations for accessible guest rooms during the same hours and in the same manner as individuals who do not need accessible rooms; (ii) Identify and describe accessible features in the hotels and guest rooms offered through its reservation service [*9]  in enough detail to reasonably permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given hotel or guest room meets his or her accessibility needs; (iii) Ensure that accessible guest rooms are held for use by individuals with disabilities until all other guest rooms of that type have been rented and the accessible room requested is the only remaining room of that type; (iv) Reserve, upon request, accessible guest rooms or specific types of guest rooms and ensure that the guest rooms requested are blocked and removed from all reservations systems; and (v) Guarantee that the specific accessible guest room reserved through its reservation service is held for the reserving customer, regardless of whether a specific room is held in response to reservations made by others.
Plaintiff argues Defendant's reservation system violates Section 36.302(e) because the website does not provide sufficient detail about accessible features to allow Plaintiff, a wheelchair user, to make an independent assessment of whether these features would meet his needs. Plaintiff suggests that more detailed descriptions of the room's features are needed, such as whether there is at least 30 inches of space on the [*10]  sides of the bed, and whether there are grab bars near the toilet.
Defendant, in turn, points to a 2010 guidance document from the Department of Justice ("DOJ") entitled "Americans with Disabilities Act Title III Regulations: Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodation and in Commercial Facilities." The DOJ document states that "[f]or hotels that were built in compliance with the 1991 Standards, it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible and, for each accessible room, to describe the general type of room (e.g., deluxe executive suite), the size and number of beds (e.g., two queen beds), the type of accessible bathing facility (e.g., roll-in shower)."
This Court agrees with Defendant that, based on the allegations in Plaintiff's FAC and the judicially noticeable documents, the descriptions and level of detail provided on Defendant's website are sufficient to comply with the ADA. "[A] website need not list its compliance or non-compliance with every [ADA] Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG")] provision to satisfy 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e)(iii)." Strojnik v. Orangewood LLC, 19-cv-00946, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11743, at *20 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2020) The 2010 DOJ ADAAG Guidance on this provision "recognizes that a reservations system is not [*11]  intended to be an accessibility survey," and "[b]ecause of the wide variations in the level of accessibility that travelers will encounter . . . it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible" and to provide basic facts about each accessible room." That is exactly what Defendant does here. Defendant provides Plaintiff notice that it has accessible rooms. (See RJN Ex. 1 (stating the hotel has "accessible guest rooms" and listing several of the specific features these guest rooms have). While Plaintiff argues that "[c]laiming something is 'accessible' is a conclusion or opinion," (FAC ¶ 20) the term "accessible" is specifically defined in the ADAAG to describe "a site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with these guidelines." 1991 ADAAG § 3.5. Thus, the Defendant's use of the term "accessible" is not merely conclusory, it means that the features in the hotel defined by Defendant as "accessible" comply with the ADAAG.
Other courts have reached the same conclusion. For example, in Rutherford v. Evans Hotels, LLC, the Court found Plaintiff's "contention that [c]ommon sense dictates that conclusorily stating that its rooms are 'accessible' is not enough detail [*12]  for Plaintiffs to assess whether a hotel or guest room meets their particular accessibility needs . . . is dubious." 18-cv-00435, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161565, 2020 WL 5257868, at * 16 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2020). The Court pointed to the DOJ's own guidance, which states it may be sufficient to specify that the hotel is accessible and to describe the general type of room. (Id.) The Court concluded that "[j]ust because Mr. Rutherford would like additional detail does not mean that he is entitled to it under Section 36.302(e)(1)(iii)." Id.; see also Strojnik, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11743, at *20 ("[E]ven had Plaintiff identified information that was missing from the website that related to his disability, a website need not list its compliance or non-compliance with every ADAAG provision to satisfy 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e)(iii)".); Barnes v. Marriott Hotel Servs., 15-cv-01409, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22588, 2017 WL 635474, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2017) (finding descriptions of rooms stating "[t]his type of room offers mobility accessible rooms" or "[t]his type of room offers accessible rooms with roll in showers" provided the "appropriate and acceptable" level of detail to comply with section 36.302(e)); Strojnik v. Kapalua Land Co., Ltd., 19-cv-1991, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185481, 2019 WL 5535766, at *7 (D. Hawai'i Aug, 26, 2019) ("Plaintiff fails to cite to any legal authority providing that failure to detail all accessible and inaccessible elements of a public accommodation results in an ADA violation."). Thus this Court finds, [*13]  as other courts have already found, that describing a room as "accessible" is sufficient to comply with the ADAAG.
Plaintiff argues "[t]here are numerous, highly technical requirements for guestrooms and bathrooms and all of them relate to usability and safety," but that it is not "'reasonable' to expect this level of detail to be provided." (Opp. at 7.) Plaintiff argues there "must be some information provided about critical or core components of a guestroom." (Id.) For example Plaintiff argues that whether the beds "have at least 30 inches of clearance on the sides to permit transfer" is "of critical importance." (Id.) In addition, Plaintiff argues toilet grab bars, "the accessibility of the sink," and "the accessibility of the desk" are of critical importance. (Id.)
Aside from the fact, as noted above, that stating that the room is "accessible" by definition means that it complies with all of these ADA requirements, Plaintiff's interpretation of what is needed for him to determine whether he can use the guest room is not the law. While this Plaintiff may think these are the most important features that a website needs to disclose, another plaintiff may think that the slope into the hotel entrance [*14]  is the most important thing a website should include. Yet another might think that the weight of the doors should be included on a hotel's website. In short, each individual plaintiff may have a separate list of the most important things to list from the ADAAG on the hotel's website, such that, in the end, a hotel would be required to state on their website whether their facilities comply with each and every requirement of the ADAAG which is more than 250 pages long. Plaintiff cannot simply cherry pick a handful of regulations he thinks are most important and argue that information is what the law requires.
In addition, should Plaintiff require additional information, the hotel website states that "[f]or more information about the physical features of our accessible rooms, or special services relating to a specific disability, please call +1 818-260-8787." (RJN Ex. 1.) Plaintiff argues "the required information must be found on the website itself and it is not sufficient to claim that the information can be obtained by jumping through an additional hoop and calling the hotel directly." (Opp. at 4.) Plaintiff cites no case law for this position, and in fact the DOJ and case law state otherwise. [*15]  The DOJ acknowledges that "individuals with disabilities may wish to contact the hotel or reservations services for more detailed information." 28 C.F.R. § Pt. 36, App. A. Courts have interpreted this to mean that a website need not include all potentially relevant accessibility information where an inquiring patron can simply call the hotel for more information. See Strojnik, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11743, at *21 ("if a website was required to have all relevant information, individuals would not [be directed by the DOJ] to call the hotel to get further information."). Thus, for this additional reason, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to state a claim that Defendant's website violates the ADA.

Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to adequately state a claim under the ADA. The Court therefore grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss as to the ADA claim. The Court finds that, based on Plaintiff's own FAC and the judicially noticed documents, Defendant's website does comply with the ADA. Thus, the Court finds any future amendment would be futile. The Court therefore dismisses Plaintiff's ADA claim with prejudice.
As for Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim, the Court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all [*16]  remaining state law claims because "the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). "[I]n the usual case in which federal law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors . . . will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims." Reynolds v. Cnty. of San Diego, 84 F.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 1996) overruled on other grounds by Acri v. Varian Assocs., Inc., 114 F.3d 999, 1001 (9th Cir. 1997) ("The Supreme Court has stated, and we have often repeated, that in the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors . . . will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.") (quotations and citation omitted); see also De LaTorre v. CashCall, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18624, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2019) ("The elimination of federal claims does not automatically deprive district courts of subject matter jurisdiction over any supplemental state law claims. . . . However, [c]omity and precedent in this circuit strongly disfavors exercising supplemental jurisdiction.") (quotations and citations omitted).
Here, the Court has dismissed the ADA claim and there are no other federal claims in the Complaint. The Court therefore declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining state law claim under the Unruh Civil Rights [*17]  Act. This claim is dismissed without prejudice.
The Court will issue a judgment consistent with this Order.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
JUDGMENT

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that:
1. Plaintiff's Americans with Disabilities Act claim is dismissed with prejudice;
2. Plaintiff's Unruh Civil Rights Act claim is dismissed without prejudice; and
3. Defendant shall have its costs of suit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54.
