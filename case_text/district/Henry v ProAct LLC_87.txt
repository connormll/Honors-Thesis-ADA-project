I.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On November 27, 2013, Plaintiff Michael J. Henry filed a Complaint against Defendants Harvest Sensations, LLC ("Harvest Sensations") and Pro*Act LLC ("Pro*Act") for (1) Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") interference; (2) disability discrimination; (3) failure to accommodate; (4) failure to engage in interactive [*2]  process; (5) age discrimination; (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. [Doc. # 1.]
On November 21, 2014, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to his Fourth Claim for Relief for Failure to Engage in an Interactive Process or, in the alternative, for specification of the following issue, and any other issue as may be identified by the Court in its discretion, as being without genuine dispute and established in this case: Defendants Pro*Act, LLC and Harvest Sensations, LLC failed to fulfill their obligation to engage in the interactive process in good faith. [Doc. # 25.] On December 1, 2014, Defendants filed their Opposition. [Doc. # 32.] On December 5, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Reply. [Doc. # 38.]

II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Parties
Pro*Act is the leading distributor of fresh produce to the food industry in the United States. Complaint at ¶ 6. Pro*Act is owned by individual produce distribution companies that sell produce to restaurants, schools, senior living facilities, and sporting venues. Defendants Pro*Act, LLC, and Harvest Sensations, LLC's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts ("GDMF") at ¶ 4. [Doc. # 33.] Harvest Sensations sells [*3]  produce to the member-owners of Pro*Act, as well as other non-member customers. Id. at ¶ 7. At all times relevant to this motion, Harvest Sensations was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pro*Act. Id. at ¶ 3.
Pro*Act administers all human resources functions for employees of Harvest Sensations, as well as other services such as legal services and payroll processing. Id. at ¶ 51. Pro*Act was therefore responsible for overseeing and administering Henry's FMLA leave from his position with Harvest Sensations. Id. at ¶ 50.
Michael J. Henry is a resident of Orange, California. Complaint at ¶ 5. In June 2006, he was hired as the Vice President of Pro*Act Specialties. GDMF at ¶ 1. In or around June 2009, Pro*Act Specialties was renamed Harvest Sensations, and Henry subsequently became the Vice President of Harvest Sensations. Id. at ¶ 2.
As Vice President of Harvest Sensations, Henry oversaw all aspects of Harvest Sensations' operations in Los Angeles and Miami and performed a wide variety of operation tasks. Id. at ¶ 9. In addition to serving as Vice President, Henry also served as the General Manager of Harvest Sensations' Los Angeles facility, which had approximately 70 employees, and managed its [*4]  operations. Id. at ¶ 10.

B. Henry's Role and Responsibilities
In his capacity as Vice President and General Manager, Henry negotiated pricing on labels, packaging, truck leases, truck rentals, and warehouse space. Id. at ¶ 11. He handled logistics for truck and air freight, addressed customer complaints, assessed the viability and pricing of both special products and new products, and performed walkthroughs of the warehouse and check on safety protocols. Id. He also reviewed daily dashboards for both Los Angeles and Miami regarding sales, costs, and profit and loss, provided weekly and comparative reports for Pro*Act members, and participated in weekly conference calls. Id.
From June 2006 to August 2009, Henry reported to Dean Simon, President of Harvest Sensations. Id. at ¶ 12. From August 2009 to March 2012, Henry reported to Steve Grinstead, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pro*Act, who was then serving as Acting President of Harvest Sensations. Id. at ¶ 13. From March 2012 to September 24, 2012, Henry reported to Chris Coffman, who replaced Dean Simon as President of Harvest Sensations. Id. at ¶¶ 14-15. As the President of Harvest Sensations, Coffman also served as a member [*5]  of the Senior Management Team for Pro*Act. Id. at ¶ 16.
In May 2012, Coffman removed Henry from his regular duties and responsibilities as Vice President/General Manager and reassigned Henry to lead two "Special Projects." Id. at ¶ 17. Coffman assigned Henry the responsibility for finding a larger warehouse facility for Harvest Sensations in Los Angeles and for leading the implementation of a conversion to a new computer software system entitled "Famous." Id. at ¶¶ 18-19.
During the discussion informing Henry of his assignment to these Special Projects, Coffman told Henry that he would reassume his duties and responsibilities as Vice President/General Manager when the special projects were completed. Id. at ¶ 22. Around the same time, Coffman sent an email to Henry stating that he added value to the company. Id. at ¶ 23. Coffman assigned Tom Travers, General Manager of Harvest Sensations' Miami Facility, to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Los Angeles facility during Henry's assignment to Special Projects. Id. at ¶ 24.

C. Henry's Medical Condition
In late May 2012, Henry notified Defendants about a condition concerning his neck and back and informed them that he would be required [*6]  to have surgery in early June. Id. at ¶ 25. On May 30, 2012, Henry informed Coffman that he would be hospitalized for two to three days following surgery, but would be able to work from home shortly thereafter and would likely be able to walk approximately two weeks after surgery. Id. at ¶ 26. Henry also informed Coffman that he would have to wear a collar around his neck for approximately six to eight weeks and would be precluded from driving during that time. Id. at ¶ 27. On June 5, 2012, Henry underwent a cervical spinal fusion to fuse together several vertebrae in his neck. Id. at ¶ 28.
As a result of the surgery, Henry suffered nerve damage affecting his right hand that required him to wear an occupational brace that manually extended the fingers on his right hand. Id. at ¶ 30. On June 11, 2012, Henry returned to work, working from his desk at home unless he was required to be at Harvest Sensations' Los Angeles facility for a Famous training session. Id. at ¶ 31. On days when Henry came to the Los Angeles facility, a Harvest Sensations employee would pick him up and drop him off at the Union Station train station. Id. at ¶ 34. Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations considered allowing [*7]  Henry to work from home during his recovery and the assistance provided for Henry's commute to be accommodations for Henry's physical condition. Id. at ¶¶ 33, 35.
In early July 2012, Henry informed Defendants that he would need to have a second surgery performed on his neck. Id. at ¶ 36. Defendants understood that Henry's recovery time and limitations from the second surgery would be similar to the period of recovery from the first surgery. Id. at ¶ 37. On July 12, 2012, Henry underwent a second neck surgery. Id. at ¶ 38.
During his recovery from the second surgery, Henry resumed work the week of July 16, 2012. Id. at ¶ 40. Henry again worked from home except when he was required to be at the Los Angeles facility. Id. During this period, Henry also traveled to and from the Harvest Sensations' Miami facility for Famous training sessions. Id. at ¶41.

D. Relevant Communications
On July 29, 2012, Coffman announced to the leadership of Harvest Sensations that Henry would no longer be returning to his position as Vice President and General Manager after the conclusion of the Special Projects.1 Id. at ¶ 42. On or about July 31, 2012, Coffman informed Henry that he would not be returning to his [*8]  role as Vice President and General Manager of the Los Angeles facility. Id.; Deposition of Michael J. Henry, ("Henry Depo.") Ex. A to Appendix of Evidence in Support of Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("Defendants' Appendix") at 98:13-25. [Doc. # 32-1.]
On or about September 14, 2012, Henry informed Defendants that he needed a third, more extensive surgery. Id. at ¶¶ 43-44. Given the extent of the third surgery and the number of vertebrae that would be fused together, Henry could not anticipate in advance the recovery time he would need. Id. at ¶ 45. On September 25, 2012, Henry had his third, more extensive surgery and went on medical leave pursuant to the FMLA. Id. at ¶¶ 46-47. On October 11, 2012, Henry underwent a follow-up procedure to relieve impingement on his nerves that resulted from the September 25 surgery. Id. at ¶ 48. Henry was scheduled to return to work on or before December 18, 2012, given the twelve weeks of leave afforded under the FMLA. Id. at ¶ 49.
In a letter dated November 15, 2012, Mary McFarland, the Human Resources ("HR") Manager for Pro*Act, requested that Henry provide a status update from his physician. Id. at ¶ 53. [*9]  In the November 15 letter, McFarland misstated that Henry's FMLA leave would expire on December 11, 2012, only eleven weeks after his leave began. Id. at ¶ 54. As of a December 3, 2012 email McFarland sent to Henry, Defendants were still mistaken in their belief that Henry's leave would expire on December 11, 2012. Id. at ¶ 57. It is undisputed that Henry's FMLA leave did not actually expire until December 18, 2012. Id. at ¶ 71.
On December 12, 2012, Henry's treating physician, Gregory D. Carlson, informed Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations that Henry could return to work at home for four to six hours per day starting on December 17, 2012. Id. at ¶ 60. Dr. Carlson informed Defendants that Henry would be reassessed regarding his ability to perform increased work duties in early January of 2013. Id. at ¶ 61.
On December 13, Coffman sent Henry an email, with copies to McFarland and Kilgore, containing an attached letter response to Dr. Carlson's December 12, 2012 letter. Id. at ¶ 64. In the letter, Coffman asserted that Dr. Carlson had failed to respond to Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations by December 11, 2012, which was the purported expiration of Henry's FMLA leave. Id. at ¶ 66. The letter also [*10]  stated that the proposed return to work date of December 17, 2012 was not feasible, Henry could not resume his prior duties, there was no reasonable accommodation that could be granted to Henry based on Dr. Carlson's restrictions, Henry's medical coverage would be discontinued after December 31, 2012, and Henry would be required to apply for medical coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") if he wanted to continue his health coverage. Id. at ¶¶ 67-68. Coffman also invited Henry "to suggest what you think you might be able to do within the company" and to offer "suggestions as to how you could be accommodated." Id. at ¶ 69.
On December 17, 2012, Henry sent an email to Coffman, with copies to McFarland and Kilgore, reminding them that his FMLA leave did not expire until the following day, December 18, 2012. Id. at ¶ 77. Coffman responded the same day and acknowledged the error regarding the expiration date of Henry's FMLA leave. Id. at ¶ 78. In the email, Coffman stated that, notwithstanding the error, "all other aspects of the [December 13, 2012] letter remain intact." Id. at ¶ 79.
On December 25, 2012, Coffman sent Henry another email with copies to [*11]  McFarland and Kilgore containing an attached follow-up letter dated December 24, 2012. Id. at ¶ 80. The letter stated that "the Company does not currently have a position available based on your physician's restrictions." Id. at ¶ 81. The letter also stated that Coffman had "requested [Henry's] assistance to find a way for the Company to reasonably accommodate your restrictions. To date, you have not provided any suggestions as to what you might be able to do within the Company consistent with your restrictions. Please provide your suggestions immediately." Appendix of Evidence in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by Plaintiff Michael J. Henry ("Henry Appendix"), Exhibit W ("December 24 Letter"). [Doc. 30.]
On December 27, 2012, Henry responded to Coffman by email, stating that "Pro Act and Harvest Sensations currently have many employees serving in a wide variety of rolls [sic] who perform their job functions remotely. As vice president of Harvest Sensations my duties included overseeing all aspects of company operations and performing a wide variety of tasks as required. I look forward to returning on a full time basis very soon. I believe you would be in the best position [*12]  to identify a roll [sic] and utilize my skill set until that is possible." GDMF at ¶ 85; Henry Appendix, Exhibit V ("December 27 email").2
On January 9, 2013, Henry sent a follow-up email to Coffman reminding Coffman that he had not received a reply to his December 27 email. GDMF at ¶ 88. In this email, Henry informed Coffman that Dr. Carlson would not release Henry to work downtown at the Harvest Sensations' Los Angeles facility. Id. at ¶ 89. Coffman responded to Henry by email the same day and indicated that Pro*Act and Harvest sensations would get back to Henry "in a day or two." Id. at ¶ 92. At this time, Defendants had already sent Henry's termination letter out for delivery. Id. at ¶ 93. Defendants made no attempt to stop Henry's termination letter from being delivered in light of the additional information in the January 9 email. Id. at ¶ 94. On January 10, 2013, Henry received the letter from Coffman terminating his employment effective January 9, 2013 ("Termination Letter"). Id. at ¶ 95.
The Termination Letter stated that Harvest Sensations had attempted to engage Henry in the interactive process to determine what reasonable accommodation may have been granted during Henry's [*13]  absence, and asserted that Henry did "not offer any suggestions for work [Henry] could perform" and that Henry "refused to participate or cooperate in the interactive process." Id. at ¶¶ 97-98. The Termination Letter stated that "nothing can be done in the timeframe which [Dr. Carlson] outlined." Id. at ¶ 99.
Coffman's letters to Henry dated December 13, 2012, December 24, 2012, and January 9, 2013, and the related email correspondence between Henry and Coffman with copies to Kilgore and McFarland on December 13, 17, 25, and 27, 2012 are the totality of the communications comprising any interactive process regarding Henry's return to work from FMLA leave after his surgery. Id. at ¶ 101.
As of the date of the December 13, 2012 letter, the two Special Projects to which Henry had been assigned had yet to be completed. Id. at ¶ 72. Both Special Projects were taken over by Coffman. Id. at ¶ 76. The implementation of and conversion to the Famous software system was not completed until May 2013. Id. at ¶ 73. The new location for the Los Angeles warehouse facility was not selected until November 2013. Id. at ¶ 74.

III

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there [*14]  is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Nat'l Ass'n of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial."). "[T]he inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts . . . must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).

IV.

DISCUSSION

A. Good Faith, Interactive Process Requirement
The Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") states that it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to engage in a timely, good [*15]  faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "Failure to engage in this process is a separate FEHA violation independent from an employer's failure to provide a reasonable disability accommodation, which is also a FEHA violation." Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. California, 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 424, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 10 (2007).
The employer has an on-going obligation to engage in good-faith in the interactive process that extends beyond a first attempt at accommodation. Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 361 (2009). The obligation continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or when the employer becomes aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further obligation is needed. Id. "This rule fosters the framework of cooperative problem-solving contemplated by the ADA, by encouraging employers to seek to find accommodations that really work." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 361 (2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).
"[F]or the process to work both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984-85, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). "[T]he fact that an employer [takes] some steps [*16]  to work with an employee to identify reasonable accommodations does not absolve the employer of liability under section 12940(n). If the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process, it may be held liable." Id. An employee must present the employer a concise list of restrictions which must be accommodated at the earliest possible opportunity. Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 266, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000). Responsibility for any breakdown in communication lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1014.
"Because specific requirements of the interactive process under FEHA are not set forth in the statute and have not been detailed by California courts, courts look to ADA case law in evaluating the sufficiency of a given case's interactive process." Diaz v. Fed. Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1061 (C.D. Cal. 2005); see also Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 56-57, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) ("Because the ADA and FEHA share the goal of eliminating discrimination, we often look to federal case authority to guide the construction and application of FEHA, particularly where parallel statutory language is involved.").
In the context of a similar provision of the American Disabilities Act ("ADA"), the Ninth Circuit has stated that "an employer fails to engage in the interactive process as a matter of law where it rejects the employee's proposed accommodations by letter [*17]  and offers no practical alternatives." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc, 228 F.3d 1105, 1116-17 (2000) (vacated on other grounds)); see also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11069(c)(1) ("The employer or other covered entity shall either grant the applicant's or employee's requested accommodation, or reject it after due consideration, and initiate discussion with the applicant or employee regarding alternative accommodations.").
Defendants assert that, because of Henry's senior position in the company, he would have been aware of the existence of other positions within the organization that he could perform with his restrictions. Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("Opp.") at 22. [Doc. # 32.] Defendants contend that Henry's failure to respond to the request for suggestions of other positions within the organization is what caused the breakdown in communications. Id. Yet, Defendants repeatedly told Henry that there was no reasonable accommodation available for him. Defendants requested that Henry suggest what he might be able to do within the company or how he could be accommodated, but never offered any suggestions of their own as to what he might be able to do or how he might be accommodated. Defendants did not respond to Henry's suggestion [*18]  that he be accommodated by being allowed to work from home, and did not offer any practical alternatives.
In the December 13, 2012 letter, Coffman had already stated that there was no reasonable accommodation that could be made for Henry, and that his medical coverage would soon be discontinued when he invited Henry "to suggest what you think you might be able to do within the company" and requested that Henry offer "suggestions as to how you could be accommodated."
Coffman's follow-up email of December 25, 2012 reiterated that "the Company does not currently have a position available based on your physician's restrictions." The email requested that Henry "provide . . . suggestions immediately" regarding how the Company could reasonably accommodate his restrictions and what he might be able to do within the company.
In his December 27, 2012 email, Henry pointed out the potential reasonable accommodation of working from home, asserted that he has a variety of skills that might be applicable to many roles, and stated his belief that Coffman would be in the best position to identify a role for him. Henry received no response from Defendants until he sent a follow-up email on January 9, 2013, [*19]  reminding Coffman that he had not received a reply to his December 27, 2012 email. Hoffman replied the same day, stating that Harvest Sensations would get back to Henry "in a day or two." Henry then received the Termination Letter, effective January 9, 2013.
Defendants began the communications process by stating that no possible accommodation could be made for Henry, and reiterated this position several times. Defendants repeatedly requested that Henry suggest a reasonable accommodation or specific role in the company, but never offered any meaningful suggestions of their own.
During the interactive process, the onus is not on an employee alone to identify a specific position within the company or the reasonable accommodations that might be available. Henry's initial failure to do so does not constitute a refusal to participate or cooperate in the interactive process. On the contrary, Defendants' repeated insistence that there was no possible reasonable accommodation for Henry and that nothing could be done within the parameters of Dr. Carlson's restrictions belie their assertions that their requests for suggestions from Henry were made in good faith.
This Court finds that Defendants [*20]  failed to engage in the good-faith, interactive process as a matter of law.

B. Availability of Reasonable Accommodation
Various California courts have addressed the question of whether "the availability of a reasonable accommodation is a prerequisite to liability under section 12940(n)." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). While not all courts are in accord, the majority of courts have found that it is necessary to the show the existence of a possible reasonable accommodation. See id., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced once the parties have engaged in litigation); Claudio v. Regents of University of California, 134 Cal. App. 4th 224, 35 Cal. Rptr. 3d 837 (2005), as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 13, 2005) (interactive process not yet futile where an employee might have been physically able to handle available clerical positions); Swonke v. Sprint, Inc., 327 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (where there were no possible accommodations consistent with employee's medical restrictions, the court did not require an interactive process that was guaranteed to be futile); but see Wysinger v. Automobile Club of Southern California, 157 Cal. App. 4th 413, 425, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2007) (liability for employer for failing to engage in interactive process regardless of whether a reasonable accommodation was available).
Courts have recognized that an employee may not be in a position to identify what reasonable accommodations [*21]  might be available until he or she has engaged in the litigation and discovery process. Wysinger, 157 Cal. App. 4th at 424-25 (if an employer did not engage in a good faith interactive process, the employee may not know whether an alternative job would have been found.); Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (employee does not have access to the same information as employer to determine what possible accommodations are available); Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 979 (employee in workplace may not be able to identify reasonable accommodations, but a plaintiff in litigation has discovery tools to do so); Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1113 (9th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds, U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) (putting entire burden on employee to identify a reasonable accommodation risks shutting out employees who do not have same knowledge of workplace that employer has).
This Court agrees with the Nadaf-Rahrov and Scotch courts that the existence of a possible reasonable accommodation is a prerequisite to liability for failure to engage in a good-faith, interactive process pursuant to section 12940(n). A plaintiff employee need not have been able to identify the reasonable accommodation at the time of the termination, but by the end of the discovery period, he or she should be able to identify a specific accommodation that the good-faith interactive process could have produced. For [*22]  the purpose of showing the existence of a reasonable accommodation, it is irrelevant whether Henry or Defendants offered viable suggestions as to a reasonable accommodation at the time of the negotiations, or which party requested that the other offer suggestions as to possible roles for Henry. The relevant inquiry is whether it is now clear that a reasonable accommodation would have been possible.
At this stage, Henry asserts that working from home is considered a reasonable accommodation when the essential functions of the job can be performed from the employee's home. See Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139 ("[employers'] rejection of [employee's] work-at-home request and its failure to explore with employee the possibility of other accommodations, once it was aware that the initial arrangement was not effective, constituted a violation of its duty regarding the mandatory interactive process."). Defendants do not dispute that some of their employees work from home because their job duties can be performed remotely. More importantly, Henry worked from home on prior occasions.
Henry also argues that an additional leave of absence would have been a reasonable accommodation. See Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263 ("[h]olding a job open for a disabled employee who [*23]  needs time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required when it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future."); Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1135 ("[a] leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation.").
Defendants contend that Henry does not explain what specific jobs he could have performed once the "Famous" project was handed off to someone else, and therefore has failed to establish what possible reasonable accommodation could have been offered.
Nothing in the case law or the statute suggests that a former employee must identify a specific role in which he could have been employed. The requirement is that an employee identify a specific reasonable accommodation which could have been made. Here, Henry has established that Defendants could have potentially accommodated his disability by allowing him to continue doing his work from home, as he and others had done before, or extending his medical leave.
Henry has established that a reasonable accommodation could have been available as a result of a good-faith, interactive process.

C. Both Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations [*24]  are Properly Considered Henry's Employers for Purposes of FEHA Coverage3
In order to be subject to liability for FEHA violations, a defendant must be considered an "employer" under that statute. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). Henry contends that both Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations qualify as Henry's "employers" during the relevant time period. Harvest Sensations does not dispute that it was Henry's employer during the relevant time period. Opp. at 23. Pro*Act disputes that it should be held liable as Henry's employer. Id. at 23-25.
Under FEHA, an employer "includes any person regularly employing five or more persons, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(d).4 "Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, there is a rebuttable presumption that 'employer' as defined by subdivision (d) of Section 12926, includes any person or identity identified as the employer on the employee's Federal Form W-2." Cal. Gov't Code § 12928. Henry's W-2 Wage Summary for 2012 lists Pro*Act LLC under "Employer's name." Henry Appendix, Ex. DD. ("Henry W-2").
As Plaintiff notes, the California Supreme Court recently examined and rejected the Court of Appeals' application of the federal "economic reality" test for employment in the context of an employer's failure to pay minimum [*25]  wage. Martinez v. Combs, 49 Cal. 4th 35, 67, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 514, 231 P.3d 259 (2010) ("We see no reason to substitute this [federal] definition of employment, which has no basis in California law, for definition in wage orders regularly adopted by the IWC."
Both before and after Martinez, California courts have confirmed that multiple entities may be "joint employers" subject to liability under FEHA. See Mathieu v. Norrell Corp., 115 Cal. App. 4th 1174, 1183, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 52, 58 (2004) (applying the doctrine of dual employers for FEHA liability); Rhodes v. Sutter Health, 949 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1003 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (assessing whether defendant was a joint employer under FEHA).
Factors to be taken into account in assessing the employment relationship include payment of salary or other employments and taxes, the authority of the defendant to hire, transfer, promote, discipline, or discharge the employee, and the authority to establish work schedules and assignments, among others. Vernon v. State, 116 Cal. App. 4th 114, 125, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 121, 130 (2004); see also Jones v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 99 Cal. App. 4th 1039, 1046, 121 Cal. Rptr. 2d 621, 625 (2002) (factors include "the power to discharge the employee, payment of salary, nature of the services, and the parties' belief as to the employment relationship.").
It is undisputed that Pro*Act administers all human resources functions for employees of Harvest Sensations, as well as other services such as legal services and payroll processing. Pro*Act was responsible for overseeing and administering Henry's FMLA leave from his [*26]  position with Harvest Sensations. Henry specifically communicated with Mary McFarland, the HR Manager for Pro*Act, regarding updates from his physician. The fact that Pro*Act's name is listed on Henry's W-2 establishes a rebuttable presumption that Pro*Act is Henry's employer, and the additional facts establishing Pro*Act's involvement with Harvest Sensations and the termination process establish that Pro*Act was also Henry's employer during the relevant time period for purposes of FEHA liability.
Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Defendants does not change the Court's conclusion that both Pro*Act and Harvest Sensations were Henry's joint "employers" within the meaning of the FEHA for the relevant time period.

V.

CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment as to the fourth claim for failure to engage in the good-faith, interactive process is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
