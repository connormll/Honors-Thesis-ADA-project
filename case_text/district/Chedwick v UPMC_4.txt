MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER OF COURT

I. Introduction
Before the Court for disposition are the Defendant's MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF No. 76), the Defendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 77), the Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 78), the Appendix to the Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF Nos. [78-1]-[78-26]), the Plaintiff's Response to the Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 79), the Appendix to the Plaintiff's Response to the Defendant's [*2]  Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF Nos. [79-1]-[79-12]), and the Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 80). For the reasons that follow, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.

II. Background
Plaintiff Gary Chedwick ("Chedwick") was born on September 10, 1948. ECF No. 78-3 at 5. He served in the United States Armed Forces during the conflict in Vietnam. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶ 1. As a result of his experience in Vietnam, Chedwick suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"). Id. On October 14, 2002, he was hired to work as an Interface Analyst III for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ("UPMC"). ECF No. 78-4 at 3.
Chedwick suffered a severe PTSD "episode" on November 19, 2003. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶¶ 3-4. He apparently left his work station without the knowledge or permission of UPMC personnel. Id. at ¶ 4. This incident caused Chedwick to be suspended without pay for a period of five days. Id. at ¶ 5. The suspension became effective on November 24, 2003, and ended on November 28, 2003. Id. Chedwick also received a "mandatory referral" to UPMC's Employee Assistance Program ("EAP"). ECF No. 78-4 at [*3]  2. His supervisor, John Truxal ("Truxal"), memorialized these actions in a memorandum dated December 8, 2003. Id. In the memorandum, Truxal informed Chedwick of his right to file a formal grievance related to his suspension within seven calendar days. Id. Chedwick did not file a grievance because he believed the suspension to be "proper." ECF No. 78-3 at 10. He stayed away from his work station for the remainder of 2003. Id. During the intervening period of time, Chedwick received treatment for PSTD and severe depression through the EAP. Id. at 11.
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA") [29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.] provides an "eligible employee"1 with a statutory right to twelve weeks of leave during any twelve-month period "[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). Chedwick formally requested a leave of absence on January 16, 2004, claiming that his mental impairments and related treatment regimen required him to be away from work. ECF No. 78-5 at 2. His request was approved, and he was provided with disability benefits pursuant to UPMC's policy with UNUM Provident. ECF No. 1 at ¶ 16.
Chedwick's statutory entitlement [*4]  to leave under the FMLA expired on March 30, 2004. ECF No. 78-6 at 2. Matthew Rimer ("Rimer"), a Human Resources Generalist employed by UPMC, informed Chedwick of the impending expiration of his FMLA leave in a letter dated March 24, 2004. Id. The letter stated that Chedwick was free to apply for a personal leave of absence in the event that he was still unable to work. Id. An internal UPMC policy permitted an employee to take up to fourteen weeks of additional leave after the expiration of the twelve weeks of leave guaranteed to him or her under the FMLA. Id. Chedwick exercised this option and remained on leave for an additional fourteen weeks. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶ 8.
Chedwick remained unable to work for the duration of his leave. In a letter to Chedwick dated July 2, 2004, UPMC Human Resources Manager Rhonda Larimore ("Larimore") stated as follows:
Your 26-week leave of absence (combination of FMLA and personal leave) expires on July 6, 2004. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center policy states that the total amount of leave may not exceed 26 weeks in any rolling 12-month period. As such, you will be removed from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's payroll and your [*5]  employment terminated effective July 6, 2004.
You will continue to receive Short Term Disability or Long Term Disability benefits as approved through UNUM Provident. Information regarding your options for post-employment continuation of your health insurance benefits (COBRA) will be forwarded to you as well.
Should you wish to reapply for employment with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center after you are fully released by your physician, please visit upmc.com to apply online. Please contact me at (412) 647-1955 if you have any questions regarding this matter.
Thank you for your contributions to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. I wish you a quick recovery, and the best of luck in the future.
ECF No. 78-10 at 2. In accordance with Larimore's letter and the corporate policy referenced therein, Chedwick's employment with UPMC was terminated on July 6, 2004. Id.
During the fall of 2005, UNUM Provident personnel concluded that Chedwick was capable of returning to work. This determination was communicated to UPMC on October 7, 2005, by means of a letter from Stephanie Perry ("Perry"), a Lead Disability Benefits Specialist employed by UNUM Provident, to UPMC employee Jodi Clark [*6]  ("Clark"). ECF No. 78-15 at 2. Perry's letter stated that Chedwick's disability claim would be closed on January 1, 2006. Id. UNUM Provident provided Chedwick with three months' worth of disability benefits and "vocational counseling" in order to give him enough time to "obtain gainful employment." Id.
After learning that his disability benefits would be discontinued, Chedwick started to pursue other employment opportunities with UPMC. He ultimately applied for twenty-seven different positions advertised on UPMC's website. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶ 54. UPMC did not interview or select Chedwick for any of the advertised positions. Id. at ¶¶ 55-63.
On June 21, 2006, Valentina Tish ("Tish") commenced an action against Magee-Women's Hospital ("Magee"), a business unit of UPMC and her former employer, contending that she had been discharged in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act") [29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.]. Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF No. 1 at ¶¶ 7-19. Tish's complaint included class allegations against Magee under both the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"). Id. at ¶¶ 20-29. Magee moved for the dismissal of Tish's ADA claims on July 26, 2006, contending [*7]  that she could not proceed as a class representative without exhausting her administrative remedies before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF Nos. 3 & 4. Chedwick filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on August 14, 2006, alleging that UPMC had discharged and refused to rehire him because of his PTSD. ECF No. 78-20. Tish filed a motion for joinder one day later, seeking to have her action against Magee joined with that of Carole Bolden ("Bolden"), who had previously commenced a similar action against Magee. Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF No. 8. In an order dated October 17, 2006, the Court dismissed Tish's ADA claims and denied her motion for joinder. Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF No. 10.
On October 24, 2006, the EEOC dismissed Chedwick's charge of discrimination and provided him with written notice of his right to sue UPMC under the ADA. ECF No. 78-21. The next day, Tish filed an amended complaint in class action without leave of court. Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF No. 11. In her amended complaint, Tish purported to add Chedwick, Barbara Fowler ("Fowler"), Gloria Hamlett ("Hamlett") and Terri Walsh ("Walsh") as plaintiffs and name [*8]  UPMC, UPMC Shadyside, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC St. Margaret as additional defendants. Id. The UPMC entities filed a motion to strike the amended complaint on November 8, 2006. Civil Action No. 06-820, ECF No. 13. The motion to strike was accompanied by an alternative motion to sever the claims brought by Tish, Chedwick, Fowler, Hamlett and Walsh into separate actions against Magee, UPMC, UPMC Shadyside, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC St. Margaret. Id.
In a memorandum opinion and order dated April 24, 2007, the Court treated Tish's filing of the amended complaint as an implied request for leave to amend, granted that request, and denied the UPMC entities' motion to strike. Tish v. Magee-Women's Hospital, Civil Action No. 06-820, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30130, *15-22, 2007 WL 1221137, at *6-8 (W.D.Pa. Apr. 24, 2007). In order to alleviate any resulting prejudice to the UPMC entities, the Court granted their alternative motion to sever and directed Chedwick, Fowler, Hamlett and Walsh to refile their claims in separate actions. Id. Chedwick commenced this action on June 15, 2007, contending that UPMC had unlawfully discharged and refused to rehire him because of his "disability." ECF No. 1.
Chedwick's complaint included class allegations under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at ¶¶ 29-39. UPMC filed a motion to dismiss on August [*9]  28, 2007. ECF No. 3. In support of its motion, UPMC argued that Chedwick's claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, and that the class allegations contained in the complaint were violative of the Court's severance order. Id. at ¶¶ 26-41. In a memorandum opinion dated December 12, 2007, the Court dismissed the ADA claims pertaining to Chedwick's dismissal because they had not been exhausted before the EEOC. Chedwick v. UPMC, 619 F.Supp.2d 172, 178-181 (W.D.Pa. 2007). UPMC's motion to dismiss was denied in all other respects. Id. at 181-190.
UPMC moved for partial summary judgment on September 30, 2009, contending that class certification in this case was precluded by the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Hohider v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 574 F.3d 169 (3d Cir. 2009). The Court denied UPMC's motion on November 9, 2009, holding that the decision in Hohider had not completely foreclosed the possibility that Chedwick could obtain class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Chedwick v. UPMC, 263 F.R.D. 269, 276-277 (W.D.Pa. 2009). The parties later became embroiled in a protracted dispute concerning the permissible scope of discovery relating to the issue of class certification. Chedwick ultimately filed a motion for class certification on December 7, 2010. ECF No. 59. In a memorandum opinion and order dated April 21, 2011, the Court [*10]  denied the motion for class certification and instructed the parties to "concentrate their efforts on the merits of Chedwick's individual claims." Chedwick v. UPMC, Civil Action No. 07-806, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43239, at *67, 2011 WL 1559792, at *21 (W.D.Pa. Apr. 21, 2011). UPMC filed a motion for summary judgment on October 14, 2011. ECF No. 76. That motion is the subject of this memorandum opinion.

III. Standard of Review
Summary judgment may only be granted where the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and that a judgment as a matter of law is warranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the Court must enter summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In evaluating the evidence, the Court must interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in his or her favor. Watson v. Abington Township, 478 F.3d 144, 147 (3d Cir. 2007). The burden is initially on the moving party to demonstrate that the evidence contained in the record does not create a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 140 (3d Cir. 2004). A dispute is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable trier of fact could return a verdict for the non-moving party. McGreevy v. Stroup, 413 F.3d 359, 363 (3d Cir. 2005). Where the non-moving [*11]  party will bear the burden of proof at trial, the moving party may meet its burden by showing that the admissible evidence contained in the record would be insufficient to carry the non-moving party's burden of proof. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322. Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party, who must go beyond his or her pleadings and designate specific facts by the use of affidavits, depositions, admissions or answers to interrogatories in order to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Id. at 324. The non-moving party cannot defeat a well-supported motion for summary judgment by simply reasserting unsupported factual allegations contained in his or her pleadings. Williams v. Borough of West Chester, 891 F.2d 458, 460 (3d Cir. 1989).

IV. Discussion
Title I of the ADA prohibits certain forms of discrimination against disabled individuals in the employment setting. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117. During the period of time relevant to this case, Title I's anti-discrimination provision provided as follows:

§ 12112. Discrimination
(a) General rule. No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, [*12]  employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
Pub. L. No. 101-336, § 102(a); 104 Stat. 327, 331-332 (1990)(previously codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)).2 The term "qualified individual with a disability" was defined as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, [could] perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual [held] or desire[d]."3 Pub. L. No. 101-336, § 101(8); 104 Stat. 327, 331 (1990)(previously codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). UPMC is both a "covered entity" subject to the provisions of Title I and a recipient of federal financial assistance subject to the Rehabilitation Act's anti-discrimination provision.4 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2); 29 U.S.C. § 794(b).

A. The Discriminatory Discharge Claims
An entity covered under Title I engages in a prohibited form of "discrimination" when it fails or refuses to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). A covered entity similarly violates the ADA when it "den[ies] employment opportunities to a job applicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, if such denial is based on the need of such covered entity to make reasonable accommodation[s] to the physical or mental impairments of the employee or applicant." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(B). The term "reasonable accommodation" is defined broadly enough to include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified [*14]  readers and interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). In the employment context, discrimination claims arising under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the standards applicable to discrimination claims arising under Title I of the ADA. 29 U.S.C. § 794(d).
The documentary record conclusively establishes that UPMC discharged Chedwick on July 6, 2004, pursuant to a policy requiring the automatic termination of any employee whose leave exceeded twenty-six weeks during the course of a rolling twelve-month period. ECF No. 78-10 at 2. Linda Croushore ("Croushore"), the Supervisor of Disability Services for UPMC's Work Partners program, testified that the applicable UMPC policy required a disabled employee seeking to return from leave to formally apply for an alternative position if he or she was incapable of performing the duties of his or her previous position. ECF No. 58-2 at 23. Relying on Shapiro v. Township of Lakewood, 292 F.3d 356, 359-361 (3d Cir. 2002), Chedwick argues that the policy referenced in Croushore's testimony violates the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. ECF No. 80 at 6-7. He contends that UPMC was required to accommodate his PTSD by transferring him to a different position, modifying the requirements of his [*15]  previous position, or permitting him to remain on leave for more than twenty-six weeks. Id. at 7-19.
The record indicates that, at the time of his discharge, Chedwick wanted to perform his work-related duties within the confines of his own home. ECF No. 79-5; ECF No. 79-9 at 1. His treating mental health therapists apparently told him that he was not yet ready to return to his work station or interact with other UPMC employees. Id. Chedwick testified that UNUM Provident personnel had prepared a return-to-work plan temporarily permitting him to spend some time working at home and some time working at his work station, and that UPMC had rejected that idea. ECF No. 78-3 at 18-19. In an affidavit, he declared that Larimore had told him in June 2004 that he needed to be at his work station on a full-time basis if he wanted to return to his position as an Interface Analyst III. ECF No. 79-6 at ¶ 3.
When a disabled employee expresses an interest5 in "reasonable accommodations," a covered employer must initiate an "interactive process" with the employee in order to "identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." [*16]  29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). A covered employer "runs a substantial risk" when it fails to engage in this interactive process. Shapiro, 292 F.3d at 359. If an employer's unwillingness to engage in the interactive process causes the availability of a feasible accommodation to go undiscovered, a disabled employee can establish an actionable violation of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415, 420-421 (3d Cir. 1997). Chedwick argues that UPMC failed to engage in the interactive process by discharging him without giving serious consideration to the idea of letting him work from home. ECF No. 80 at 9.
The legality of UPMC's refusal to let Chedwick work from home was dependent upon whether he was "otherwise qualified" for his position, whether his proposed accommodation was "reasonable," and whether permitting him to work from home would have imposed an "undue hardship on the operation of [UPMC's] business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). Under normal circumstances, the Court would be required to consider these issues in accordance with the burden-shifting framework adopted in Walton v. Mental Health Association of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir. 1999). In this case, however, there is no need for that analysis to take place. To the extent that Chedwick challenges UPMC's decision to discharge him on the ground that he would have been able to retain his position as an Interface [*17]  Analyst III with reasonable accommodations, his claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
Any ADA claims relating to Chedwick's discharge have already been dismissed. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 180-181. Insofar as the discharge decision is concerned, only the Rehabilitation Act claims remain in the case. Id. at 181-187. The Rehabilitation Act was originally enacted in 1973. Pub. L. No. 93-112; 87 Stat. 355 (1973). Since Congress did not enact a statute of limitations for claims arising under § 504, such claims are usually governed by the "most closely analogous" limitations period available under state law. North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U.S. 29, 34, 115 S.Ct. 1927, 132 L.Ed.2d 27 (1995); DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 158, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). In Pennsylvania, claims arising under § 504 are ordinarily governed by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to personal-injury actions. Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, 539 F.3d 199, 208 (3d Cir. 2008); 42 PA. CONS. STAT. § 5524. Nevertheless, Congress has specifically established a four-year statute of limitations for causes of action arising under federal statutory provisions enacted after December 1, 1990, that are not subject to more specific limitations periods. 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a). Where a cause of action is available because of a statutory amendment enacted after December 1, 1990, the four-year statute of limitations applies even if the original version of the amended statute was enacted before that date. Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 369, 380-383, 124 S.Ct. 1836, 158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004). When UPMC moved for the dismissal of the [*18]  Rehabilitation Act claims stemming from Chedwick's discharge, the Court permitted those claims to proceed with the understanding that they were not based on conduct that would have been actionable under the original version of the Rehabilitation Act. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 181-187.
Prior to 1992, the Rehabilitation Act did not require a covered employer to provide a disabled employee with the "reasonable accommodation" of a transfer to a vacant position. School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 289, n. 19, 107 S.Ct. 1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987). In order to be "otherwise qualified" for employment, a disabled employee had to establish that he or she could perform the duties of his or her existing job with "reasonable accommodations." Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1996)("Before 1992, disabled individuals had to prove that they were qualified only for the job that they were employed to do."). The reasonableness of a proposed accommodation was "decided on a case-by-case basis." Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d 1368, 1385 (3d Cir. 1991). The regulations applicable at that time recognized "[j]ob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar actions" as "reasonable accommodations" available to disabled employees under the Rehabilitation Act. 57 Fed. Reg. 12634, 12651 (Apr. 10, 1992)(quoting [*19]  the regulation previously appearing at 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(c)(2)(ii)).
Title I of the ADA became effective on July 26, 1992. Pub. L. No. 101-336, § 108; 104 Stat. 327, 337 (1990). Title I specifically designated a "reassignment to a vacant position" as a "reasonable accommodation" available to disabled employees. Pub. L. No. 101-336, § 101(9)(B); 104 Stat. 327, 331 (1990); 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). Shortly thereafter, Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. Pub. L. No. 102-569; 106 Stat. 4344 (1992). President George H.W. Bush signed the Rehabilitation Act Amendments into law on October 29, 1992. Id. Section 506 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments made Title I's standards applicable to employment discrimination claims arising under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Pub. L. No. 102-569, § 506; 106 Stat. 4344, 4428 (1992); 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). As a result of this amendment, the Rehabilitation Act sometimes requires a recipient of federal financial assistance to transfer a disabled employee to a vacant position. Shiring, 90 F.3d at 831-832. Because such a "reassignment" became a "reasonable accommodation" mandated by the Rehabilitation Act after December 1, 1990, failure-to-transfer claims arising thereunder are governed by a four-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a); Jones, 541 U.S. at 380-383; Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 208 (3d Cir. 2009); Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 181-187. Failure-to-accommodate claims based on conduct that would have been actionable under the Rehabilitation Act prior to 1992 remain subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, 539 F.3d at 208; Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 187, n. 9.
Chedwick was discharged on July 6, 2004. ECF No. 78-10 at 2. This action was commenced on October 25, 2006, when Tish named Chedwick as a plaintiff [*20]  and UPMC as a defendant in her amended complaint. Fowler, 578 F.3d at 209, n. 5.6 More than two years elapsed between Chedwick's discharge and the commencement of this action. Chedwick's assertion that UPMC should have accommodated his disability by allowing him to work as an Interface Analyst III from home amounts to a contention that UPMC failed to provide him with the "[j]ob restructuring" or "modified work schedule[]" that would have been required under the Rehabilitation Act prior to 1992. 57 Fed. Reg. 12634, 12651 (Apr. 10, 1992)(quoting the regulation previously appearing at 29 C.F.R. § 1614.203(c)(2)(ii)). His Rehabilitation Act claims are barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations to the extent that they are based on UPMC's alleged failure to provide accommodations that would have enabled him to perform his previous duties. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 187, n. 9. For this reason, the Court has no occasion to consider whether Chedwick was "otherwise qualified" to perform his previous duties, whether his request for permission to work from home was "reasonable," or whether the proposed accommodation would have placed an "undue hardship" on the operation of UPMC's business. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Walton, 168 F.3d at 670.
To the extent that Chedwick alleges that UPMC should have provided him with the "reasonable accommodation" [*21]  of a "reassignment to a vacant position" rather than with notice that his employment would be terminated, his Rehabilitation Act claims remain before the Court. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 181-187. These claims were clearly commenced within the applicable four-year limitations period. 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a). In order to establish an actionable violation of the Rehabilitation Act under these circumstances, Chedwick must demonstrate that UPMC had a vacant, funded position at or below the level of his former position, and that he was qualified to perform the duties of the vacant position with "reasonable accommodations." Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226, 230 (3d Cir. 2000).
A major point of disagreement between the parties centers on UPMC's policy requiring a disabled employee who desires a transfer to formally apply for a vacant position. UPMC clearly believes that the policy is permissible under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. ECF No. 77 at 2-6, 13-16. Chedwick has consistently maintained that the policy is illegal under Shapiro. ECF No. 80 at 4-9. Indeed, the uniform application of the automatic-termination policy was his primary reason for seeking class certification in this case. ECF No. 57 at 1, ¶ 3 (defining the proposed class to include "all former employees of UPMC for all business [*22]  units from 2004 through the present who were on a medical leave of absence and automatically terminated after twenty-six weeks"). UPMC contends that Shapiro should not be read as broadly as Chedwick suggests. ECF No. 77 at 13-16. Nonetheless, the Court need not resolve the dispute concerning the legality of UPMC's policy and the proper reading of Shapiro. Even if it is assumed that UPMC's policy is unlawful as applied to those disabled employees who could be reasonably accommodated with transfers to vacant positions, Chedwick cannot establish that he could have been reasonably accommodated by a transfer in July 2004.
Although Chedwick faults UPMC for failing to engage in the interactive process required under the Rehabilitation Act, he makes no attempt to demonstrate that he could have been accommodated with a reassignment at the time of his discharge. ECF No. 80 at 7-20. Relying on Taylor v. Phoenixville School District, 184 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 1999), Chedwick posits that UPMC can be held liable for failing to engage in the interactive process even if he cannot demonstrate the existence of a vacant, funded position to which he could have been transferred. Id. at 7-12. In Taylor, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit suggested that the entry [*23]  of summary judgment in favor of an employer was improper where a genuine dispute existed as to whether the employer had made a good-faith effort to participate in the interactive process. Taylor, 184 F.3d at 318. Nevertheless, in Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 224 F.3d 226, 235 (3d Cir. 2000), the Court of Appeals explained that the relevant language in Taylor was applicable only where a plaintiff could persuasively identify "a universe of potential accommodations." Speaking through Judge Alito in Donahue, the Court of Appeals made the following observations:
If the defendant in a failure-to-transfer Rehabilitation Act case moves for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff has not identified any appropriate vacant position to which the plaintiff could have been transferred, the plaintiff may move for a continuance to permit discovery regarding such positions. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(f). But after a full opportunity for discovery, a motion for summary judgment must be granted if the summary judgment record is insufficient to support a judgment in favor of the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255-56, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (1986). Consequently, in a failure-to-transfer case, if, after a full opportunity for discovery, the summary judgment record is insufficient to establish the existence of an appropriate position into which the plaintiff [*24]  could have been transferred, summary judgment must be granted in favor of the defendant—even if it also appears that the defendant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process.
Donahue, 224 F.3d at 234 (emphasis added). The principle that an employee must identify a vacant position to which he or she could have been transferred in order to hold an employer liable for failing to engage in the interactive process is fully consistent with the Court of Appeals' subsequent decision in Shapiro. Shapiro, 292 F.3d at 359-360. Irrespective of whether a disabled employee can proceed on a failure-to-transfer theory without formally applying for a vacant position, he or she cannot prevail without establishing the existence of such a position. Id. at 360 (declining to read Donahue broadly enough to require "an employee in a failure-to-transfer case" to "show that he or she formally applied for the position in question"). An employer's failure to engage in the interactive process is actionable under federal law only where a reasonable accommodation actually exists. Mengine, 114 F.3d at 420-421 ("Nonetheless, if an employer fails to engage in the interactive process, it may not discover a way in which the employee's disability could have been reasonably accommodated, thereby risking [*25]  violation of the Rehabilitation Act.")(emphasis added).
As discussed earlier, Chedwick can challenge UPMC's decision to discharge him solely on the ground that he should have been reassigned to a vacant position. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 181-187. His discriminatory discharge claims are time-barred in all other respects. Id. at 187, n. 9. He cannot premise his claims on "a universe of potential accommodations." Donahue, 224 F.3d at 235. Therefore, Chedwick must "establish the existence of an appropriate position into which [he] could have been transferred" in order to defeat UPMC's motion for summary judgment. Id. at 234.
Chedwick does not identify vacant positions that were available at the time of his discharge. Instead, he makes reference to the twenty-seven positions that he applied for fifteen months later. ECF No. 80 at 15-20. The Court acknowledges that an employer presented with a disabled employee's request for a transfer must consider not only positions that are vacant at the time of the request, but also "positions that the employer reasonably anticipates will become vacant in the fairly immediate future." Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1175 (10th Cir. 1999). In this case, however, the positions specifically identified by Chedwick did not become available until more than a year after his discharge. An employer's [*26]  obligation to locate a vacant position to which a disabled employee can be transferred continues only for a reasonable amount of time. Boykin v. ATC/VanCom of Colorado, L.P., 247 F.3d 1061, 1064-1065 (10th Cir. 2001). It does not continue for more than a year after the date of the employee's termination. Hoskins v. Oakland County Sheriff's Dep't, 227 F.3d 719, 729 (6th Cir. 2000). Chedwick acknowledged during his deposition that he had not yet received medical clearance to return to work at the time of his discharge. ECF No. 78-3 at 18. Because Chedwick cannot identify a vacant position to which he could have been transferred during the summer of 2004, he cannot establish a violation of the Rehabilitation Act based on UPMC's failure to provide him with a "reassignment."
Chedwick argues that UPMC should have accommodated his disability by allowing him to remain on leave beyond the twenty-six weeks permitted under its internal policy. ECF No. 80 at 11-14. As an initial matter, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not require a covered employer to "accommodate" a disabled employee by permitting him or her to remain on leave for an indefinite period of time. Boykin, 247 F.3d at 1065; Walton, 168 F.3d at 671; Dogmanits v. Capital Blue Cross, 413 F. Supp. 2d 452, 461-462 (E.D.Pa. 2005). Furthermore, Chedwick cannot proceed on such a theory under the present circumstances even if it is assumed that a longer period of leave would have been "reasonable" in this case. [*27]  To the extent that Chedwick believes that medical leave extending beyond July 6, 2004, would have enabled him to return to his previous position at some point, his Rehabilitation Act claim is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 187, n. 9. To the extent that Chedwick believes that an extended leave period would have eventually facilitated his transfer to a different position, UPMC is entitled to summary judgment because of his inability to identify a specific position that was available at the time of his discharge, or that would have been available within a reasonable period of time. Boykin, 247 F.3d at 1065; Donahue, 224 F.3d at 234. In either case, Chedwick cannot hold UPMC liable for its decision to discharge him.7
When UPMC challenged all of Chedwick's claims on statute-of-limitations grounds, the Court rejected UPMC's argument on the basis of a distinction between the discriminatory discharge claims and the failure-to-hire claims. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 178-181. UPMC was not allowed to blur the distinction between its initial decision to terminate Chedwick's employment and its subsequent decision not to rehire him. Id. In the same vein, Chedwick cannot premise his discriminatory discharge claims on UPMC's alleged failure to "transfer" him to the positions [*28]  for which he later applied.8 UPMC is entitled to summary judgment with respect to all claims stemming from its decision to discharge Chedwick on July 6, 2004.

B. The Failure-to-Hire Claims
Chedwick's failure-to-hire claims are properly characterized as "disparate treatment" claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 799 F.Supp.2d 492, 504, n. 11 (W.D.Pa. 2011). Since Chedwick presents no "direct evidence" of discrimination, his claims must be analyzed in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's decisions in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).9 In an employment discrimination case of this kind, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of illegal discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the defendant must articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for treating the plaintiff in an adverse manner. Id. at 802-803. If the defendant articulates legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's adverse treatment, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the reasons given by the defendant for such treatment are merely a pretext for unlawful employment discrimination. Id. at 804-805. Evidence suggesting that an employer's stated reasons for an adverse employment action are unworthy of credence is one form of circumstantial [*29]  evidence that a plaintiff can use to establish the existence of intentional discrimination. Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 100, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003).
The plaintiff's burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. In order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the plaintiff need only show that: (1) he or she was a member of a statutorily-protected class; (2) he or she was aggrieved by an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of illegal discrimination. Shah v. Bank of America, 598 F.Supp.2d 596, 604 (D.Del. 2009). The specific elements of a prima facie case generally "depend on the facts of the particular case" before the court and "cannot be established on a one-size-fits-all basis." Jones v. School District of Philadelphia, 198 F.3d 403, 411 (3d Cir. 1999). The prima facie inquiry "remains flexible and must be tailored to fit the specific context in which it is applied." Sarullo v. United States Postal Service, 352 F.3d 789, 797-798 (3d Cir. 2003). Because the prima facie inquiry in any case is fact-specific, "[t]he touchstone of the inquiry is whether the circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination are of evidentiary value, not whether they fit into a mechanical formula." Cobetto v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, 619 F.Supp.2d 142, 153, n. 3 (W.D.Pa. 2007)(emphasis in original), citing O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 312-313, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996). A prima facie case "raises an inference of discrimination" [*30]  sufficient to shift the burden of production to the defendant. Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). This inference is based on an assumption that certain actions, if left unexplained, "are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors." Id.
If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of discrimination through the introduction of admissible evidence indicating that the challenged employment action was taken for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-255. To sustain this burden, "[t]he defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons." Id. at 254. The inquiry as to whether the defendant has met its burden of production "can involve no credibility assessment," since "the burden-of-production determination necessarily precedes the credibility-assessment stage." St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)(emphasis in original). The defendant satisfies its burden of production, and rebuts the plaintiff's prima facie showing of discrimination, simply by introducing admissible evidence that, if taken as true, would permit a finding that the challenged employment action was taken for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. [*31]  Id.
If the defendant meets its burden of production, the dispositive factual issue is framed with "sufficient clarity" to provide the plaintiff with "a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255-256. In order to establish that the defendant is liable for illegal employment discrimination, the plaintiff must ultimately convince the trier of fact that a discriminatory animus was the real reason for the adverse employment action at issue. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 765 (3d Cir. 1994). Liability cannot be established upon a jury's mere disbelief of the defendant's proffered reasons for an adverse employment action, but rather upon the jury's affirmative belief of the plaintiff's contention that the action was taken on the basis of an impermissible discriminatory criterion. St. Mary's Honor Center, 509 U.S. at 519 ("It is not enough, in other words, to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination.")(emphasis in original). Nevertheless, evidence suggesting that an employer's proffered reasons for an adverse employment action are false, when coupled with a plaintiff's prima facie case, may sufficiently undermine the employer's credibility to enable a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that illegal discrimination [*32]  has occurred. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147-148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Evidence used to establish a prima facie case of discrimination may also be relied upon to demonstrate pretext, since nothing about the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine burden-shifting framework requires a court to ration the evidence presented in a particular case among the prima facie and pretext stages of the analysis. Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 370 (3d Cir. 2008). Proof that an employer's explanation for an adverse employment action is unworthy of credence can be a powerful form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination. Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147. Circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination, "but may also be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence." Desert Palace, 539 U.S. at 100, quoting Rogers v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 500, 508, n. 17, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957). Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a plaintiff can sometimes prevail on the basis of circumstantial evidence without introducing "additional, independent evidence of discrimination." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 149. Whether summary judgment is warranted in a given case depends upon the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the evidence discrediting the defendant's proffered reasons for the challenged employment action, and the presence or absence [*33]  of additional evidence that may properly be considered by a court in determining whether a judgment as a matter of law is appropriate. Id. at 148-149.
After learning in October 2005 that his disability benefits would be discontinued, Chedwick formally applied for twenty-seven positions advertised on UPMC's website. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶ 54. Eighteen of the advertised positions were no longer available when Chedwick submitted his applications. Id. at ¶¶ 55-57. Therefore, the Court's inquiry in this case concerns only the nine positions that were available and vacant during the relevant period of time. Id. at ¶ 58.
When an individual applies for a position at one of UPMC's fifty-seven business units, his or her application is initially reviewed by a recruiter. Id. at ¶ 48. The recruiter determines whether the applicant's name and resume should be forwarded to the appropriate manager for further consideration. Id. at ¶¶ 48-50. An applicant whose credentials fall below the minimum qualifications for the sought-after position, or below the preferred qualifications previously conveyed to the recruiter by the hiring manager, may be rejected by the recruiter without being considered by the manager. Id. at [*34]  ¶¶ 49-50. Of the nine applications submitted by Chedwick for vacant positions, five were rejected by recruiters Cyndi McGough ("McGough"), Shannon Williams10 ("Williams") and Ryan Corbett ("Corbett"). Id. at ¶¶ 59-60; ECF No. 78-8 at 4. These applications were never forwarded to the managers responsible for filling the positions. Id. The remaining four applications were forwarded to managers Edward McAllister ("McAllister"), Clifford Denholm ("Denholm"), Bruce Haviland ("Haviland") and John Lovelace ("Lovelace"). ECF No. 78-8 at 4-5. These four managers ultimately decided not to interview or hire Chedwick. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶¶ 62-63. The critical question in this case is whether McGough, Williams, Corbett, McAllister, Denholm, Haviland and Lovelace rejected Chedwick's applications because of his disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a).
An applicant or employee cannot establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination without demonstrating that his or her employer (or prospective employer) knew that he or she was "disabled" at the time of the challenged employment decision. Geraci v. Moody-Tottrup, International, Inc., 82 F.3d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1996); Hedberg v. Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Inc., 47 F.3d 928, 932 (7th Cir. 1995). Chedwick points to nothing in the record which suggests that McGough, Williams, Corbett, McAllister, Denholm, Haviland or [*35]  Lovelace knew about his disability when they decided not to interview or hire him.11 ECF No. 80 at 19-20. The Court notes that Truxal was the manager responsible for hiring an Interface Analyst II. ECF No. 78-19 at 26. Since Truxal had previously served as Chedwick's supervisor, a reasonable trier of fact could easily infer that he knew that Chedwick suffered from PTSD. Although Chedwick applied for the Interface Analyst II position, it is undisputed that Williams rejected his application without forwarding it to Truxal for further consideration. ECF Nos. 78 & 79 at ¶ 60; ECF No. 78-8 at 4. The record contains no evidence which indicates that Williams knew about Chedwick's disability when she decided not to forward his application to Truxal. Chedwick cannot defeat UPMC's motion for summary judgment simply by speculating that the individuals responsible for reviewing his applications were aware of his disability and decided not to hire him because of it. Geraci, 82 F.3d at 582; Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 931-932.
Manager Melissa Russo ("Russo") hired John W. Newman ("Newman") to work as a Programmer II. ECF No. 78-19 at 36. Although Chedwick applied for the Programmer II position, Williams did not forward his application to Russo. ECF Nos. [*36]  78 & 79 at ¶ 60; ECF No. 78-8 at 4. Chedwick contends that his qualifications for the position greatly exceeded those of Newman, and that a reasonable jury could infer that he was not hired because of his disability. ECF No. 80 at 20. Williams testified that she typically declined to forward applications submitted by individuals who did not meet the preferred qualifications conveyed to her by UPMC's hiring managers. ECF No. 78-11 at 13. In any event, the record contains no evidence which suggests that Williams and Russo were aware of Chedwick's disability during the relevant period of time.
On December 5, 2005, Perry emailed Croushore on behalf of UNUN Provident and asked her to assist Chedwick in his efforts to apply for two positions advertised on UPMC's website. ECF No. 79-3 at 3. Croushore responded two days later by stating that UPMC had multiple recruiters working throughout its numerous departments, and that she did not know where to direct Chedwick. Id. She forwarded Perry's message to Larimore and observed that she could not help Chedwick with the application process. Id. at 1-2. Larimore forwarded Croushore's message to Rimer, who opined that Chedwick was qualified for only one of the [*37]  two positions. Id. at 1. Croushore testified that she sometimes needed to discuss an employee's medical restrictions with recruiters and managers in order to facilitate his or her transfer to a vacant position through the Work Partners program. ECF No. 78-12 at 8. She went on to explain that the program was available only to individuals employed by UPMC, that Chedwick had not been an employee of UPMC during the fall of 2005, and that he had never participated in the program. ECF No. 78-13 at 13. Williams testified that she had never dealt with Work Partners personnel while working as a recruiter. ECF No. 78-11 at 8.
In an affidavit submitted in opposition to Chedwick's motion for class certification, Croushore acknowledged that a recruiter could access a former UPMC employee's work history when reviewing his or her application. ECF No. 78-7 at ¶ 20. Croushore further stated that a former employee's work history would include information relating to whether he or she had previously been placed "on a personal or family medical leave of absence," but that it would not reveal the nature of his or her "medical diagnosis, condition or treatment." Id. Assuming arguendo that an applicant's status as [*38]  a "disabled" individual could be inferred from his or her leave history, the mere fact that Chedwick's leave history was accessible to the recruiters and managers responsible for filling the positions in question does not mean that it was actually accessed by them. Williams testified that she had never been involved in the rehiring of former employees who had been terminated for remaining on leave in excess of the twenty-six weeks permitted under UPMC's policy. ECF No. 78-11 at 11. She also stated that she had never participated in the reassignment of disabled employees to other positions. Id. at 10. Haviland testified that he did not have frequent interaction with Work Partners personnel in connection with the hiring process. ECF No. 79-10 at 9-10. The evidentiary record simply provides no basis upon which a reasonable trier of fact could infer that the recruiters and managers who decided not to interview or hire Chedwick were aware of his disability during the relevant period of time. Ambrose v. Township of Robinson, 303 F.3d 488, 494 (3d Cir. 2002)("There is no evidence that anyone brought Ambrose's affidavit to the attention of the Township Supervisors or that they were otherwise aware of it when they voted to suspend Ambrose."); Geraci, 82 F.3d at 581 ("We cannot presume [*39]  that an employer most likely practiced unlawful discrimination when it does not know that the plaintiff even belongs to the protected class.").
A decisionmaker's knowledge of a former employee's protected characteristic can sometimes be inferred from the fact that the relevant information was generally known to other members of the workforce. Stephens v. Kerrigan, 122 F.3d 171, 177 (3d Cir. 1997). In this case, however, no such inference could reasonably be drawn. The UPMC entities employ over 40,000 individuals.12 ECF No. 1 at ¶ 7. Chedwick was not a UPMC employee when he applied for the positions at issue. ECF No. 78-13 at 13. He never participated in the Work Partners program. Id. Under these circumstances, a jury could only speculate as to whether his disability was known to the recruiters and managers responsible for filling the sought-after positions. Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 931-932. Since the evidence presented by Chedwick is not adequate to create an inference that his applications were rejected because of his disability, he cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. O'Connor, 517 U.S. at 312.
In light of Chedwick's failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, there is no "presumption of discrimination" for UPMC to rebut. [*40]  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-256. Aside from the job descriptions for the nine vacant positions and the application summaries detailing the employment histories of the successful applicants, UPMC presents no evidence explaining the precise reasons for Chedwick's rejection. ECF Nos. 78-18 & 78-19. UPMC simply maintains, in very general terms, that Chedwick was not hired because other applicants were deemed to have superior credentials. ECF No. 77 at 8. Had Chedwick been able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a serious question would exist as to whether the evidence put forth by UPMC is sufficient to satisfy its burden of production under Burdine. EEOC v. Target Corp. 460 F.3d 946, 958 (7th Cir. 2006)(finding an employer's proffered reason for failing to hire an applicant to be inadequate because the employer had not provided a "clear statement" explaining the qualifications that the applicant lacked); Patrick v. Ridge, 394 F.3d 311, 317 (5th Cir. 2004)(holding that "justifying an adverse employment decision by offering a content-less and nonspecific statement, such as that a candidate is not 'sufficiently suited' for the position, is not specific enough to meet a defendant employer's burden of production"); Halfond v. Legal Aid Society of the City of New York, 70 F.Supp.2d 155, 162 (E.D.N.Y. 1998)(explaining that a "vague and ambiguous explanation does not 'frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity [*41]  so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext'"), quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255-256; Grier v. Secretary of Navy, 677 F. Supp. 362, 367 (E.D.Pa. 1988)("It is not enough to say that only 'highly qualified' individuals were selected and that Mr. Grier was not found to be 'highly qualified.'"). An employer seeking to rebut an employee's prima facie case must ordinarily present testimonial evidence explaining why the challenged employment decision was made. Alvarado v. Texas Rangers, 492 F.3d 605, 617 (5th Cir. 2007); Bates v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 81 F.Supp.2d 1292, 1301-1303 (N.D.Fla. 2000). The record in this case contains no precise explanation as to why the successful applicants were chosen over Chedwick. This deficiency in the evidence submitted by UPMC, however, is offset by Chedwick's own failure to establish that the recruiters and managers responsible for filling the relevant positions were aware of his disability when they decided not to interview or hire him. Geraci, 82 F.3d at 581-582. The case cannot proceed to trial on the basis of "unsupported speculation." Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 931.

V. Conclusion
The Rehabilitation Act claims based on UPMC's decision to discharge Chedwick on July 6, 2004, were timely filed only to the extent that they are premised on a failure-to-transfer theory. Chedwick, 619 F.Supp.2d at 181-187. They are time-barred in all other respects. Id. at 187, n. 9. Chedwick testified that, at the time of his discharge, he had not received medical [*42]  clearance to return to work. ECF No. 78-3 at 18. He was apparently unable to work around other UPMC employees at that point in time. ECF No. 79-9 at 1. Since Chedwick has presented no evidence establishing that UPMC had jobs available in July 2004 that would have accommodated his disability, UPMC is entitled to summary judgment with respect to his discriminatory discharge claims. Donahue, 224 F.3d at 234. In light of this determination, the Court has no occasion to consider whether UPMC may lawfully terminate employees on disability leave who can be accommodated with transfers to vacant positions, but who fail to formally apply for such transfers. Shapiro, 292 F.3d at 360-361.
This case has been pending for almost five and a half years. Despite the long history of this case, the record contains no testimonial evidence relating to the manner in which Chedwick's applications for reemployment were considered by UPMC during and after the fall of 2005. Although Williams and Haviland were both deposed, they were never asked whether they had been aware of Chedwick's PTSD when they were considering his applications for employment. ECF Nos. 78-11 & 79-10. It is undisputed that Chedwick was not a UPMC employee when he submitted his applications. [*43]  ECF No. 78-3 at 23; ECF No. 78-13 at 13. He never participated in the Work Partners program. ECF No. 78-13 at 13-14. On the basis of the existing record, a trier of fact could only speculate as to whether Chedwick was not rehired because of his disability. Geraci, 82 F.3d at 582; Hedberg, 47 F.3d at 931-932. Since Chedwick cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, UPMC's motion for summary judgment will be granted.
