Order
Plaintiff's motion to amend or alter judgment [81] is denied for the reasons set forth below. The status hearing set for 4/14/2020 [104] is stricken. Civil case remains closed.

Statement
The court granted judgment to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County ("OCJ") in this suit brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., by Richard Smith, Jr., who had been employed at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center ("JTDC"). Docs. 75-77 (reported at 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59565, 2019 WL 1515007 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 8, 2019)). Familiarity with the court's summary judgment opinion is assumed. Smith moves for reconsideration as to his failure to accommodate claim. Doc. 81. The motion is denied.
First, Smith contends that the summary judgment record shows that he asked only for an accommodation through August 2016—about one month after the July 2016 grievance meeting—and not an "open-ended" [*2]  accommodation. Id. at 3, 8-11. The court's opinion granted that point, noting that Smith requested an accommodation only through August 2016, but it explained that because he "adduce[d] no evidence concerning whether or when his [work] restrictions would have abated," his "requested exemption ... was functionally unlimited in duration." , 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59565, 2019 WL 1515007, at *6-7. As the precedents cited by the court hold, where the plaintiff cannot show any date by which he could return to regular work, a limited period of leave is not, in fact, limited. See Whitaker v. Wis. Dep't of Health Servs., 849 F.3d 681, 686 (7th Cir. 2017) ("[The plaintiff] does not provide sufficient evidence to allow a trier of fact to find that, if the [employer] had given her additional unpaid leave, she likely would have been able to return to work on a regular basis. While [the plaintiff] said that she was receiving treatment, she did not explain the effectiveness of this treatment or the medical likelihood that it would enable her to return to work regularly."); Basden v. Prof'l Transp., Inc., 714 F.3d 1034, 1038 (7th Cir. 2013) ("[The plaintiff] responded to [the employer's] summary judgment motion with evidence that medication improved her condition; that she had hoped for enough improvement to return to work regularly after leave; and that she subsequently had brief employment [*3]  that was interrupted by a two-week absence caused by her condition. This evidence was insufficient to support a factual finding that [the plaintiff] was able to come to work regularly at the time of her termination, or that her regular attendance could have been expected following the leave she sought or with any other accommodation."). Accordingly, Smith's request for limited work through August 2016 does not amount to a reasonable accommodation because he adduced no evidence about whether or how his medical condition might have improved after August 2016.
Second, Smith contends the court erred in crediting OCJ's submission that no vacant positions existed that could accommodate his disability. Doc. 81 at 3, 11-14. In so doing, Smith fails to acknowledge that he bears the burden of showing that a suitable vacant position existed at the time he was terminated. See Majors v. GE Co., 714 F.3d 527, 534 (7th Cir. 2013) ("[The plaintiff] bears the burden of establishing that [h]e could perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation, and can't meet this burden if the only accommodations suggested were unreasonable."); Kotwica v. Rose Packing Co., 637 F.3d 744, 750 (7th Cir. 2011) ("[P]laintiffs, when alleging that an employer's failure to reassign them violated [*4]  the ADA's anti-discrimination provisions, bear the burden of showing that there is a vacant position in existence for which they are qualified."). As a result, Smith was required to adduce evidence of a suitable vacant position at the time he was terminated; OCJ did not have to show that no such position existed.
Smith's best evidence on this point is a statement from George Sanchez, the union steward, that "[t]here likely were" open positions to which Smith could have returned, though Sanchez was not "100 percent certai[n] whether there would have been." Doc. 81 at 5 (quoting Doc. 52-9 at 13). However, Smith did not present that evidence in his Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) response or Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) statement of additional facts, so it was not part of the summary judgment record. See Shaffer v. Am. Med. Ass'n, 662 F.3d 439, 442 (7th Cir. 2011) (noting that it "is certainly within a district court's prerogative" to decline to consider "any facts that were not contained in the parties' Rule 56.1 statements"); Midwest Imps., Ltd. v. Coval, 71 F.3d 1311, 1317 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding that the predecessor to Local Rule 56.1(b)(3) "provides the only acceptable means of ... presenting additional facts to the district court"); Dunhill Asset Servs. III, LLC v. Tinberg, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102451, 2012 WL 3028334, at *3 (N.D. Ill. July 23, 2012) ("Under settled law, facts asserted in a brief but not presented in a Local Rule 56.1 statement are disregarded in resolving a summary judgment motion.") (internal quotation [*5]  marks omitted); Byrd-Tolson v. Supervalu, Inc., 500 F. Supp. 2d 962, 966 (N.D. Ill. 2007) ("[F]acts are properly presented through the framework of the Rule 56.1 statements, and not through citation in the briefs to raw record material ... .").
Smith also cites deposition testimony from Eboni Montsho, JTDC's human resources director, who did not recall what she did to determine whether an alternative position existed, and from Zenaida Alonzo, JTDC's general counsel, who testified that she assumed that Montsho had looked into alternative positions but did not specifically recall considering any such positions for Smith. Doc. 81 at 4-7. Montsho's and Alonzo's inability to recall what positions they considered for Smith does not carry his burden of showing that a vacant position in fact existed. At best, their inability to recall what steps they took after receiving Smith's ADA request might tend to show that they failed to engage in the interactive process. But as the court explained, "Smith's inability to identify a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the [position's] essential functions defeats his interactive process argument and distinguishes" the cases he cites in seeking reconsideration. , 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59565, 2019 WL 1515007, at *8. For example, it is true that the court in [*6]  Sams v. City of Chicago, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167018, 2018 WL 4679581 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 28, 2018), did not find that the Medical Services Section ("MSS") position that the plaintiff police officer wanted was definitely available at the time she was terminated. Id. at *13. However, the plaintiff in Sams adduced evidence that multiple police officers were detailed to the MSS after reporting medical issues. Id. at *4 ("Plaintiff is aware of three officers ... who were assigned to MSS ... . A number of the officers in MSS were assigned there on limited duty due to medical issues."). Thus, while the Sams employer's failure to engage in the interactive process prevented the plaintiff from engaging in the process that produced the same requested reasonable accommodation for other officers with medical restrictions, Smith failed to adduce evidence of a reasonable accommodation that OCJ could have offered if it had only engaged in the interactive process.
Third, Smith contends that the court abused its discretion in declining to deem forfeited OCJ's argument, developed primarily in its reply brief, that ADA liability cannot rest exclusively on the employer's failure to engage in the interactive process. Doc. 81 at 3-4, 8, 14-15. As Smith acknowledges, id. at 8, 14-15, a footnote in OCJ's opening brief asserted [*7]  that the interactive process is a discussion "to determine the appropriate accommodation for a qualified individual with a disability" and that Smith failed to show that he is a qualified individual. Doc. 42 at 13 n.4 (internal quotation marks omitted). The footnote cited Majors, 714 F.3d at 535, and Jackson v. City of Chicago, 414 F.3d 806, 813 (7th Cir. 2005), where the Seventh Circuit held that "whether the discussion between [the employer] and [the employee] was sufficiently interactive is immaterial" if the employee fails to show that he "was a qualified individual," Majors, 714 F.3d at 535, and explained that "when considering the success of the interactive process, we first look to whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the availability of a vacant position to accommodate the employee," Jackson, 414 F.3d at 813 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the precedent on which Smith principally relies for his interactive process theory, Spurling v. C & M Fine Pack, Inc., 739 F.3d 1055 (7th Cir. 2014), also makes clear that "an employer's failure to engage in the interactive process alone is not an independent basis for liability." Id. at 1062. As a result, the court did not abuse its discretion declining to find OCJ's argument forfeited. See Harmon v. Gordon, 712 F.3d 1044, 1053 (7th Cir. 2013) ("We have often said that a party can waive an argument by presenting it only in an undeveloped footnote ... .") (emphasis [*8]  added); ISI Int'l, Inc. v. Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, 256 F.3d 548, 551 (7th Cir. 2001) (in excusing forfeiture, explaining that "[f]ederal courts are entitled to apply the right body of law, whether the parties name it or not"). Although arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief may be deemed forfeited, see Narducci v. Moore, 572 F.3d 313, 324 (7th Cir. 2009), OCJ's reply did not raise a new ground for summary judgment, but only elaborated on a point made in its initial brief by responding to Smith's contention that the breakdown of the interactive process justified denying summary judgment.
