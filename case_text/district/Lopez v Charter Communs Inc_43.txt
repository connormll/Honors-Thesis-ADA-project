ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 27]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Guadalupe Lopez brings this disability discrimination suit against her employer, Defendant Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter"). (Dkt. 1-1 [Complaint].)1 Before the Court is Charter's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 27 [hereinafter "Mot."].) For the following reasons, that motion is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.2

II. BACKGROUND

A. The CSR Position
On June 2, 2003, Charter hired Lopez to be a Customer Service Call Center Representative ("CSR") at their Ontario, California call center. (Dkt. 27-2 [Declaration of Nicole Jones, hereinafter "Jones Decl."] ¶ 4.) Charter is a provider of cable television, internet, and telephone services. (Id. ¶ 3.) Among other duties, call center CSRs like Lopez [*2]  are responsible for fielding incoming phone calls from customers, providing them with technical support, and responding to their complaints. (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 4 [CSP 4 Job Description].) As the job title suggests, CSRs spend a majority of their time speaking to customers over the phone. The average call lasts approximately eight minutes. (Dkt. 29-1 Ex. 225 [Deposition of James Wells, hereinafter "Wells Dep."] at 38:5-11.) A computer program determines which CSR will field each customer call. All CSRs are placed in an online queue, and the computer program routes each call to the CSR who has been waiting the longest for a call. (Id. at 23:13-25.) CSRs can take themselves out of the queue and signal that they are not available to field new calls if they leave their work stations during their shifts. (Id. at 24:6-25.)
CSRs work in eight-hour shifts. (Jones Decl. ¶ 22.) Charter does not hire CSRs on a part-time basis. (Id.) The CSR job description states that CSRs "must be available to work outside normal business hours to satisfy customer needs" and "[m]ust be willing to work any schedule; days, evenings and/or weekends." (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 4.) Between 2016 and 2017, there were between 300 and [*3]  400 CSRs working at Charter's Ontario call center in several different shifts. (Wells Dep. at 21:6-20.) The first shift begins at 5:45 a.m. and the last shift ends at 12:30 a.m. (Id. at 21:2-7.)

B. Lopez's Injuries
On June 29, 2016, Lopez suffered an injury at work when she slipped and fell walking down the stairs during her lunch break. (Dkt. 29-1 Ex. 221 [Deposition of Guadalupe Lopez, hereinafter "Lopez Dep."] at 16:7-16.) As a result of the fall, Lopez suffered a torn rotator cuff, a fractured coccyx, and a right forearm contusion. (Id. at 18:17-19:5.) After visiting a doctor later that day, Lopez received a note stating that she would have to limit the use of her right arm until her injury healed. (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 22 [compilation of relevant medical records] at 1.) Charter determined that, because Lopez's job required her to type periodically throughout her shift, it could not accommodate this restriction. (Dkt. 29-1 Ex. 222 [Deposition of Nicole Jones, hereinafter "Jones Dep."] at 96:2-8.) Accordingly, Charter put Plaintiff on a paid leave of absence during which she received seventy percent of her salary plus benefits. (Jones Decl. ¶ 7.)
About three months later, on October 28, 2016, [*4]  Lopez received another doctor's note which permitted her to return to work with the following restriction: "sit/stand as tolerated." (Id. ¶ 8.) Nicole Jones, a human resources manager at Charter, determined that Charter could accommodate this restriction. (Jones Dep. at 136:7-16.) Lopez returned to Charter on December 7, 2016 with this restriction. (Jones Decl. ¶ 10.) Around the time that Lopez returned to work, she requested a sit-stand desk that would allow her to type on her keyboard while standing up. (Lopez Dep. at 55:5-20.) Jones informed Lopez that she could not provide her with such a desk until she received a doctor's note stating that Lopez needed the desk in order to work. (Jones Dep. at 144:17-20, 145:15-23.) Lopez began working without the sit-stand desk, and as a result she was oftentimes forced to bend down over her desk to type while standing. (Lopez Dep. at 21:7-18.) Lopez eventually provided Jones with a doctor's note, and Charter ordered her a sit-stand desk. (Id. at 22:4-21.) However, it did not arrive for approximately one month, and uring this time, Lopez's health worsened. (Id.) On January 18, 2017, she went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a cervical [*5]  sprain. (Id. at 24:3-12.) She missed work from January 23 through January 27 but returned later that month. (Jones Decl. ¶ 19.)
On January 25, 2017, Lopez received another doctor's note allowing her to work subject to the following restrictions: (1) sit and stand as tolerated, and (2) work for a maximum of six hours per day. (Id. ¶ 20.) Lopez gave the note to Jones. (Id.) Upon receipt of the note, Jones contacted Alex Levya, an Operations Team Manager who was responsible for staffing and scheduling. (Jones Dep at 42:15-43:22.) Jones, Levya, and Anne Long, the Director of Human Resources at the Ontario call center, had a meeting to discuss whether to Charter could accommodate Lopez's proposed restrictions. (Id. at 280:7-24.) Levya instructed Jones that Charter could not accommodate Lopez's request to work six-hour days for several reasons, all related to the fact that Charter considers working fulltime and working overtime to be essential functions of the CSR position. (Dkt. 29-1 Ex. 226 [Deposition of Alejandro Levya, hereinafter "Levya Dep"] at 52:10-14; Jones Decl. ¶ 22.)
Jones then called Lopez and informed her that Charter could not allow her to return to work with the six-hour restriction. [*6]  (Lopez Dep. at 35:9-14.) Lopez remained out on leave, and between February 8, 2017 and September 12, 2017, she continued to receive Temporary Total Disability payments at seventy percent of her salary. (Jones Decl. ¶ 22.) Lopez had surgery on her shoulder on April 11, 2017, rendering her unable to work at all between that day and July 5, 2017. (Id. ¶ 25.)
On September 13, 2017, Lopez returned to her doctor and received another note. The doctor determined that she could return to work at Charter subject to the following restrictions: (1) may push and lift up to five founds constantly, (2) no reaching above shoulders with affected extremity, (3) work six hours maximum, (4) sit and stand as tolerated. (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 22 at 38.) Charter again determined that it was unable to accommodate Lopez's six-hour restriction, and Lopez remained on a leave of absence. (Jones Decl. ¶ 27.) From January 23, 2018 to November 25, 2018, Lopez was totally disabled, rendering her unable to work at all. She is not seeking damages for this time period. (Dkt. 29-3 [Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Separate Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, hereinafter "P's Resp."] at ¶ 19.)
Finally, on November 25, 2018, Lopez's [*7]  doctor again released her to return to work, subject to the following permanent restrictions: (1) no working for longer than six hours per day or 30 hours per week, (2) no lifting more than five pounds, (3) no sitting for longer than twenty minutes without a five-minute break, and (4) no standing for more than twenty minutes without a break. (Jones Decl. ¶ 34.) Lopez's doctor testified that the six-hour restriction was permanent and would remain in place for the rest of Lopez's life. (Dkt. 27-5 [Deposition of Khalid Ahmed, hereinafter "Ahmed Dep."] at 40:2-8.)
Lopez was never formally terminated by Charter, (Jones Decl. ¶ 37), but she no longer considers herself to be employed by them, (Lopez Dep. at 127:14-17). Charter's understanding is that Lopez remains employed and out on leave. (Jones Dep. at 352:13-22.) Lopez maintains that she is currently healthy enough to work a six-hour shift and would return to work if Charter would accommodate her restriction. (Lopez Dep. at 127:18-21.)

C. Procedural Posture
Lopez filed suit against Charter in Los Angeles County Superior Court on August 3, 2018 asserting seven causes of action under California law: (1) failure to accommodate a known disability; [*8]  (2) failure to engage in the interactive process; (3) disability discrimination; (4) failure to prevent discrimination; (5) retaliation; (6) wrongful termination; and (7) failure to provide accurate wage statements. (See generally Compl.) Charter subsequently removed the case and filed the instant motion for summary judgment approximately one year later on each of Lopez's seven claims. (Mot.) Lopez opposed Charter's motion, (Dkt. 29 [hereinafter "Opp'n"], and both sides filed numerous evidentiary objections.3

III. STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment on "each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. A factual issue is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant's favor. [*9]  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and is determined by looking to the substantive law. Id. "Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 249.
Where the movant will bear the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant "must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). In contrast, where, as here, the nonmovant will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim or defense, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970), or (2) showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. Once this burden is met, the party resisting the motion must set forth, by affidavit, or as otherwise provided under Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. A party opposing summary judgment must support its assertion that a material fact is genuinely disputed by (i) citing to materials in the record, (ii) showing the moving party's materials are inadequate to establish an absence of genuine dispute, or (iii) [*10]  showing that the moving party lacks admissible evidence to support its factual position. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)-(B). The opposing party may also object to the material cited by the movant on the basis that it "cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). But the opposing party must show more than the "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence"; rather, "there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [opposing party]." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all justifiable inferences in its favor. Id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). The court does not make credibility determinations, nor does it weigh conflicting evidence. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But conclusory and speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise triable issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. Thornhill Publ'g Co. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).

IV. ANALYSIS

A. Failure to Accommodate
Charter first seeks summary judgment on Lopez's California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") failure to accommodate claim. FEHA requires employers to provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a known physical disability, unless doing so would cause undue [*11]  hardship. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). To prevail on her failure to accommodate claim, Lopez must prove that (1) she suffered a disability, (2) she could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) Charter failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. See Wilson v. County of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009). In this case, both the second and the third elements are in dispute. The Court finds that, after construing the evidence in a light most favorable to Lopez, genuine factual disputes remain as to both of these elements.

1. Essential Functions
The bulk of the parties' briefing is dedicated to the threshold issue of whether Lopez could perform the essential functions of the CSR position during the times that she was cleared to return to work with a six-hour shift limit. The parties dispute whether working full time and working overtime are essential functions of the CSR position. According to Charter, it was not obligated to accommodate Lopez's six-hour shift request because doing so would eliminate the essential job functions of working full-time and working overtime. Lopez contends that genuine issues exist as to whether working full-time and working overtime are essential functions of the CSR position. The Court agrees. [*12] 
Essential functions are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires" and do not include "the marginal functions of the position." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). Marginal functions of a position are "those that, if not performed, would not eliminate the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an alternative way." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(e)(3). A job function may be considered essential "for any of several reasons, including, but not limited to" (1) if the reason that the position exists is to perform that function, (2) if there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the function can be distributed, and (3) if the function is highly specified, such that an employee is hired based on expertise or the ability to perform the function. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). Evidence of whether a given function is essential can include, but is not limited to: (1) the employer's judgment, (2) written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, and (3) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (4) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function, (5) [*13]  the work experiences of past incumbents in the job, and (6) current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2). Employers are not required to eliminate an essential job function in order to meet their obligation to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled employees. See Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 375, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). The determination of which functions are essential to any given position is a "highly fact-specific inquiry." Lui v. City and County of San Francisco, 211 Cal. App. 4th 962, 971, 150 Cal. Rptr. 3d 385 (2012) (internal quotation omitted).
Based on the evidence before the Court, a reasonable jury could conclude that working full-time and working overtime are marginal functions of the CSR position, as opposed to essential ones. First, the CSR job description used by Charter provides strong evidence that these functions are not essential. The job description contains an exhaustive list of duties that are "essential job functions . . . necessary to complete the work." (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 4.) This detailed list of "essential" duties—which includes tasks like "receiving [a] high volume of incoming phone calls and respond[ing] to inquiries," "provid[ing] technical support for customers," and "respond[ing] to customer complaints in a professional manner"—makes no mention of working fulltime or working overtime. ( [*14] See id.) Such an omission provides Lopez with strong evidence that neither function is essential to the CSR position. Cf. Rincon v. AFSCME, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114403, 2013 WL 4389460, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2013) (finding that no genuine issue remained as to whether working extended hours were essential to being a union organizer when the position's description expressly provided that "extended work hours are required"); Saracay v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163179, 2019 WL 4194308, at *5 (C.D. Cal. June 13, 2019) (certain physical tasks were essential functions to being a hotel housekeeper when the job description indicated that "physical requirements" of the position include "mov[ing], lift[ing], carry[ing], and plac[ing] objects weighing less than or equal to fifty-five pounds without assistance and in excess of fifty-five pounds with assistance").
Defendants make much of the fact that the CSR job description states that CSRs "must be available to work outside normal business hours to satisfy customer needs." (Dkt. 27-2 Ex. 4.) But this description does little to help their position that working full-time or working overtime are essential functions of the CSR position. The reference to required work "outside of normal business hours" makes no express mention of fulltime shifts and overtime. (Id.) Instead, this requirement likely refers to the fact that CSR shifts—which [*15]  can begin as early as 5:45 a.m. and can run as late as 12:30 a.m.—often require CSRs to be at work outside of normal business hours. (Wells Dep. at 21:2-7.) Taken as a whole, the CSR job description supports Lopez's position.
Although Charter's job description may be sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on its own, Lopez also persuasively argues that many of the other factors listed in § 12926(f) also support her position. First, this case does not present a situation in which there are a "limited number of employees available" to perform the job. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). During the relevant time period, there were approximately 400 other CSRs at Charter's Ontario call center all performing the same job as Lopez. (Wells Dep. at 21:6-20.) Nor would working less than a full eight-hour shift "eliminate the need" for the CSR position. See 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11065(e)(3). The Court is also not convinced that the consequences of allowing Lopez to work a six-hour shift are as drastic as Charter claims. Lopez has introduced evidence indicating that the call center's computer program can seamlessly adjust during times that CSRs are unavailable to take calls. (Id. at 24:6-25.) The "work experiences of past incumbents" factor also remains [*16]  disputed. Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2). Though Charter's official policy was to hire CSRs only on a fulltime basis, Lopez provides evidence that Charter has permitted other CSRs to work a part-time schedule on at least three separate occasions. (See Dkt. 29-1 Ex. 223 [Deposition of Anne Long, hereinafter "Long Dep."] at 55:6-16; Jones Dep. at 273:13-22.) Furthermore, before her injuries, Lopez was never told that working an eight-hour shift was essential to performing her job duties and she was oftentimes permitted to leave work early on light days and on days that she had personal commitments. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 3.)
Charter's reliance on Rincon v. AFSCME—a case in which a district court determined that working extended hours was an essential function of being a labor organizer—is misplaced.4 First of all, unlike the CSR job description, the job description in Rincon expressly provided that "extended work hours are required." Rincon, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114403, 2013 WL 4389460, at *10. Moreover, the defendant employer submitted evidencing showing that "extended hours are essential to the success of its organizing campaigns" because campaigns often occur in "organizing blitzes" which required organizers to work significantly more than forty hours per week. Id. Charter has failed [*17]  to persuasively argue that having CSRs work full-time shifts is similarly essential to its goal of providing quality customer services. Lopez has submitted evidence which indicates that the impact on customer wait-time would be negligible if Charter allowed one of its approximately 400 CSRs to work a slightly shorter shift. (See, e.g., Wells Dep. at 24:6-25, 59:20-25; Long Dep. at 55:6-15.)
Charter raises an alternative, but related, argument for why Lopez is not a qualified individual under FEHA. It contends that Lopez's failure to accommodate claim fails because she could not perform her CSR duties without reinjuring herself. FEHA does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability "if the employee, because of a physical or mental disability . . . cannot perform those [essential] duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee's health or safety . . . even with reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). In support of this argument, Charter asserts that (1) Lopez told her doctors that she believed that she was aggravating her condition by working, (2) Dr. Ahmed testified that Lopez's condition would have worsened if she returned [*18]  to work, and (3) Lopez reported that she is "unable to work without pain" and continues to report high levels of pain. (Mot. at 23-25.) Lopez contends that she has raised a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether she could perform the essential duties of the CSR position without endangering her health. The Court agrees that this issue remains in dispute. Despite acknowledging that she continues to experience considerable pain, Lopez testified that, if Charter were willing to accommodate her six-hour shift restriction, she could return to work despite her health problems. (Lopez Dep. at 89:14-16.) More importantly, Lopez's doctor agreed with this assessment. He testified that, as long as she complied with the restrictions he laid out, Lopez could return to work safely despite her continued pain. (Ahmed Dep. at 36:11-15, 38:22-39:2.) This testimony is sufficient to create a genuine factual dispute regarding Lopez's ability to safely return to work.
In sum, Lopez has successfully established that genuine disputes exist as to whether working fulltime and working overtime are essential functions to the CSR position. She has also established that genuine issues remain as to [*19]  whether she could return to work at Charter without reinjuring herself. Thus, Charter's summary judgment motion is DENIED to the extent that it is premised on Lopez not being a qualified individual under FEHA.

2. Reasonable Accommodation
The parties also dispute the third element of Lopez's failure to accommodate claim—whether Charter failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. Under FEHA, it is an unlawful employment practice "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee" unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1). Reasonable accommodations can include, (1) "making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities;" (2) job restructuring, which may include "reallocation or redistribution of non-essential job functions in a job with multiple responsibilities;" (3) "providing an alteration of when and/or how an essential function is performed;" or (4) "providing a part-time or modified work schedule." 2 Cal. Code Regs., § 11065(p)(2).
Charter contends that no genuine dispute remains on this element because it reasonably accommodated Lopez by placing her on permanent [*20]  leave. However, under California law, "[w]hen an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence." 2 Cal. Code Regs., § 11068(c); see also Wallace v. County of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 134, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016) (holding that defendant's decision to put plaintiff on leave was not a lawful accommodation under § 11068(c) when he could perform the essential functions of his job). As discussed above, genuine issues of fact remain as to whether Lopez could have returned to work with a reasonable accommodation, namely the six-hour restriction proposed by her doctor. (See Ahmed Dep. 32:6-34:10.) Thus, a material dispute remains as to whether Charter reasonably accommodated Lopez by putting her on leave.
Similar factual issues also remain on the question of whether Lopez's request for six-hour shifts was reasonable or would impose an undue burden on Charter. Lopez introduced evidence that (1) Charter has on at least three occasions permitted CSRs to work part-time for extended periods of time, (2) Charter oftentimes allows CSRs to work less than a full eight-hour shift, and (3) allowing Lopez to work a six-hour shift would have a negligible impact on customer wait-time given the number of other CSRs [*21]  Charter employs. (See P's Resp. ¶ 18.) In light of this evidence, the Court cannot find that Charter has met its burden in establishing that accommodating Lopez's proposed six-hour shift would impose an undue burden on it. Accordingly, Charter's summary judgment motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim.

3. The Scope of Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate Claim
Finally, the parties dispute whether Lopez's failure to accommodate claim can be premised on Charter's alleged delay in providing her with a sit-stand desk during December 2016 and January 2017. Charter argues that "the only failure to accommodate that Lopez alleges in her Complaint is Charter's refusal to allow Lopez to work a six-hour shift." (Mot. at. 26.) Lopez contends that her Complaint alleged detailed facts regarding Charter's failure to provide her with a sit-stand desk and that those allegations were incorporated into her failure to accommodate claim. The Court again agrees with Lopez.
A substantial portion of the "Common Allegations to all Causes of Action" section of Lopez's complaint is dedicated to the sequence of events during which Lopez alleges that Charter failed to provide her with a sit-stand [*22]  desk despite being aware that she needed one. (See Compl. ¶¶ 22-34.) And the section of her complaint dedicated to her failure to accommodate claim incorporates the "Common Allegations" section. (Id. ¶ 63.) The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly permit such incorporation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c). Lopez's incorporation of the Complaint's prior allegations was sufficient to give Charter notice that her failure to accommodate claim would be based in part on the allegations regarding the sit-stand desk. Compare Fontana v. Haskin, 262 F.3d 871, 877 (9th Cir. 2001) (the fact that count one of the plaintiff's complaint did not include specific reference to alleged conduct was "irrelevant" because she had incorporated that conduct by reference) with Pickern v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc., 457 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir. 2006) (affirming grant of summary judgment when "the complaint gave the [defendants] no notice of the specific factual allegations presented for the first time in [plaintiff's] opposition to summary judgment"). Accordingly, the Court rejects Charter's argument that Lopez's failure to accommodate claim is limited to the allegations regarding the six-hour shift. The allegations regarding the standing desk were properly incorporated as well.

B. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
The FEHA imposes [*23]  an additional duty on the employer "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). An employer's failure to engage in this process is a separate FEHA violation. See Wilson, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 1193. Liability for failure to engage in the interactive process "hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Co., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n.22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006). In order to prevail on a FEHA claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must prove that a reasonable accommodation is possible. See Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 981-82, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008). Charter argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Lopez's failure to engage in the interactive process claim because Lopez was not a qualified individual and because it reasonably accommodated her by placing her on leave. As discussed above, Lopez has established that genuine issues of material fact remain as to both of these issues. Accordingly, Charter's motion for summary judgment on Lopez's failure to engage claim is DENIED.

C. Disability Discrimination
Charter next seeks summary judgment on Lopez's disability discrimination [*24]  claim. To establish a claim for disability discrimination under the FEHA, Lopez must show that: (1) she suffers from a disability; (2) she is otherwise qualified to do her job with a reasonable accommodation; and (3) she was subject to an adverse employment action because of the disability. Faust v. Cal. Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal. App. 4th 864, 886, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007). Charter's summary judgment motion makes two arguments as to this claim. The first is based on the same theory it advanced as to Lopez's failure to accommodate claim—that working full-time and overtime are essential functions of the CSR position and that Lopez's inability to perform those functions precludes her from being a qualified individual under FEHA. For the same reasons discussed above, genuine issues of fact remain as to whether these two functions are essential to the CSR position.
Charter's second argument—that Lopez's disability discrimination nonetheless fails because she was never subjected to an adverse employment action—is more persuasive. Lopez contends that Charter took an adverse employment action against her when it refused to allow her to return to work with a six-hour restriction. (See Opp'n at 25.) This alleged refusal to accommodate does not constitute an adverse employment [*25]  action for the purposes of Lopez's disability discrimination claim. The California Court of Appeal recently clarified the relationship between an employer's alleged failure to accommodate a disability and the "adverse employment action" requirement of a disability discrimination claim. See Doe v. Dep't of Corrs. and Rehab., 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7973, 2019 WL 6907515 (Cal. Ct. App., Nov. 27, 2019). In Doe, the plaintiff alleged that his employer discriminated against him on the basis of his asthma and dyslexia and brought a disability discrimination claim against it under FEHA. 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7973 at [WL]*1. He further asserted that the adverse employment action taken against him was his employer's rejection of his accommodation requests. 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7973 at [WL]*1, 7. After finding that "[n]o court has ever held that a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's disability—which is a separate cause of action under FEHA []—can qualify as the adverse action underlying a discrimination [] claim," the court dismissed the claim, holding that a defendant's rejection of a proposed accommodation could not constitute an adverse employment action for the purposes of a discrimination claim. 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7973 at [WL]*7.
Lopez's disability discrimination claim fails for the same reason. The only adverse employment action she identifies is Charter's alleged failure to accommodate her [*26]  disability. (See Opp'n at 25 ["[B]eing placed on an unpaid leave of absence . . . [is] clearly an adverse employment action."].) For the reasons articulated in Doe, this decision not to accommodate Lopez's disability does not qualify as an adverse employment action for the purposes of her discrimination claim. Otherwise, "every time an employee was denied a requested accommodation, he would be able to 'double dip' by asserting both" failure to accommodate and discrimination claims. See Doe, 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7973, 2019 WL 6907515 at *7 (internal quotation omitted). Given the lack of an adverse employment action, Charter's motion for summary judgment on Lopez's disability discrimination claim is GRANTED.
Lopez's failure to prevent discrimination claim is derivative of her disability discrimination claim. See Trujillo v. North Co. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998) ("[T]here's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not preventing discrimination that didn't happen, for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred." ); see also Brent v. Boeing Co., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159276, 2019 WL 4450424, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2019) ("It is well-settled law that no action lies for failure to take necessary steps to prevent discrimination or harassment if no such conduct in fact occurs."). Accordingly, Charter's [*27]  motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED as well.

D. Retaliation and Wrongful Termination Claims
Charter next moves for summary judgment on Lopez's retaliation claim. To make out a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, Lopez must establish that (1) she undertook a protected activity, (2) her employer subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action. See McAlindin v. County of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1238 (9th Cir. 1999). "If a plaintiff succeeds in proving a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. Should defendant carry this burden of production, the burden of proof shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that defendant's asserted reason is pretextual." Day v. Sears Holding Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1160 (C.D. Cal. 2013).
Lopez has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on her retaliation claim. Lopez's Complaint asserts that Charter retaliated against her for filing a worker's compensation claim after her initial injury. "Neither the Ninth Circuit nor the California Supreme Court have specifically addressed whether filing such a claim constitutes protected activity under FEHA." Ayala v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 2018 WL 6307891, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2018). The Court need not address this [*28]  unsettled question however, because Lopez has failed to introduce any evidence that there was any causal link between her filing of the worker's compensation claim and the alleged adverse action.
"To show the requisite causal link, the plaintiff must present evidence sufficient to raise the inference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action." Washington v. Cal. City Corr. Ctr., 871 F. Supp. 2d 1010, 1028 (E.D. Cal. 2012). Lopez has not identified any evidence that would allow the Court to infer that her worker's compensation claim had anything to do with Charter's refusal to allow her to work a six-hour shift. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325 (summary judgment is proper upon a showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case). Meanwhile, Charter has established that it had a longstanding policy of employing CSRs on a full-time basis only and that it denied Lopez's request to work six-hour shifts pursuant to that policy rather than any animus towards her stemming from her worker's compensation claim. See McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1239 (affirming summary judgment on plaintiff's retaliation claim when the "undisputed evidence shows that all of the adverse actions occurred because the County followed universally-applied policies, and not because McAlindin [*29]  was targeted for unfavorable treatment on account of his protected activities"). Charter also notes that Lopez's worker's compensation claim was filed six months prior to the alleged adverse employment action taken against her. (Mot. at 30.) Lopez has failed to raise a disputed factual issue as to her retaliation claim. Accordingly, Charter's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED.
Lopez's wrongful termination claim similarly alleges that Charter terminated her in retaliation for filing a worker's compensation claim. Given the lack of evidence connecting Lopez's worker's compensation claim to any of the alleged adverse action taken against her, this claim also fails. See Ayala, 2018 WL 6307891, at *9 (granting summary judgment on wrongful termination claim when plaintiff "presented no evidence that the decision to terminate him was at all related to his filing of a workers' compensation claim"). Charter's motion for summary judgment on Lopez's wrongful termination claim is GRANTED.

E. Failure to Provide Wage Statements
Finally, Charter moves for summary judgment on Lopez's wage statement claim. Lopez's opposition to Charter's motion does not address this claim. However, her complaint alleges that at [*30]  some point, Charter failed to provide her with accurate wage statements, in violation of Cal. Lab. Code § 226(a)(1). (Compl. ¶ 88.) Lopez testified that Charter's online system was down for a about a month around December 2016, and as a result, she could not access her paystubs. (Lopez Dep. 71:6-24.)
California Labor Code § 226(e)(1) enables an employee to obtain statutory damages if they "suffer injury as a result of a knowing and intentional failure by an employer to comply with" the requirements of § 226. A "'knowing and intentional failure' does not included an isolated and unintentional payroll error due to a clerical or inadvertent mistake." Cal. Lab. Code § 226(e)(3). Here, the undisputed evidence in the record is that for about a month around December 2016, Charter's online system was down, and during this period, Lopez was unable to access her paystubs. (Lopez Dep. 71:6-24.) Lopez has failed to introduce any evidence indicating that Charter's alleged violation of § 226 was "knowing and intentional" as opposed to "isolated and unintentional." Cal. Lab. Code § 226(e)(3). Charter's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Charter's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to Lopez's claims for (1) disability discrimination, (2) failure to prevent [*31]  discrimination, (3) retaliation, (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and (5) failure to provide wage statements. It is DENIED as to Lopez's claims for (1) failure to accommodate, and (2) failure to engage in the interactive process.
