Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS [D.E. 221
This matter is before the Court pursuant to Defendant Medical Data Systems, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint. Plaintiff Jamkirea Williams filed her original Complaint on January 29, 2018 [D.E. 1]. In response, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 12]. Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint in response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 15]. The Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg granted leave to amend and denied the motion to dismiss as moot [D.E. 17]. Plaintiff then filed her First Amended Complaint [D.E. 16] and Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint [D.E. 22]. Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 24] and Defendant filed a Reply [D.E. 25]. For the reasons that follow, it is respectfully recommended [*2]  that the Court grant in part and deny in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

BACKGROUND
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff began working as a Debt Collector for Defendant, Medical Data Systems, Inc. ("Medical Systems" or Defendant), in January 2015 [D.E. 16 at ¶8]. Medical Systems is a privately owned collection agency providing debt collection services to healthcare systems, hospitals, and doctors' offices. [Id. at ¶¶9.] Plaintiff's job was to call individuals to collect on their medical debts. [Id. at ¶10].
On June 12, 2015, Plaintiff was involved in a car accident during her lunch break. [Id. at ¶11]. Plaintiff injured her back and needed immediate medical attention. [Id. at ¶12]. Instead of returning to work she went to the hospital. [Id.]. She called Medical Systems' office and spoke to Operations Manager Tammy Ortiz. [Id. at ¶¶13-14]. She told Ortiz she would not be returning to work after lunch because she had been in a car accident and needed to go to the hospital. [Id. at ¶14.] Ortiz said that any work missed would be deducted from Plaintiff's remaining vacation time or paid time off ("PTO"). [Id. at ¶15].
Plaintiff went to the Emergency Room at Indian River Medical [*3]  Center, where she received an MRI and pain medications. [Id. at ¶16]. Two days later, on June 14, 2015, Plaintiff returned to the Emergency Room (this time at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center) because her pain had worsened. [Id. at ¶18]. The doctor told her not to return to work until Wednesday, June 17, 2015. [Id. at ¶19]. She was provided stronger pain medications and a muscle relaxant, and was discharged from the hospital in the early morning hours of June 15th. [Id. at ¶20]. The medicines made her dizzy, nauseous, and affected her thinking. [Id. at ¶21]. Plaintiff called Ortiz and told her how she was feeling and that she could not come to work that day. [Id. at ¶22]. She told Ortiz that she had a doctor's note instructing her not to return to work until June 17, 2015. [Id.]. Ortiz responded that Medical Systems "did not accept doctors' notes" and Plaintiff did not have any PTO available. [Id. at ¶24]. Ortiz said any absence would be considered "unexcused," which would lead to Plaintiff's termination. [Id.]. Afraid of losing her job, Plaintiff had her fiance drive her to work although she was in pain and under the influence of prescribed medications. [Id. at ¶ 29].
The next day, [*4]  on June 16, 2015, Plaintiff called Ortiz prior to her shift and asked to be excused from work due to her medical condition. [Id. at ¶30.] Ortiz responded that "any absence would be unexcused" and would result in Plaintiff's immediate termination. [Id. at ¶31]. Ortiz also said Plaintiff would be "better off resigning due to [her] condition." [Id. at ¶¶31-32], Again, Plaintiff's fiancé drove her to work, where everyone could see that Plaintiff was unable to work due to her medical condition. [Id. at ¶¶33-34]. Ortiz finally called Plaintiff into the office and told Plaintiff she would be terminated if she was unable to work, but could be hired at a later date if she resigned. [Id. at ¶35.]. Plaintiff refused to resign. [Id. at ¶37]. Although Plaintiff had only been at work for 30 to 45 minutes at that point, Ortiz called Plaintiff's fiance to come pick her up because it was clear that Plaintiff was physically unable to work. [Id.]. That evening, Plaintiff called Ortiz again and requested short term leave or some other accommodation that would allow her to keep her job. [Id. at ¶38.] Ortiz said that if Plaintiff did not show up for work the next day, June 17, 2015, she would be terminated. [*5]  [Id. at ¶39].
On June 17, 2015, Plaintiff showed up for work as scheduled. [Id. at ¶40]. She informed Ortiz that she had a doctor's appointment on Friday, June 19th. [Id.]. Ortiz said Plaintiff could not miss any more work or she would be fired. [Id. at ¶41]. On the following day, June 18, 2015, Ortiz made Plaintiff come to work two hours, presumably to make up time she would miss on June 19th at the doctor's office. [Id. at ¶42-43]. While Plaintiff was working, another supervisor and a colleague asked Plaintiff how she was feeling. [Id. at ¶45]. Plaintiff responded that she was still suffering from her injuries and her medications made her dizzy and affected her ability to work. [Id. at ¶46]. After standing up to talk to them, Plaintiff passed out and hit her head as she fell. [Id. at ¶48]. Plaintiff was transported by ambulance to the hospital where she was seen for head injuries resulting from the fall. [Id. at ¶¶49-50].
On June 19, 2015, Plaintiff had a follow up doctor's appointment. [Id. at ¶51]. The doctor said she should not return to work until Thursday, June 24th, 2015. [Id.]. Plaintiff contacted Medical Systems to advise them, but received no response. [Id. at ¶53-54].
On June [*6]  22, 2015, Plaintiff had another follow up doctor's appointment. [Id. at ¶55]. This time the doctor said she could not return to work until July 8, 2015. [Id. at ¶55]. Plaintiff called Medical Systems and spoke with Ms. Shannon, who handles workers' compensation claims at Medical Systems' corporate office. [Id. at ¶56]. Plaintiff told Ms. Shannon that Ortiz was not accepting any of her doctors' notes or offering any accommodations, and was treating her differently than other white and non-disabled employees. [Id. at ¶57]. Ms. Shannon said she would notify Ortiz of Plaintiff's expected health-related absence through June 25, 2015 and Medical Systems would investigate the circumstances of Plaintiff's fall to determine whether it was a work-related incident. [Id. at ¶¶58].
On June 25, 2015, Medical Systems concluded that Plaintiff's June 18th fall was not work related and fired Plaintiff for "excessive unexcused absences." [Id. at ¶¶60-61]. Medical Systems recorded Plaintiff's absences from June 19, 2015 to June 25, 2015 as unexcused. [Id. at ¶59].
Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint sets forth ten counts. Counts I and II allege racial discrimination in violation of  [*7] Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et. seq. Counts III, IV, V and VI allege discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et. seq. Counts VII, VIII and IX allege racial discrimination, unlawful termination and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act (FCRA), §§ 760.01 et. seq. Count X alleges unlawful retaliation due to workers' compensation activity in violation of Fla. Stat. § 440.205.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a complaint on the basis that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. When considering such a motion, a court must accept the factual allegations pleaded in the complaint as true and must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A plaintiff is not required to detail all of the facts on which her claim is based; rather, Rule 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement that fairly notifies the defendant of what the claim is and the grounds on which it rests. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56; Randall v. Scott, 610 F.3d 701, 705 (11th Cir. 2010). A plaintiff must plead "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face" so as to "nudge [his or her] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.
"A claim has facial [*8]  plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). As the Supreme Court has explained, "[t]he plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility[.]" Id. at 679. In determining whether the plausibility standard has been met, a court must consider the pleading as a whole and must draw on judicial experience and common sense. Id. See Speaker v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 623 F.3d 1371, 1380 (11th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted); Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1252 n. 11 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (stating that, in a Rule 12(b)(6) context, "[w]e read the complaint as a whole").
Although detailed factual allegations are not required, a complaint's allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. Id. The Federal Rules demand "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me-accusation." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 662. "Mere labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do, and a plaintiff cannot rely on naked assertions [*9]  devoid of further factual enhancement." Franklin v. Curry, 738 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir. 2013). "[I]f allegations are indeed more conclusory than factual, then the court does not have to assume their truth." Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012).

ANALYSIS

I. Racial Discrimination Claims Under Title VII and the FCRA

A. Title VII Claims — Counts I and II
Count I alleges that Medical Systems violated Title VII by "treating [Plaintiff] less well than similarly situated white employees, including subjecting her to harsher disciplinary policies than white employees." [D.E. 16 at ¶¶ 69-75]. Count II alleges that Medical Systems terminated Plaintiff's employment for conduct that a similarly situated white employee would not have been terminated for in violation of Title VII. [D.E. 16 at ¶¶ 76-83].
Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of her race, gender, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). The plaintiff in a Title VII case carries the initial burden of establishing a claim of racial discrimination. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See also McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir. 2008); Hall v. Alabama Ass'n of Sch. Boards, 326 F.3d 1157, 1166 (11th Cir. 2003). To establish intentional discrimination based on circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff must show (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the job; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) a [*10]  similarly situated individual outside her protected class was treated more favorably. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-03; see also Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997) (describing the McDonnell Douglas analysis). This standard — known as a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas — must be met for a Title VII claimant to survive summary judgment and/or prevail at trial. A plaintiff need not allege facts sufficient to make out a prima facie case to survive a motion to dismiss, however, because McDonnell Douglas is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading requirement. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510-515, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). At the motion to dismiss phase, a complaint need only "provide enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest intentional unlawful discrimination." Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol, 516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Said differently, a plaintiff has only a "'minimal burden' of alleging facts 'suggesting an inference of discriminatory motivation[.]'" Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 85 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 311 (2d Cir. 2015)).
The Amended Complaint fails to meet even this minimal burden. The Amended Complaint alleges generally that white disabled employees were provided excused time off consistent with their doctors' orders, while Plaintiff was not. [D.E. 16 at ¶25]. It also alleges that one specific white employee — Tasha Maccray — was allowed to go on medical leave, while Plaintiff was not, [*11]  and that Plaintiff and Maccray had the same basic job duty (that is, to call individuals and collect on medical debts). [Id. at ¶26]. These allegations, by themselves, do not permit a reasonable inference that Plaintiff was denied medical leave or treated differently because of her race. There are no facts in the complaint suggesting race was the reason for any differential treatment. There are also no details showing how Plaintiff and Maccray were so similarly situated that any differences in treatment was plausibly based on race. While one may speculate that race was a motivating factor, the Amended Complaint as pled does not raise Plaintiff's right to relief based on race above a speculative level.
A review of comparable cases makes this point. In El-Saba v. University of South Alabama, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137286, 2015 WL 5849747 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 22, 2015) (Nelson, J.), a Lebanese born engineering professor alleged that the university discriminated against him on the basis of national origin. The complaint alleged specific instances of foreign born professors being treated differently than American born professors and also included statements made by the dean of the engineering department that he wanted to "change the demographics" of the department and hire "native born, natural English [*12]  speaking faculty." 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137286, [WL] at *13. The magistrate judge found the examples of differential treatment along with the Dean's remarks sufficient to show a "minimal inference of discriminatory motivation" in the plaintiff's termination. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137286, [WL] at *12-13. Similarly, in Scribner v. Collier County, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42425, 2012 WL 1058149 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 28, 2012), the complaint raised an inference of discrimination by outlining a series of adverse actions taken against a male plaintiff by his female supervisor that were not taken against a similarly situated female comparator, and describing how gender-based complaints from women were routinely and thoroughly investigated while plaintiff's claims of gender discrimination were ignored. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42425, [WL] at *3-4. In Vega v. Hempstead Union Free School District, 801 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2015), the complaint raised an inference of discrimination by alleging how the plaintiff, a Hispanic teacher, was assigned a higher number of non-English speaking students than non-Hispanic teachers and a banner bearing the words "University of Puerto Rico" was placed over his classroom door. In Castillo v. Allegro Resort Marketing, et. al., 603 Fed. Appx. 913 (11th Cir. 2015), a forty year-old woman plausibly alleged sex and age discrimination when her boss reacted negatively to her family related obligations, said he wanted a "young boy" in her position, required her to train a young man for her position when she returned from maternity leave, and ultimately [*13]  gave that young man her job. All of these cases alleged some set of facts that suggested enough of a discriminatory motive to nudge the plaintiffs' claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.
On the other hand, complaints that do not adequately allege sufficiently similar comparators or offer any other indicia of discriminatory intent fail to meet the plausibility standard. In Uppal v. Hospital Corporation of America, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71702, 2011 WL 2631869 (M.D. Fla. 2011), the Court dismissed the plaintiff's Title VII claims because she alleged that others outside of her protected class were treated differently than her without offering any details suggesting that race, gender or national origin played a role in those differences. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71702, [WL] at *3-4. In Mesumbe v. Howard University, 706 F. Supp.2d 86 (D.D.C. 2010), a student alleging racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 failed to state a claim because none of the supporting facts in his complaint suggested a racially discriminatory motive. Id. at 92. Similarly, in Brown v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119207, 2009 WL 5170170 (D. Md. Dec. 18, 2009), the Court dismissed the plaintiff's claims that white employees were treated more favorably when seeking sick leave because he failed to state specific facts about "how non-African Americans were, or would have been, treated differently under similar circumstances." 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119207, [WL] at *2. Likewise, in Pettway v. Mobile Cty. Revenue Comm'r, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9730, 2018 WL 736599 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 19, 2018), the Court dismissed plaintiff's claim of gender discrimination because [*14]  she failed to allege facts showing that only men were treated better than her. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9730, [WL] at *6. The complaints in these cases were dismissed because they failed to allege facts raising the plaintiffs' right to relief above a speculative level.
Here, Plaintiff invokes her own race as well as the race of another debt collector, but does not provide sufficient details of how their circumstances were so similar that differences in their treatment were plausibly motivated by race. A "plaintiff cannot merely invoke...race in the course of a claim's narrative and automatically be entitled to pursue relief." Mesumbe, 706 F. Supp.2d at 92. See Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cty., Fla., 447 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir. 2006). See also Decosta v. ARG Res., LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192060, 2012 WL 12865835, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2012) (dismissing a claim where the plaintiff's complaint only referred to other "non-Black and non-Jamaican similar employees[]" being treated differently); Ashmore v. F.A.A., No. 11-CV-60272, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103623, 2011 WL 3915752, at **1, 4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 2, 2011) (finding that simply alleging that no employees of another race were terminated for the same conduct was insufficient to establish a race discrimination claim). "Without some allegation indicating the intent behind these disparate outcomes, Plaintiff cannot state a claim for intentional discrimination." Mesumbe, 706 F. Supp.2d at 92. "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, [*15]  do not suffice" to defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
That is not to say that a complaint alleging racial discrimination can withstand 12(b)(6) scrutiny only if there are comments or statement suggestive of racial discrimination, or if it alleges with minute detail every single way in which comparators are similarly situated to the plaintiff. The Court recognizes a plaintiff's burden is minimal at this stage of the case. But merely naming a purported comparator and saying they had the same basic job responsibility is not, by itself, enough to state a Title VII discrimination claim. There are too many other legitimate non-discriminatory business reasons for treating employees differently for this to be sufficient. Moreover, alleging that a particular person is "similarly situated" is a legal conclusion. A plaintiff must allege sufficient plausible facts permitting a reasonable inference that the purported comparator is indeed similarly situated. Here, the Amended Complaint says only that Plaintiff and Maccray are both responsible for calling individuals to collect on medical debts. It fails to identify any other details, such as the nature or duration of Maccray's disability, how Maccray's injuries [*16]  were documented (through doctors' notes or otherwise), whether Maccray worked at Medical Systems longer than Plaintiff, or whether Maccray had vacation or PTO leave available while Plaintiff had none. A complainant at this stage need not necessarily articulate all of these details, but must allege at least some "specific, discrete facts of the who, what, when and where variety" that raise a plausible inference of entitlement to relief. Watts v. Ford Motor Co., 519 Fed. Appx. 584, 587 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Feliciano v. City of Miami Beach, 707 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir. 2013)). Plaintiff has not done so, and Counts I and II should be dismissed.

B. FCRA Racial Discrimination Claims — Counts VII and VIII
For the same reasons, the Amended Complaint fails to state claims for racial discrimination under the FCRA. Count VII alleges that Plaintiff was more harshly disciplined than white employees in violation of the FCRA. Count VIII alleges that Plaintiff's employment was unlawfully terminated based on race in violation of the FCRA. Federal law interpreting Title VII controls when analyzing FCRA claims because both follow the same statutory framework. Ponce v. City of Naples, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169635, 2017 WL 4574649, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 13, 2017). Florida courts have held that decisions construing Title VII apply to FCRA claims because the Florida act was patterned after Title VII. See Kelly v. K.D. Const, of Fla., Inc., 866 F. Supp. 1406, 1411 (S.D. Fla. 1994); Fla. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Bryant, 586 So. 2d 1205, 1209 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991); Ranger Ins. Co. v. Bal Harbour Club, Inc., 549 So.2d 1005, 1009 (Fla.1989). Like her Title VII claims, [*17]  Plaintiff was required to plead "specific, discrete facts" to state a claim under FCRA. Watts, 519 Fed. Appx. at 587. She has not done so, and Counts VII and VIII should be dismissed.1

II. Disability Claims Under the ADA and FCRA

A. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA — Count III
Count III alleges that Medical Systems failed to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. The ADA forbids an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of his or her disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination includes failure to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability" unless the employer "can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of [its] business." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To prove a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual, meaning able to perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Russell v. City of Tampa, 652 Fed. Appx. 765, 767 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (citing Lucas v. W. W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)).
At the outset, this Court notes that the majority [*18]  of the cases cited by Defendant to support its ADA arguments were decided on motions for summary judgment under Rule 56 and not on motions to dismiss.2 These cases have little instructive value at this juncture because they were decided based on fully developed factual records not present here. Defendant relies on these cases to show Plaintiff was not disabled, was not a "qualified individual," and did not request a reasonable accommodation, so the interactive process contemplated by the ADA was never triggered. This Court will review Plaintiff's ADA claims under the plausibility standard set forth in Twombly and Iqbal, however, and not under the more rigorous standard applicable to a motion for summary judgment.
Under the appropriate standard, the Amended Complaint pleads enough facts to raise a plausible inference that Plaintiff was disabled. The ADA provides that a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of an individual's "major life activities," a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). In 2008, Congress passed the ADA Amendments Act ("ADAAA") which, inter alia, rejected restrictive [*19]  standards established by courts for determining whether a person is disabled. Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (rejecting specifically the standards announced in Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999) and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002)). "[T]hese amendments convey that an extensive analysis is not required to determine whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA." EEOC v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). The Amended Complaint alleges that severe back pain from a car accident substantially limited Plaintiff's ability to sit, stand, bend, focus and think. [D.E. 16 at ¶¶17, 22]. These all qualify as major life activities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (major life activities include "walking," "standing," "bending," "lifting," "concentrating," and "thinking"); Para*da v. Banco Indus. de Venez., 753 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2014) (an employee's inability to sit for a prolonged time may constitute a disability under the ADA). To support this, Plaintiff alleges that she went to the Emergency Room immediately after a car accident and was in such pain that she had to return to the Emergency Room two days later, where she was held overnight. [D.E. 16 at ¶18]. Two different doctors prescribed her strong pain medications and recommended that she take a short term leave of absence. [Id. at ¶¶l6, 20]. She could not drive herself to work and had to be driven to work by her fiance. [Id. [*20]  at ¶¶29, 36-37]. When she arrived at work others could see she was having difficulties. So much so that Plaintiff's boss, after calling Plaintiff into the office, telephoned the fiance to come back and pick Plaintiff up because Plaintiff was unable to work. [Id. at ¶¶37, 44, 45]. The next day Plaintiff stood up to respond to co-workers and passed out. [Id. at ¶48]. She was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and doctors ultimately concluded that she should not return to work until almost a month later. [Id. at ¶50]. Taken as true, these facts support Plaintiff's allegation that she was substantially impaired in performing major life activities.
Defendant's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Defendant complains that Plaintiff's doctors' notes did not contain a diagnosis of any disability [D.E. 22 at 10 n. 2], but "the AD AAA does not require a plaintiff to have a formal 'diagnosis' in order to be 'disabled.'" Hutchinson v. Ecolab, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110641, 2011 WL 4542957, *9 n. 10 (D. Conn. Sept. 28, 2011). Next, Defendant suggests that the short term nature of Plaintiff's impairment precludes her from being considered disabled, but duration is only one factor in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. ("Impairments that last only for a short period of time are typically not covered, although they may be covered if sufficiently severe.") (emphasis added). Moreover, Plaintiff's request for short term leave does not necessarily mean her impairment and/or limitations [*21]  were short term. Indeed, Plaintiff says she still has not recovered from her injuries and likely never will. [D.E. 16 at ¶63]. It cannot be conclusively determined at this stage of the case whether Plaintiff's impairments were so limiting as to constitute an actual disability under the ADA. That is an inquiry best left for discovery, summary judgment or trial. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must merely provide enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal the evidence needed to support the claim); cf. Cohen v. CHLN, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75404, 2011 WL 2713737, at *8 (E.D. Pa. July 13, 2011) (concluding that unlike the common cold or flu, back and leg pain that began four months prior to termination and could extend indefinitely into the future might constitute a disability under the ADA).
Plaintiff alleges facts showing she was a "qualified individual." An individual is qualified if she can perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Holly v. Clairson Industries, LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff worked for Medical Systems for six months before she was injured and "never received any complaints, write ups or discipline concerning her performance or job duties." [D.E. 16. at ¶68]. Thus, she adequately alleges facts showing she was [*22]  qualified for and could perform the essential functions of the job with the accommodation of a short term medical leave of absence.
Plaintiff also alleges facts showing she requested a reasonable accommodation. The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that a short term leave of absence may constitute a reasonable accommodation. See Moore v. Accenture, LLP, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 26275, 2007 WL 3313152, at *3-4 (11th Cir. Nov. 9, 2007); Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 982, 124 S. Ct. 467, 157 L. Ed. 2d 373 (2003); see also Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that a "reasonable accommodation is by its terms most logically construed as that which, presently, or in the immediate future enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job in question") (emphasis added). See also See 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. 1630.2(o) ("[P]ermitting the use of accrued paid leave, or unpaid leave, is a form of reasonable accommodation when necessitated by an employee's disability."). According to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff requested a short term leave of absence on multiple occasions. She requested a few days of leave after the car accident to regain control of her symptoms, and requested twenty six days of leave after passing out and hitting her head on June 18th. [D.E. 16. at ¶¶22, 55]. All of her requests for leave were denied. The reasonableness of her request for short term leave is a question of fact, [*23]  which is not appropriately dismissed at this stage. See Pandazides v. Va. Bd. of Educ. 13 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir. 1994); Hutchinson v. Ecolab, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110641, 2011 WL 4542957 at *9 (D. Conn. Sept. 28, 2011) (citations omitted).
Plaintiff also alleges facts showing she requested at least one recognized form of accommodation,3 and her employer denied it and failed to engage in an interactive process with her to identify reasonable accommodations. After a disabled individual informs the employer that an accommodation is needed, "the employer must make a reasonable effort to determine the appropriate accommodation." 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.9. See also Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), cert, denied, 137 S. Ct. 592, 196 L. Ed. 2d 474 (2016) (internal citations omitted) (opining that the ADA regulations "state that an employer may in some circumstances need to 'initiate an informal, interactive process' with a disabled employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation.'") See also Everett v. Grady Mem'l Hosp. Corp., 703 F. App'x 938, 946 (11th Cir. 2017) (requiring employer to engage in an informal interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation). Medical Systems failed to do so, and the Motion to Dismiss Count III should be denied.

B. Unlawful Termination Under the ADA — Count IV
Count IV alleges that Medical Systems unlawfully terminated Plaintiff because she was disabled. To prevail on a claim of unlawful termination based on disability, Plaintiff must establish (1) she [*24]  had a disability, (2) she was qualified to perform her job, and (3) her employment was terminated because of her disability. Collado v. United Parcel Serv. Co., 419 F.3d 1143, 1152 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).
Defendant argues that Court IV must fail because pleading in the alternative is not permitted under the ADA. Defendant meshes together a number of cases to reach this conclusion, but mainly relies on the Supreme Court's holding in Gross v. FBL.557 U.S. 167, 177-78, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009), and then uses cases from other circuits to extend that holding to the ADA context. In Gross, the Supreme Court determined that plaintiffs alleging age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") are not entitled to a "mixed motives" jury instruction at trial because liability under the ADEA turns on whether "age was the but for cause of the challenged adverse employment action." Id. In other words, a plaintiff cannot establish age discrimination at trial with proof that age was merely a motivating but not determinative factor. According to Defendant, this holding means the Plaintiff in this case cannot simultaneously plead that her termination resulted from disability discrimination and also from race discrimination. Plaintiff counters that she can plead alternative causes of discrimination.
The undersigned [*25]  disagrees with Plaintiff's logic for several reasons. First, Gross involved age and not disability discrimination, and Defendant does not cite Eleventh Circuit case law to show that its holding has been extended to ADA cases. See [D.E. 22 at 16-17] (relying on case law from the Sixth and Seventh Circuits). Further, while Gross ultimately may limit a plaintiff's case at trial, it does not address the sufficiency of a complaint's allegations at the motion to dismiss phase at all. "'Evidence of additional motives, and the question of whether the presence of mixed motives defeats all or some parts of a plaintiff's claim are trial issues,' not issues that can be addressed at the outset of a case based solely on allegations." Collins v. Fulton County School District, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187392, 2012 WL 7802745 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 26, 2012) (quoting King v. Hardesty, 517 F.3d 1049, 1058 (8th Cir. 2008)). Indeed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(d) expressly permits litigants to plead inconsistent claims and defenses. FRCP 8(d)(2)-(3); see also Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1283 ("Under [Federal Rule 8(d)] a party may include inconsistent allegations in a pleading's statement of facts.") (citations omitted). While not discussing the issue extensively, the Eleventh Circuit in a brief, unpublished per curiam opinion appeared to agree that Gross does not bar an ADEA plaintiff from [*26]  pleading alternative causes of action. Savage v. Secure First Credit Union, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 9530, 2016 WL 2997171, at *1 (11th Cir. May 25, 2016) (reversing district court's decision that plaintiff alleging disability, age and racial discrimination had to choose among her causes of action). Courts addressing this issue have generally held that "Gross does not in any way limit a plaintiff's ability to plead alternative facts and alternative theories." Pearson v. Lawrence Medical Center, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152595, 2012 WL 5265774, *4-5 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 24, 2012); see also Collins v. Fulton County School District, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187392, 2012 WL 7802745 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 26, 2012); Woldetadik v. 7-Eleven, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 738, 741-43 (N.D. Tex. 2012); Porter v. American Cast Iron Pipe Company, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153127, 2010 WL 11507904, *15 (N.D. Ala. May 28, 2010). But see Culver v. Birmingham Bd. Of Educ, 646 F. Supp.2d 1270, 1271-72 (N.D. Ala. 2009). The undersigned agrees with the weight of the case law and rejects Defendant's argument in this regard.
Reviewing the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint and construing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has adequately pled that was fired because of her disability. A plaintiff satisfies the causality element at this stage of the case if there is close temporal proximity between the employer becoming aware of the disability and an adverse employment action. Farley v. Nationwide Mut Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (11th Cir. 1999). See also Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir. 1999); Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993). According to the Amended Complaint, less than two weeks passed between Plaintiff's disabling accident and Defendant's decision to fire her. [Id. at ¶¶11, 12, 61]. Moreover, when Plaintiff talked to Ortiz about her condition and asked for an accommodation, Ortiz twice responded that Plaintiff would be "better [*27]  off resigning due to [her] condition" and could be hired at a later date. [Id. at ¶¶ 30, 35]. The temporal proximity between the onset of Plaintiff's disabling condition and her termination, as well as her manager's insistence that she should just quit due to her condition and be re-hired once her condition improved, makes Plaintiff's causation claim plausible. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count IV should be denied.

C. Interference and Retaliation Under the ADA — Counts V and VI
Counts V and VI allege unlawful interference with and retaliation for Plaintiff's exercise of her rights under the ADA. To show retaliation or interference in violation of the ADA, a Plaintiff must show she engaged in an activity protected by the ADA (such as requesting an accommodation), she suffered an adverse employment decision, and the adverse decision was causally related to the exercise of her ADA rights. Lucas v. W. W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1260 (11th Cir. 2001); Farley, 197 F.3d at 1337; Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a causal relationship between the exercise of her statutory rights under the ADA and her termination. This Court disagrees. Requests for accommodation are protected activity. Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., 252 F.3d 696, 706 (4th Cir. 2001). The close temporal proximity between Plaintiff's [*28]  requests for accommodation in the form of short term leave and her termination is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Accordingly, Plaintiff's interference and retaliation claims are facially plausible, and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts V and VI should be denied.

D. FCRA Disability Claims—Counts VIII and IX
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's FCRA disability claims (Counts VIII and IX) should also be denied. The FCRA is modeled after the federal statutory scheme and "is construed in conformity with" the ADA. Byrd v. BT Foods, Inc., 948 So. 2d 921, 925 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007). Because the FCRA's anti-retaliation clause is nearly identical to the ADA's provision, Florida courts follow federal case law. Beatty v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162267, 2015 WL 7777520, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 3, 2015). Therefore, for the same reasons that Plaintiff's ADA claims survive, her claims pursuant to the FCRA should not be dismissed.

III. Workers' Compensation Claims under Fla. Stat. § 440.205
In Count X, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant terminated her in retaliation for filing a worker's compensation claim, in violation of Fla. Stat. § 440.205. This provision of the Florida Statutes provides that "No employer shall discharge, threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any employee by reason of such employee's valid claim for compensation or attempt to claim compensation under [*29]  the Worker's Compensation Law." Fla. Stat. § 440.205. As relevant here, Plaintiff must allege facts plausibly showing: (1) she made a workers' compensation claim; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; and (3) the adverse action was causally related to her worker's compensation claim. Ortega v. Engineering Systems Technology, Inc., 30 So. 3d 525 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010).
As with the ADA counts, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff cannot claim she was terminated both because of her disability and because she filed a workers' compensation claim. As discussed above, this Court rejects that argument. Plaintiff is not precluded from alleging alternative theories of relief. According to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's firing came on the heels of her workers' compensation inquiry. [D.E. 16 at ¶¶55-61] (Plaintiff called Defendant's workers' compensation representative on June 22nd and was fired three days later after being informed that her workers' compensation claim had been denied). This is enough to infer a causal connection between her protected workers' compensation activity and the adverse employment action taken against her. See, e.g., Humphrey v. Sears, Roebuck, and Co., 192 F. Supp.2d 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (initial burden to establish causation satisfied where plaintiff showed a close temporal proximity between Defendant's awareness of her workers' compensation [*30]  claim and termination of her employment). This Court therefore recommends that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count X be denied.

CONCLUSION
ACCORDINGLY, the undersigned recommends to the District Court that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [D.E. 22] be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The Motion should be granted with respect to Counts I, II and VII of the Amended Complaint. The undersigned recommends that Counts I, II and VII of the Amended Complaint be dismissed without prejudice.4 The Motion to Dismiss should be denied with respect to Counts III, IV, V, VI, IX and X of the Amended Complaint. Count VIII alleges unlawful termination based on race and disability in violation of the FCRA. Count VIII should be dismissed without prejudice insofar as it alleges racial discrimination.
In light of the upcoming discovery deadline, this Court shortens the time for objecting to this Report and Recommendation. The parties shall have seven (7) days from the date of this Report and Recommendation within which to file objections, if any, with the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg, the United States District Judge assigned to this case.
DONE AND SUBMITTED in Chambers at Fort Pierce, Florida, [*31]  this 24th day of September, 2018.
