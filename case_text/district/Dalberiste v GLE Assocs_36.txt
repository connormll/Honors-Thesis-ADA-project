Opinion



ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff, Mitche A. Dalberiste, brought this lawsuit against Defendant, GLE Associates, Inc. (GLE), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and the Florida Civil Rights Act (FCRA), Fla. Stat. § 760.10 et seq., for failure to accommodate religious practices, religious discrimination, and retaliation. Plaintiff alleges that GLE failed to accommodate his request to not work during his Sabbath and that GLE rescinded an offer of employment in retaliation for his request for religious accommodation. GLE filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 29] on grounds that it could not have accommodated Plaintiff's request without incurring undue hardship and it did not discriminate or retaliate against Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition [*2]  to the Motion [DE 40] and GLE filed a Reply [DE 52]. This matter is ripe for adjudication.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff is a life-long, practicing Seventh Day Adventist. (Pl. Dep. [DE 44-1] at 31:22-32:13, 161:15-23.) As a Seventh Day Adventist, Plaintiff's religious beliefs prohibit him from working during his Sabbath, which occurs from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday each week. (Pl. Dep. 43:8-15, 44:18-45:21, 161:21-23.) In April 2016, Plaintiff applied for an Industrial Hygiene Technician position at GLE's Fort Lauderdale office. (Pl. Dep. 48:5-49:18; 91:2-92:8.) GLE is an architectural, engineering, and environmental services firm headquartered in Tampa, Florida. (Greene Decl. [DE 31] ¶ 3.) GLE is solely owned by Robert Greene, who founded the business in 1989 and has overseen all areas of its operation in the thirty years since then. (Greene Decl. ¶¶ 3, 11, 46.) GLE currently has roughly eighty employees across all locations and had sixty back in 2016. (Greene Decl. ¶¶ 14-15; Ward Dep. [DE 45-1] 99:3-7.)
One of GLE's primary services is worksite safety monitoring, which includes asbestos monitoring performed by its industrial hygienists. (Greene Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 8; Padgett Dep. [*3]  [DE 33-1] 24:20-27:11.) One of GLE's clients in this area served by its Fort Lauderdale office is Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station ("the Nuclear Station" or "the plant"). (Greene Decl. ¶ 22; Simmons Dep. [DE 34-1] at 65:20-68:8.) The plant is a twin reactor nuclear power station owned by Florida Power & Light (FP&L) and located in Homestead, Florida. FP&L handles the operations of the plant itself but has a contractor ("the Contractor") that handles all other necessary work at the facility. (Padgett Dep. 31:24-33:25.) GLE maintains contracts with both FP&L and the Contractor. (Simmons Dep. 38:23-40:5.) Each year, the Nuclear Station has planned outages in the fall, and every other year it has an additional outage in the spring. (Simmons Dep. 28:8-25; Padgett Dep. 36:17-20.) These outages, which shut down parts of the facility for maintenance, last anywhere from thirty to eighty days. (Simmons Dep. 28:22-29:1, 70:21-71:2, 162:3-10; Padgett Dep. 34:18-21, 35:2-12.)
FP&L and the Contractor set terms to govern the work GLE performs at the Nuclear Station. For example, they tell GLE how many workers are needed during an outage. (Padgett Dep. 36:17-25, 37:15-38:8, 43:2-11.) Once selected, the GLE employees must [*4]  receive badges from the plant before they can begin working. (Padgett Dep. 38:16-39:3, 49:9-10; Simmons Dep. 31:20-33:21, 62:12-21.) The badging process takes about two to three weeks and involves an extensive background check, urinalysis, and a psychological exam. (Padgett Dep. 38:16-39:3, 49:9-10; Simmons Dep. 31:20-33:21, 62:12-21.) Ahead of the outage, GLE employees must also attend training classes at the plant, which last about a week. (Padgett Dep. 38:16-39:3, 49:9-10; Simmons Dep. 31:20-33:21, 62:12-21.) The employees must have previously had asbestos and air monitoring training pertaining to Phase Contrast Microscopy Samples (PCM) and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certification. (Simmons Dep. 71:17-20; Padgett Dep. 66:19-73:10; Ward Dep. 29:15-32:13.) NIOSH and PCM training are usually out of state and collectively take about two weeks to complete.1 (Simmons Dep. 71:17-20; Padgett Dep. 66:19-73:10; Ward Dep. 29:15-32:13.)
Generally, the work done by industrial hygienists in GLE's Fort Lauderdale office is described as "very physical and dirty," "mostly field work," "mostly after hours," and requiring flexibility. (Padgett Dep. 26:16-27:1, 44:4-12, [*5]  57:3-4, 78:6-25, 111:4-11, 112:2-23, 114:1-23; Simmons Dep. 70:3-20, 79:6-80:12, 173:1-22.) Indeed, much of GLE's work requires its employees to be on job sites during evenings and weekends when they will create the least interference with the clients' businesses. (Greene Decl. ¶ 10; Simmons Dep. 78:24-82:7, 85:9-86:6.) It is project-based work; that is, technicians are assigned to a project and are expected to see their project through to the end. (Simmons Dep. 81:4-19; 82:8-16; Padgett Dep. 111:12-112:22.) While the outage work at the Nuclear Station is an entry-level job, it is just as demanding. GLE employees assigned to the Nuclear Station during an outage work seven days per week in twelve-hour shifts, anywhere from thirty to eighty days. (Greene Decl. ¶¶ 25-26; Padgett Dep. 35:5-8, 37:2-5, 57:14-21.) FP&L and the Contractor require this exacting schedule because they need to get the plant back up as quickly as possible. (Padgett Dep. 37:1-5; Simmons Dep. 70:3-20.)
In early 2016, employees in the Fort Lauderdale office were overworked and as a result the Director of GLE's South Florida Operations, John Simmons, sought to hire two new employees to staff the fall outage at the Nuclear [*6]  Station. (Simmons Dep. 20:19-22:8, 41:14-20, 60:12-61:4, 93:24-94:6; Ward Dep. 110:6-10.) Typically, GLE would send an experienced employee and a new employee to work an outage. (Simmons Dep. 40:8-41:10; Padgett Dep. 39:21-40:9, 59:1-9.) Experienced employees work the day shift and liaise with FP&L and the Contractor on planning and logistical issues, and new employees work the night shift. (Padgett Dep. 39:21-40:9.) In 2016, because of the workload at the Fort Lauderdale office, Simmons decided it would be more efficient to send the two new employees to the plant and keep his experienced staff on other projects, which required higher proficiency. (Simmons Dep. 20:19-22:8, 57:2-21, 93:24-94:16.) To get the two new employees acclimated, GLE planned to send a third, experienced employee to the plant for about two to three days at its own expense to get them started. (Simmons Dep. 41:14-42:5, 46:14-22, 52:22-53:9.)
Plaintiff testified that GLE did not inform him during the application or interview process that he was being hired to work, at least initially, at the plant. (Pl. Dep. 114:18-115:6, 32:23-133:5, 166:1-5, 168:5-18.2 ) On the other hand, Simmons, Amber Ward (GLE's current head [*7]  of Human Resources), and Rafe Padgett (a Senior Project Manager at GLE) testified that they discussed Turkey Point with Plaintiff in detail and explained the exacting schedule that would be required of him, including the need to work on nights and weekends. (See, e.g., Padgett Dep. 77:19-20, 84:10-85:4; Ward Dep. 80:6-17, 108:20-110:10; Simmons Dep. 109:7-114:10.) In short, there is a dispute between the parties regarding what aspects of the job requirements and GLE's business — particularly concerning the Nuclear Station — were discussed prior to Plaintiff's acceptance of the job offer. Nonetheless, the following material facts regarding the hiring process are not disputed. GLE first interviewed Plaintiff by phone in early April 2016. (Pl. Dep. 53:8-54:8, 77:14-25; Ward Dep. 57:6-19, 62:5-8.) During the phone interview, Plaintiff told GLE that he had no problems traveling or working nights and weekends, as those issues were discussed by him and Ward. (Pl. Dep. at 67:20-68:6, 150:15-21.) Plaintiff also recalls reading on the employment application form that GLE could require him to work unscheduled hours such as on weekends and recalls that the job advertisement "said sometimes night [*8]  and weekend" work could be required. (Pl. Dep. 98:1-12, 148:15-149:24, 151:19-23.)
Shortly after the phone interview, Plaintiff had an in-person interview at GLE's Fort Lauderdale office with Simmons, Padgett, and possibly a third individual.3 (Pl. Dep. 53:8-19, 77:14-25.) During the in-person interview, GLE referenced its contract at the Nuclear Station, explaining that it staffed the facility with two employees who together work twenty-four-hour shifts; one person worked twelve hours in the morning and one worked twelve hours at night. (Pl. Dep. 80:12-19, 81:1-8, 86:20-24, 113:9-24, 164:16-165:14.) The interviewers also discussed the distance to travel to the plant. (Pl. Dep. 80:24-81:8, 105:15-106:3, 14:2-17, 168:7-18.)
GLE did not offer Plaintiff the position and issued a turndown letter around April 28, 2016. (Pl. Dep. 89:13-90:28; Ward Dep. 61:18-24, 63:8-15.) Plaintiff reapplied for the same position in June 2016, by personally dropping off his resume at the Fort Lauderdale office and speaking to Simmons. (Pl. Dep. 90:14-16, 101:17-103:10.) GLE extended a job offer to Plaintiff on June 21, 2016. (Pl. Dep. 103:11-104:17.) The offer letter highlighted the requirement that Plaintiff [*9]  pass a background and drug test by GLE as well as potentially by GLE's clients, such as "nuclear power plants." (Pl. Dep. 80:24-81:8, 105:15-106:3, 14:2-17, 168:7-18.) Plaintiff also remembers reading in the offer letter that "[o]ut of town travel, weekend and night work may be required for th[e] position." (Pl. Dep. 106:6-11.) Plaintiff accepted the job offer on June 21, 2016. (Pl. Dep. 103:11-104:17.)
After he was hired and a few days before his start date in July, Plaintiff informed GLE for the first time that he was unable to work from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday because of his Sabbath. (Pl. Dep. 76:10-77:5, 115:7-16; Simmons Dep. 127:9-128:4.) Plaintiff did not disclose his schedule restrictions prior to being hired because he concluded that "[i]t wasn't information that needed to be discussed" since it was a matter of religion, and GLE was legally required to make an accommodation once it hired him. (Pl. Dep. 71:24-72:1, 76:10-77:5, 135:8-13.) Without offering any accommodation, on July 5, 2016, GLE rescinded the job offer because of Plaintiff's inability to work from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. (Pl. Dep. 112:14-23, 140:15-16.) GLE was unable to hire [*10]  someone to replace Plaintiff in time for the October outage and, at additional costs to the company, ended up bringing one of its workers from Tampa to work at the Nuclear Station. (Simmons Dep. 46:1-6, 54:1-55:1, 56:14-25, 58:18-23; Greene Decl. ¶ 17.4 )
On July 20, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). (Pl. Dep. 138:3-22.) The EEOC issued a Notice of Rights to Sue on June 26, 2018. (Compl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff filed the Complaint on September 21, 2018. In his Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a religious discrimination claim under theories of disparate treatment and failure to accommodate. Plaintiff also alleges that GLE's failure to accommodate his religious beliefs and rescission of the job offer constitute unlawful retaliation. (Id. ¶¶ 32-36, 48-53.) GLE denies these allegations and maintains that it rescinded the job offer only because of Plaintiff's inability to work from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, which rendered him unable to perform the job required at the Nuclear Station. (Mot. at 1-3, 9.) GLE states that it could not have accommodated Plaintiff's religious beliefs without incurring undue hardship. Id. [*11] 

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, "summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "[G]enuine disputes of facts are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant." Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal marks and citation omitted). A fact is material if, under the applicable substantive law, it might affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202(1986).
A party seeking summary judgment bears the initial responsibility of supporting its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. "[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. The Court "must view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and must resolve all reasonable doubts about [*12]  the facts in favor of the non-movant." Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008) (internal marks and citation omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
Decisions construing Title VII guide the analysis of claims under the FCRA, which was patterned after Title VII. Harper v. Blockbuster Entm't Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998). Therefore, the Court's analysis of Plaintiff's Title VII claims is equally applicable to Plaintiff's FCRA claims.5 All three of Plaintiff's claims are based on GLE's failure to accommodate his observance of the Sabbath. As a result, the Court need not analyze the claims separately. See Patterson v. Walgreen Co., 727 F. App'x 581, 589 (11th Cir. 2018). As a final preliminary matter, the Court notes that the evidence reflects that GLE extended an offer of employment, Plaintiff accepted the offer, and then GLE communicated to Plaintiff that it could no longer hire him. While these facts suggest termination, the parties — who have more intimate knowledge of all the facts — have framed this case as failure-to-hire case. Hence, the Court will treat this action as such. The Court now turns to the merits.

A. Title VII Standard
"Title VII . . . prohibits a prospective employer from refusing to hire an applicant in order to avoid accommodating a religious practice that it could accommodate without undue hardship." E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 135 S. Ct. 2028, 2031, 192 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015). As defined in the statute, "[t]he term [*13]  'religion' includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j).
On summary judgment, the Court applies the burden-shifting principles provided in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). In the first step, Plaintiff must submit evidence that (1) he had a bona fide religious belief that conflicted with an employment requirement, (2) he informed the employer of his belief, and (3) he was not hired for failing to comply with the employment requirement. Walden v. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, 669 F.3d 1277, 1293 (11th Cir. 2012). "If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business." Id. (citation and internal marks omitted).
Here, Plaintiff has established a prima facie case. Plaintiff's bona fide religious beliefs as a Seventh Day Adventist prohibit him from working from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday and GLE rescinded [*14]  the job offer because of Plaintiff's inability to work those hours. The burden now shifts to GLE to demonstrate that it was unable to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's beliefs without incurring undue hardship.

B. Accommodation and Undue Hardship
"[A] reasonable accommodation is one that eliminates the conflict between employment requirements and religious practices." Walden, 669 F.3d at 1293 (citation and internal marks omitted). An employer, however, is not required to accommodate at all costs. Morrissette-Brown v. Mobile Infirmary Med. Ctr., 506 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir. 2007). "Undue hardship" is defined "as any act that would require an employer to bear greater than a 'de minimis cost' in accommodating an employee's religious beliefs." Beadle v. Hillsborough Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, 29 F.3d 589, 592 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 75, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 2272, 53 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1977)). "'[D]e minimis cost' entails not only monetary concerns, but also the employer's burden in conducting its business." Patterson, 727 F. App'x at 586 (citing Hardison, 432 U.S. at 84 n.15).
GLE did not offer any accommodation and takes the position that there was no accommodation option that would have avoided undue hardship to its business. Plaintiff disagrees. Plaintiff points to a prior outage, for instance, where GLE had only one person working at the Nuclear Station on double-shifts to suggest that the same arrangement could have been made in his case. Plaintiff further argues that a manager from the [*15]  Fort Lauderdale office or an employee from another office could have been assigned to cover the times he was unavailable. Plaintiff also highlights the fact that GLE had originally intended to send a third employee to the plant and argues that GLE could have simply assigned this third employee to his Sabbath shift for the duration of the project. The Court concludes that based on the evidence these proposals would have caused undue hardship on GLE's business operations.
To start, regarding Plaintiff's suggestion that his co-worker at the plant do double-shifts each week to cover his unavailability, "Title VII does not contemplate such unequal treatment." Hardison, 432 U.S. at 81. Indeed, the Supreme Court has made it clear that an accommodation that requires other employees to assume a disproportionate workload or which deprives other employees of their shift preference is an undue hardship. See id. ("[T]o give [plaintiff] Saturdays off, [the employer] would have had to deprive another employee of his shift preference at least in part because he did not adhere to a religion that observed the Saturday Sabbath. . . . It would be anomalous to conclude that by 'reasonable accommodation' Congress meant that an [*16]  employer must deny the shift and job preference of some employees, as well as deprive them of their contractual rights, in order to accommodate or prefer the religious needs of others, and we conclude that Title VII does not require an employer to go that far.").
The Eleventh Circuit confirmed as much in a recent persuasive opinion in which it observed that, "[t]o ensure that [plaintiff] received the time off for Sabbath observance that he was insisting on, Walgreens [the employer] would have had to schedule . . . shifts, including emergency ones, based solely on [plaintiff's] religious needs, at the expense of other employees who had nonreligious reasons for not working on weekends." Patterson, 727 F. App'x at 588-89. "In the immediate future," the court continued, "the burden to work all Friday night and Saturday shifts would have fallen on Alsbaugh, Walgreens' only other training instructor at the time. . . . Under those circumstances, the accommodation [plaintiff] sought would have imposed an undue hardship on Walgreens just as it would have for the employer in Hardison." Id.; see also Bruff v. N. Mississippi Health Servs., Inc., 244 F.3d 495, 501 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding that requiring one or more of plaintiff's co-workers to assume a disproportionate workload or to travel involuntarily [*17]  with plaintiff to accommodate plaintiff constitute an undue hardship as a matter of law); Weber v. Roadway Exp., Inc., 199 F.3d 270, 274 (5th Cir. 2000) ("The mere possibility of an adverse impact on co-workers . . . is sufficient to constitute an undue hardship.").
The law does not require GLE to impose a disproportionate workload on Plaintiff's co-worker at the plant to accommodate Plaintiff's beliefs. This conclusion is particularly warranted on the facts of this case. GLE employees who work during the Nuclear Station's outages are subject to a grueling schedule; they work seven days per week, twelve hours per day, for thirty to eighty days — depending on the length of the outage. The work is very physically demanding and dirty. To impose on another employee an added twenty-four hour shift one day every week on top of this taxing schedule merely to accommodate Plaintiff would amount to unfair treatment of Plaintiff's co-worker.
Additionally, regarding Plaintiff's proposal that a third local or non-local employee be assigned to cover for him, GLE had no obligation to revamp the way it schedules and assigns its employees to accommodate Plaintiff, especially where there is evidence that the company's business efficiency would be affected. See Patterson, 727 F. App'x at 589 [*18]  (employer not required to change training sessions to accommodate Plaintiff; occasional Saturday trainings were a business necessity and sometimes required on an urgent basis); Berry v. MeadWestvaco Packaging Sys., LLC, No. 3:10CV78-WHA-WC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25777, 2011 WL 867218, at *8 (M.D. Ala. Mar. 14, 2011) ("[T]he Hardison court emphasized that it is an undue hardship to force an employer to change the way it schedules its employees merely to satisfy the needs of an employee with a religious objection to the schedule."); Bruff, 244 F.3d at 501 ("Requiring the [employer] to schedule multiple counselors for sessions, or additional counseling sessions to cover areas [plaintiff] declined to address [because of her religious beliefs], would also clearly involve more than de minimis cost.").
At the relevant time, the Fort Lauderdale office had a substantial workload and projects which required more experience than the entry-level work done at the plant. Under these circumstances, Simmons concluded that he needed to hire additional employees to staff the plant and that the better business decision was to have the new employees work the outage so that experienced employees could remain on more advanced assignments. Further, GLE uses a project-based model so the company generally keeps its employees on the projects they are assigned to. This evidence supports GLE's position that it did not have adequate resources to staff the Nuclear Station with a third employee each week. GLE's staffing decisions are based on its view of the most efficient allocation of resources. Absent evidence of discrimination, this Court does not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions. Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). The evidence [*19]  reflects legitimate business concerns and, therefore, the Court will not second-guess GLE's staffing decisions.
While Plaintiff points to GLE's original plan to send a third employee to the plant, the evidence is that the company planned to do so for only two or three days, not for the entirety of the outage. Likewise, Plaintiff's reliance on testimony that GLE relied on a non-local employee to cover Turkey Point in the past is not compelling because the company did so out of necessity after it was unable to find a replacement for Plaintiff in time for the fall outage.
Above all, Plaintiff's proposals come with added economic costs to GLE. GLE has offices in Atlanta, Nashville, Gainesville, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, and Jacksonville. (Lemen Dep. [DE 46-1] 30:19-23.) Still, in 2016, the company had only roughly sixty employees. It is a relatively small company, and it hires employees for specific offices based on the needs of the office. It is not normal practice to send employees to work away from their home office.6 In fact, the evidence in the record is that it was more cost effective to use local employees (that is, from the Fort Lauderdale office) than out-of-town employees [*20]  to cover the Nuclear Station. For instance, Simmons testified that using the employee from Tampa to cover the fall outage after Plaintiff's offer was rescinded ended up costing the company more money than it would have expended if a local employee was available and had been assigned, because GLE had to absorb per diem and hotel expenses.7 Likewise, if GLE were to send a third employee from Fort Lauderdale to the plant each week to cover for Plaintiff, GLE would have to absorb the associated costs. (Simmons Dep. 52:22-53:7 (plant would not have covered cost of the third employee).)
Even worse, staffing the outage with a third employee as Plaintiff proposes would have imposed an unreasonable burden on the Nuclear Station as well. For economic and safety reasons, the plant restricts the number of badges it issues. (Simmons Dep. 130:23-133:6.) The number of badges issued correlates to the shifts or the number of employees the plant requests of GLE, which would have been two in 2016. In urgent situations or on daily non-outage jobs, a non-badged GLE employee can get access upon twenty-four-hour notice to the plant and on condition that the non-badged employee be escorted around the plant [*21]  by a badged GLE employee or by one of the Contractor's employees (at a cost to the Contractor and the Contractor decides who can serve as an escort). (Simmons Dep. 30:11-31:19, 42:18-43:1, 46:14-16, 53:10-13; Padgett Dep. 49:9-18.)
In this scenario, the non-badged GLE employee covering for Plaintiff would have to be escorted around the facility by the Contractor's staff, at the Contractor's expense, one day each week for at least twelve hours straight.8 That would be an undue burden on the plant and would possibly result in GLE losing its contract with the Contractor. Indeed, on a previous occasion, the plant came close to terminating GLE's contract due to a staffing shortage caused by an employee's sudden resignation, which left only one worker doing double-shifts and left the plant questioning whether GLE could properly cover the shifts. (Simmons Dep. 59:1-60:8.) Overall, in the end, Plaintiff's proposals would require not only GLE but also the Nuclear Station to change business practices and incur added costs. This finding supports GLE's position that it could not have accommodated Plaintiff without incurring undue hardship.
To essentially show that GLE did not make a good faith effort [*22]  to try to accommodate him, Plaintiff points to the short amount of time it took GLE to decide to rescind the job offer. On the day Plaintiff called Simmons to inform him of his Sabbath requirements, Simmons reached out to Ginny Lemen, GLE's former Corporate Administrator, to inform her of Plaintiff's request. (Simmons Dep. 128:2-11; Lemen Dep. 59:3-61:16.) Upon speaking with Simmons, Lemen called GLE's attorney to consult on the matter. (Lemen Dep. 61:13-25.) After speaking with the attorney, Lemen went to Greene's office to discuss the issue. (Lemen Dep. 62:3-22.)
During the conversation, Greene asked Lemen: (1) if she consulted with the company's attorney and what advice she received; (2) if Plaintiff was prescreened and what was the result; (3) about the nature and substance of Plaintiff's interview with Simmons; and (4) if anyone else interviewed Plaintiff and what was the result. (Greene Dep. [DE 49-1] 19:19-21:15.) Upon receiving responses to his questions and based on "his extensive experience knowing that nights and weekends are required extensively in all offices, including the South Florida office, for work in the asbestos environment," Greene instructed Lemen to rescind the [*23]  job offer. (Greene Dep. 23:25-24:20; 26:8-17.) Greene did not do any other evaluation because by that point he felt "it would create undue hardship for the company for [Plaintiff] not to be able to work nights and weekends, or weekends specifically." (Greene Dep. 28:3-29:12.) Greene made his decision within ten minutes from the time Lemen walked into his office. (Id.)
Plaintiff takes issue with Greene's failure to: (1) consult with him or other GLE employees; (2) confirm the facts given by Lemen; (3) confirm the number of Friday and Saturday nights worked by industrial hygienists in the Fort Lauderdale office; and (4) determine the extent of the accommodation requested. Plaintiff provides no evidence, however, that longer deliberations would have produced a different outcome, especially one that would have avoided undue hardship to the company. To the contrary, as discussed above, the evidence in the record shows that undue hardship was likely to result had GLE granted Plaintiff's accommodation request. Further, Greene, the decision maker, started and built the company and has run GLE for the last thirty years. These facts support his assertion that he had enough knowledge of the company's [*24]  client, project, and staffing needs to evaluate the situation and make a prompt decision.
Hence, short of Plaintiff electing to work throughout the weekend (which was not possible given his religion) the Court cannot conclude, based on the evidence, that further discussions would have been fruitful. Plaintiff's proposed interactive process would have been futile. See E.E.O.C. v. Townley Eng'g & Mfg. Co., 859 F.2d 610, 615 n.7 (9th Cir. 1988) ("If an employer can show that no accommodation was possible without undue hardship, it makes no sense to require that he engage in a futile act" of taking "initial steps to reach a reasonable accommodation of the particular religious belief at issue.") (citing Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 69, 107 S. Ct. 367, 372, 93 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986) and cases similarly allowing an employer to argue "undue hardship" where it made no attempt at accommodation); Weber, 199 F.3d at 275 (explaining that even though employer failed to make an effort to accommodate plaintiff's religious beliefs it is entitled to summary judgment where it demonstrates that any accommodation would impose an undue hardship) (citation omitted).
As a final observation on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim, it is not lost on the Court that Plaintiff specifically represented to GLE during the interview process that he could work nights and weekends, with [*25]  full knowledge that the position potentially required work during those times and knowing that he was unable to work at least half the weekend. The Court further notes that this case is distinguished from other cases where the evidence shows that the employer had either a sufficiently large workforce or a manageable workload to reasonably facilitate a plaintiff's request for accommodation. In addition, the evidence consistently demonstrates that the industrial hygienist work done by GLE's Fort Lauderdale office is inflexible in terms of the time commitment required and the restrictions imposed by the Nuclear Station, and is so physically taxing that passing Plaintiff's workload to his co-worker at the plant would have been unjust.
For all these reasons, the Court concludes that GLE is entitled to summary judgment on its religious accommodation, discrimination, and retaliation claims. See Patterson, 727 F. App'x at 589 (district court did not err in granting summary judgment on all three of plaintiff's claims — failure to accommodate, discrimination, and retaliation — where they were all based on the employer's failure to accommodate plaintiff's observation of his Sabbath). All three claims turn on GLE's alleged [*26]  failure to accommodate Plaintiff's religious beliefs. The uncontroverted facts in the record are enough to foreclose any genuine issue of material fact on all claims. Furthermore, even if the Court were to independently analyze the discrimination and retaliation claims, it would similarly conclude that the claims must fail because Plaintiff cannot show that GLE's reason for not hiring him was a pretext for religious discrimination.

C. Pretext
To briefly elaborate, where a discrimination or retaliation claim is supported by circumstantial evidence, like this case, the McDonnell Douglas framework addressed above governs the Court's analysis. Lubetsky v. Applied Card Sys., Inc., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2002) (discrimination); Bush v. Regis Corp., 257 F. App'x 219, 222 (11th Cir. 2007) (retaliation). Assuming Plaintiff can meet his burden under the first prong and demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination and retaliation, "the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection." Lubetsky, 296 F.3d at 1305. If the defendant carries his burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons offered by the defendant were a pretext for discrimination or prohibited, retaliatory conduct. Id.; Pennington v. City of Huntsville, 261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457, 1460 (11th Cir. 1998)).
GLE articulated legitimate [*27]  non-discriminatory reasons for not accommodating Plaintiff's request to be off from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. Plaintiff has not offered any evidence to rebut those reasons. Plaintiff attempts to do so by arguing that the requirement to work twelve-hour shifts at the Nuclear Station was pretext for discrimination because GLE did not specifically inform him during the interview process that he was being hired to work at the plant and, in any event, he was prepared to work all non-Sabbath hours. This argument is not persuasive because even if he was not given a specific schedule during his interview, the undisputed evidence is that Plaintiff was on notice of GLE's work at the plant, was on notice of the possibility of working nights and weekends, and he informed GLE he could meet such temporal requirements. Plus, regardless of his availability at other times, Plaintiff's absence for at least half of the weekend would have created undue hardship for GLE, undermined its business efficiency, and put its contract with the plant at risk.
Next, Plaintiff argues that he has shown pretext by flagging purported conflicting testimony concerning GLE's hiring decision. More specifically, [*28]  Plaintiff argues that there are inconsistencies regarding why Plaintiff was not hired the first time he applied in April 2016 and regarding who made the final hiring decision.9 This argument is neither here nor there. GLE did not become aware of Plaintiff's religious beliefs until July 2016, so its reason for not hiring Plaintiff in April 2016, or who made the decision to hire Plaintiff in June 2016, is not relevant or material to the Court's determination of whether religious bias motivated GLE's decision to rescind the job offer in July once it became aware of Plaintiff's schedule restrictions. In the end, there is no evidence of discrimination or that GLE acted with retaliatory animus by virtue of its failure to accommodate Plaintiff's beliefs. Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that:
1) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 29] is GRANTED;
2) The Court will enter separate judgment;
3) All pending motions not otherwise ruled on are DENIED AS MOOT; and
4) The case is CLOSED.
DONE AND ORDERED in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 18th day of February, 2020.
