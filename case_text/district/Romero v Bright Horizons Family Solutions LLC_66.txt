II.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The Court sets forth the material facts below and views all reasonable inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.2 These facts are uncontroverted unless otherwise indicated.
Bright Horizons is a provider of early education to infants, toddlers, and preschool children. Defendant's Reply Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("Reply SUF") P 1 [Doc. # 27-1.] Bright Horizons' El Segundo Center ("the Center") has six classrooms—two infant, two toddler, and two preschool classrooms. Id. P 21. The infant classrooms include infants from the age of 6 weeks to 16 months. Id. P 22. The toddler classrooms include children from the age of 20 months to three years old. Id. P 23. The preschool classrooms include children from ages three to five years old. Id. P 24.
Romero started working at the El Segundo Center in 2008 as a teacher in one [*4]  of the infant classrooms.3 Id. PP 20, 150. Romero was responsible for a group of three to four infants ranging in age from three months to 18 months. Id. P 25. The job required Romero to provide a safe and nurturing environment that encourages children's social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development. Id. P26. This required Romero to play with the children, change their diapers, feed them, wash their clothes and dishes, and clean tables and floors. Id. P 151. Additionally, Romero had to lift and pick up babies, and play with them on the floor "[a]ll the time." Id. P 32; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 33. The babies weighed anywhere between 10 pounds and 40 pounds. Reply SUF P 28; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 38. Romero had to often ("maybe 90 percent of the time") kneel or squat to play with the babies on the floor. Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 34. The physical demands of Romero's job required her to "[d]emonstrate full range of motion to lift, reach, squat, climb, sit, and otherwise fully participate in activities," and respond immediately and appropriately to multiple or unexpected situations or emergencies. Reply SUF PP 29-30; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 43-44, Ex. 5(Teacher Job Description with Romero's [*5]  signature of acknowledgement).
Sometime in late 2008, Romero began experiencing neck pain, which lasted about one or two months. Reply SUF P 49. Romero told her supervisor, lead teacher Amy Fougy, that she experienced neck pain, but did not request an accommodation at the time. Id. P 50. According to Romero, Fougy told her to "just take it easy." Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 49. Romero herself "thought [the neck pain] was going to go away in a matter of days." Id. To treat the pain, Romero started physical therapy. Reply SUF P 153. While her condition improved, the pain did not go away completely. Id.
In 2009, Romero began experiencing back and knee pain. Id. P 155. She informed Fougy about the back pain. Id. P 156. Fougy told her to be careful and lift with her knees instead of just bending her back. Id.; Pletcher Decl., Ex. 1 (Romero Dep.) at 55. In or around 2009 or early 2010, Romero told the Center's director, Hawani Negussie, [*6]  that she was having a hard time doing her job because of her condition and requested to move classrooms to work with the older children.4 Reply SUF PP 71, 157-58. Romero stated that it would be better to work with older children because "I didn't have to pick them up" and "didn't have to kneel so much, squat." Pletcher Decl., Ex. 1 (Romero Dep.) at 56. Negussie told Romero she was going to move her as soon as possible to another classroom when a position opens up. Id. P 159. Romero's back and knee pain were made worse by lifting, bending, squatting, and sitting on the floor, among other things. Reply SUF P 54. Occasionally, Romero requested days off from work, which Bright Horizons approved. Id. P 55.
In or about late June 2012, Romero's workers' compensation counsel sent a letter to Bright Horizons alleging that Romero had [*7]  suffered a workplace injury and had filed a Workers' Compensation claim. Id. P 56. Romero was still actively working at the El Segundo Center during this time and never told anyone at Bright Horizons that she was going to file a Workers' Compensation claim. Id. PP 57-58. After receiving notice of Romero's claim, Center management met with Romero. Id. P64. Romero was put on medical leave. P 65. Romero submitted a patient status form from her doctor on July 7, 2012, which stated she would be unable to work until August 18, 2012. Id. P 66. .
Romero then had a conversation with Negussie about moving to a preschool classroom because a preschool teaching position had recently opened up at the Center. Id. P 160; Pletcher Decl., Ex. 1 (Romero Dep.) at 73-74. Negussie told Romero that she could not apply for the position because she was on medical leave. Pletcher Decl., Ex. 1 (Romero Dep.) at 74.
On July 20, 2012, Bright Horizons sent Romero paperwork designating her leave of absence as one under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). Reply SUF P 76. On July 25, 2012, Romero requested a 45-day FMLA leave, which Bright Horizons approved. Id. PP 77-78. Her medical provider indicated on the FMLA-related paperwork that Romero is "unable to perform [a] full range of motion w[ith her] spine [*8]  or knees[, and] is unable to lift 40 pounds." Id. P 77; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 11.
On August 18, 2012, Romero's doctor extender her "total temporary disability" leave to September 29, 2012. Reply SUF P 79; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 13. On August 20, 2012, Romero submitted a physician's certification and patient status report stating that she is "unable to perform the essential functions of [her] position as listed in the attached form until" September 4, 2012. Reply SUF P 80; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 12. According to the attached form, the job functions Romero could not inform included kneeling, squatting, walking up and down stairs, and standing longer than one hour. Id. Bright Horizons approved Romero's leave request. Reply SUF P 81.
Between September 1, 2012 and February 2, 2013, Romero submitted five additional patient status reports and 45-day leave requests. Reply SUF PP 82-88, 90-96. Bright Horizons granted all of the requests, even after Romero's FMLA eligibility expired and after her leave of absence under Bright Horizons' Extended Medical Leave program expired. Id. During this time, Bright Horizons sent Romero a letter on November 28, 2012 and [*9]  December 28, 2012, requesting further information concerning her medical condition that would allow it to fully understand her situation, and its expected duration. Reply SUF P 89, 93. In particular, the December 28, 2012 letter stated Bright Horizons needed this information to understand "how any further accommodations would facilitate [Romero's] ability to return to work with any degree of medical certainty." Id. P 93; Meyer Decl. P 7, Ex. N. Romero's February 2, 2013 status report and leave request, however, did not state how long Romero's medical situation would last or how any further accommodations would facilitate her return. Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 20 (stating that Romero would be unable to return until 45 days, but not her medical condition's expected duration).
On March 4, 2013, Bright Horizons sent a letter and accommodation request form to Romero stating that it would consider her leave indefinite unless she provided supplemental documentation by March 19, 2013. Reply SUF P 97; Meyer Decl. P 7, Ex. O. On March 19, 2013, Romero submitted to Bright Horizons updated medical documentation which contained the following restrictions: limited walking and standing to 30 minutes [*10]  consecutively; limited bending, stooping, kneeling to 10% of the work day; and limited lifting to 10 pounds. Reply SUF PP 99-100; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 22. The March 19, 2013 document still failed to indicate an estimated end date for the listed restrictions. See Id. It did state that "if light duty is not available patient is considered to be Total Temporarily Disabled and should not resume regular work." Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 22. Romero's doctor informed her around this time that her knee injuries would be permanent. Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.) at 113.
On March 19, 2013, Bright Horizons extended Romero's leave of absence one more time while it "attempted to clarify the duration of the requested restrictions." Meyer Decl. P 10. It also sent Romero a letter asking for further information regarding her limitations, including specifically the "duration or estimated durations of the accommodations" that Romero indicated in her March 19, 2013 documentation (e.g., limited walking and standing). Meyer Decl. P 10, Ex. R (emphasis in original). Bright Horizons sent another letter on March 28, 2013, asking Romero to submit a completed Accommodation Request [*11]  Form by April 4, 2013. Meyer Decl. P 11, Ex. S.
On April 5, 2013, Romero submitted a completed Accommodation Request Form to Bright Horizons. Reply SUF P 123-24; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 25. The form stated Romero could not lift objects over 15 pounds, could not bend or crawl, and could not walk or stand for longer than 30 minutes. Id. It further stated as a "suggestion regarding possible accommodations" that Romero should be able to take a 15-minute break every hour. Id. In response to the question "If not permanent, how long will the limitation last," Romero's doctor wrote "Unknown, pt. has restrictions for 45 days, then should be reevaluated." Id.
On April 15, 2013, Center Director Negussie sent Romero a letter stating that her leave of absence expired on that date. Reply SUF 127; Boyce Decl., Ex. U (Romero Dep.), Ex. 27. The letter stated that based on the most recent updated information Romero submitted, Bright Horizons determined that "further leave as an accommodation would not be effective in enabling you to work and perform the essential functions of your job." Id. It further stated, "Should you wish to explore the possibility of transferring to another center which [*12]  may have an open position and may be able to accommodate your restrictions please contact me by April 22, 2013." Id. Romero never contacted Negussie or anyone else at Bright Horizons after she received the April 15, 2013 letter. Reply SUF P 128. With no further contact from Romero, Romero's employment was terminated. Id. P 129. Nonetheless, Bright Horizons marked Romero as "rehireable," which meant Romero "could be considered for re-employment at another time should she apply to work at Bright Horizons." Id. P 130; Martin Decl. P 13.

A. Bright Horizons' Decision to Not Place Romero in Another Classroom
Bright Horizons did not believe it was possible to accommodate Romero's restrictions, especially given that Romero could not identify how long they would last. Martin Decl.P 5. In the past, it had accommodated temporary lifting, bending, stooping, kneeling, or standing restrictions by placing an extra teacher in the classroom. Id. P 8. Bright Horizons limits such accommodations, however, to instances "when the restriction is known to be for a definite, short-term basis, such as one to two weeks, as it imposes extra labor costs and essentially requires the second teacher to perform many of the restricted teacher's [*13]  job duties." Id. Given that Romero did not provide a timeframe for the requested restrictions, Bright Horizons determined Romero "would need more than a short-term accommodation, and any accommodation for these restrictions would necessarily change her job duties as a teacher." Id. P 12. This, in combination with Bright Horizons' conclusion that "further leaves of absence would be of an indefinite and potentially permanent duration," convinced Bright Horizons that it could not provide any reasonable accommodation which would allow Romero to return to work. Id.
Bright Horizons did consider whether it should move Negussie to a toddler or preschool classroom within the El Segundo Center. Reply SUF P 104; Martin Decl. P 6. The Center had no openings in those classrooms during the March and April 2013 period.5 Id. Moreover, even assuming the Center had teacher position openings in those classrooms, Bright Horizons determined Romero's restrictions would still prevent her from performing the essential functions of those jobs. Id. P 7.
Preschool teachers are required to sit on the floor to play with [*14]  children, and bend, stoop, and kneel to work with students. Fougy Decl. P 16. In particular, Bright Horizons teachers are required to communicate directly with each child at the child's eye level when speaking to them about certain subjects or when disciplining the child. Id. A teacher must "constantly bend, stoop, kneel or sit on the floor to reach the child's eye level." Id. Preschool teachers are also "constantly on their feet," as they work with fully mobile children who walk, run, and explore their surroundings. Id. P 17. This is in contrast to the infant classroom, where the teachers may sit down more often to bottle-feed or play with less mobile babies. Id.
Furthermore, while moving Romero to a preschool classroom may lessen the need for her to lift children, teachers in that classroom are still required to lift children weighing up to 40 pounds in certain situations, like emergencies. Martin P 7; Fougy Decl. P 15. For instance, in the event of a physical altercation between two children, a preschool teacher may be required to physically intervene. Fougy Decl. P 15. Allowing a teacher to work with lifting restrictions in a preschool setting puts children at risk even during their everyday [*15]  physical acts—running, climbing, roughhousing whether at the preschool playground or in the classroom—because such acts require immediate teacher intervention.6 Id.

III.

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that [*16]  there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); accord Wash. Mut. Inc. v. United States, 636 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011). Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) .
Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(c) requires the nonmoving party to "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e) (1986)); see also Norse v. City of Santa Cruz, 629 F.3d 966, 973 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ("Rule 56 requires the parties to set out facts they will be able to prove at trial."). "In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence." Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). "Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id.

IV.

DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination
California has adopted the three-part burden-shifting test for FEHA discrimination claims set forth [*17]  in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 307, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010) (citation omitted). If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, then the burden shifts to the employer to establish that its action was taken for a non-discriminatory reason. Id. at 307-08. If the employer meets this burden, then the plaintiff must show pretext by offering evidence of a discriminatory motive. Id. at 308.
"Under California law, a prima facie case of discrimination requires the plaintiff to 'provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive.'" Zeinali v. Raytheon Co., 636 F.3d 544, 552 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000)).
"When an employer moves for summary judgment . . . 'the defendant who seeks summary judgment bears the initial burden. Thus, [t]o prevail on summary judgment, [the employer is] required to show either that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of [the] FEHA claim or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiff's employment. If the employer meets its burden, the discharged [*18]  employee must demonstrate either "that the defendant's showing was in fact insufficient or . . . that there was a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing." Lawler v. Montblanc N. Am., LLC, 704 F.3d 1235, 1241 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 745-46 (9th Cir. 2011) (alterations in the original)).
Here, Bright Horizons does not dispute that Romero is disabled. Rather, Bright Horizons argues that Romero has failed to establish that she is a "qualified individual" within the meaning of Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). In Green, the California Supreme Court held that drawing distinctions on the basis of physical or mental disability under section 12940 is "prohibited only if the adverse employment action occurs because of a disability and the disability would not prevent the employee from performing the essential duties of the job, at least not with reasonable accommodation." Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 262 (emphasis in original). "[I]n order to establish that a defendant employer has discriminated on the basis of disability in violation of the FEHA, the plaintiff employee bears the burden of proving he or she was able to do the job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Id.
FEHA defines "essential functions" as "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires," not including "the marginal [*19]  functions of the position." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f). A court may consider an employer's job description as evidence of what a particular job's essential functions are. See Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 887 (9th Cir. 2001) (interpreting analogous provision of the ADA). Such evidence, however, is not conclusive—"an employer may not turn every condition of employment which it elects to adopt into a job function, let alone an essential job function, merely by including it in a job description." Id. (citing Echazabal v. Chevron USA, Inc., 226 F.3d 1063, 1071 (9th Cir. 2000). Other relevant evidence that a court may consider in determining the essential functions of a job includes the amount of time spent performing a function, the work experience of current or past employees, and the consequences of not requiring that an employee perform a function. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)(2).
Bright Horizons presents evidence that the essential functions of a teacher at the Center—whether in the infant classroom or in the preschool classroom—include lifting, bending, stooping, kneeling, or standing. The Center's interim director who supervised Romero's and other teachers' work, and who has worked in all three types of classrooms at the Center, stated that in order to manage, communicate with, and play with the children, teachers are required to lift up to 40 [*20]  pounds, bend, stoop, kneel, and stand on a regular basis. Lifting is just as crucial in the case of preschool children, who are fully mobile and run, climb, and roughhouse both at the preschool playground and in the classroom. Indeed, the job description for a teacher at the Center requires that teachers "[d]emonstrate full range of motion to lift, reach, squat, climb, sit, and otherwise fully participate in activities," and respond quickly to multiple or unexpected situations. Moreover, Romero herself testified that she had to lift and pick up babies that weighed anywhere between 10 pounds and 40 pounds, and play with them on the floor "[a]ll the time." In the infant classroom, she had to kneel or squat to play with the babies on the floor "maybe 90 percent of the time."
Romero has failed to designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine dispute for trial on the issue of whether lifting, bending, stooping, kneeling, or standing are essential functions of a teacher position. While Romero makes legal arguments concerning Defendant's burden and the weight a court should give to Bright Horizons' job description, Romero fails to point to any evidence contradicting Defendant's evidence regarding [*21]  the essential-functions issue in her brief.7 See Opp. at 25-27. Romero's own testimony as to her job as an infant teacher could only lead a reasonable jury to conclude that lifting, bending, stooping, kneeling, and standing are essential functions of her job as an infant teacher. Romero offers no helpful citations to the record to contradict Bright Horizons' evidence. Nevertheless, the Court did an exhaustive review of the entire record presented and found only the following statement in Romero's deposition:
Q: And why was it that you thought it would be better to work with older children?
A: Because with the older children, I didn't have to pick them up.
Q: Any other reasons?
A: I didn't have to kneel so much, squat.
Pletcher Decl., Ex. 1 (Romero Dep.) at 56.
Such answers from Romero do not create a genuine dispute of material fact on the essential-functions issue. She does not have personal knowledge to testify that she would not have to pick up children as a preschool classroom teacher or kneel and squat less—Romero has presented evidence that she has only worked as an infant classroom teacher. Furthermore, Romero offers no other evidence to support her conclusory deposition statements. In light of the evidence that Bright Horizons presented—declarations, job description, and Romero's own admissions—a reasonable jury can [*23]  only conclude that lifting, bending, stooping, kneeling, and standing are essential functions of any teaching job at Bright Horizons.
Romero has not presented any evidence that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of a teaching job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, either at the time she first requested a transfer to the preschool classroom in July 2012 or at the time of her termination in April 2013. In July 2012, Romero's doctor specifically stated that Romero is unable to perform a full range of motion with her spine or knees, and is incapable of lifting 40 pounds. And by March 2013, Romero's medical documentation stated she could function at work with only limited bending, stooping, and kneeling to 10 percent of the work day, limited walking and standing to 30 minutes consecutively, and could lift no more than 10 pounds.
In short, Bright Horizons has met its burden of demonstrating that Romero does not satisfy the "qualified individual" requirement of her FEHA claim. Thus, Romero had to adduce evidence demonstrating either "that the defendant's showing was in fact insufficient or . . . that there was a triable issue of fact material to the defendant's showing." [*24]  Lawler, 704 F.3d at 1241 (citation omitted). Romero has introduced no evidence that she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the position for which she was terminated or the preschool teaching position she sought. She also has presented no evidence challenging the sufficiency of Bright Horizons' evidence concerning what constitutes an essential function.
Because the evidence is uncontroverted that Romero cannot perform the essential functions of either an infant or preschool teacher position, the Court GRANTS Bright Horizons' summary judgment motion as to Romero's first cause of action for disability discrimination.

B. Failure to Accommodate
Under FEHA, it is unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). "The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Institute of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (citing Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009)).
Applying California law, the Ninth Circuit recently described a defendant's burden on summary judgment as follows:
An 'employer [*25]  cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts' [1] that 'reasonable accommodation was offered and refused,' [2] that 'there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation,' or [3] that 'the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith.'
Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 743-44 (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)).
Here, Bright Horizons has established that there was no vacant position within the Center for which Romero was qualified and capable of performing with or without accommodation. Romero has not presented evidence that any vacant positions within the Center or in other alternative locations existed between July 2012 and August 2013.8 According to Bright Horizons, it was not possible to reasonably accommodate Romero's restrictions, especially given that she could not identify how long they would last. Bright Horizons could have hired another teacher to assist Romero temporarily, [*26]  but requiring a second teacher to perform Romero's essential job duties would not have been feasible as a long-term accommodation. "FEHA does not obligate the employer to accommodate the employee by excusing him or her from the performance of essential functions." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 375, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015) (citation omitted).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Bright Horizons' motion as to Romero's second cause of action.

C. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
Under FEHA, "[i]t is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability." Lucent Techs., 642 F.3d at 742 (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)) (alterations in original). "[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." [*27]  Id. at 742-43 (quoting Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (alterations in original)).
"To prevail on a claim . . . for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018. While "[a]n employee cannot necessarily be expected to identify and request all possible accommodations during the interactive process . . . , once the parties have engaged in the litigation process, to prevail, the employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." Id. (citing Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984) (emphasis added).
According to Romero, she "made the same accommodation request on two separate occasions—to transfer from a newborn classroom to a preschool classroom which would less the physical strain on Romero's symptoms because she would be dealing with older children." Opp. at 23. This first request took place in 2009 or 2010. Romero's supervisor told her that she would be moved into another classroom when a position opened up. Romero neither contests that her supervisor in 2009 or 2010 made this statement nor does she present evidence that there was a preschool classroom opening available during that [*28]  time. As to the second request in July 2012, Romero argues that Bright Horizons failed to engage in the interactive process by simply telling her she could not apply for the then-open preschool classroom position because she was on medical leave. This was not an appropriate response by Bright Horizons to Romero's request. The better practice would have been for Bright Horizons to engage in the interactive process at that time to determine whether Romero could fill the preschool classroom position.
Yet, in order to prevail on a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, Romero must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process allegedly should have occurred in July 2012. As discussed earlier, no reasonable jury could find on this evidentiary record that Romero was able to perform the essential functions of the preschool teacher position at that time or at any other point afterwards. Nor has Romero adduced any evidence, after months of discovery, from which the Court can discern a triable issue of fact as to whether any other reasonable accommodation existed.
Thus, the Court GRANTS Bright Horizons' motion on Romero's [*29]  third cause of action for failure to engage in interactive process.

D. Retaliation
A prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA requires that a plaintiff show (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer subjected her to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action. Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). "Causation sufficient to establish the third element of the prima facie case may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision." Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987).
Here, Romero alleges that after she made several attempts to seek accommodation of her disability and to engage in the interactive process, Bright Horizons took adverse employment actions against her that culminated in her termination. Compl. P 43. Bright Horizons contends that Romero has not established a causal nexus between her protected activity and the termination decision. The Court agrees. In the absence of evidence that Romero could perform the essential functions of an available teaching position, no reasonable jury could [*30]  come to a conclusion other than that Bright Horizons terminated Romero's employment because, despite multiple extensions of her leave of absence, she could not return to work and perform the essential functions of the job, whether with or without accommodations.
Because Romero does not present a genuine dispute of material fact that there is a causal nexus between her protected activity and her termination, the Court GRANTS Bright Horizons' motion on Romero's fourth cause of action for retaliation.

E. Failure to Prevent Discrimination
Under California Government Code section 12940(k), it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Indeed, "[t]he employer's duty to prevent harassment and discrimination is affirmative and mandatory." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 288, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (2009) (quoting Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 103 Cal. App. 4th 1021, 1035, 127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 285 (2002)). In order to prevail on a claim for failure to prevent discrimination, a plaintiff must establish three elements: "1) plaintiff was subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation; 2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination, harassment or retaliation; and 3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Lelaind v. City & Cty. of S.F., 576 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1103 (N.D. Cal. 2008).
Romero has not [*31]  come forth with evidence to overcome summary judgment with respect to her FEHA discrimination and retaliation claims. Because she cannot satisfy the first element of section 12940(k), the Court GRANTS Bright Horizons' motion as to Romero's fifth cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination.

F. Wrongful Termination
To prevail on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the policy in question must satisfy four requirements: (1) it must be supported by either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) it must be "public" in the sense that it inures to the benefit of the public rather than an individual; (3) it must have been articulated at the time of the discharge; and (4) it must be "fundamental" and "substantial." Ross v. RagingWire Telecomms., Inc., 42 Cal. 4th 920, 932, 70 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382, 174 P.3d 200 (2008). There is no question that the public policy against disability discrimination meets these requirements.
As discussed above, however, Romero's FEHA claims based on disability discrimination and retaliation fail. Romero does not identify any other public policy that was violated by her discharge. Romero therefore cannot sustain her cause of action for wrongful termination. Bright Horizons' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED on this sixth cause of action.

G. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [*32] 
Because Romero cannot prevail on any of her substantive claims, the remedies of declaratory and injunctive relief are perforce unavailable. The Court therefore GRANTS Bright Horizons' motion on Romero's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.
