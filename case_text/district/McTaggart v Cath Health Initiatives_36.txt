Opinion



MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Defendants Catholic Health Initiatives and Memorial Health Care System, Inc. ("Defendants") [*2]  have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 35], requesting the Court dismiss Plaintiff Rick McTaggart's (Plaintiff) claims under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. Plaintiff has responded [Doc. 41] and Defendants have replied [Doc. 44]. The matter is now ripe for resolution.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked as a respiratory therapist at Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee ("Memorial") from May 6, 1990 until April 30, 2018 [Doc. 18, ¶¶ 6, 12]. In 2013, Plaintiff had cardiac bypass surgery and was approved to take FMLA leave [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 2-5]. In early 2015, Plaintiff applied for and was granted a position in the pulmonary function testing ("PFT") lab [Doc. 40, ¶ 6]. In February 2016, Plaintiff fractured his pelvis in an ATV accident and took FMLA leave from February 28, 2016 through July 31, 2016 [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 9-10]. When he returned to work, Plaintiff requested he be permitted to use a wheelchair and cane in performing his duties and Defendants approved his request [Doc. 40, ¶ 12].
In August 2016, Tena Green ("Green") became Plaintiff's manager, and she required PFT lab employees, including Plaintiff, to perform clinical care duties on the hospital floor when they were not actively performing lab [*3]  tests [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 14, 15]. When Plaintiff complained, Green told him to "suck it up, buttercup." [Doc. 40, ¶ 17]. Plaintiff requested a transfer to Memorial's North Park location where he would only have to perform patient rounds with no duties in the lab [Doc. 40, ¶ 27]. Green approved his transfer effective March 5, 2017 [Doc. 40, ¶ 28]. At the North Park location, Plaintiff seldom encountered Green, though she remained his department manager [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 14, 30].
On September 28, 2017, while working at North Park, Plaintiff requested and received "intermittent FMLA" for arthritis "flare-ups." [Doc. 40, ¶ 32]. Defendants approved this request through March 31, 2018 [Doc. 40, ¶ 36]. Plaintiff did not use any of his approved intermittent FMLA leave between October 28, 2017 and March 31, 2018 [Doc. 40, ¶ 37].
Plaintiff was scheduled to work on April 9, 2018, but on the morning of that day he called Defendants and reported that he "was not going to be [at work], that [his] back and hip were bothering [him]" and that he was "going to try an use FMLA; but if not, [he would] use [his personal time off]." [Doc. 40, ¶ 51]. Plaintiff was scheduled to work the next day, April 10th, but he again [*4]  called to report that his back and hip were bothering him and that he was going to use FMLA leave [Doc. 40, ¶ 52]. On April 9, Defendants marked "FMLA" next to Plaintiff's name on the assignment sheets, and on April 10-11, he was marked "sick." [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 51-52].
When he returned to work, Plaintiff edited his attendance record to reflect that his absence on April 9-11, 2018 should be classified as "FMLA" leave [Doc. 40, ¶ 54]. Plaintiff claims that he "requested FMLA leave for April 9-11, 2018 because he was in 'extreme pain,' 'very stiff,' and 'sore' from his back and hip flaring up." [Doc. 40, PDF, ¶ 19].1
On those same dates, another staff therapist saw Plaintiff in attendance at a conference held by the Tennessee Society for Respiratory Care ("TSRC") in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and advised Green that she had seen him there [Doc. 40, ¶ 55]. Green considered this odd because she knew Plaintiff had taken FMLA leave for those days [Doc. 40, ¶ 56]. Gatlinburg, Tennessee is about two and a half hours from Chattanooga [Doc. 40, ¶ 56]. Green reported Plaintiff's attendance at the conference to Amanda Coots, ("Coots") in Defendants' human resources department [Doc. 40, ¶ 57]. Coots advised [*5]  Green that Plaintiff's use of FMLA to attend a conference was a falsification of records and grounds for immediate termination rather than corrective action [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 57-58]. Coots and Green then met with Joe Romeo, Director of Nursing, about Plaintiff's conduct [Doc. 40, ¶ 62]. He agreed that termination was the appropriate sanction [Id.]. At some point, it is not clear in the record, Plaintiff changed his leave classification from FMLA, "logging his time at the conference as PTO...." [Doc. 40, PDF, ¶ 21].
On April 30, 2018, Plaintiff met with Coots, Green, and Romeo and confirmed he attended the conference, but did not attempt to explain why his absence was covered under FMLA [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 63-65]. And, Romeo did not inquire if Plaintiff had a medical reason for using FMLA leave while at the conference [Doc. 40, PDF, ¶ 31]. Indeed, no one asked Plaintiff if he was entitled to FMLA leave on those dates, or if he had observed medical restrictions from his doctor while at the conference [Doc. 40, PDF, ¶ 34]. At the conclusion of the meeting, Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment for falsifying personnel records [Doc. 40, ¶ 66].
Plaintiff timely filed this lawsuit against Defendants [*6]  for retaliation and discrimination in violation of the FMLA, and for retaliation, discrimination, wrongful discharge, and failure to make reasonable accommodations for his disability, and for hostile work environment in violation of the ADA and related state disability laws.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and makes all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Nat'l Satellite Sports, Inc. v. Eliadis Inc., 253 F.3d 900, 907 (6th Cir. 2001).
The moving party bears the burden to demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Leary v. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 897 (6th Cir. 2003). The moving party may meet this burden either by affirmatively producing evidence establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact or by pointing out the absence of support in the record for the nonmoving party's case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Once the movant has discharged this burden, the nonmoving party can no longer rest upon the allegations in the pleadings; rather, it must point to specific facts supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that there is a genuine issue [*7]  for trial. Chao v. Hall Holding Co., Inc., 285 F.3d 415, 424 (6th Cir. 2002).
At summary judgment, the Court may not weigh the evidence; its role is limited to determining whether the record contains sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for the non-movant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A mere scintilla of evidence is not enough; the Court must determine whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict in favor of the non-movant based on the record. Id. at 251-52; Lansing Dairy, Inc. v. Espy, 39 F.3d 1339, 1347 (6th Cir. 1994). If not, the Court must grant summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.

III. ANALYSIS

A. FMLA Claim
The FMLA entitles an employee to take up to 12 weeks of leave within a 12-month period when the employee has "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the [employee's] position." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). An employer cannot "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise any right provided [by the FMLA]," nor may an employer "discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by [the FMLA]." Id. § 2615(a)(1), (2).
Plaintiff claims Defendants retaliated against him in violation of the FMLA by terminating his employment for exercising FMLA leave [Doc. 18, ¶ 54]. Defendants claim they terminated Plaintiff's employment for falsely representing [*8]  his absences as FMLA leave [Doc. 35, pg. 7]. Defendants claim they held an "honest belief" that Plaintiff engaged in misconduct and terminated him according to their personnel policies [Doc. 35, pg. 7].
"To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in an activity protected by the Act, (2) this exercise of his protected rights was known to the defendant, (3) the defendant thereafter took an employment action adverse to the plaintiff, and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Tennial v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 840 F.3d 292, 308 (6th Cir. 2016). A Plaintiff may prove his FMLA retaliation claim using either direct or circumstantial evidence. Daugherty v. Sajar Plastics, Inc., 544 F.3d 696, 707 (6th Cir. 2006).
Plaintiff contends that direct evidence supports his retaliation theory because Defendants terminated him without asking whether he qualified for FMLA leave on April 9th and 10th [Doc. 41, pg. 9]. This is not direct evidence. For evidence to be direct it "must establish not only that the plaintiff's employer was predisposed to discriminate on the basis of [the FMLA], but also that the employer acted on that predisposition." Daugherty, 544 F.3d at 707. "[D]irect evidence of discrimination does not require a factfinder to draw any [*9]  inferences in order to conclude that the challenged employment action was motivated at least in part by prejudice against members of the protected group." Id.
Plaintiff has shown no predisposition by Defendants to retaliate against him based on his request for FMLA leave. In fact, just the opposite is true. Defendants had a history of approving Plaintiff's FMLA leave requests, dating back to 2013 when he had cardiac bypass surgery [Doc. 40, ¶ 2]. In 2016, Defendants again approved Plaintiff's FMLA leave request based on the injuries he sustained after his ATV accident [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 9, 10]. On September 28, 2017, Defendants approved Plaintiff's request for "intermittent FMLA leave due to arthritis 'flare-ups.'" [Doc. 40, ¶ 32].
Plaintiff cannot show any direct evidence of retaliation. The Court will analyze Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework that applies to claims premised on indirect evidence. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1972); Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 762 (6th Cir. 2012). Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, if the employee establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, "the burden shits to the employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for discharging the employee." Edgar v. JAC Prod., Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 511 (6th Cir. 2006). If the employer establishes such a reason, the [*10]  burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reason is pretextual. Id. "The burden of establishing a prima facie case in a retaliation action is not onerous...." Nguyen v. City of Cleveland, 229 F.3d 559, 563 (6th Cir. 2000).
The first element Plaintiff must show is that he engaged in an activity protected by the Act. Tennial, 840 F.3d at 308. Here he claims that the activity protected by FMLA is his report to Defendants that he could not work because his back and hip were hurting. Defendants had already pre-approved intermittent FMLA leave for Plaintiff. Thus, on its face, Plaintiff has met the first element. The second element focuses on the employer's knowledge, or whether Defendants knew Plaintiff was exercising rights protected under FMLA. This element is satisfied because Plaintiff reported to Defendants that his absence was FMLA related. The third element requires an adverse employment action, which is satisfied by Plaintiff's termination.
That leaves the fourth element — causation. Here Plaintiff must show "a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Id. "To show causation, a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the adverse action would [*11]  not have been taken in the absence of the protected conduct." Kirilenko-Ison v. Bd. of Educ. of Danville Indep. Sch., 974 F.3d 652, 664 (6th Cir. 2020) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff alleges Defendants terminated him because he claimed his absences in April were covered under his preapproved intermittent FMLA leave. Indeed, Defendants terminated Plaintiff within 30 days of his exercise of FMLA leave and use of FMLA was a stated reason for the termination. This is enough to allege causation. Plaintiff has met his relatively easy burden to show a prima facie case of retaliation.
At this point, the burden shifts to Defendants to "proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory rationale for discharging the employee." Edgar, 443 F.3d at 511. Here, Defendants claim Plaintiff engaged in a ruse to get out of work and attend the conference by lying about his hip and back hurting [Doc. 35, pg. 11]. To be sure, it appears that Plaintiff had prearranged his attendance at the conference in Gatlinburg. And, "an employer's suspicion of FMLA abuse is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination that defeats a retaliation ... claim." Seeger, 681 F.3d at 284. Defendants have met their burden to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination.
Accordingly, "the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show [*12]  by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's reasons were not its true reasons but were a pretext for retaliation." Kirilenko-Ison, 974 F.3d at 661 (internal quotations omitted). "All that a plaintiff must show in order to overcome a defendant's motion for summary judgment at this stage is that a reasonable juror could find that the defendant's reasons were pretextual. The plaintiff does not need to prove pretext; she only needs to show that the question of pretext is a genuine factual dispute." Id. at 667.
"A plaintiff may establish pretext by showing that the employer's proffered reasons (1) have no basis in fact; (2) did not actually motivate the action; or (3) were insufficient to warrant the action." Seeger, 681 F.3d at 285. "[A] reason cannot ... be a pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason." Id. at 285 (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)). 'Pretext is a commonsense inquiry: did the employer fire the employee for the stated reason or not?'" Blizzard v. Marion Tech. Coll., 698 F.3d 275, 285 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Chen v. Dow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394, 400 n.4 (6th Cir. 2009)). "Ultimately the plaintiff must produce 'sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably reject [the employer's] explanation of why it fired her.'" Brown v. Kelsey-Hayes Co., 814 F. App'x 72, 80 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Chen, 580 F.3d at 400).
Plaintiff argues if Defendants had truly believed he had falsely claimed [*13]  FMLA leave, they would have investigated further into his medical condition and inquired whether he followed FMLA protocols at the conference [Doc. 41, pgs. 11-12]. After all, Defendants had already approved him taking intermittent FMLA leave. He claims that Defendants' failure to investigate violated its own corporate policy and that no one asked if he had observed medical restrictions while at the conference [Id. at 11]. He also points to Coots' admissions that employees taking FMLA could be an "inconvenience" in terms of scheduling [Id. at 12]. And, he claims Green had a history of being overly critical of employees who had disabilities or had used FMLA [Id.]. More importantly, he claims he was genuinely in pain to the extent that he legitimately could not work [Id. at 4].
Defendants claims that their stated reason is not pretextual because they "can demonstrate an honest belief in [the] proffered reason...." Seeger, 681 F.3d at 285 (citation omitted). "As long as the employer held an honest belief in its proffered reason, the employee cannot establish pretext even if the employer's reason is ultimately found to be mistaken, foolish, trivial, or baseless." Id. at 285-86 (quotations and citations omitted).
Defendants [*14]  had previously found Plaintiff's physical condition qualified him for intermittent FMLA leave. On April 9-10, 2018, Plaintiff claimed that he was experiencing physical pain to the point that he qualified to take the intermittent leave Defendants had approved. Defendants did not investigate or inquire into the legitimacy of that claim. Instead, Defendants assumed the claim was false because Plaintiff had made prior arrangements to attend a conference. But Plaintiff asserts that he was in pain on those days, and that he needed to and was entitled to take the preapproved FMLA leave.
In other words, the Court would have to resolve a disputed issue of fact that Plaintiff's claimed entitlement to FMLA was a ruse to enable him to attend the conference. All that is required here is a genuine issue of fact regarding pretext. Given Green's prior statements and Plaintiff's unchallenged claims that he was experiencing pain qualifying him for FMLA leave, a genuine issue exists. For these reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgement with respect to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim is DENIED.

B. ADA Claims
Plaintiff next alleges that Defendants discriminated and retaliated against him on account [*15]  of his disabilities in violation of the ADA, TDA and THRA2 . Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants "discriminated against him and discharged him . . .in violation of the ADA by . . . creating a hostile work environment [and] retaliating against him on account of his disability." [Doc. 18, ¶¶ 59, 63]. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants failed to "provide him with reasonable accommodations and . . . to engage in the interactive process in good faith." [Doc. 18, ¶¶ 59, 63, 66].
Plaintiff's ADA claims center around Green's behavior, the manager of the respiratory therapy department [Doc. 18, ¶¶ 19-24, 59, 60; Doc. 41, pg. 13] Shortly after she became his supervisor, Plaintiff alleges that Green made his job "more strenuous" by adding tasks to his regular duties such as requiring him to perform direct patient treatments [Doc. 18, ¶¶ 16, 19, 21]. When Plaintiff asked Green if he could have "accommodations" in performing these "changed duties," she responded, "Suck it up, buttercup." [Doc. 40, ¶ 17]. Plaintiff further alleges that Ms. Green "conspired" against him to "set him up for termination," by changing his job duties as described and that she also sabotaged his [*16]  job performance by deleting or shredding documents he needed to operate a machine as part of his regular duties [Doc. 18, ¶ 24].
In their motion for summary judgement, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has provided no direct evidence to support his ADA claims [Doc. 35, pg. 8]. Plaintiff does not challenge this assertion, agreeing that the McDonnell Douglas framework should be applied [Doc. 35, pg. 13].

1. Discrimination in violation of the ADA.
The ADA provides, in relevant part: "No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to [the hiring], advancement, or discharge of employees . . . or other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112. To establish a prima facie ADA discrimination claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of ADA, (2) he is able, with or without reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job, and (3) he was terminated because of his disability. Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1047 (6th Cir. 1998).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot establish that he was terminated because of his disability [Doc. 35, pg. 9]. Aside from taking FMLA leave to attend the conference,3 Defendants argue that no evidence exists to link Plaintiff's [*17]  disabilities, or his requests for accommodation, with his eventual termination.
Prior to 2018, Defendants had granted Plaintiff's two requests for extended medical leave, one in 2013 and one in 2016 [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 4, 9]. When Plaintiff returned from each of these, he retained the same job at the same pay as before [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 5, 13]. After the second FMLA leave, Defendants accommodated Plaintiff request to use a wheelchair and a cane to perform his duties [Doc. 40, ¶ 12]. Plaintiff alleges that Green denied his request for "modified" work duties when she responded to his complaints with the phrase "suck it up, buttercup." [Doc. 40, ¶ 17]. However, soon after this comment, Green granted Plaintiff's request for a transfer to a position with decreased duties [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 27, 28]. After the transfer, Plaintiff had very few interactions with Green, and none of those interactions were negative or involved any criticisms from her [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 30, 31]. Plaintiff transferred to North Park on March 5, 2017, more than a year before he was terminated [Doc. 40, ¶ 28].
Plaintiff has identified no evidence of a causal connection between his alleged disabilities and his termination. Thus, Plaintiff [*18]  has failed to establish a prima facie ADA discrimination claim. For that reason, Defendants' motion for summary judgement is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA discrimination claim.

2. Retaliation in violation of the ADA.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge ... under [the ADA]." Penny v. United Parcel Service, 128 F.3d 408, 417 (6th Cir. 1997) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)). To establish a prima facie retaliation claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must show "(1) that he engaged in protected activity; (2) that he suffered adverse employment action; and (3) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse action." Id.
As with the discrimination claim, Defendants argue that Plaintiff "cannot establish any causal connection" between his disability and any adverse action [Doc. 35, pg. 10]. Plaintiff counters that Green's "suck it up, buttercup" comment, as well as the increase in work duties she assigned, suffices to show a connection between his disabilities and discrimination [Doc. 41, pg. 13]. Plaintiff also claims that Defendants failed to engage "in the interactive process" when Green [*19]  responded to his complaints with the "buttercup" comment [Doc. 41, pg. 13]. Plaintiff claims that Green's criticisms of his work performance, together with the increase in his work duties, constitute retaliation against him because of his disabilities, and those actions are directly linked to his eventual termination [Doc. 41, pg. 13].
The undisputed facts do not support Plaintiff's claims of causal connection. Even taking as true Plaintiff's allegations that Green criticized him and added to his workload, Plaintiff has not connected these facts with any adverse action. Nor can Plaintiff show that his protected ADA activity (using a wheelchair and cane on the job) led to any adverse action. Instead, Defendants accommodated Plaintiff's requests through the years, and even Green granted Plaintiff's transfer application to reduce his workload [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 27, 28]. The Court finds no temporal proximity between Green's demands on Plaintiff and Plaintiff's termination since Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment more than a year after he was transferred to North Park. Finally, Defendants' clear and stated reason for terminating Plaintiff was "falsifying personnel records," a reason [*20]  not related to any requested disability accommodations [Doc. 40, ¶ 66].
Because Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between any protected activity under the ADA and his termination, his prima facie showing of retaliation in violation of the ADA fails. Therefore, Defendants' motion for summary judgement with regard to Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim is GRANTED.

3. Hostile work environment in violation of the ADA.
Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants created a "hostile work environment" in violation of the ADA. A successful ADA hostile work environment claim must allege that the perpetrator's conduct is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and [to] create an abusive working environment." Trepka v. Board of Education, 28 F. App'x 455, 461 (6th Cir. 2002).4 To determine severe or pervasive abuse, courts look to factors such as "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). "Conduct that is 'merely offensive' will not suffice to support a hostile work environment action." Trepka, 28 F. App'x at 461 (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 21). A successful hostile work environment [*21]  claim alleges conduct so "extreme" as to "amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment." Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998). Courts measure conduct from an objective standard of a reasonable person, as well as the subjective standard of the alleged victim of the harassment. See Phillips v. UAW International, 854 F.3d 323, 328 (6th Cir. 2017).
As with the retaliation and discrimination claims, Plaintiff's hostile work environment claims center around Green's actions. Plaintiff alleges that "Green created a working environment where employees believed they would be disciplined or terminated if they took medical leave or suffered from a physical disability. [Green] created a working environment where employees believed that [she] would change the conditions of their employment if they took medical leave or suffered from a physical disability." [Doc. 18, ¶ 9]. Plaintiff further alleges that Green was "harsher" with disabled employees and that she would "yell loudly at them, or get in their face," and would make "insensitive or sarcastic remarks" concerning their medical conditions or need for leave [Doc. 18, ¶ 11].
Specifically, Plaintiff testified that Green required him to perform "clinical care on the hospital floor" in addition to his work in the respiratory [*22]  lab, and that she responded rudely when he complained about this change [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 15, 17]. Plaintiff also testified that Green criticized him and "basically [picked his] job apart." [Doc. 40, ¶ 24]. As to specific instances of discrimination, Plaintiff states that Green removed from Memorial's computer system two forms and protocols Plaintiff needed to complete his job and refused to show him where they were located [Doc. 40, ¶ 22]. Ms. Green also sent an email informing coworkers that Plaintiff was not a supervisor, even though he believed his job included a supervisory role [Doc. 40, ¶ 20]. Green never disciplined Plaintiff nor did she make derogatory comments to Plaintiff specifically about his FMLA leave [Doc. 40, ¶¶ 25, 26].
Defendants argue in their motion for summary judgement that Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim fails because it is based on "minor job criticisms, interpersonal conflicts, and workplace inconveniences" which do not rise to the level of severe or pervasive harassment [Doc. 35, pg. 8]. Defendants state that the ADA does not create a "general civility code for the American workplace," and that Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law [Doc. 35, pg. [*23]  8].
Responding to Plaintiff's specific complaints, Defendants argue that Green's requirement that Plaintiff perform clinical patient care was not discriminatory because it was part of Plaintiff's job description [Doc. 40, ¶ 18]. Defendants point out that Ms. Green's "buttercup" comment was a "single comment in [Plaintiff's] 20 months of working under Ms. Green" and falls far short of creating a hostile work environment [Doc. 35, pg. 16]. Regarding Green's criticisms of Plaintiff's job performance, Defendants argue "minor, work related" criticisms of Plaintiff created a hostile work environment [Doc. 35, pg. 18]. Defendants state that Green's removal of the forms from the computer system was "at most an inconvenience" and does not reflect a "material change in the terms and conditions of [Plaintiff's] employment." [Doc. 35, pg. 19]. Finally, in response to Plaintiff's complaint that Green told others he was not a supervisor, Defendants notes that this was consistent with Plaintiff's job description [Doc. 35, pg. 18].
Plaintiff does not address any of Defendants' arguments [See Doc. 41]. Instead, Plaintiff reiterates that Green was constantly "trying to find things to write up and griping [*24]  at" employees who had disabilities or who had been approved for FMLA [Doc. 41, pg. 6]. Plaintiff states that he "witnessed" Green threatening to write up other employees [Doc. 41, pg. 6]. Yet, Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence that Green ever disciplined him or threatened to take any adverse employment action against him on account of his disabilities.
Plaintiff testified that Green constantly criticized his work but offers no concrete examples of this criticism to suggest frequency or severity. No evidence suggests that Green ever threatened Plaintiff or humiliated him. Plaintiff claims Green was "harsh" toward him and other coworkers. Green's email explaining that Plaintiff was not a supervisor contained no humiliating language and was consistent with his job description. Finally, Green's removal of forms from the computer system only marginally affected Plaintiff's work, resulting in the minor inconvenience of having to ask her for them [Doc. 40, ¶ 23]. None of this behavior, even considered as a whole, rises to the level of severe or pervasive harassment.
In conclusion, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff has suffered severe or pervasive abuse at the hands of Green [*25]  or any individual in Defendants' employ. Therefore, with respect to Plaintiff's ADA hostile work environment claim, Defendants' motion for summary judgement is GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION
Defendants' motion for summary judgement is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Summary judgement is DENIED as to Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim because there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether Defendants' termination of Plaintiff was pretextual. However, Defendants are entitled to summary judgement as to Plaintiff's ADA claims. Therefore, Plaintiffs' ADA claims, and the related state claims that Defendants violated the TDA and the THRA, are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
SO ORDERED:
/s/ Clifton L. Corker
United States District Judge
