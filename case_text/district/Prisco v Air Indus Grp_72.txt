REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
SHIELDS, United States Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Michele Prisco ("Plaintiff" or "Prisco") commenced this lawsuit alleging employment discrimination and retaliation based on his age and alleged disability in violation of: (1) the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), (2) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (the "ADEA"), (3) Title 1981 of the Civil Rights Act ("Section 1981"), (4) the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution (together, the "Constitutional Amendments"), (5) the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), and (6) New York State common law. Originally named as Defendants were: (1) Air Industries Group ("Air Industries"), (2) Welding Metallurgy, [*2]  Inc. ("WMI"), (3) Peter D. Retalliata, as former President of Air Industries ("Retalliata"), and (4) Gary Settoducato, as former President of WMI ("Settoducato").
The parties attempted an early settlement of this matter in a conference held before the District Court. See DE 13. When the matter did not settle, the parties submitted documents with respect to Plaintiff's motion to amend, and Defendants' motion to dismiss. Those motions were thereafter referred by the Honorable Joan M. Azrack to this Court for Report and Recommendation. Electronic Order dated April 17, 2017. This Court held oral argument on the referred motions on June 7, 2017.
In a Report and Recommendation dated June 8, 2017 (DE 27) (the "R&R") which has since been adopted by the District Court (DE 30), this Court: (1) recommended that the motion to amend be denied, (2) indicated that it would be recommending dismissal of any claim of quantum meruit and/or unjust enrichment, and (3) allowed supplemental briefing as to certain claims and therefore reserved decision as to those claims pending additional briefing. See Minute Order dated June 7, 2017 and Tape FTR: 11:15-11:57, 12:46-1:04. As further stated in the R&R, Plaintiff [*3]  agreed to the withdrawal of certain causes of action — some in total and others as against certain Defendants. See DE 27 (noting Plaintiff's withdrawal of all claims against WMI and Rettaliata as well as non-viable federal discrimination claims against any individual defendants, Section 1981, constitutional claims and those based on breach of contract).
As to the supplemental briefing allowed in the R&R, this Court reserved decision to allow the parties to submit memoranda as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, which was clarified at oral argument to allege specifically identified claims of actual and perceived disability. In particular, Plaintiff made clear at oral argument that his disability discrimination claims are based upon: (1) perceived disability stemming from WMI's receipt of a Workers' Compensation award with respect to a 2012 shoulder injury, and (2) actual disability only as to a February 2014 hand injury.
As a result of this prior motion practice, oral argument, and final disposition of Plaintiff's motion to amend, the issues to be discussed herein are the Court's previously indicated granting of Defendants' motion to dismiss any claims of quantum meruit and/or unjust [*4]  enrichment, as well as its disposition of the motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Federal ADA and ADEA claims against corporate defendant WMI, his parallel New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL") claims against WMI and individual defendant Settoducato, and a New York state law claim of slander. For the reasons set forth below, this Court respectfully recommends the motion be denied as to Plaintiffs Federal and NYSHRL claims of age discrimination. The Court also recommends that the motion be granted with respect to all Federal and State law claims of disability discrimination, all Federal and State law claims of retaliation and hostile environment and retaliation (whether alleging disability or age discrimination), all State law claims of slander, and all claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment.
Thus, this Court recommends that this case proceed only as to Plaintiff's Federal and State law claims of age discrimination.

BACKGROUND
I. Facts Alleged in the Complaint
The facts sets forth below are gleaned from the operative complaint, and, as required in the context of the present motion, are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.
A. Plaintiff's Employment [*5]  with Decimal and WMI
1. Plaintiff's Positions and Supervision by Settoducato
Plaintiff is a 71 year-old-man who worked for over thirty years with Decimal Industries, Inc. ("Decimal"). Compl. ¶ 16. He worked as a shop supervisor for twenty-two years, and as a plant manager for eight years. Id. In July of 2013, Decimal was acquired by Defendant WMI, a subsidiary of now-dismissed defendant, AIG. Id. At the time of the acquisition, Defendant Settoducato, who was the president of WMI, asked Plaintiff how long he would continue working. Plaintiff responded that he would work as long as possible, adding, "I'm still healthy." Id.
Plaintiff's complaint makes several references to a contract he was working on at Decimal and, after its acquisition, at WMI. This contract is referred to as the "Excelis Contract [job]"), and is hereinafter referred to as the "Excelis Job". While still working at the Decimal plant, Plaintiff states that he informed Settoducato that work could not begin on the Exelis Job until Settoducato "released" it. Settoducato is alleged to have failed to take the necessary step of asking the manufacturing engineer to "open" the job, which delayed the work. Upon reminding Settoducato [*6]  of the delay, Plaintiff states that he was told not to "point fingers." Id. ¶ 17.
2. Plaintiff's 2012 and 2014 Injuries
On February 24, 2012, prior to the acquisition of Decimal by WMI, Plaintiff suffered an on-the-job injury to his left shoulder. Plaintiff pursued a worker's compensation claim with respect to that injury. That claim was not resolved until May of 2014 — after Decimal was acquired by WMI.
On February 18, 2014, after the WMI acquisition, Plaintiff alleges that he suffered a second relevant on-the-job injury. Specifically, Plaintiff states that he was injured while training an employee, Joseph N. DeRosa, to work with a heavy hammer. Plaintiff states that as he struck the hammer, he felt shooting pain through the three last fingers of his left and right hands. Id. ¶ 18. Plaintiff states that he immediately notified Settoducato of the injury, and Settoducato stated that he would have an employee identified as Cheryl Sinram complete an injury report. Id.
3. Plaintiff's Complaint of Unequal Treatment
In support of his claim of unequal treatment, Plaintiff points to conduct taking place at weekly meetings and thereafter. Specifically, Plaintiff states that he commented at the meetings [*7]  that non-Decimal employees were causing a slow down because they were drinking coffee and using their cell phones instead of working. Id. ¶ 19. The Vice President, George Moles, is stated to have complimented Plaintiff on how well trained his "people" were, and repeated the compliment at other meetings in the presence of Settoducato. Id. ¶ 19.
Soon thereafter, Settoducato is alleged to have begun his mistreatment of plaintiff. Settoducato is stated to have demanded that all communication take place via email. Id. Plaintiff states that he did not receive many emails. Despite Settoducato's assurances that he would put in a repair request with the information technology department (which would take several days), Plaintiff alleges that his exclusion from meetings and emails caused him to suffer stress and anxiety. Id. ¶ 20. In addition to excluding him from meetings and email notifications, Plaintiff states that Settoducato's conduct became increasingly aggressive, severe and pervasive. Such conduct is alleged to have caused Plaintiff to lose sleep and experience stomach discomfort and headaches. Id. ¶ 22-23.
In March of 2014, Settoducato began to regularly exclude Plaintiff from weekly [*8]  meetings, and email notifications. Despite the fact that Plaintiff was responsible for production of the Excelis Job, Settoducato is alleged to have withheld information related to that job from the Plaintiff. Plaintiff states that despite this lack of communication, he completed his production work with respect thereto by the first week of May 2014. Nonetheless, the Exelis Job was delayed for weeks by different WMI departments. Id. ¶ 21.
4. Plaintiff Receives a Workers' Compensation Award
In May of 2014, Plaintiff received notification that he would receive a monetary reward in connection with his 2012 injury, which as noted, took place prior to the 2013 acquisition of Decimal by WMI. Id. ¶ 24.
5. Events of June 2014 and Plaintiff's Termination
On June 6, 2014, Settoducato granted Plaintiff's request to take one half-day vacation leave on June 20, 2014. Id. ¶ 25. On June 20, 2014, Plaintiff was informed that a morning meeting would take place; however, at 10:00 A.M., Plaintiff realized that the meeting was not going to go forward at 11:00 A.M. He therefore took the one half day vacation leave as planned. Id. ¶ 26.
On Monday morning, June 23, 2014, Settoducato informed Plaintiff that the [*9]  June 20, 2014 morning meeting had indeed taken place the previous Friday, during Plaintiff's absence. Settoducato is then alleged to have stated, "We're not clicking. We don't click," id. ¶ 28, and proceeded to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff states that he was terminated without any opportunity to provide justification as is required in the Employee Handbook. Id. ¶ 28.
Plaintiff's complaint states that following his termination, younger and less qualified individuals were promoted to assume Plaintiff's position and responsibilities. Specifically, Plaintiff points to the promotions by Settoducato of Karl Fisher (a man seventeen years younger than Plaintiff), and Joseph N. DeRosa (a man forty-seven years younger than Plaintiff). Id. ¶ 30.
B. The New York State Division of Human Rights Investigation
On November 13, 2014, plaintiff filed a Verified Complaint, Case No. 10172408, Federal Charge No. 16GB500751, with the New York State Division of Human Rights, (hereinafter referred to as the "SDHR") charging WMI with an unlawful discriminatory practice based on age and disability in violation of the NYSHRL, N.Y. Exec. Law, art. 15. Plaintiff asserts that following the SDHR Investigation [*10]  he learned that he had been demoted from the position of plant manager to foreman, excluded from email messages, and that Settaducato falsely accused Plaintiff of causing delay on the Exelis Job. Id. ¶ 32.
On or about May 15, 2015, after investigation, the SDHR determined, inter alia, that Plaintiff raised material issues of fact, and that probable cause existed to support his allegations of discrimination. See DE 1, Exhibit A.
C. Allegations as to Post-termination Acts of Retaliation
Plaintiff claims that after his termination, Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff by:
• Falsely informing New York State Unemployment that the Plaintiff was insubordinate, DE 1 ¶ 33;
• Slandering Plaintiff by referring to his "insubordination" in its January 7, 2015 letter to the Regional Director of SDHR in response to Plaintiff's charge of discrimination. Id. ¶ 38;
• Slandering Plaintiff by stating in a December 9, 2015 letter to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, that Plaintiff "was terminated on 6/23/2014 for misconduct. . ." Id ¶ 40 ;
• Continuing in their denial of workers compensation coverage and benefits submitting a barrage of contradictory insurance carrier information; to dissuade [*11]  doctors and delay treatment. Id ¶ 42;
D. Additional Alleged Wrongful Acts of Defendants
Plaintiff claims that Defendants intentionally and willfully capitalized on Plaintiff's goodwill, experience, reputation and skills by:
i. purchasing Decimal Industries, Inc. and thereby taking advantage of a workforce developed by Plaintiff as leader and supervisor for over 30 years;
ii. using the Plaintiff's goodwill, experience and reputation at Decimal to secure the Exelis Job and other "strategically important new customers";
iii. exploiting Plaintiff's management skills and leadership to developed, train and influence the WMI's plant atmosphere and workforce; and
iv. cruelly utilizing Plaintiff to teach his skills of proper machining, welding and benching to WMI employees, and his replacement.
Id ¶ 47. Plaintiff claims that based upon the above listed acts of Defendants, their financial wealth has increased at Plaintiff's expense. Id ¶ 47. Thus, Plaintiff contends he is due restitution and special damages. Plaintiff further seeks damages as a result of the stressful and anxious condition resulting from the above-summarized adverse employment actions, wrongful termination, and ongoing retaliation. [*12]  Id ¶ 48. Plaintiff asserts that as a result of Defendants' slanderous actions, his reputation in the industry has been decimated, and he was forced to take a job earning a salary fifty percent lower than the amount he earned while at Decimal. Id. ¶ 36. According to Plaintiff, employees who were not of advanced age and disabled were not subjected to the Defendants' acts of harassment, hostile work, and discriminatory practices. Id. ¶ 2.
II. The Motion to Dismiss
As this Court noted in the R&R, it would be recommending dismissal of Plaintiff's claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. Those claims are discussed further below. The Court further made clear that only claims subject to supplemental briefing (and to be disposed of in this Court's decision) will be those as to which this Court expressly reserved decision — Plaintiff's Federal and State age and disability discrimination claims (and related claims of hostile environment and retaliation) as well as Plaintiff's claim of slander. See DE 27 at 2, n. 1. To be clear, those claims, as set forth in the complaint are:
• Count I — ADA claims against WMI;
• Count II — ADEA claims against WMI;
• Count VI — Age discrimination NYEL § 296;
• Count VII [*13]  — Disability discrimination NYEL § 296;
• Count X — Intentional torts under Common Law1 (slander).

DISCUSSION
I. Legal Principles: Standards Applicable on Motions to Dismiss 12(b)(6)
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain "sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)); see also Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2010). Facial plausibility is established by pleading sufficient factual content to allow a court to reasonably infer the defendant's liability. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. at 555. Nor is a pleading that offers nothing more than "labels and conclusions" or "a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action," sufficient. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).
In addition to the Iqbal standards, a court deciding a motion to dismiss a claim of employment discrimination must consider the prima facie elements of plaintiff's case in the context of the standards and burdens set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 304, 310 (2d Cir. 2015) (Title VII); Dawson v. New York City Transit Authority, 624 Fed. Appx. 763, 2015 WL 5438790, at *2 (2d Cir. 2015). Just as the McDonnell Douglas "temporary presumption" reduces the facts a plaintiff must show to defeat a motion for summary judgment, that same presumption [*14]  "also reduces the facts needed to be pleaded under Iqbal." Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 310; see Jones v. Target Corp., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61, 2016 WL 50779, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). Thus, at the pleading stage, plaintiff is required only to allege facts to afford "plausible support" for the "reduced requirements" of the prima facie case. Jones, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61, 2016 WL 50779, at *2; see Dawson, 624 Fed. Appx. 763, 2015 WL 5438790, at *1-2; see also Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2015) ("a plaintiff is not required to plead a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas . . ." and "need only give plausible support to a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation.").
To be clear, the elements of the prima facie case are considered in the context of a motion to dismiss, not to determine whether plaintiff states a prima facie claim, but because they "provide [a helpful] outline of what is necessary to render [a plaintiff's] claims for relief plausible." Friel v. County of Nassau, 947 F. Supp. 2d 239, 251 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Sommersett v. City of New York, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71357, 2011 WL 2565301, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)).
With these standards in mind, the Court turns to outline the documents considered and to assess the viability of each of Plaintiff's remaining claims.
II. Documents Considered
As is required in the context of this motion to dismiss, and as set forth above, the factual allegations in the Complaint, though disputed by Defendant, are accepted to be true for purposes of this motion, and all reasonable inferences are drawn therefrom in favor of the Plaintiff.
While facts to consider [*15]  in the context of a Rule 12 motion to dismiss are generally limited to those set forth in the pleadings, a court may consider matters outside of the pleadings when determining, for purposes of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, whether subject matter jurisdiction exists. M.E.S., Inc. v. Snell, 712 F.3d 666, 671 (2d Cir. 2013); Romano v. Kazacos, 609 F.3d 512, 520 (2d Cir. 2010); Morrison v. Nat'l Australia Bank Ltd., 547 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2008) aff'd, 561 U.S. 247, 130 S. Ct. 2869, 177 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2010).
Additionally, in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider: (1) documents attached to the Complaint as exhibits or incorporated by reference therein; (2) matters of which judicial notice may be taken; or (3) documents upon the terms and effect of which the Complaint "relies heavily" and which are, thus, rendered "integral" to the Complaint. Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152-53 (2d Cir. 2002); see International Audiotext Network, Inc. v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir. 1995). Moreover, "[a] court may take judicial notice of a document filed in another court not for the truth of the matters asserted in the other litigation, but rather to establish the fact of such litigation and related filings." Glob. Network Commc'ns, Inc. v. City of New York, 458 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Int'l Star Class Yacht Racing Ass'n v. Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc., 146 F.3d 66, 70 (2d Cir.1998)).
Prior to instituting this lawsuit, Plaintiff filed an administrative claims of employment discrimination (the "Administrative Charge") with the New York State Division of Human Rights (the "NYSDHR"). Decisions rendered in connection with the Administrative Charge and documents filed thereunder are annexed as extensive exhibits to Plaintiff's motion. Such [*16]  documents are public and referenced in Plaintiff's Complaint. There is no question as to his notice thereof. These documents are properly considered in the context of the present motion to dismiss. See Morris v. David Lerner Associates, 680 F. Supp. 2d 430, 436 (E.D.N.Y. 2010); Muhammad v. New York City Transit Authority, 450 F. Supp. 2d 198, 204-205 (E.D.N.Y. 2006); see also James v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43493, 2005 WL 1889859, at * 1 n. 2 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that a court may take judicial notice of an EEOC charge). Plaintiff has submitted multiple documents in connection with his motion in opposition. See DE 23, Exhibits A — Y. The Court will consider only the documents that are either referenced by the Complaint or incorporated in the Complaint. See Arnold v. Research Found. for State Univ. of N.Y., 216 F. Supp. 3d 275 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). Those documents include prior New York State Workers' Compensation claims, Compl. ¶ 2; Employee Handbook, Compl. ¶ 2; Letters dated 1/7/15 and 12/9/15, Compl. ¶ 2; Monetary Award, Compl. ¶ 31; Newsday Article, Compl. ¶ 44; Requests for Workers' Compensation coverage, Compl. ¶ 54.
III. Dismissal of Claims of Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit
During the oral argument on June 7, 2017, this Court made clear that based upon the uncontroverted fact that Plaintiff was an at-will employee, it would be recommending dismissal of Plaintiff's state law claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The Court turns to explain the reasons for recommending dismissal of those claims.
Under New York Law, quantum [*17]  meruit and unjust enrichment are not separate claims. As such, the Court will analyze both claims together as a single claim. See Mid-Hudson Catskill Rural Migrant Ministry, Inc. v. Fine Host Corp., 418 F.3d 168 (2d. Cir. 2005); see also Int'l Techs. Mktg., Inc. v. Verint Sys., Ltd., 157 F. Supp. 3d 352, 370 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). To successfully state a claim of quantum meruit under New York Law a plaintiff must establish "(1) the performance of services in good faith, (2) the acceptance of the services by the person to whom they are rendered, (3) an expectation of compensation therefor, and (4) the reasonable value of the services." Learning Annex Holdings, LLC v. Cashflow Techs., Inc., 652 F. App'x 67, 70 (2d Cir. 2016)(quoting Mid—Hudson Catskill Rural Migrant Ministry, Inc. v. Fine Host Corp., 418 F.3d 168, 175 (2d Cir. 2005)). In order to state a claim of unjust enrichment under New York Law, a Plaintiff must establish "(1) that the defendant was enriched; (2) that the enrichment was at the plaintiff's expense; and (3) that the circumstances are such that in equity and good conscience the defendant should return the money or property to the plaintiff." Shearon v. Comfort Tech Mech. Co., 936 F. Supp. 2d 143, 153 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Golden Pac. Bancorp v. F.D.I.C., 273 F.3d 509, 519 (2d Cir. 2001). However, even though "the elements of Plaintiff's unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims are distinct, for all intents and purposes, the claims are indistinguishable." Shearon, 936 F. Supp. 2d at 153.
There is no question but that plaintiff was a salaried, at-will employee and that there was no employment contract between him and any Defendant. A salaried employee may not circumvent the employment-at-will doctrine [*18]  by making claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. See Freedman v. Pearlman, 271 A.D.2d 301, 304, 706 N.Y.S.2d 405, 408 (2000). Instead, to recover on such claims, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he has not already been reasonably compensated for his work. Lamb v. Money Transfer Sys., Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132007, 2013 WL 5216442, at *12 (W.D.N.Y. 2013) (dismissing at-will employee's claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment under New York Law when "the pleading [did] not plausibly allege that Plaintiff performed work that exceeded the scope of his duties"). Plaintiff attempts to support a finding that he was not reasonably compensated by pointing to WMI's statement to the SDHR, in which it stated that Plaintiff was compensated as a "foreman." Plaintiff appears to be arguing that because Plaintiff was hired as a "Plant Manager," and had the duties of a Plant Manager, he was inadequately compensated because his title was changed to foreman. DE 21-1 at 20-21. Plaintiff's argument lends no support to his claims. That is because Plaintiff does not allege that any or all of the services he provided did not fall within the contemplated duties of his employment, or that he was not paid his negotiated salary. In contrast, Plaintiff claims he was unaware that his title was changed until he read the SDHR report. Compl. ¶ 32, DE 1. As such, there [*19]  can be no argument that his duties were anything other than those duties contemplated upon his employment with the company.
In summary, Plaintiff's complaint and concessions made at oral argument make clear that he was a salaried employee. See Compl. ¶ 36, DE 1. He does not allege that Defendants failed to compensate him for work performed, nor does he point to any controlling sources that support his claims of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. Accordingly, this Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment be granted. See Lamb, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132007, 2013 WL 5216442, at *12; see also Kidz Cloz, Inc. v. Officially for Kids, Inc., 320 F. Supp. 2d 164, 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (dismissing claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment on the basis that the relationship was terminable at-will).
IV. Disposition of the Motion to Dismiss Claims as to which Decision was Reserved
A. Age Discrimination
1. Legal Principles: Discrimination
A prima facie case of age discrimination under the ADEA requires a plaintiff to plausibly plead: (1) that plaintiff was within the protected age group, (2) plaintiff's qualification for the position, (3) adverse employment action, and (4) that such action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. [*20]  Powell v. Delta Airlines, 145 F. Supp. 3d 189, 199 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 106 (2d Cir. 2010)). As to the element of causation, a plaintiff alleging age discrimination must show that the alleged adverse employment action would not have occurred but-for the plaintiff's age. Vega, 801 F.3d at 86 (quoting Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 177, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009)).
In light of these prima facie elements, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss an age discrimination claim must be denied if plaintiff plausibly alleges that that "age was the 'but-for' cause of the adverse action." Marcus v. Leviton Mfg. Co., Inc., 661 F. App'x 29, 31-32 (2d Cir. 2016). Id. (plaintiff's pleading must give "'plausible support to a minimal inference' of the requisite discriminatory causality") (quoting Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 310-11 (2d Cir. 2015). To satisfy this burden, a plaintiff may not set forth legal conclusions, but must instead provide sufficient factual allegations. Id. Thus, in the context of a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, the Court must determine whether the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts "to plausibly support a minimal inference of 'but-for' causality between his age and his termination." Marcus, 661 F. App'x at 32.
Replacement of a terminated employee with an employee outside of Plaintiff's protected class can raise the requisite "inference of discrimination." Franchino v. Terence Cardinal Cook Health Care Ctr., Inc., 692 Fed. Appx. 39, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 9756, 2017 WL 2392473, at *2 (2d Cir. 2017); see also Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 312-13. Indeed, the Second Circuit has held "[A] plaintiff has demonstrated an inference of age discrimination and thus established a prima facie case [*21]  ... where the majority of plaintiff's responsibilities were transferred to a younger co-worker." Carlton v. Mystic Transp., Inc., 202 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). Testa v. Carefusion, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101204, 2016 WL 4099113, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) ("replacement of a plaintiff by a significantly younger employee may support an inference of discrimination") (collecting cases); see also Franchino, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 9756, 2017 WL 2392473, at *2.
2. Legal Principles: New York State Law Claims of Discrimination
Since Plaintiff here raises parallel NYSHRL claims, it is important to note that such state law claims "are analyzed under the same standard as discrimination claims brought under the ADEA." Powell, 145 F. Supp. 3d at 198; Marcus, 661 Fed. Appx 29 at 32; Russo v. New York Presbyterian Hosp., 972 F. Supp. 2d 429, 449 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) ("NYSHRL hostile work environment claims are analyzed under the same standard as Title VII hostile work environment claims").
While the elements of the prima facie cases are the same, the NYSHRL, unlike the ADEA, permits liability to be imposed upon individual defendants. Such liability is imposed upon (1) a showing that the individual has an ownership interest in the business or is a supervisor that can make hiring and firing decisions, and (2) that the individual defendant aided and abetted the illegal discriminatory actions. E.E.O.C. v. Suffolk Laundry Servs., Inc., 48 F. Supp. 3d 497, 523 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1317 (2d Cir. 1995) and N.Y. Exec. Law § 296).
3. The Parties' Positions
At the outset, the Court notes that there is no issue as to Plaintiff's membership in a protected class, or the fact that he [*22]  suffered adverse employment action. In support of their motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's allegation that he was replaced by two younger employees is insufficient to plausibly allege a claim of discrimination pursuant to either his Federal or State law claims of age discrimination. DE 20 at 13. Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to plead "any facts to support the claim that his alleged replacements were put in their respective positions because they were younger than him, or any other evidence that would permit an inference that his termination was motivated by age-based bias." DE 20 at 13.
For his part, Plaintiff asserts that such claims are adequately pled. In particular, Plaintiff responds by relying primarily on three factual allegation to support an inference "that he was terminated from his position as Plant Manager due to his age." DE 21-1 at 16. First, Plaintiff asserts that although there were older more qualified employees, Settoducato promoted Karl Fisher, a man seventeen years younger than Plaintiff, and Joseph N. DeRosa, a man forty-seven years younger than Plaintiff, to Plaintiff's position with increases in their salaries. Id. ¶ 30.
Second, Plaintiff [*23]  points to the NYSDHR investigation to support the contention that Defendants' reason for terminating Plaintiff (his insubordination) was nothing more than a pretext. Plaintiff argues that the NYSDHR investigation revealed Settoducato's inconsistent testimony regarding his explanation that Plaintiff's termination for insubordination with respect to the leave taken in June of 2014. Thus, Plaintiff notes that while Settoducato averred that Plaintiff was terminated for insubordination as a result of leaving early on June 20, 2014, he also stated that he may have approved of that leave. DE 21-1, page 16. In final support of the adequacy of his pleading, Plaintiff relies on the SDHR conclusion that probable cause existed to support the allegations of discrimination made to that agency.
4. The Motion to Dismiss the Claim of Age Discrimination is Denied
Plaintiff's allegations as set forth above, in conjunction with an issue of fact as to Defendants' claim of Plaintiff's insubordination, lead this Court to conclude that Plaintiff has plausibly pled facts sufficient to support the required "minimal inference of 'but-for' causality between his age and his termination," Marcus, 661 F. App'x at 32. Although such allegations [*24]  may not survive a motion for summary judgment, or carry the day at trial, the Court holds that Plaintiff has met the minimal burden required at this stage of the litigation. It is therefore recommended that the motion to dismiss all claims of age discrimination be denied.
B. Disability Discrimination
At the oral argument held on June 7, 2017, the Court obtained clarification as to the alleged bases for Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination. It is now clear that the Plaintiff's claim of actual disability relates to an alleged injury to the Plaintiff's hands that occurred in February 2014. His perceived disability claim relates to the injury suffered in 2012, and an alleged perception of disability arising from the May 2014 worker's compensation award with respect to that injury. Plaintiff also claims that he suffered retaliation in violation of Federal and State disability discrimination laws.
1. Legal Principles
The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, [*25]  and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To establish a prima facie case of unlawful disability discrimination, a plaintiff must show that "(1) the defendant is covered by the ADA; (2) plaintiff suffers from or is regarded as suffering from a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (3) plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability or perceived disability." Horsham v. Fresh Direct, 136 F. Supp. 3d 253, 261-62 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Kinneary v. City of New York, 601 F.3d 151, 155-56 (2d Cir. 2010).
Similar to the parallel analysis of his Federal and State age discrimination claims, Plaintiff's Federal and State law disability claims are analyzed under the same standards. See Trane v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 94 F. Supp. 3d 367, 376 (E.D.N.Y. 2015), aff'd, 639 F. App'x 50 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 619, 196 L. Ed. 2d 530 (2017) (citation omitted).
i. Disability Within the Meaning of the ADA
As defined by the ADA, a disability is: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Horsham v. Fresh Direct, 136 F. Supp. 3d 253, 262 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). "[M]ajor life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, [*26]  breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102. However, "[a]n impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting." Parada v. Banco Indus. De Venezuela, C.A., 753 F.3d 62, 69 n. 3 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii))).
Even without a disability, a plaintiff may nevertheless prevail under this statute upon a showing that he was subjected to an action prohibited under the ADA because of a "perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102. Thus, a plaintiff need not establish that the "impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. § 12102; see also Millman v. CVS Caremark, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150488, 2015 WL 6760204, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2015).
ii. Proving ADA Causation
The final element of a prima facie case of discrimination requires plaintiff to show that the adverse action alleged took place as a result of the alleged disability. See Sherman v. County of Suffolk, 71 F. Supp. 3d 332, 344 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). In the context of the ADA causation, it is an open question in this Circuit whether discriminatory animus need be a "motivating factor" or a "but-for" cause of the employer's decision to take adverse employment action. Vale v. Great Neck Water Pollution Control Dist., 80 F. Supp. 3d 426, 437 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). "As with traditional ADA discrimination claims, the Second Circuit has not [*27]  yet articulated what standard now applies for ADA retaliation claims in light of Gross and Nassar." Vale, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 439 (quoting Sherman, 71 F. Supp. 3d at 353, 2014 WL 7370033, at *18); see also Eisner v. Cardozo, 684 F. App'x 29, 30, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 5189 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that there is an "unsettled question of law in this Circuit" on whether a plaintiff alleging an ADA retaliation claim is required to show that the "retaliation was a 'but-for' cause of the termination or merely a 'motivating factor.'").
2. The Parties' Positions
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination fail because he has neither plausibly alleged he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA (or State law), nor that he was terminated from his employment because of any such "disability." DE 20, page 10-11. In response, Plaintiff asserts (1) that he has adequately alleged a disability pursuant to the ADA, and (2) that Defendants had knowledge of such disability. Plaintiff further relies on the short temporal period between his 2014 receipt of a monetary workers' compensation award for his 2012 work-related injury, and his termination to demonstrate a causal connection of adverse employment based upon perceived disability discrimination. DE 21, page 14. In support of his retaliation claim, Plaintiff argues whether or not [*28]  he was disabled, he engaged in ADA-protected activity (as described below) that is sufficient to plausibly state a claim under the ADA and the NYSHRL. DE 20, pages 17-19.
3. The Motion to Dismiss the Claims of Disability Discrimination is Granted
i. The Claim of Actual Disability
Plaintiff claims that at all relevant times he has been a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he sustained severe injuries to the middle, ring and small fingers triggers of both hands that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. DE 1 ¶ 50. Aside from this conclusory statement, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts that would allow the Court to draw an inference that his "disability" substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Indeed, the complaint fails to allege how the injuries to his hands impacted his life activities in any way during the time period he was employed by Defendants. Although the Complaint makes clear the allegation, accepted as true at this stage of the proceedings, that Defendants were aware that Plaintiff injured himself at work, there are no factual allegations alleged which would [*29]  provide a basis to find that Defendants' believed such injury to be anything other than transient, which cannot support a claim that the Plaintiff was disabled. See Balgley v. New York City Health and Hosps. Corp., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3584, 2017 WL 95114, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (noting that Courts within the Second Circuit and "the vast majority of courts elsewhere . . . have held that temporary disabilities do not trigger the protections of the ADA because individuals with temporary injuries are not disabled persons within the meaning of the act") (citations omitted). Indeed, Plaintiff additionally asserts that he had perfect attendance for the last year because he used his personal time for any doctor appointments or sick time. The failure of Plaintiff to allege such factual allegations prevents the Court from holding that Plaintiff has properly pled that he is disabled pursuant to the ADA. Dechberry v. N.Y.C. Fire Dep't, 124 F. Supp. 3d 131, 151 (E.D.N.Y. 2015).
To the extent that Plaintiff's supplemental motion can be construed as asserting discrimination under the ADA based upon a failure to accommodate, the Court finds any such argument to be meritless. Plaintiff characterizes the Defendants' denial of a half day of vacation time as a "refusal to accommodate." Pl. Sup. Mem. at 6. The Court notes that Plaintiff's own motion papers make clear that he did not tell [*30]  Defendants why he was seeking to take a half day leave on June 20, 2014, DE 21-1, page 16. Thus, his request for a half day of time off does not supply a basis for Defendants' knowledge of any "disability," and the refusal of such vacation time can certainly cannot constitute a refusal to accommodate. Plaintiff nonetheless argues that although he did not disclose what his vacation time was needed for, Defendants' actions can constitute a refusal to accommodate "because in certain circumstances, an employer is required [emphasis added] to act proactively and engage in an interactive process to accommodate the disability of an employee even if the employee does not request accommodation [emphasis added]." DE 35 at 7 (citing McElwee v. County of Orange, 700 F.3d 635, 641-42 (2d Cir. 2012).
As the Plaintiff has failed to set forth any facts that in support of a claim that there was reason to engage in any such interactive process of accommodation, no such "circumstances" existed in this case and the Court finds Plaintiff's "interactive process" argument to be completely inapposite to the facts herein. In sum, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that his request for a half day of vacation was, in any way, a violation of [*31]  any failure to accommodate.
Finally, Plaintiff alleges no facts in plausible support of the notion that his termination was in any way related to any disability. To survive a motion to dismiss a Plaintiff must, as noted show that he was terminated as a result of an alleged disability. Plaintiff makes no such plausible allegation. Therefore, regardless of whether the Court applies the "motivating factor" or "but for" standard to establish causation under the ADA, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts from which a factfinder could infer that any adverse actions were taken against Plaintiff on the basis of his disability.
ii. The Claim of Perceived Disability
The Court now turns to analyze whether Plaintiff has alleged factual allegations to support his claim of perceived disability, i.e., whether the facts alleged raise a plausible inference that during his employment Plaintiff was regarded as having a physical impairment that falls within the scope of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102.
As noted above, Plaintiff was given an opportunity to supplement his argument in support of the Plaintiff's perceived disability claim. See Plaintiff's Supplemental Memo in Support of Perceived Disability [*32]  ("Pl. Sup. Mem."). In his supplement, Plaintiff argues that the Defendants were aware of his prior 2012 shoulder injury, and that he was therefore perceived as disabled. Plaintiff attempts to support this argument by pointing to the fact that in Defendants' response to NYSDHR Complaint, it stated "When WMI purchased Decimal it retained all of Decimal employees and all employees were integrated in WMI with their seniority intact, including Mr. Prisco." Pl. Sup. Mem. at 4. Plaintiff argues that since WMI retained the employees, it must have retained the workers compensation records of its employees, including those of Mr. Prisco, and upon review of such documents Defendants became aware of his disability. Id. Plaintiff also supports his argument by citing to the Defendants' letter to New York State Workers' compensation in which WMI stated, "Further, it should be noted that, upon information and belief, the claimant has another claim for CTS under WCB#G0195981, and there may be no new injury on the date in question." Id. at 9. Thus, Plaintiff argues that Defendants' claim that it was unaware Mr. Prisco had filed a workers' compensation claim is completely disingenuous. Id. According to Plaintiff, [*33]  such knowledge creates an inference that Defendants perceived Plaintiff as disabled.
Viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, it can be inferred only that Defendants were aware that Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim for a shoulder injury that occurred on February 24, 2012, over a year before the Defendants acquired Decimal. However, that knowledge does not support Plaintiff's claim that Defendants perceived Plaintiff to be disabled under the ADA based upon his shoulder injury, or that Defendants discriminated against him due to a perceived disability. To the contrary, if Defendants were aware of his disability upon acquiring Decimal as Plaintiff claims, it is certainly less likely that he would have been retained and, as Plaintiff argues, relied upon to play a key role in the organization moving forward. As Plaintiff alleges, he was hired and retained by WMI upon its acquisition of Decimal, where he continued to work until June of 2014. Plaintiff's factual allegations thus supports only an inference that Defendant either did not perceive Plaintiff to be disabled based upon his shoulder injury, and/or that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff [*34]  due to a perceived disability. See Glidden v. Cty. of Monroe, 950 F. Supp. 73, 77, n.4 (W.D.N.Y. 1997) ("the fact that [defendant] hired plaintiff for a full-time LPN position with full knowledge of plaintiff's previous "nervous breakdown" undercuts plaintiffs claim of discrimination and suggests that [defendant] does not discriminate against individuals with previous mental impairments").
Moreover, nothing in the Complaint supports any inference that Defendants treated Plaintiff adversely because of a perceived disability. Plaintiff's conclusory statement that employees who were not disabled were not subjected to the Defendants' discriminatory practices, DE 1 ¶ 2, is without any factual support. Plaintiff does not allege, for example, any examples of other non-disabled employees given preferential treatment.
The fact that Plaintiff received a 2014 notification that he was entitled to a monetary award for an injury obtained in 2012 does not, by itself, create an inference that the Defendants regarded him as disabled under the ADA. "While this may establish that [Defendant] was aware that Plaintiff had injured his [shoulder] in the past, it does not establish that [Defendant] perceived Plaintiff as still having an impairment." Castagnozzi v. Phoenix Beverages, Inc., 208 F. Supp. 3d 461, 475 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). For the foregoing reasons, [*35]  Plaintiff has failed to plausibly state a claim of perceived disability discrimination. See Sibilla v. Follett Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46255, 2012 WL 1077655, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding that as plaintiffs did not demonstrate that defendants regarded them as disabled within the meaning of the ADA, Plaintiff did not establish membership in a protected class in connection with their disability claim).
Even if Plaintiff plausibly alleged actual or perceived disability under the ADA, his claim would nonetheless be subject to dismissal because Plaintiff has failed to plausibly create an inference of causation. Plaintiff's only allegation to support any such theory argues that "shortly after discovery of the plaintiff's workers 'compensation award, the defendants terminated the plaintiff's employment . . . ." Compl. ¶ 2. This allegation is completely conclusory and lacks the factual support to raise a plausible inference of causation.
As Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege that he had a disability under the ADA, or that he was regarded as having a physical impairment that falls within the scope of the relevant statutes, or that he was in any way treated adversely as a result of such disabilities, the Court recommends that his claims of disability discrimination under [*36]  the ADA and NYSHRL be dismissed.
iii. The Claim of Retaliation
The final branch of Plaintiff's disability claim alleges retaliation. To successfully state such a claim under the ADA and/or the NYSHRL, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) [he engaged in protected activity; (2) defendant was aware of the activity; (3) an adverse employment action; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Caputo v. Copiague Union Free Sch. Dist., 218 F. Supp. 3d 186, 194 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (citing Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 287 F.3d 138, 149 (2d Cir. 2002); Sarno v. Douglas Elliman—Gibbons & Ives, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 1999)).
In support of the motion to dismiss, Defendants assert that any claim of retaliation must be dismissed for failure to plausibly allege that Plaintiff engaged in any activity protected under the ADA or the NYSHRL.
Plaintiff asserts that he engaged in three protected activities. These activities are (1) taking earned vacation leave; (2) exercising the right to collect workers' compensation; (3) the right to be gainfully employed at 70 years old. Pl. Mot. in Opp. at 23, DE 21-1. For the reasons set forth below, the Court holds that none of these activities to constitute "protected activity" under the ADA and that therefore Plaintiff fails to state a plausible claim of retaliation.
First, any argument that Plaintiff's earned [*37]  vacation leave constitutes a protected activity under the ADA is meritless. As noted above, Plaintiff merely asked for, and was granted, a half day off. There is no indication that he asked for such leave as an accommodation for any disability. Accordingly, the taking of such leave, cannot under the circumstances in this matter constitute protected activity under the ADA or its parallel New York state statute.
Plaintiff's second allegation of protected activity, i.e., that he collected (or attempted) to collect a workers' compensation award, is the only allegation that comes close to constituting a protected activity. However, that claim, too, must fail. The Second Circuit has made clear that such activity is not protected under the ADA or NYSHRL. See Bennett v. Project Renewal, Inc., 627 F. App'x 29, 31 (2d Cir. 2015) ("discrimination and retaliation based on [] filing of a workers' compensation claim do not allege membership in any class or engagement in any activity protected by Title VII or the ADA") (citing Reynolds v. American Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 154 (4th Cir. 2012) ("Filing a workers' compensation claim is not something that is covered by the ADA....")).
Indeed, New York Workers' Compensation Law provides an "exclusive remed[y]" to employees for retaliation and discrimination for seeking workers' compensation." [*38]  Rivers v. New York City Hous. Auth., 176 F. Supp. 3d 229, 255 (E.D.N.Y. 2016), aff'd sub nom. Crenshaw v. New York City Hous. Auth., 697 Fed. Appx. 726, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 11029, 2017 WL 2644637 (2d Cir. June 20, 2017) (citing Ridgway v. Metro. Museum of Art, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27007, 2007 WL 1098737, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); see N.Y. Workers' comp. Law § 120 (McKinney) (anti-retaliation provision making it unlawful to discriminate against employee who "has claimed or attempted to claim compensation from his employer, and providing a tow year statute of limitations for alleging such claim). Thus, any claims of retaliation for pursuing a Worker's Compensation claim is properly presented to the Workers' Compensation Board for determination, and not to this Court.
Even if filing a Worker's Compensation claim were covered by the ADA, Plaintiff has failed to plausibly create an inference Defendants knowledge that Plaintiff was awarded the compensation was causally related to his termination. Plaintiff's only allegation to support such a theory argues that "shortly after discovery of the plaintiff's workers 'compensation award, the defendants terminated the plaintiff's employment . . . ." Compl. ¶ 2. This allegation is completely conclusory and lacks the factual support to raise a plausible inference of causation.
Finally, the Court rejects the notion that attaining the age of 70 somehow constitutes protected activity under the ADA. While there is no question that Plaintiff is in a protected [*39]  group due to his age, (which is required to establish a claim of age discrimination), Plaintiff has not alleged facts or legal authority to support the conclusion that "being gainfully employed at 70 years old" is protected activity.
Although not clearly argued by Plaintiff, to the extent that he attempts to support his claim of retaliation by pointing to Defendants' statements to the (i) the New York Department of Labor in proceedings regarding Plaintiff's unemployment benefits, (ii) the New York Workers' Compensation Board; and (iii) the New York State Division of Human Rights, such attempts must fail. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 32-33, 35, 38, 40, 41. That is because, as discussed below, such actions are privileged, and cannot properly form the basis of Plaintiff's retaliation claim.
For the reasons set forth above, this Court recommends that the motion to denial of Plaintiff's retaliation claims.
C. Hostile Environment
1. Legal Principles
A claim of a hostile working environment is properly supported by plausibly pleading that alleged harassment was "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir.1997) (internal citations [*40]  and quotation marks omitted); see Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 373 (2d Cir. 2002) ("plaintiff must show that the workplace was so severely permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that the terms and conditions of her employment were thereby altered") (citing Leibovitz v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 252 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir. 2001)); see also Brennan v. Metro. Opera Ass'n, Inc., 192 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir. 1999).
A plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment "must demonstrate either that a single incident was extraordinarily severe, or that a series of incidents were 'sufficiently continuous and concerted' to have altered the conditions of her working environment." Cruz v. Coach Stores, Inc., 202 F.3d 560, 570 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Perry, 115 F.3d at 149). To decide whether the threshold has been reached, courts examine and evaluate case-specific circumstances in their totality. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). Relevant factors to consider include "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Id.; see also Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 373-74 (2d Cir. 2002); Cruz, 202 F.3d at 570, Skates v. Inc. Vill. of Freeport, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16564, 2016 WL 1459659, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49634, 2016 WL 1452391 (E.D.N.Y. 2016).
2. The Motion to Dismiss Any Hostile Environment Claim is Granted
Whether alleged pursuant to a Federal or State claim of age or disability discrimination, the Court makes clear that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden in plausibly pleading [*41]  a hostile working environment. Plaintiff's allegations of adverse treatment, which consist of exclusion from meetings and failures to receive emails, do not rise to the level required to plausibly allege such a claim. Indeed, his complaint refers to nothing more than a handful of arguably negative isolated incidents that come nowhere near the level of conduct necessary to state a hostile environment cause of action. See Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 373-74 (2d Cir. 2002); see also Skates v. Inc. Vill. of Freeport, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16564, 2016 WL 1459659, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49634, 2016 WL 1452391 (E.D.N.Y. 2016); Russo v. New York Presbyterian Hosp., 972 F. Supp. 2d 429, 449 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) ("NYSHRL hostile work environment claims are analyzed under the same standard as Title VII hostile work environment claims"). Accordingly, any claim of a hostile working environment is recommended to be dismissed.
D. State Law Claim of Slander
The final claim to be discussed in the context of the present motion is Plaintiff's state law claim of slander. The allegedly slanderous statement alleged in support of this claim are statements to (i) the New York Department of Labor in proceedings regarding Plaintiff's unemployment benefits, (ii) the New York Workers' Compensation Board; and (iii) the New York State Division of Human Rights (in response to Plaintiff's employment discrimination claim). According to Plaintiff such [*42]  statements constitute libel, slander, and false words. Defendants assert that such statements are privileged and, therefore, cannot form the basis of an action for intentional tortious claims. DE 20 at 15, 18. Plaintiff cites to absolutely no authority to support his claim of defamation, but only claims that equity and conscience require restitution and special damages. DE 20 at 19.
The Court agrees with Defendants. Indeed, "New York State laws 'litigation privilege' provides that '[s]tatements made by parties, attorneys, and witnesses in the course of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding are absolutely privileged, notwithstanding the motive with which they are made, so long as they are material and pertinent to the issue to be resolved in the proceeding.'" Officemax Inc. v. Cinotti, 966 F. Supp. 2d 74, 79 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Bisogno v. Borsa, 101 A.D.3d 780, 781, 954 N.Y.S.2d 896, 896 (2d Dep't 2012) (citing Kilkenny v. Law Off. of Cushner & Garvey, LLP, 76 A.D.3d 512, 513, 905 N.Y.S.2d 661, 662 (2d Dep't 2010)). Thus, statements are protected if they "may possibly be pertinent" to a proceeding. Id. (citations omitted). Such privilege is absolute and "has been applied not only to statements made in pleadings and in court, but also to statements made in ... letters between attorneys and parties ... [and] during offers of settlement by attorneys." Aequitron Med., Inc. v. Dyro, 999 F. Supp. 294, 298 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (citing O'Brien v. Alexander, 898 F. Supp. 162, 171 (S.D.N.Y.1995)). The privilege extends to judicial proceedings and administrative proceedings [*43]  where "public interests are at stake." Rosenberg v. MetLife, Inc., 8 N.Y.3d 359, 365, 866 N.E.2d 439, 834 N.Y.S.2d 494 (2007).
The New York State Division of Human Rights, the Department of Labor, and the Workers' Compensation Board are all quasi-judicial in nature. As such, statements made to those tribunals throughout an investigation cannot form the basis of a defamation action. Rock v. Mustich, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66900, 2009 WL 2391776, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) ("it is well settled that statements made to the New York State Division of Human Rights in the course of an investigation cannot subject the declarant to liability for defamation"); see also Blige v. City Univ. of New York, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354, 2017 WL 498580, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), report and recommendation adopted by, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40928, 2017 WL 1064716 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (stating that a "defamation claim based upon statements made to the DOL, [] would nevertheless still fail because communications with the DOL are subject to an absolute privilege under New York law"); Burnett v. Trinity Inst. Homer Perkins Ctr., Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6872, 2011 WL 281023, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. 2011) (finding as a "matter of law that the predicate oral and written statements made by [defendants] are entitled to absolute immunity as they were all made in the course of proceedings held by ACDSS, Department of Labor, and NYSDHR); Calderon v. Dinan & Dinan PC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39024, 2006 WL 1646157, at *9 (D. Conn. June 2006) (finding workers' compensation hearings are quasi-judicial in nature).
Here, all of the Defendants' statements and/or actions that Plaintiff cites as the basis for his so-called 'intentional torts' of libel, slander, and false words are [*44]  actions that were taken by the Defendants in the defense of administrative proceedings that were initiated against them by the Plaintiff in quasi-judicial tribunals. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41. Thus, the Court recommends Plaintiff's intentional tort claim be dismissed.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court respectfully recommends that:
• Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted to the extent (1) that all claims of disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA and NYSHRL be dismissed, (2) that the claim of intentional torts under New York State Common Law be dismissed, (3) that any claim of retaliation be dismissed, (4) that any claim of hostile work environment be dismissed, and (5) that Plaintiff's claims of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment be dismissed.
• The Court recommends denial of the Motion to Dismiss with regard to Plaintiff's claim of age discrimination in violation of the ADEA and NYSHRL.
