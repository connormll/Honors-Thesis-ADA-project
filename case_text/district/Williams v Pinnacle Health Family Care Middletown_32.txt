REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
Pending before the court is the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all four counts of the plaintiff's complaint. (Doc. 30). The plaintiff, Debra Williams, brought the instant suit against Pinnacle Health Family Care Middletown and Pinnacle Health Medical Services (collectively "Pinnacle"), alleging violations of her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2611, et seq., the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 951 et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111, et seq. Williams contends that Pinnacle failed to reinstate her employment following her use of FMLA leave in violation of the statute. Relatedly, Williams asserts that the defendants retaliated against her for using her protected leave by terminating her employment. Further, Williams argues that the defendants discriminated against her due to her disability and [*2]  failed to make reasonable accommodations for her to return to work in violation of the ADA and the PHRA.
The defendants dispute these claims, arguing that Williams exhausted her FMLA leave and that she has failed to establish a causal relationship between her termination and the use of her FMLA leave. Pinnacle argues that they granted Williams the full amount of FMLA leave required by law and at the end of her leave, she was not medically cleared by her doctor to return to work, with or without accommodations. Additionally, Pinnacle maintains that Williams provided no evidence that she was qualified to return to work at the end of her leave. Therefore, the defendants assert Williams' employment was terminated simply because she was not medically cleared to return, and because she had exhausted her statutorily protected leave.
After a review of the record, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, we will recommend that the defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted.

II. BACKGROUND
Williams began work at Pinnacle as a medical assistant [*3]  in 2004 and continued through the date of her termination in 2017. (Doc. 1, P 10). She utilized FMLA leave six times while employed by Pinnacle before June 13, 2016, when the leave at issue in this suit began. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 18-37). At this time, the plaintiff was diagnosed with bladder cancer and requested six weeks of intermittent FMLA leave to undergo treatment. (Doc. 1, PP 13-14). Pinnacle granted this request without issue and Williams was approved for 480 hours of intermittent leave. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit F).
In January 2017, Williams' doctor found that her cancer had not responded to treatment and that additional treatment, including surgery, was required. (Doc. 1, PP 17-18). Accordingly, Williams submitted a request to Pinnacle for a continuous leave of absence under the FMLA from February 2017 to May of 2017. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 52-55; Exhibit I). Williams' doctor submitted a "Certification of Health Care Provider" form to the defendant indicating that she would be unable to return to work until May 20, 2017. (Id.) The plaintiff's request for leave was approved on February 1, 2017, but Pinnacle informed Williams that she was only eligible for 122.25 hours of [*4]  job-protected leave as of January 31, 2017, since she had already used 357.75 hours. (Id., Exhibit K). Thus, Williams' FMLA-approved leave was scheduled from February 20 to March 13. (Id., Exhibit J).
On or around March 10, 2017, the office manager for Pinnacle, Sharon DeSantis, called Williams for an update on her condition and expected return to work date. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 57-58). At that time, Williams informed DeSantis that she would know more after an upcoming appointment with her treating physician, and DeSantis advised her that she would need to submit an updated Medical Certification to her employer. (Id.) Following the appointment, Williams informed DeSantis that her doctor would not yet release her to return to work. (Id.) Additionally, her doctor did not prepare an updated Medical Certification form for Williams to submit to Pinnacle at that time. (Id.)
On March 20, 2017, DeSantis wrote Williams a letter again alerting her that she would need to submit an updated Medical Certification form, as her current form indicated that she needed to be out until May 20, 2017 (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit M)— approximately two months after her remaining FMLA time expired. In this letter, [*5]  DeSantis also informed Williams that she would be granted additional job-protected time off in the form of personal leave.1 This personal leave extended from March 13, 2017 to April 10, 2017. (Id.) The March 20 letter also informed Williams that if she was still unable to attend work by April 11, she needed to send Pinnacle an updated Medical Certification form. (Id.)
At an April 7, 2017 doctor's appointment, Williams' doctor determined that she was too ill to return to work and ordered her immediate hospitalization due to severe dehydration. (Doc 1, PP 19-21). Thus, at that time, Williams was not cleared to return to work in any capacity. (Id.) Williams called Pinnacle on April 11, 2017 to notify her employer of her condition and indicated that despite her current hospitalization, she was hopeful to return to work in a restricted capacity "within a few days," though the defendants do not recall this statement. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit C, at 27). DeSantis reminded the plaintiff again that an updated Medical Certification form clearing her to return to work was required to continue her employment. Williams failed to make the necessary update to her Medical Certification. (Id., Exhibit A, [*6]  at 60-61).
On April 19, 2017, Williams was informed that her employment with Pinnacle was terminated effective April 14, 2017 because she was not cleared to return to work by her doctor, and by her own admission on the April 11 phone call with DeSantis, she was unable to return. (Id., Exhibit O). While Williams claims that DeSantis was hostile to her during this time, (Doc. 1, PP 22, 26), the immutable fact is that ultimately Williams was never well enough to return to work. Indeed, while Williams had follow-up conversations with DeSantis in May of 2017 regarding her work, she was never medically cleared to resume work. Quite the contrary, in May of 2017, Williams was hospitalized once again and suffered a debilitating stroke. (Doc. 31-1, at 19-22). By July 2017, Williams was found to be totally disabled and began receiving disability benefits. (Doc. 31-1, at 5).
Thus, Pinnacle concedes that Williams did not abuse her FMLA privileges and that her work performance was not a factor in their decision to terminate her employment. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit C, at 18-19; Exhibit P, at 22). Instead, Pinnacle adds that while Williams' absences did not cause staffing issues, her physician never prepared [*7]  a return to work form clearing Williams to resume her job, with or without accommodations. (Id., Exhibit A, at 66). Further, the defendants emphasize that Williams herself told DeSantis, and Employee Benefits Counselor, Tamah Wicke, that she did not know when her physician would release her to return to work and that she refused to be admitted to the hospital at her physician's request. (Doc. 36- 3, at 5). Finally, it is clear that the medical complications experienced by Williams in May of 2017, including a stroke that she suffered, rendered her totally disabled. (Doc. 31-1, at 5, 19-22).
On January 8, 2018, the plaintiff received a certified right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (Doc. 1, Exhibit A), and subsequently filed this action with the district court on April 3, 2018. (Doc. 1). Pinnacle filed the instant motion for summary judgment on December 2, 2019. (Doc. 30). The motion has been fully briefed (Docs. 31, 36) and is ripe for resolution.
After review of the record, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment in this case. Rather, the undisputed facts indicate that Williams was terminated after her FMLA leave expired, and after [*8]  she failed to certify to Pinnacle that she was cleared to return to work. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, we will recommend that the defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, a court must determine "whether the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Macfarlan v. Ivy Hill SNF, LLC, 675 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). A disputed issue is only "genuine" if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis upon which a reasonable factfinder could find for the non-moving party. Kaucher v. Cnty. of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A factual dispute is "material" only if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Doe v. Luzerne Cnty., 660 F.3d 169, 175 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Gray v. York Papers, Inc., 957 F.2d 1070, 1078 (3d Cir. 1992)). The Court is not tasked with resolving disputed issues of fact, but only with determining whether there exist any factual issues that must be tried. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-49. In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court must view [*9]  the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Macfarlan, 675 F.3d at 271; Bouriez v. Carnegie Mellon Univ., 585 F.3d 765, 770 (3d Cir. 2009). Where there exist factual issues that cannot be resolved without a credibility determination, the court must credit the non-moving party's evidence over that presented by the moving party. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255. However, if there is no factual issue presented, and if only one reasonable conclusion could arise from the record with respect to the potential outcome under the governing law, the court must award summary judgment in favor of the moving party. Id. at 250.
The court must review the entire record, but in doing so must take care to "disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, 530 U.S. 133, 150-51, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The task for the court is to examine "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to the jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 251-52. In considering this evidence, we note that "a single, non-conclusory affidavit or witness's testimony, when based on personal knowledge and directed at a material issue, is sufficient to defeat summary judgment." Paladino v. Newsome, 885 F.3d 203, 209 n. 34 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Lupyan v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 761 F.3d 314, 320 (3d Cir. 2014)). This principle of the rules governing summary judgment holds true "even where . . . [*10]  the information is self-serving." Id. (citing Lupyan, 761 F.3d at 321 n.2).

IV. DISCUSSION
In this case, the plaintiff brings two categories of claims against her employer. First, Williams claims that Pinnacle violated the FMLA by failing to reinstate her employment following the end of her leave, and by retaliating against her for asserting her rights to take this leave. Second, Williams alleges that Pinnacle violated the ADA and PHRA by discriminating against her due to her disability and for failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her to return to work. However, our review of the record demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all of the plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, we will recommend that the defendants' motion be granted.

A. FMLA Claims
The plaintiff alleges that Pinnacle violated the FMLA when it failed to reinstate her to the same or similar position following the end of her leave. Additionally, Williams claims that the defendant retaliated against her for taking leave by terminating her employment. Pinnacle counters that William's FMLA leave was exhausted, and thus her termination was solely the [*11]  result of the expiration of her leave, coupled with the fact that she was still unable to return to work and not medically cleared by her treating physician.

1. FMLA Failure to Reinstate
The FMLA grants eligible employees the right to take a total of 12 weeks of leave during a 12-month period for specific, statutorily prescribed reasons, including "serious health condition[s] that make the employee unable to perform the functions" of their position. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). It is undisputed that the plaintiff in this case was suffering from an FMLA-qualifying serious health condition and was an eligible employee within the meaning of the Act. Following leave, an employee is entitled to be returned to their position, or an equivalent position with comparable benefits, including pay and other terms and conditions of employment. 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a).
To state a claim for failure to reinstate under the FMLA, an employee must allege that she was not returned to the same or an equivalent job following leave, and that she was able to perform the essential functions of that position. Rinehimer v. Cemcolift, 292 F.3d 375, 384 (3d Cir. 2002). The plaintiff must establish that she was able to work on a full-time basis as a necessary part of showing that she was able to perform the essential elements [*12]  of her job. Baker v. Hunter Douglas, Inc., 270 F. App'x 159, 162 (3d Cir. 2008). Notably, the FMLA imposes no requirement for an employer to make accommodations to facilitate an employee's return. Rinehimer, 292 F.3d at 384.
To prevail on an FMLA failure to reinstate claim, a plaintiff carries the burden of establishing a prima facie case by showing that she was not reinstated to the same or similar job despite being able to perform the essential function of that job. Id. Importantly, employees who exhaust their prescribed FMLA leave lose their statutorily granted right to job restoration, "even if their employers provide additional, non-FMLA, leave". Dogmanits v. Capital Blue Cross, 413 F.Supp.2d 452, 462-63 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (citations omitted). In other words, FMLA protection is strictly limited to the statutorily prescribed time. Frederick v. Brandywine Hosp., Inc., No. 03-3362, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12151, 2003 WL 21961372, at *1 (E.D. Pa July 1, 2003).
In the instant case, Williams cannot show that Pinnacle violated the FMLA by failing to reinstate her to her original position or a comparable position following her leave. The FMLA requires that employees returning from FMLA leave "be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment." 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1); see also Dogmanits, 413 F.Supp.2d at 462. However, it is clear that the burden is on the plaintiff's [*13]  medical provider, rather than the employer, to certify that the plaintiff can perform the essential functions of her job at the end of her FMLA leave. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.123(a) ("An employee is 'unable to perform the functions of the position' where the health care provider finds that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of the employee's position"); Budhun v. Reading Hosp. and Medical Center, 765 F.3d 245, 254 (3d Cir. 2014).
On this score, the Third Circuit has found that when determining the validity of a failure to reinstate claim, the "primary issue" is whether the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her former position upon the expiration of her FMLA leave. Hunter Douglas, 270 F. App'x at 162. Further, a plaintiff must show that she is able to work full-time to sufficiently demonstrate that she can perform the essential functions of her position. Id. (citing Tardie v. Rehabilitation Hosp., 168 F.3d 538, 544 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding plaintiff's inability to work fifty to seventy hours per week as hospital administrator constituted a failure to perform essential function of the job); Hatchett v. Philander Smith College, 251 F.3d 670, 676-77 (8th Cir. 2001)). The plaintiff in Hunter Douglas was not medically cleared to return to work following her FMLA leave. Id. Accordingly, due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain medical clearance, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiff [*14]  could not perform the essential functions of her position and thus was not entitled to reinstatement under the FMLA. Id.
Similarly, here, it is undisputed that Williams failed to update her Medical Certification form to reflect that she was able to return to work at the end of her FMLA leave on March 13, 2017. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 52-55; Exhibit I). Thus, on March 13, 2017, the last date of her FMLA leave, Williams remained unable to return work and thus could not perform the essential functions of her job. Indeed, between March and July of 2017 Williams' health declined dramatically. She was hospitalized, suffered a stroke, and was deemed totally disabled. This decline is evident not only from her March 10, 2017 conversation with DeSantis, in which she stated that she was medically unable to work, but also because the Medical Certification form she submitted to the defendant indicated that she was not cleared by her doctor to return to work until May 20, 2017—approximately two months past the end of her FMLA leave. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 57-58). Moreover, Williams' doctor refused to clear her to return to work at this time and even recommended that she be admitted to the hospital [*15]  for additional treatment. (Doc 1, PP 19-21). Williams was, in fact, hospitalized in May of 2017, suffered a stroke, and became completely disabled.
As was her personal policy, Williams' supervisor DeSantis granted the plaintiff additional job-protected time off in the form of a month-long personal leave, lasting from March 13, 2017 to April 10, 2017. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit M). In taking this action, Pinnacle did more than the law required. This personal leave was granted at the discretion of the defendants, as employers are not required to grant additional leave following FMLA leave. Indeed, employees who exhaust their FMLA prescribed leave time lose their entitlement to job restoration "even if their employers provide additional, non-FMLA, leave." Dogmanits, 413 F.Supp.2d at 462-63. Thus, although it was not required, Pinnacle granted Williams an additional period of leave, and Williams was still not cleared to return to work at the end of this additional leave period. Accordingly, it is undisputed that Williams cannot show that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job when her FMLA leave expired. Accordingly, Pinnacle was not required under the FMLA to restore Williams to her position at this time. [*16]  Therefore, Williams' FMLA failure to reinstate claim fails as a matter of law and the defendants should be entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

2. FMLA Retaliation
While a failure to reinstate claim under the FMLA does not need to be contemporaneous with a retaliation claim, they are often factually related and, as in this case, accompany one another. To state a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, an employee must allege that after taking FMLA-qualifying leave, she was subjected to an adverse employment action, including termination or other retaliatory action, because she took time away from work for FMLA-qualifying reasons. See, e.g., Freeman v. Phila. Hous. Auth., No. 12-1422, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100774, 2013 WL 3761274, at *22 (E.D. Pa. July 18, 2013) (describing retaliation claims as those "where an employee requested or took FMLA leave, remained at or returned to work, and then was subject to some type of adverse employment action such as termination or demotion.").
To prevail on her FMLA retaliation claim, it is the plaintiff's burden to establish a prima facie case by showing that (1) she invoked a right to FMLAqualifying leave, (2) subsequently suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) demonstrate that the adverse action was causally related to her invocation of her FMLA rights. [*17]  Ross, 755 F.3d at 193 (citing Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir. 2012)). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to show a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the allegedly adverse employment decision. Lichtenstein, 691 F.3d at 302. If the employer satisfies this "minimal burden," id., the plaintiff has the burden of establishing evidence sufficient to cast doubt on the employer's legitimate, nonretaliatory reason. Id. As we have noted, the essence of a retaliation claim is that the defendant has taken some adverse action against an employee because of her use of FMLA. Kintz v. SMNRC, L.P., No. 4:16-CV-02313, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182280, 2018 WL 5279320, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 24, 2018).
Here, it is uncontested that on January 31, 2017, Williams invoked her right to continuous FMLA leave and used that leave through March 13, 2017 for a qualifying serious health condition. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit J). Likewise, there seems to be no dispute that Williams suffered an adverse employment action when she was terminated on April 14, 2017—over one month after her FMLA leave ended. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit O). Thus, the first two elements of an FMLA retaliation claim are met in this case. However, Pinnacle disputes that Williams was terminated for invoking her right to use FMLA leave. On this score, the Third [*18]  Circuit has spoken to the nature of the circumstantial evidence needed to create a genuine issue of fact regarding causation:
To demonstrate a prima facie case of causation, [a plaintiff] must point to evidence sufficient to create an inference that a causative link exists between her FMLA leave and her termination. See Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d 271, 279-81 (3d Cir.2000). When the "temporal proximity" between the protected activity and adverse action is "unduly suggestive," this "is sufficient standing alone to create an inference of causality and defeat summary judgment." LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 232 (3d Cir.2007). "Where the temporal proximity is not 'unusually suggestive,' we ask whether 'the proffered evidence, looked at as a whole, may suffice to raise the inference.'" Id. (quoting Farrell, 206 F.3d at 280).
Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 307 (3d Cir. 2012).
Put another way:
To demonstrate a causal connection, a plaintiff generally must show "either (1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the allegedly retaliatory action, or (2) a pattern of antagonism coupled with timing to establish a causal link." Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir. 2007). Employers "cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c).
Budhun, 765 F.3d at 258.
Here, in our view, the evidence does not create an inference of causation necessary to satisfy the third element [*19]  of a FMLA retaliation claim. At the outset, we note that the timing of Williams' termination is not sufficiently suggestive of retaliation. Williams' official termination on April 14, 2017 occurred over one month after the expiration of her FMLA time. This does not qualify as "unduly suggestive" temporal proximity between her taking leave and her ultimate termination. See Schummer v. Black Bear Distribution, LLC, 965 F.Supp.2d 493, 499 (D.N.J. 2013) (finding that one month between the end of the plaintiff's FMLA leave and his termination was not unduly suggestive). However, where no inference can be draw from temporal proximity alone, we must look to the body of other evidence to determine if it is sufficient to raise the inference of retaliation.
On this score, while an email between DeSantis and HR coordinator Tamah Wicke regarding the plaintiff's use of FMLA states, "let's hope she doesn't abuse [her FMLA leave]," there is no other evidence to suggest that anyone at Pinnacle was hostile to Williams because of her use of FMLA leave or that she was terminated because she used FMLA leave. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit C, at 30). Rather, the record indicates that DeSantis communicated with Williams several times throughout her leave regarding her potential to return to [*20]  work and reminded her to complete the necessary paperwork. DeSantis even granted Williams an additional month of personal leave after her FMLA time had expired. Additionally, while not dispositive of the absence of retaliation in this instance, Williams had taken FMLA leave six times during her employment with Pinnacle without issue. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, at 18-19).
Thus, the evidence Williams presents does not satisfy her prima facie burden to show that there are disputed factual issues regarding the causation element of this FMLA retaliation claim. Rather, the record demonstrates that Williams was able to use her FMLA leave without incident, and that DeSantis granted her additional personal leave at the expiration of her FMLA time. However, after the expiration of the extended personal leave, Williams still did not have clearance from her doctor to return to work. Accordingly, Williams has not set forth a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation.
Moreover, even if Williams was able to make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Pinnacle has sufficiently demonstrated that there was a non-retaliatory reason for taking an adverse employment action against Williams, and Williams has not presented [*21]  evidence that this reason was pretextual. The simple, stark, sad reality is that Williams' medical decline in 2017 was dramatic, significant and ultimately rendered her completely disabled. Indeed, by July of 2017, Williams had applied for and was receiving disability benefits based upon the well-grounded conclusion that she could no longer work. While this disability finding is not per se conclusive as a matter of law, it is undisputed, and has clear evidentiary relevance as we consider the question of whether Williams' has shown that the medical justification for terminating her employment was wholly pretextual. See Motley v. New Jersey State Police, 196 F.3d 160, 166 (3d Cir. 1999). Given this finding of disability, which is uncontested here, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has carried her burden of establishing evidence sufficient to cast doubt on the employer's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Williams' employment based upon her inability to continue working. Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.2

B. ADA Claims
The plaintiff also brings two claims against Pinnacle under the ADA. First, Williams alleges that she was a qualified individual and Pinnacle violated the ADA by taking [*22]  an adverse employment action against her because of her disability. (Doc. 1, PP 30, 33). Additionally, Williams alleges that the defendant refused to engage in the necessary interactive process to identify reasonable accommodations or provide her any such accommodations to facilitate her return to work. (Id., P 34).
The defendant counters these allegations, arguing that Williams has failed to establish that her termination was the result of her disability or discriminatory in nature. (Doc. 31, at 12). Pinnacle asserts that Williams is not a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA because she was never released by her doctor to return to work. (Id. at 16). Moreover, Pinnacle claims that Williams cannot establish that she was terminated because of her disability, but rather, that she was terminated because she had exhausted her statutorily-protected leave and was unable to return to work. After review, we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact that preclude us from granting summary judgment for the defendant on these claims. Therefore, we recommend that the defendant's motion for summary judgment also be granted with respect to the plaintiff's ADA and PHRA claims.

1. Legal [*23]  Standards Under the ADA3
The ADA was enacted to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F.Supp.2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). A disability can take the form of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
To establish a prima facie claim for workplace discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is: (1) disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) remains qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations by the employer; and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of the discrimination. Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 F.3d 177, 185 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Stadtmiller v. UPMC Health Plan, Inc., 491 F. App'x 334, 336 (3d Cir. 2012); Gaul v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998). Moreover, under the ADA, employers must provide "'reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,' unless the employer demonstrates that such accommodations would impose an 'undue hardship' on the operation of their business." Fleck v. WILMAC, Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, 2011 WL 1899198, at *4 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2011) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112).

On this score, [*24]  an employer must, in good faith, engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine what a reasonable accommodation for them to return to work may be. Lewis v. Univ. of Pennsylvania, 779 F. App'x 920, 923 (3d Cir. 2019). The interactive process "should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and the potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Fleck, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54039, 2011 WL 1899198, at *7 (citing Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997)). Throughout this process, "both parties have a duty to assist in the search for appropriate reasonable accommodation and to act in good faith." Id. However, it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of identifying the reasonable accommodation. Fogleman v. Greater Hazleton Health All., 122 F. App'x 581, 585-86 (3d Cir. 2004); see Skerski v. Time Warner Cable Co., 257 F.3d 273, 284 (3d Cir. 2001). Relatedly, the Third Circuit has found that a plaintiff must show certain conditions existed to demonstrate that their employer failed to engage in an interactive process to provide reasonable accommodations as required by the ADA:
To show that an employer failed to participate in the interactive process, a disabled employee must demonstrate: 1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee [*25]  could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith. Taylor v. Phoenixville Sch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 319-20 (3d Cir.1999).
Fogleman, 122 F. App'x at 585.
In some instances, requesting a leave of absence may be considered a "reasonable accommodation," though this is not always the case and is a fact specific inquiry. Id. A leave of absence may constitute a reasonable accommodation under the ADA in situations where the disabled employee would be able "to perform his essential job functions in the near future." Conoshenti v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 151 (3d Cir. 2004). However, it is well settled that providing for an indeterminate, additional period of leave does not constitute a reasonable accommodation. Fogleman, 122 F. App'x 581, at 586 (citing Peter v. Lincoln Technical Inst., 255 F.Supp.2d 417, 437 (E.D. Pa. 2002) ("[M]any courts have found that a request for indefinite leave is inherently unreasonable, particularly where there is no favorable prognosis") (internal citations omitted)); Shafnisky v. Bell Atlantic, Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21829, 2002 WL 31513551, *11 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 5, 2002) ("Open-ended disability leave is not a reasonable accommodation").
Crucially, for ADA protections to apply, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she is a qualified individual within the meaning of the statute. The ADA states that a "qualified individual" is "...an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Essential [*26]  functions of the position are those fundamental functions which the individual who holds the position must be able to perform unaided or with the assistance of a reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1).
If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing under this three-part standard, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action. See Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 2000) (noting that the burden-shifting framework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies to ADA disparate treatment and retaliation claims). If a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is given, then the plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate that the defendants' stated reasons for the adverse employment action were purely pretextual. Id. The plaintiff may meet this burden by presenting evidence that allows a factfinder to either discredit the employer's articulated justification, or to conclude that a discriminatory reason was more likely than not the proximate cause of the employment action. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir. 1994).

2. Williams' Claims Fail as a Matter of Law.
Turning to the facts of this case, we find that there are no genuine issues of material fact that preclude the entry of summary judgment for the defendants on Williams' ADA and PHRA [*27]  claims. Though it is undisputed that the plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the Act, she has failed to meet her prima facie burden of showing that she was a qualified individual who could perform the essential functions of her job. One of the "threshold requirement[s] in a disability discrimination case under the ADA is that the plaintiff be a 'qualified individual'. . . ." Krensavage v. Bayer Corp., 314 F. App'x 421, 425 (3d Cir. 2008). As Pinnacle highlights, and as we have acknowledged, the plaintiff's physician did not authorize her to return to work at the end of her FMLA leave or extended personal leave. Moreover, it is undisputed that Williams' health continued to seriously decline throughout the Spring of 2017, as she was hospitalized and suffered a stroke in May of 2017, medical mishaps that led to Williams' being deemed disabled by July of 2017.
This disability finding has legal and factual relevance here. As the Court of Appeals has observed:
Although courts should not assume that an individual's ADA claim is barred "merely because prior representations or determinations of disability exist in the record," Krouse, 126 F.3d at 503 n. 5, the attainment of disability benefits is certainly some evidence of an assertion that would be inconsistent with the argument [*28]  that the party is a qualified individual under the ADA. Recognizing that this was the logical conclusion in these types of cases, the Supreme Court in Cleveland acknowledged that the ADA plaintiff must somehow explain the apparent inconsistency.
Motley v. New Jersey State Police, 196 F.3d 160, 166 (3d Cir. 1999). In the instant case, Williams simply has not provided an explanation for the apparent inconsistency between her assertion that she was qualified under the ADA to work and the finding that she was totally disabled.
This is a material failure of proof since in Krensavage v. Bayer Corp., the court held that "determining whether an individual is qualified requires a two-part analysis: (i) whether the individual meets the necessary prerequisites for the job, such as education, experience, training, and the like; and (ii) whether the individual can perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation." Krensavage, No. 02:04CV1476, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69958, 2006 WL 2794562, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 27, 2006), aff'd, 314 F. App'x 421. The plaintiff in Krensavage brought an ADA discrimination claim against her employer following the termination of her employment and denial of long-term disability benefits. Id. Summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendant because the court found that Krensavage was not a "qualified [*29]  individual" under the ADA. Id. Integral to this decision was the fact that the plaintiff herself had several doctors certify to the defendant that she was totally disabled and unable to return to work and thus, unable to perform the essential functions of her job. Id.
Similarly, in the instant case, Williams failed to provide the defendant with the necessary medical clearance form that would allow the defendants to infer that she had become qualified to resume work, with or without accommodations. Quite the contrary, it is uncontested that Williams' medical condition declined and became totally disabling by July of 2017. Though Williams repeatedly stated her desire to return to work, she did not provide the defendants any indication that she was well enough to perform and, to the contrary, she was hospitalized around the end date of her personal leave on April 10, 2017. (Doc. 31, at 9). She never sought a second medical opinion to show that she was medically able to return to work earlier than her treating physician's opinion that she could not return until May 2017. Moreover, the evidence on record in this case reflects that even if Williams had been granted leave until May 20, 2017 [*30]  she would have remained to be unable to perform her essential job functions as unfortunately, her health did not subsequently improve. See Krensavage, No. 02:04CV1476, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69958, 2006 WL 2794562, at *11, aff'd, 314 F. App'x 421. Therefore, it is evident that Williams was not a "qualified individual" within the meaning of the ADA.
Because Williams was unable to show to show that he she was not a qualified individual, it follows that Pinnacle was not obligated to engage in an interactive process with her to provide reasonable accommodations. See Hohider v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 193 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Gaul, 134 F.3d at 581 (finding that because the plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the ADA, the employer was not obligated to investigate a reasonable accommodation); see also Shafnisky, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21829, 2002 WL 31513551, at *6 ("An employer, of course, need not engage in a process designed to identify a reasonable accommodation with an employee who represents that she is unable to perform any full or part-time work"). As we have explained, the lack of medical clearance by her treating physician, along with her own statements that she was unable to return to work, demonstrates that Williams was unable to perform any kind of work and therefore is not a "qualified individual" under the ADA.
However, assuming arguendo that Williams could show that [*31]  she was a qualified individual, the defendants have satisfied their burden under the McDonnell-Douglas test by showing that Pinnacle's decision to terminate Williams' employment was made for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons. See Shaner, 204 F.3d at 500. Pinnacle has shown that the expiration of Williams' FMLA leave, coupled with her lack of medical clearance, formed the basis of its decision to terminate her employment. Moreover, as we have explained, the immutable evidence reveals that Williams' medical decline in 2017 was dramatic and ultimately rendered her completely disabled. Indeed, by July of 2017, Williams had applied for and was receiving disability benefits based upon the well-grounded conclusion that she could no longer work. Once an employer articulates a legitimate reason for their adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff "to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." Id. Further, "the attainment of disability benefits is certainly some evidence of an assertion that would be inconsistent with the argument that the party is a qualified individual [*32]  under the ADA." Therefore, "[r]ecognizing that this was the logical conclusion in these types of cases, the Supreme Court . . . acknowledged that the ADA plaintiff must somehow explain the apparent inconsistency." Motley, 196 F.3d at 166.
Here, Williams fails to meet this burden. The plaintiff provides no evidence to suggest that the defendants' stated reasons for the adverse employment action against her were purely pretextual other than stating that the defendant's "conduct is indicative of [it] seeking a reason to eliminate plaintiff's employment". (Doc 36-1, at 3). Furthermore, Williams provides no grounds for discounting the well-founded determination that she become totally disabled by the Spring of 2017.
Instead, Williams grounds her claim in her assertion that "at the very least, there is material dispute of fact surrounding the breakdown of the interactive process...that was the fault and responsibility of the defendants." (Doc. 36-1, at 11). We disagree. Even if Williams could show that she was a qualified individual under the ADA, the defendant did not fail to engage in an interactive process to provide reasonable accommodations. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has elaborated on the importance [*33]  of both the employee and the employer engaging in this interactive process to come to an effective resolution concerning an employee's need for an accommodation:
As we explained in Mengine [v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415 (3d Cir. 1997)], the process must be interactive because each party holds information the other does not have or cannot easily obtain. We noted that "employers will not always know what kind of work the worker with the disability can do, and conversely, the worker may not be aware of the range of available employment opportunities, especially in a large company. Thus, the interactive process may often lead to the identification of a suitable position." Mengine, 114 F.3d at 420.
Taylor v. Phoenixville School District, 184 F.3d 296, 316 (3d Cir. 1999).
With this in mind, as one court in this district noted, it is "utterly unreasonable and not within the mandate of the ADA to expect an employer to accommodate an employee with an indefinite leave of absence". Reifer v. Colonial Intermediate Unit 20, 462 F. Supp. 2d 621 (M.D. Pa. 2006); see also Fogleman, 122 Fed. Appx. 581, 585 (citing Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 151 (3d Cir. 2004)). In this case, given the evidence which reveals that Williams was never able to return to work, that is essentially what Williams was requesting of her employer. (Doc. 36- 1 at 3). Moreover, Pinnacle did, in fact, grant Williams an additional month-long leave of absence. Even after this extended leave expired, though she repeatedly [*34]  stated her intention to return to work (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A at 77-78), Williams was neither medically cleared, nor provided any indication that she was well enough to return to work in any capacity. This is so even though she inquired about the availability of other jobs. In conversations with DeSantis after her personal leave expired, the plaintiff indicated that she had no clear answer about when she could return to work and needed to be hospitalized for dehydration. (Doc. 31-1, Exhibit A, p. 65).
Thus, the evidence indicates that while Pinnacle was not required to grant Williams a reasonable accommodation, it did grant her additional personal leave following the expiration of her FMLA leave. Thus, no reasonable factfinder could find that Pinnacle either failed to grant Williams an accommodation, or that Pinnacle terminated Williams' employment because of her disability. Rather, it is clear that Pinnacle endeavored to assist Williams after her FMLA leave expired, but ultimately had to terminate her employment. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we recommend granting summary judgment to the defendants on Williams' ADA and PHRA claims.

V. RECOMMENDATION
