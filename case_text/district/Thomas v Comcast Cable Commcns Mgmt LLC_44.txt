Opinion



FINAL ORDER
The parties in this case have consented to jurisdiction by the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge. [Doc. 26].
This employment discrimination case is before the Court on the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC ("Defendant" or "Comcast"). [Doc. 43]. Having considered the evidence, applicable law, and the parties' arguments, I conclude that Plaintiff has not established a triable issue of fact, and Plaintiff's claims are barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed below, I will grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint on May 3, 2019. [Doc. 1, Compl.]. After a bumpy start, he engaged an attorney to represent him, and on December 26, 2019, Plaintiff, through his attorney, [*2]  filed an amended complaint that is now the operative complaint before this Court. [Doc. 21, Am. Compl.].
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges the following two counts for relief: failure to accommodate his disability (Count One), and retaliation (Count Two), in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). [Am. Compl. at 1, 2, 4, ¶ 1].

II. PRELIMINARY MATTERS
First, although Plaintiff's Amended Complaint makes a passing reference to 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a), the complaint does not assert an actual claim under that statute. Section 1981(a) provides as follows:
(a) Statement of equal rights
All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.
Id. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint contains no factual allegations pertaining to his race, to discrimination based on race, or to any alleged violation of the civil rights set forth in Section 1981(a). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff's Amended [*3]  Complaint is seeking to assert a claim under that statute, summary judgment is granted, and I will focus my analysis on Plaintiff's claims under the ADA.
Even assuming that Plaintiff cited to the wrong statute, and meant to cite 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2) (Damages in cases of intentional discrimination in employment; (a) Right of recovery . . . (2) Disability), Plaintiff appears to be including the statute for the sole purpose of asserting a claim for punitive and compensatory damages under the ADA. As discussed herein, Plaintiff's claims under the ADA are deficient, and summary judgment will be granted on those claims. Accordingly, for the same or similar reasons, Plaintiff's mis-cited allegation for punitive or compensatory damages under the ADA must also be dismissed, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted on Plaintiff's claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. See Jones v. Aarons, Inc., No. 1:15-cv-1686-RWS-JSA, 2017 WL 6375993, at *38-39 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 31, 2017) (granting summary judgment on Civil Rights Act of 1991 claim where ADA claims were dismissed).
Second, as Defendant correctly notes, Plaintiff has failed to file any response to Defendant's Statement of Material Facts accompanying its motion for summary judgment [Doc. 44], in accordance with the federal and local rules and this Court's scheduling order and instructions [*4]  issued on January 6, 2020 regarding summary judgment motions. [Doc. 28]. Nor has Plaintiff filed a Statement of Additional Facts.
Under Local Rule 56.1 of the Northern District of Georgia, a party moving for summary judgment must include "a separate, concise, numbered statement of the material facts to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa. The Court deems the movant's facts admitted unless the opposing party either refutes the facts with citations to evidence or law, or states a valid objection to the movant's evidence. LR 56.1(B)(2).
Because Plaintiff has neither refuted nor stated valid objections to the material facts as set forth in Defendant's Statement of Material Facts, the facts are deemed admitted by operation of law. Id.; Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1267-69 (11th Cir. 2008).
Nonetheless, in addressing the merits of Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and retaliation in violation of the ADA, and Defendant's summary judgment motion, the Court has not simply relied on Defendant's statement of material facts, "but the court has reviewed the evidentiary materials submitted ... to determine ... whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried." Hall v. Graham Packing Co., L.P., No. 1:08-CV-2424-TWT, 2010 WL 481214, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 3, 2010).
Third, the Court notes that Plaintiff has also failed to file [*5]  any evidence to support his claims: i.e., no affidavit, no declaration, no deposition testimony, no interrogatory responses, admissions, or any medical evidence whatsoever to support his claim of disability. The only evidence cited by the Plaintiff in his response to Defendant's motion for summary judgment is a sworn declaration of Nikita Wells filed by Defendant [Doc. 43-4, Exhibit D, Declaration of Nikita Wells ("Wells Decl.")], and the attachments thereto, and a position statement that Plaintiff asserts Defendant filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), but Plaintiff has not attached a copy of either to his response.1
Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the Court has drawn the following facts from the Defendant's uncontested statement of material facts as well as the uncontroverted record evidence. The Court has excluded all assertions of fact that are immaterial or presented as legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to evidence in the record or asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B). The Court has viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, [*6]  as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment.2 Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994).

III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact are present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant carries its burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).
"Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). The nonmovant is then required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "Mere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to create a dispute to defeat summary judgment." Bald Mountain Park, Ltd. v. Oliver, 863 F.2d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir. 1989).
Federal Rule 56 mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of every element essential to that party's case on which he will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. In such a situation, there can [*7]  be no genuine issue as to any material fact, as a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. Id. at 322-23.
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view all evidence and draw any factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Samples v. City of Atlanta, 846 F.2d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir. 1988). But "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). The requirement to avoid summary judgment is that there be no "genuine issue of material fact." Id. at 248 (italics in original). Resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party, the Court must determine "whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented." Id. at 252.

IV. FACTS
In light of the foregoing summary judgment standard, the Court finds the following facts for the purpose of resolving Defendant Comcast's motion for summary judgment only.
Plaintiff was hired by Comcast in approximately July 2014 and began working as a field technician. [Doc. 43-1, Deposition of Haywood Thomas ("Pl.'s Dep."), at 31-32, 42, 44;3 Doc. 43-4 at 16, EEOC Charge, filed on March [*8]  19, 2018]. After some time off due to a vehicle accident, Plaintiff transitioned to an inside technical support position in February 2017, and Plaintiff worked in that position until he was terminated in February 2018. [Doc. 43-4 at 16; Pl.'s Dep. at 8, 42, 49-52, 54-55].
Like many of his coworkers, in February 2017, Plaintiff was first assigned to work in a cubicle designed for two people. His cube-mate at that time was a coworker named Betty Lee. [Pl.'s Dep. at 60]. During all relevant times, Plaintiff's supervisor was Michael Calton. [Id. at 57]. Calton worked in a cubicle approximately ten to fifteen feet from Plaintiff's work area, and the department's manager, Steve Reese, worked at a desk approximately fifteen to twenty feet from Plaintiff's cubicle. [Id. at 63, 65-67]. The Human Resources person for the department was Nikita Wells, who worked on a different floor. [Id. at 65].
At some point in or around late June 2017, Plaintiff began to experience physical symptoms at work, on an episodic basis, while he was sitting at his desk.4 The symptoms included a metal taste in his mouth, watery eyes, a runny nose, pressure on his chest, and trouble concentrating. [Doc. 44, Def.'s Stmt. [*9]  of Mat. Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 2; Pl.'s Dep. at 80-83, 92]. The metal taste in Plaintiff's mouth always preceded the other symptoms. [Pl.'s Dep. at 81-83]. Plaintiff's symptoms, however, never included difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, a cough, or wheezing. [DSMF ¶ 6; Doc. 43-2 at 37]. Plaintiff's symptoms would subside within fifteen to thirty minutes when he went outside to get some fresh air. [DSMF ¶ 3; Pl.'s Dep. at 91-94].
From July 2017 through mid November 2017, there were six documented instances where Plaintiff reported to Comcast that he had experienced one or more of these symptoms. [DSMF ¶ 5]. During that period, Plaintiff became convinced that he was being exposed to some type of toxin at work, or that someone at work was trying to poison him. [Pl.'s Dep. at 87-88]. Plaintiff initially thought that his cubicle-mate, Betty Lee, was spraying something in their cubicle that was causing his symptoms because if his symptoms occurred, they did so shortly after she arrived to work. [Id. at 88-91, 107]. Plaintiff's symptoms did not occur every day, but when they did, Plaintiff would remove himself from his office, go outside, and within fifteen to thirty minutes, his symptoms [*10]  would subside. [Id. at 92]. Plaintiff never spoke directly to Betty Lee about his symptoms or concerns, but he did report his concerns to his supervisor, Michael Calton, the department manager, Steve Reese, and the department's HR representative, Nikita Wells. [Id. at 108, 110, 112].
After Plaintiff brought these "episodes" to the attention of his management on several occasions, Reese decided to relocate Plaintiff's desk and separate Plaintiff's work area from Betty Lee's. [Pl.'s Dep. at 110-112]. However, even after moving Plaintiff's desk, Plaintiff continued to experience the same symptoms, and he began to think that maybe what was bothering him was just something in the office building where he worked. [Id. at 92-93, 147-149]. He did continue to be concerned, however, that maybe someone with malice was attempting to harm him. [Id. at 162]. Accordingly, when Plaintiff would arrive at work, he began wiping down his desk and work area with hand sanitizer or Lysol wipes, and he would clean his desk again after he came back from lunch. [Id. at 95].
After multiple trips to doctors, clinics, a hospital, and to Georgia Poison Control for Plaintiff to be tested and evaluated for his symptoms [*11]  (often accompanied by either Michael Calton or Steve Reese), there was still no definitive medical evidence of what was causing Plaintiff's symptoms or definitive diagnosis.5 Following the car incident (where Plaintiff experienced his same symptoms in his car while leaving work, and noticed some white-looking substance on the door frame of his car, see supra n.4), Plaintiff filed a police report at the suggestion of Joshua Smith, who worked on Comcast's security team and was assigned to investigate Plaintiff's allegations. [Pl.'s Dep. at 136, 169-73]. Upon hearing about the car incident, HR's Nikita Wells determined that Comcast should place Plaintiff on paid administrative leave while they investigated Plaintiff's situation further. [Id. at 170]. Plaintiff expressed his desire not to be placed on administrative leave, but the decision had already been made to put Plaintiff on administrative leave until Comcast got the results of a toxicology test that Plaintiff was scheduled to take. [Id. at 170-71, 180-81].
On December 6, 2017, Plaintiff underwent a toxicology test and evaluation at Grady Hospital. [Doc. 43-2 at 37, Ex. 19 (the "Grady report"); Pl.'s Dep. at 182]. The Grady report [*12]  documents the history that Plaintiff gave of his present illness—i.e., that he was complaining of exposure to an unknown toxic substance at his place of work, on an intermittent basis, that caused symptoms of a runny nose, watery eyes, an odd metallic taste in his mouth, light headedness, difficulty concentrating, and chest tightness, but no shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing. [Doc. 43-2 at 37]. Plaintiff reported that he noticed those symptoms especially after returning to his cubicle after employee meetings and fire drills, and that the symptoms resolved if he walked in fresh air for fifteen to thirty minutes, but returned once he returned to his cubicle. [Id.]. Plaintiff also reported the incident where he experienced the same symptoms while driving his car after work one day, but noted that the symptoms did not return once he cleaned off the residue of whatever substance was there. [Id.].
The third and fourth paragraphs of the Grady report dated December 6, 2017 state:
Mr. Thomas is certain there is someone, or a group of people at his work, who are trying to poison him with this unknown toxin. He has spoken with Human Resources, company security, and the police regarding this [*13]  issue. There was one other person at his job who seemed to be suffering from similar symptoms, however, after being interviewed by Human Resources, it was determined to not be related to his symptoms. He states his work space is dirty, although he has not noticed visible mold on the walls. He cleaned his cubicle daily upon arriving to work. He states the chemical has no odor.
Mr. Thomas has been sent to us for toxicological testing in aiding the identification of this unknown xenobiotic. He has been on paid administrative leave since 17 November 2017 and had no recurrence of his symptoms since being put on leave. He never experienced these symptoms at home or anywhere other than his cubicle, except the one time in his car, as mentioned above. Currently he is in good health and without complaint.
[Doc. 43-2 at 37]. The report notes that Plaintiff's physical examination was essentially normal. [Id. at 39]. The report also notes that at Plaintiff's request, Grady performed a urine heavy metal screen, although it noted that there was no indication, given Plaintiff's history and physical examination, for heavy metal exposure. [Id.].
Under "Assessment," the Grady report notes that Plaintiff [*14]  was a twenty-four-year-old man with a possible unknown toxic chemical exposure, with symptoms "consistent with an irritant gas or allergen" and with an "isolated workplace exposure." [Id.]. The report stated, "However, we will not be able to comment on whether there is nefarious activity taking place. As there are countless potential irritant gases and they exert their toxicity through contact with mucous membranes and are not absorbed in large amount, there is no test that can be performed to evaluate for the possible exposure. His symptoms do not match any toxidrome for heavy metal toxicity, organophosphates, knock down gases such as cyanide, or carbon monoxide." [Id.].
For Plaintiff's concerns of vapor or gaseous exposure, Grady recommended hiring a company to perform a detailed analysis of the air in Plaintiff's cubicle while he was experiencing symptoms and also in another part of the office where Plaintiff did not experience symptoms. [Doc. 43-2 at 39]. Grady also recommended, if there was a concern for malicious activity, that surveillance equipment be used to identify a person and/or chemical that could be causing the exposure. [Id.]. Ultimately, the Grady report explained that [*15]  there was no broad toxicological screen that could be performed to identify an unknown agent, and that many of the possible toxins that could cause symptoms like Plaintiff's are "either undetectable in blood and urine or there is no test for them." [Id. at 39-40]. The Grady report closed by stating, "We will readdress the possibility of testing Mr. Thomas if a specific chemical is identified, but at present there is no further test we can offer which would help identify his potential exposure." [Id. at 40].
After the Grady evaluation, while still on administrative leave, Plaintiff received an email from Nikita Wells saying that Comcast was waiting for the results of the toxicology testing before bringing him back to work. [Pl.'s Dep. at 191]. Following the toxicology test and evaluation at Grady, Plaintiff did not see any other doctors for his symptoms or for further evaluation. [Pl.'s Dep. at 189-90].
Upon receiving and evaluating the report from Grady, which showed negative results for exposure to any known or unknown toxins, and after having taken a number of actions in response to Plaintiff's concerns, including, but not limited to, moving Plaintiff's desk and work location, investigating [*16]  whether the pest control service Comcast was using on Plaintiff's floor was causing Plaintiff's symptoms (which Comcast determined was not causing his issues) [Wells Decl. ¶ 12], taking Plaintiff to the doctor multiple times to see if he could be diagnosed,6 involving Comcast's security department on multiple occasions to investigate Plaintiff's belief that he was being poisoned [Wells Decl. ¶ 10], and complying with Plaintiff's request to be tested for poison or toxic chemical exposure [id. ¶ 13], Comcast determined that it had done everything it reasonably could do for Plaintiff. Because Plaintiff was still asserting that someone was trying to poison him, and, according to Comcast, Plaintiff's accusations were causing a disruption to the workplace, Comcast decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment and offer him a severance package to aid him in transitioning to different employment. [DSMF ¶¶ 11, 14, 17; Pl.'s Dep. at 79, 83-84, 129-31, 134-37, 149, 154-60, 162-64, 166].
In light of Grady's inconclusive testing, Plaintiff asked Comcast whether it could monitor his work and desk area by installing a camera in order to potentially catch or expose whoever might be poisoning him. [DSMF [*17]  ¶ 7; Doc. 43-3 at 10, Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 18; Pl.'s Dep. at 204-06]. While Comcast at times permitted cameras in common, non-work areas like hallways or breakrooms in its corporate offices (as distinguished from its stores), Comcast's policy was not to have cameras in work areas where customer information could be viewed or recorded. [Wells Decl. ¶ 18]. Comcast considered Plaintiff's request, but ultimately determined that maintaining the privacy of its customers' information that might be captured on a video camera in Plaintiff's work area outweighed Plaintiff's concerns that had not been substantiated by any medical or other evidence. According to Comcast, Plaintiff's request was based on his belief that someone was intentionally trying to poison him, and Comcast had not discovered any evidence to support or substantiate that belief. [Id.].
On February 13, 2018, Comcast informed Plaintiff that he was being separated from his employment with Comcast, and offered him a severance package, which Plaintiff did not accept. [Wells Decl. ¶ 17; Pl.'s Dep. at 194-95].
Following his termination, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC on March 19, 2018. [Doc. 43-4 at [*18]  16; Doc. 43-6 at 2 (Ex. F to Def.'s MSJ)]. The charge alleges discrimination on the basis of disability, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act ("ADAAA") (hereinafter, the "ADA"), starting at the earliest on November 13, 2017, and ending on the date of his termination, February 13, 2018 (the approximate period of time that Plaintiff spent on administrative leave). [Doc. 43-6 at 2]. The charge also alleges that Plaintiff believed he was terminated in retaliation for reporting his medical condition to his employer upon returning from medical leave, but the charge does not specifically identify Plaintiff's purported disability, under the ADA. [Id.].
On February 8, 2019, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a notice of right to sue, indicating that based on its investigation, it was unable to conclude that the information obtained established a violation of the ADA. [Doc. 3 at 8].
On or about May 3, 2019, Plaintiff filed his original complaint in this Court. [Doc. 3, Compl.]. As noted earlier, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 26, 2019 [Doc. 21], and the amended complaint is now the operative complaint before this Court.
On July 30, 2020, Defendant filed the [*19]  instant motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 43]. Defendant's motion for summary judgment has been fully briefed and is before this Court for consideration.

V. DISCUSSION

A. Failure to Accommodate Claim (Count One)
In Count One of his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Comcast discriminated against him by "failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for his known disability." [Am. Compl. ¶ 20]. Paragraph 12 of his Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability, under the ADA, and that his impairment is "unspecified asthma," which substantially limits him in major life activities, "including but not limited to respiration." [Id. ¶ 12; see also DSMF ¶ 1; Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 17; Pl.'s Dep. at 201-04].
Plaintiff contends that Comcast failed to provide three specific accommodations: (1) Comcast should have changed Plaintiff's work location to a different building or site, or permitted him to telework; (2) Comcast should have "tested" Plaintiff's work area in an effort to determine what might be causing his problems; and (3) Comcast should have monitored Plaintiff's work area by installing a camera in order to potentially catch or expose [*20]  whoever might be poisoning him. [DSMF ¶ 7; see Pl.'s Answer to Def.'s Interrog. No. 18, at 9; see also Pl.'s Dep. at 204-06].
Comcast argues that Plaintiff's ADA failure-to-accommodate claim should be dismissed on summary judgment for three independent reasons: (1) Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not raising a failure-to-accommodate claim in his EEOC charge; (2) Plaintiff has failed to show that he is an individual with an ADA-covered disability; and (3) the instances of failure-to-accommodate that Plaintiff has asserted are not actionable as a matter of law. [Doc. 43-9, Def.'s Br., at 3-4]. For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that all three reasons have merit.

1. Plaintiff Failed to Assert a Failure-to-Accommodate Claim in his EEOC Charge.
Like Title VII, the ADA requires a plaintiff to first exhaust the available administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC before filing a lawsuit in court. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2001) (Title VII); 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(2); Maxwell v. Inner Harbour, Ltd., No. 1:08-CV-2925-RWS, 2009 WL 1045478, at *1-2 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 20, 2009) (stating that the administrative filing requirements are the same for claims brought under Title VII and the ADA). An ADA plaintiff may not bring any claim in his lawsuit that was not included in his [*21]  EEOC charge. See Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970) ("the 'scope' of the judicial complaint is limited to the 'scope' of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination")). Thus, a plaintiff is precluded from pursuing any ADA claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in his EEOC charge, or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. Id.; Thomas v. Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., 508 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1275 (N.D. Ga. 2007); see also Coon v. Ga. Pac. Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1568-69 (11th Cir. 1987) (limiting plaintiff's action in court to single claim contained in plaintiff's EEOC charge).
Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge of discrimination with the EEOC on March 19, 2018. [Doc. 43-6 at 2]. On the charge form, Plaintiff checked the boxes for disability and retaliation in the space for indicating the bases of the alleged discrimination. [Id.]. The charge alleges that the purported discrimination took place at the earliest, on November 13, 2017, and at the latest, on February 13, 2018, the date of Plaintiff's termination. [Id.]. In the space for providing a textual description of the alleged discrimination, Plaintiff stated:
I began working at Comcast in June 2014 as a field technician. After some time [*22]  off due to a vehicle accident, I transitioned to an inside technical support position in February 2017.
I began noticing that when I sat at my desk, I would get symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxin of some sort. It would generally only occur when a certain other employee was present on the premises. The symptoms would only occur at my desk and one time in my car leaving work when I noticed the presence of a foreign substance. Because the cause was environmental, my doctor was unable to determine an exact diagnosis. In November 2017, I was put on a paid leave of absence. I went for additional tests, but because the exposure to the toxin was only occurring at work, the tests were inconclusive. On February 13, 2018,1 was terminated from my position.
I never had any performance issues at work. I was terminated when I returned from my required medical leave of absence purely because the cause of my symptoms could not be determined with certainty. I believe I have been the victim of discrimination due to my medical condition in violation of The Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act (2009) (ADAAA) and retaliation by being terminated after reporting my medical condition to my employer and upon returning from medical leave.
Id. Nowhere [*23]  in Plaintiff's EEOC charge does he allege that he asked for any accommodation and that Comcast violated the ADA by failing to accommodate his disability. Nor does the charge identify any specific disability that Plaintiff contends Comcast failed to accommodate. The charge merely alleges that Plaintiff was a victim of discrimination due to his unspecified "medical condition" in violation of the ADA. [Id.]. Under similar circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit has held that where, like here, a plaintiff's complaint in federal court describes a "new act[ ] of discrimination," namely, a failure-to-accommodate claim that was not asserted in the plaintiff's EEOC charge, dismissal is appropriate for lack of exhaustion. See Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 835 (11th Cir. 2018); [DSMF ¶ 17].
Numerous courts in this and other circuits have similarly held. See, e.g., Andrews v. City of Hartford, No. 15-cv-00684-BJR-SRW, 2016 WL 4154685, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 3, 2016) (dismissing the plaintiff's ADA failure-to-accommodate claim because his EEOC charge "ma[de] no mention of [p]laintiff's request for reasonable accommodations nor how that request led to retaliation in the form of termination"), aff'd, 700 F. App'x 924 (11th Cir. 2017); Perry v. American Red Cross Blood Servs., 651 F. App'x 317, 323-24 (6th Cir. 2016) (holding that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies where her ADA charge of discrimination alleged that she was terminated [*24]  for excessive call-ins and absenteeism, but failed to mention "failure to accommodate" or the date of the alleged failure to accommodate); MacKenzie v. City & Cty. of Denver, 414 F.3d 1266, 1274 n.13 (10th Cir. 2005) (dismissing failure-to-accommodate claim where plaintiff did not allege it in her EEOC charge); Jones v. Sumser Ret. Vill., 209 F.3d 851, 853-54 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that a failure-to-accommodate claim could not reasonably be expected to grow out of claims in the plaintiff's EEOC charge that focused only on the plaintiff's termination, since that was "far different" than a failure-to-accommodate claim).
In this case, Plaintiff's EEOC charge did not explicitly (or even implicitly) allege that he asked Comcast to accommodate his disability, or that Comcast failed to accommodate his disability. Nor would such a claim reasonably grow out of the facts and claims that he asserted. Accordingly, Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not including the failure-to-accommodate allegation when he filed his claim with the EEOC. He is therefore precluded from asserting a failure-to-accommodate claim in the Amended Complaint that he filed in this Court.

2. Plaintiff Has Failed to Show that he is a Qualified Individual with a Disability Under the ADA.
Even if Plaintiff had administratively exhausted his [*25]  failure-to-accommodate claim (which he did not), summary judgment would still be granted for the independent reason that Plaintiff has failed to show that he is a qualified individual with a disability, under the ADA.
Under the ADA, an employer may not discriminate against "a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . discharge of employees." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). "[T]he term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "[A]n employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (italics in original). The burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365.
To establish a prima facie claim for failure to [*26]  accommodate, under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is disabled; (2) he was a "qualified individual" at the relevant time, meaning he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). "The plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job's essential functions." Id. at 1255-56. A plaintiff's failure to prove any element of his prima facie case defeats his ADA failure-to-accommodate claim. Allen v. City of Raleigh, 140 F. Supp. 3d 470 483 (E.D.N.C. 2015).
Once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee cannot reasonably be accommodated, because the accommodation would impose an undue hardship to the employer. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365.
A qualified individual with a disability is "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). The plaintiff, in other words, "must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, [*27]  or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). "Thus, if [the plaintiff] is unable to perform an essential function of his . . . job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a qualified individual and, therefore, not covered under the ADA." Id. (internal quote marks omitted).
The ADA defines the term "disability" as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). "Major life activities include, but are not limited to: '(i) caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i). An activity is "substantially limited" when an individual cannot perform an activity that an average person in the general population could perform, or faces significant restrictions in the condition, manner, or duration of time in which the individual can perform the major life activity. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(i)-(ii).
In making such a determination, courts apply the following three-step analysis: (1) consider [*28]  whether the alleged disability is a physical impairment; (2) identify the life activity upon which the plaintiff relies and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity; and (3) determine whether the impairment substantially limits the major life activity. See Hudson v. Tyson Farms, Inc., 769 F. App'x 911, 915 (11th Cir. 2019) (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998)).
Not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Id. at 916 ("A physical impairment, standing alone, however, is not necessarily a disability as contemplated by the ADA."). "In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, the EEOC advises that courts should consider: [i] the nature and severity of the impairment, (ii) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment." E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 614-15 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2).
In numerous cases like Plaintiff's, where the plaintiffs were experiencing episodic respiratory reactions mainly in the workplace, courts have frequently determined that the plaintiffs did not have a disability, as defined by the ADA, because there was not a substantial limitation on a major life activity as a matter of law. For example, in [*29]  Whitesell v. FMS Fin. Mgmt. Servs., LLC, No. 3:18-cv-00496, 2020 WL 2770017, at *1 (M.D. Tenn. May 28, 2020), the court considered whether the plaintiff's alleged disability of a fragrance allergy met the required standard for an ADA-qualifying disability in the context of a summary judgment motion. The court acknowledged that the 2009 amendments to the ADA were enacted to ensure "a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA." Id. at *4. Nevertheless, even with this more lenient standard, the court cautioned that "not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning [of the ADAAA]" and noted that the ADAAA "left untouched the plaintiff's burden of proof in a disability case," meaning that a plaintiff "still has to prove he has a disability." Id.
In its analysis, the Whitesell court took particular note of the episodic nature of the plaintiff's alleged fragrance allergy. Id. at *7. The court acknowledged that the plaintiff's allergic reactions "clearly affect[ed] Plaintiff's ability to breathe when [they occurred]," but also noted that those reactions only occurred when certain substances were present. Id. at *6-7. The Whitesell court pointed to numerous courts that had found that an employee's sensitivity to particular substances "was not a disability if the plaintiff was able to work and [*30]  breathe in the absence of those substances." Id. at *7. The court noted that "[w]hile asthma, allergies and 'bronchitis-related conditions' are physical impairments that can affect an individual's major life activity of breathing, these illnesses present in varying levels of severity and [a plaintiff] must still prove that [his] condition, be it asthma, allergies or bronchitis, substantially limits his ability to breathe." Id. (quoting Svoboda v. TimkenSteel Corp., No. 5:18-cv-01443, 2020 WL 1513710, at *7 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 30, 2020) (brackets in original)).
In Svoboda, the plaintiff had respiratory sensitivities to airborne agents that existed only at his place of work, which the court found was not enough to substantially limit the major life activity of breathing. Whitesell, 2020 WL 2770017, at *7 (citing Svoboda, at *8). Similarly, in Jackson v. Oil-Dri Corporation of America, No. 3:16-cv-189-DMB-RP, 2018 WL 1996474 (N.D. Miss. Apr. 27, 2018), the plaintiff asserted an ADA disability claim based on "asthma-like conditions." Id. at *2. On summary judgment, the Jackson court determined that the plaintiff had failed to show a substantial limitation on the major life activity of breathing within the meaning of the ADA because the plaintiff's alleged respiratory sensitivities only occurred at work. See id. at *6; see also Goldbolt v. Trinity Prot. Servs., Inc., No. GJH-14-3546, 2017 WL 2579020, at *10 (D. Md. June 12, 2017) (concluding that an asthma attack at work was not a disabling impairment as a matter of law); Jimenez-Jimenez v. Internat'l Hospitality Grp., Inc., No. 15-1461 (SCC), 2017 WL 5905529, at *8-9 (D.P.R. Nov. 30, 2017) (finding no evidence that the plaintiff's "severe allergic [*31]  condition that makes [the plaintiff] sensitive to the smell and breathing of some perfumes and chemicals" rendered him disabled within the meaning of the ADA where his "condition" was never triggered outside of his place of employment).
The same applies here. Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show that he suffers from a condition which makes him unable to perform a major life activity, or significantly restricts his ability to perform a major life activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). In Plaintiff's response to Comcast's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff claims that his disability is "unspecified asthma," but he cites no evidence that his breathing or "respiration" was ever substantially impaired. Nor is there any medical evidence in the record from which this Court could find that Plaintiff was substantially limited in his ability to breathe.
On the multiple occasions that Plaintiff left work to be evaluated and/or tested after he experienced an "episode," no medical doctor or medical personnel that evaluated Plaintiff could ever definitively identify or determine what, if any, airborne or other toxic substance was causing Plaintiff's intermittent symptoms at work. Nor do any of the records [*32]  indicate that Plaintiff ever complained of difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, a cough, or wheezing. [DSMF ¶ 6; Doc. 43-2 at 37]. In describing his symptoms, Plaintiff testified that his chief initial symptom was an unpleasant metal taste in his mouth every time. [DSMF ¶ 2; Pl.'s Dep. 80-83, 92]. Other symptoms included watery eyes, runny nose, pressure on his chest, and trouble concentrating, but he did not experience all of those symptoms every time he had an episode. In a medical treatment waiver form that Plaintiff submitted to Comcast, he described his symptoms as "dizziness, jittery feelings, . . . not able to focus feeling." [Doc. 43-2 at 17-18, Exs. 9, 10]. One doctor described Plaintiff's symptoms as "consistent with an isolated workplace exposure." [DSMF ¶ 6; Pl.'s Dep. Ex. 9 at 3; Pl.'s Dep. at 182, 187]. There is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff's condition was ever triggered outside of his workplace.7
Records submitted by Comcast show six documented instances (from July 12, 2017 through mid November 2017) where Plaintiff complained to Comcast managerial personnel that he was experiencing symptoms. [DSMF ¶ 5]. However, none of the treating physicians who examined [*33]  Plaintiff found that Plaintiff's ability to breathe was in any way impacted. [See Doc. 43-2 at 33-34, Caduceus patient visit on Nov. 16, 2017 ("Patient denies any difficulty breathing or other respiratory disorders. . . . He reports that the symptoms will go away after about twenty to twenty-five minutes. . . . Respiratory examination showed symmetric chest expansion, non-labored respiratory effort, normal chest excursion, and clear lung fields without evidence of wheezes, rales, or pleural rubs); Doc. 43-2 at 37-39, Ex. 19, Grady Hospital visit on December 6, 2017 ("he has intermittently noticed symptoms of runny nose, water[y] eyes, an odd taste in his mouth, that he describes as metallic, and chest tightness, but not shortness of breath"; Plaintiff's pulmonary examination showed equal chest rise, no respiratory distress, lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales)].
Moreover, Plaintiff has repeatedly reported that his symptoms would totally subside within fifteen to thirty minutes if he went outside to get some fresh air. [DSMF ¶ 3; Pl.'s Dep. at 91-94]. Plaintiff has offered not a shred of evidence of any respiratory problems outside of his workplace, [*34]  medical evidence showing a history of asthma before or after he worked for Comcast, or a record of having such a limitation. Even within the workplace, Plaintiff's episodes were intermittent, sporadic, and of relatively short duration. As noted above, numerous courts have held that "individuals suffering from respiratory sensitivity to airborne agents [can]not show a substantial limitation on the major life activity of breathing within the meaning of the ADA[ ]" when the irritating agents only existed at the plaintiff's place of work. See Jimenez-Jimenez, 2017 WL 5905529, at *8 (collecting cases). At the most, the evidence supports a finding that, due to his employment, Plaintiff occasionally experienced short-term symptoms that were diagnosed, based solely on Plaintiff's subjective reports, as unspecified asthma of unknown severity.
Based on the evidence before this Court, the Court cannot conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff's ability to breathe was substantially limited, or that his episodic symptoms at his workplace substantially impacted any other major life activity, as that term is defined in the ADA and referenced in applicable case law.
Further, when Plaintiff's symptoms [*35]  were presumably triggered by something in his workplace, and he became dizzy, unable to concentrate, and was forced to leave the workplace to get fresh air, those symptoms or allergic reactions took Plaintiff away from his desk and work duties (to get fresh air and/or to seek medical evaluation and testing) for collectively what ultimately amounted to a significant period of time. Plaintiff has failed to show that he could perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation. Because Plaintiff has not provided probative evidence that he could perform his job's essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation, he has not shown that he is a "qualified individual" for purposes of the ADA. See Dickerson v. Sec., Dep't of Veterans Affairs Agency, 489 F. App'x 358, 361-62 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming grant of summary judgment where nurse employed by the VA failed to establish disability discrimination absent showing that she could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation for her occupational asthma and multiple chemical sensitivity).

3. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he requested accommodations for an alleged disability, under the ADA.
As noted earlier, Plaintiff asserts that Comcast failed to provide [*36]  three specific accommodations: (1) a change of work locations, such as moving him to a different building or permitting him to telework; (2) testing his work area to help determine what might be causing his problems; and/or (3) monitoring his work area by installing a camera or cameras to potentially catch whoever might be poisoning him.
Under the ADA, the burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee. An employer's duty to provide an accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made. See Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 1999) ("both our precedent and the EEOC's interpretive guidelines clearly provide that the initial burden of requesting an accommodation is on the employee"); Brooks v. Phoenix Metals Co., No. 1:15-cv-3612-ODE-JKL, 2017 WL 11093573, at *17 (N.D. Ga. May 22, 2017) ("An employer's duty to provide an accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made"), adopted by No. 1:15-cv-3612-ODE, 2017 WL 11093677 (N.D. Ga. June 28, 2017).
In this case, Plaintiff testified that he never asked anyone at Comcast to be relocated to another building or work site, or to telework. [DSMF ¶ 8; Pl.'s Dep. at 204-05]. In fact, the record shows that Plaintiff asked that he not be moved from the cubicle where he initially started experiencing symptoms. [Pl.'s Dep. at 111]. In any event, the record shows that in an effort [*37]  to address Plaintiff's complaints, Comcast did move his desk to a different location, albeit not at Plaintiff's request. Plaintiff testified, however, that even after he was moved, he continued to have the same "issues." [Pl.'s Dep. at 92-93]. Plaintiff denies that he ever asked Comcast to move him to a different building, work site, or that he be permitted to telework. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim that Comcast violated the ADA by not providing him with this alleged accommodation fails as a matter of law.
Plaintiff's second failure-to-accommodate claim is based on his assertion that Comcast should have tested his work area. [DSMF ¶ 7; Pl.'s Dep. at 205-06; Pl.'s Answer to Interrog. No. 18 at 9]. However, as with the first claim discussed above, Plaintiff testified that he does not recall ever specifically asking anyone at Comcast to test his work area, and Comcast has confirmed that he did not. [Pl.'s Dep. at 205-06; DSMF ¶ 9; Wells Decl. ¶ 20].
Plaintiff's third and final failure-to-accommodate claim is based on his assertion that Comcast should have installed a security camera or cameras to monitor his work area to potentially expose or "catch" whoever might be trying to poison or [*38]  harm him, as suggested by the Grady report. [DSMF ¶ 7; Pl.'s Answer to Interrog. No. 18 at 9].
Under the ADA, an accommodation is reasonable and necessary only if it will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of the job. See Williams v. Revco Disc. Drug Ctrs., Inc., 552 F. App'x 919, 921 (11th Cir. 2014); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of his job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that such an accommodation is reasonable. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (citing Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997)). Under the ADA, an employee is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Furthermore, "where a plaintiff cannot demonstrate 'reasonable accommodation,' the employer's lack of investigation into reasonable accommodation is unimportant." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367 (citing Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Finally, before an employer has a duty to show undue hardship, the plaintiff first must show that a reasonable accommodation exists. See id. (citing Willis, 108 F.3d at 286).
Plaintiff's failure to identify a reasonable accommodation is fatal to his ADA claim. By Plaintiff's own admission, his request that Comcast monitor his work area was not so that he might work even with his alleged disability, [*39]  but rather so that the security camera might "expose" the person who might be putting a toxic substance in his work area that he believed was negatively affecting him. [DSMF ¶ 7; Pl.'s Dep. at 150-52, 208]. Plaintiff acknowledged in his deposition that his request was more akin to a request for an "investigation" to help determine the cause of his symptoms, rather than an accommodation that would allow him to perform the essential functions of his job.8
Even if Plaintiff's request for video monitoring of his desk could arguably be considered to be an ADA-qualifying accommodation, Plaintiff has not shown that Comcast's decision not to install round-the-clock camera monitoring of Plaintiff's work space was unreasonable. Comcast has submitted uncontroverted evidence that it declined to install cameras directed at Plaintiff's work area because of customer privacy concerns and a persistent lack of evidence to support Plaintiff's claim that someone was trying to harm or poison him. [DSMF ¶ 10; Wells Decl. ¶ 18; Pl.'s Dep. at 151-52]. According to Nikita Wells, while Comcast sometimes permits cameras in common, non-work areas like hallways or breakrooms in its corporate offices, Comcast's policy [*40]  is not to have cameras in work areas where customer information could be viewed or recorded. [Wells Decl. ¶ 18]. As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, "[w]hatever the obligations of an employer are under the ADA to accommodate an employee, they do not extend to engaging in generalized negotiations with an employee concerning the employer's workplace rules and policies for all employees." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286. Moreover, as noted above, an employer is not required to provide "every conceivable accommodation possible." Id. at 1285. Nor is a qualified individual with a disability "entitled to the accommodation of [his] choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." Id. at 1286.
The undisputed evidence shows that Comcast made numerous efforts (other than installing security cameras aimed at his desk) to try and address Plaintiff's concerns, including (1) taking him to see a doctor on two occasions when he said he was experiencing symptoms [DSMF ¶ 11; Pl.'s Dep. at 79, 83-84, 154-156); (2) getting the company's security department involved to meet with Plaintiff several times in furtherance of its investigation into his concerns that someone was trying to poison him [DSMF ¶ 11, Pl.'s Dep. at 135-37]; (3) taking Plaintiff to two medical [*41]  visits to try and get a doctor's referral so that Plaintiff could obtain a toxicology examination from the Georgia Poison Control Center [DSMF ¶ 11; Pl's Dep. at 129-31, 134, 149, 154-160, 162-64, 166]; (4) investigating what its pest control service was using on the floor where Plaintiff worked [Wells Decl. ¶ 12]; (5) moving Plaintiff and the person he originally thought was trying to poison him so that they were not sitting or working near each other [DSMF ¶ 11; Pl.'s Dep. at 62, 111-12, 121-22]; (6) placing Plaintiff on paid administrative leave for his own safety while efforts were made to schedule a toxicology examination [Wells Decl. ¶ 14]; and (7) supporting Plaintiff's request to undergo toxicology testing to see if he had been poisoned [DSMF ¶ 11; Pl.'s Dep. at 166]. Comcast also offered to take Plaintiff to see a doctor on at least three other occasions when he said he was experiencing symptoms, which Plaintiff declined. [DSMF ¶ 12; Pl.'s Dep. at 94, 122-23, 127-29].
In sum, for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, Plaintiff has failed address or show that he was capable of performing the essential functions of his employment position "with or without reasonable accommodation." [*42]  42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). He has also failed to meet his burden of identifying any reasonable accommodation that he sought, but was denied, that would have allowed him to perform his job's essential functions. For this and the other reasons discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the ADA. Accordingly, Comcast's motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's Count One claim of failure to accommodate is GRANTED.

B. Retaliation Claim (Count Two)
For the same or similar reasons, Plaintiff's Count Two claim of retaliation, in violation of the ADA, also fails.
The ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposing an unlawful practice or making a charge under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To prevail on his ADA retaliation claim, Plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the two. Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2016); Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., 513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir. 2008). The first element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation. Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (citing Standard v. A.B.E.L. Serv. Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998)). The third element requires a showing of but-for causation. Id. (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 362 (2013)).
In support of his retaliation claim, Plaintiff argues that he was terminated because he requested [*43]  an accommodation. Plaintiff specifically argues that he "requested an accommodation when he complained on more than one occasion about his illness at work to members of management and asked for a modification to his work location which was granted when he was moved away from the employee he believed was involved in the flare up of his condition." [Doc. 50, Pl.'s Resp. Br., at 8-9]. However, this argument is contrary to Plaintiff's sworn deposition testimony, where Plaintiff stated that he never asked to be moved, and in fact objected to having his desk or work location moved because he liked his desk and did not feel like he was the cause of his issues. [Pl.'s Dep. at 111].
Plaintiff has not presented or pointed to any probative evidence in the record where he affirmatively requested a reasonable accommodation, identified to whom he made such a request, or on what date he made such a request, or who denied it. Instead, Plaintiff contends his claim is based on the fact that he provided medical recommendations in the form of the records brought back from his medical appointment at Grady Hospital "wherein his treating doctor recommended testing of his work area." [Doc. 50, Pl.'s Resp. [*44]  Br., at 9; Pl.'s Dep. at 209-11]. Plaintiff, however, has failed to cite any binding case law or statutory authority for the proposition that merely submitting medical records regarding a negative toxicology screen is sufficient to constitute an affirmative request for reasonable accommodation.
Without any facts, evidentiary support, or legal authority to support his retaliation claim, Plaintiff has failed to show that he satisfied the first element of his retaliation claim by engaging in protected activity. Plaintiff has not produced any evidence that, at the time he was asking for his employer to help figure out what was bothering him, he believed that he was disabled or that such a belief was objectively reasonable. Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998). Plaintiff now argues that his "unspecified asthma" was a disability, without any grounds for that conclusion. As discussed earlier, the mere existence of a physical impairment or sensitivity does not constitute a disability under the ADA; the impairment must substantially limit a major life activity. Id. This, Plaintiff has failed to show. The uncontroverted medical evidence in the record shows that on each and every occasion where Plaintiff was evaluated for exposure [*45]  to a purported toxic substance at work, the doctors found no physical symptoms to support his claim, and recommended that Plaintiff be returned to work the same day without restrictions. Plaintiff has not introduced any evidence that his doctors, or anyone else, gave him reason to consider his alleged "unspecified asthma" as impairing his ability to breathe or to work in a long-term or permanent way. See id. Having failed to introduce any evidence that would allow a rational factfinder to conclude that Plaintiff's belief that he was disabled under the ADA was objectively reasonable, Plaintiff cannot establish the first element of his prima facie case. Id. (citing Talanda v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 140 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming summary judgment for defendant when plaintiff's belief that employee was disabled, as defined in the ADA, was not reasonable).
Plaintiff has also failed to provide any probative evidence from which the Court could infer that any request for reasonable accommodation that Plaintiff affirmatively made was the but-for cause of his termination. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA.
Summary judgment is also due to be granted for the separate and independent [*46]  reason that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his current retaliation claim. Comcast argues that Plaintiff's retaliation claim is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, because his EEOC charge merely alleges that Comcast terminated him "purely" because the Grady toxicology exam was negative and/or because he reported his alleged medical condition to Comcast, whereas he claims in this federal lawsuit that he was fired because he asked, as reasonable accommodations, for the testing and/or monitoring that was mentioned in the Grady report. [Doc. 43-9 at 19-21, citing Duble v. FedEx Ground Pkg. Sys., Inc., 572 F. App'x 889, 892 (11th Cir. 2014) ("allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate for a post-charge judicial complaint"); Andrews v. City of Hartford, No. 15-cv-00684-BJR-SRW, 2016 WL 4154685, at *5 (M.D. Ala. Aug. 3, 2015) (dismissing plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim because the plaintiff did not include it in his EEOC charge)]. The Court agrees.
Plaintiff's EEOC charge speaks only of retaliation for reporting his medical condition to his employer upon returning from medical leave "purely because the cause of [his] symptoms could not be determined with certainty." [Doc. 43-6 at 2]. No reasonable EEOC investigator could have concluded from Plaintiff's EEOC charge that what Plaintiff was complaining [*47]  about was Comcast's alleged failure to accommodate a request for the testing and/or monitoring that was mentioned in the Grady report (based on Plaintiff's subjective belief that someone was trying to poison him), and that Comcast unlawfully discharged Plaintiff for requesting those accommodations. Consequently, Plaintiff's judicial complaint does not "amplify, clarify or more clearly focus" the allegations in his EEOC charge. Rather, Plaintiff's retaliation claim alleges "new acts of discrimination." This is inappropriate. See Andrews, 2016 WL 4154685, at *5. For the reasons stated, Plaintiff's Count Two retaliation claim is barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

VI. SUMMARY
In this case, Plaintiff has failed to produce or point to any probative evidence showing that Plaintiff is disabled as defined in the ADA, that he is a "qualified individual," that Comcast violated the ADA by failing to accommodate his alleged disability, or that he was subjected to unlawful retaliation because of his disability. As discussed above, Plaintiff has not supported his claim with probative medical evidence of a disability. Instead, Plaintiff has referred ambiguously to a "medical condition" and/or "unspecified asthma," [*48]  which he has failed to describe with any degree of specificity. In the absence of any credible evidence to support his claim, Plaintiff's unsupported arguments are insufficient to withstand Comcast's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff's claims are also barred by the failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
For all the stated reasons, Comcast's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 43] with respect to Plaintiff's ADA claims of failure to accommodate and retaliation is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED, this 24th day of November, 2020.
