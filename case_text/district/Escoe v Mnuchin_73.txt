Order and Judgment
The Court has considered Defendant Secretary Steven Mnuchin's motion for summary judgment, together with the moving and opposing papers.
From March, 1995, to July, 2014, Plaintiff Michael Escoe was employed by the Internal Revenue Service ["IRS"] as a Revenue Agent. As a Revenue Agent, Escoe conducted tax audits on behalf of the IRS. The grounds for, and the date of, Escoe's termination are disputed. Escoe alleged that he provided the IRS with an "involuntary resignation letter," effective July, 28, 2014. The IRS argued that it issued a final decision letter terminating Escoe on July 29, 2014, and effective on August 8, 2014. The IRS avered that it terminated Escoe for, inter alia, excessive absences, while Escoe contends that he was terminated, or constructively terminated, because of his disability and age, and because he filed various Equal [*2]  Employment Opportunity ["EEO"] complaints.
On December 13, 2016, Escoe filed, pro se, this action, alleging: (1) Violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. ["Title VII"] based on a hostile work environment, retaliation, and reprisal; (2) Failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. ["ADA"]; and (3) Violations of his First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendment rights.
On May 22, 2017, Secretary Mnuchin moved to dismiss, arguing that he failed to timely file this action after he received the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's ["EEOC"] decision on his EEO complaints. Because Escoe had filed multiple EEO complaints, the outcome of the motion to dismiss turned on which EEO complaint Escoe based this lawsuit on. In his opposition to the motion to dismiss, Escoe clarified that this action was based on EEO complaint Number IRS 15-1616. Because this action was timely filed if predicated on IRS 15-1616, the Court denied the motion.
Secretary Mnuchin, now, moves for summary judgment on all of Escoe's claims.
Although Escoe styled his claims regarding adverse employment actions based on his disability as Title VII and ADA claims, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. [*3] , is the exclusive remedy for disability discrimination claims by federal employees. See Leno v. Dep't. of Veterans Affairs, 211 F. App'x. 554, *1 (9th Cir. 2006). Accordingly, to the extent that Escoe's Title VII and ADA claims are predicated on disability discrimination, the Court will liberally construe those claims as properly brought under the Rehabilitation Act. See Leno, 211 F. App'x. at *1.
Secretary Mnuchin argued that Escoe's Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims are barred because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, a statutory precondition to filing suit. See Vinieratos v. U.S. Dep't. of Air Force Through Aldridge, 939 F.2d 762, 773 (9th Cir. 1991). The Ninth Circuit is split on whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies for a Rehabilitation Act claim is jurisdictional, thereby placing the burden on Escoe, or merely an affirmative defense, thereby placing the burden on Secretary Mnuchin. See Stanfill v. Johnson, 203 Fed. App'x. 72, *1 (9th Cir. 2006), Boyd v. United States Postal Servs., 752 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir. 1985). For purposes of this motion, and because Escoe is pro se, the Court will follow the line of district court cases in this Circuit holding that the burden is on the defendant. See Munoz-Munoz v. Locke, CV 10-1475-JCC, 2012 WL 12925022, *4 (W.D. Wash. Oct. 24, 2012).
When considering a motion for summary judgment where the moving party has the burden of proof at trial, as Secretary Mnuchin has here on the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, Secretary Mnuchin has the initial burden of establishing, with admissible evidence, a prima facie case for this defense. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If Secretary Mnuchin meets his initial burden on his motion, then the burden shifts to Escoe to show the existence of a triable [*4]  issue of material fact to avoid the granting of a partial summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.
As part of exhausting his administrative remedies, a federal employee alleging discrimination must, first, consult with an EEO counselor within forty-five days of the discriminatory act or personnel action. Munoz v. Locke, 634 F. App'x. 166, 167 (9th Cir. 2015). Failure to do so bars any subsequent Title VII or Rehabilitation claims in federal court. See Kraus v. Presidio Tr. Facilities Div./Residential Mgmt. Branch, 572 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir. 2009).
Secretary Mnuchin provided the Court with a copy of EECO file Number IRS 15-1616. Based on the file, the date that Escoe first contacted an EEO counselor with regard to IRS 15-1616 was September 2, 2015, eleven months after his employment with the IRS ended. Thus, Secretary Mnuchin established a prima facie case that Escoe failed to timely exhaust his administrative remedies. See Vinieratos, 939 F.2d at 773.
Escoe did not argue that the EEOC file provided to the Court was improperly authenticated, nor did he dispute the information contained therein. Rather, Escoe argued that because the basis for his IRS 15-1616 complaint was that his managers harassed him based on his age and disability during the post-termination disability retirement application process, his EEO consult and complaint were timely. However, the allegations before [*5]  the Court are that the IRS discriminated against him during his tenure at the IRS.
Claims not argued in the relevant EEO complaint may not be considered by a federal court unless those claims are like or reasonably related to the allegations contained in the EEO charge. See Mesbah v. Ashcroft, 14 F. App'x. 952, 954 (9th Cir. 2001). Whether the claims are reasonably related turns on whether the claims first raised in federal court can "reasonably be expected to grow" out of the claims raised in the EEO complaint. See Mesbah, 14 F. App'x. at 954. Alleged acts of discrimination during employment cannot reasonably be expected to grow from alleged acts of discrimination post-employment because the allegations involve distinctively different acts at different points in time. See generally, Pezzillo v. Evans, 131 F. App'x. 106, *1 (9th Cir. 2005). Because the allegations before the Court exceed the scope of the relevant EEO complaint, Escoe failed to exhaust his administrative remedies for the claims presently before the Court.
Thus, Escoe failed to raise a triable issue of fact to survive summary judgment with regard to his Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims.
Secretary Mnuchin, also, seeks summary judgment on Escoe's claims that his First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.
Escoes seeks, inter alia, damages and reinstatement for the IRS's [*6]  allegedly unconstitutional actions against him. Sovereign immunity extends to United States agents and officers where they are sued in their official capacity for actions within the scope of their employment. Zamora v. Gonzalez, 15 F.3d 1095, *2 (9th Cir. 1994). Only where this immunity has been explicitly waived can an action be brought against the United States. Zamora, 15 F.3d at *2. The United States has not waived sovereign immunity for suits for damages based on allegations of constitutional violations by its employees. Zamora, 15 F.3d at *2. Therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Escoe's First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendment claims against Secretary Mnuchin in his official capacity to the extent that Escoe seeks monetary damages. See Zamora, 15 F.3d at *2.
To the extent the Escoe's claims are not barred by sovereign immunity, Escoe failed to provide any evidence to establish a prima facie case for any of the alleged violations of his constitutional rights. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. When considering a motion for summary judgment, where the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, as Escoe has here, summary judgment should be granted when the nonmoving party fails to produce evidence to establish a prima facie case. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Secretary Mnuchin, as the moving party, however, has the initial burden to show that Escoe does [*7]  not have enough evidence to establish a prima facie case for his claims. See Williams v. Gerber Prods. Co., 552 F. 3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2008). Secretary Mnuchin has met this initial burden. Thus, the burden shifts to Escoe to establish, with admissible evidence, a prima facie case for his claims. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.
Although Escoe alleged that he was terminated for speaking to an auditee about purportedly illegal actions the IRS may be taking against the auditee, in violation of the First Amendment, he failed to show, with admissible evidence, inter alia, that he spoke as a private citizen and that his protected speech was the substantial or motivating factor in his termination. See Eng v. Cooley, 552 F.3d 1062, 1070-1072 (9th Cir. 2009). Indeed the only "evidence" Escoe provided are bald, conclusory statements.
Further, Escoe failed to set forth any basis, let alone evidence, for his Fourth or Sixth Amendment claims.
Accordingly,
It is Ordered that the Secretary Mnuchin's motion for summary judgment be, and hereby is, Granted.
It is further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that Judgment be, and hereby is, Entered in favor of Defendant Secretary Steven Mnuchin and against Plaintiff Michael Escoe as to all of Plaintiff's claims.
It is further Ordered that Plaintiff shall take nothing.
