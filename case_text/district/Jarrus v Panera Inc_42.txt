REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [ECF NO. 32]

I. Introduction
Plaintiff Michael Jarrus sues Panera, Inc., under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA), M.C.L. § 37.1101 et seq. [ECF No. 1].1 He alleges that Panera discriminated against him by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability from multiple sclerosis and that its discrimination led to an adverse employment action. [ECF No. 1, PageID.4-7]. Panera moves for summary judgment under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. [ECF No. 32]. [ECF No. 4]. Except for Panera's request for exemplary or punitive damages under the PWDCRA, the Court recommends that Panera's summary judgment motion be denied.

II. Background
Jarrus's alleges that his multiple sclerosis limits his mobility. [ECF No. 1, PageID.3]. He claims that when he applied for work at Panera in April 2018, he informed Panera of his "disability and limitations," that is, that "he could not lift heavy [*2]  items and had limited mobility." [Id.]. Jarrus alleges that Panera agreed to accommodate his limitations, but that soon after he began working for Panera, he was required to do the "duties that were beyond the agreed-upon accommodations," and his complaints were ignored. [Id., PageID.3-4]. While working at Panera in May 2018, Jarrus "[s]lipped on a pile of boxes" and fell into a door, injuring his shoulder. [Id., PageID.4; ECF No. 32-6, PageID.134; ECF No. 32-5, PageID.129].
Jarrus applied for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act for the period beginning on May 24, 2018, but was found ineligible, so he has been on a non-FMLA unpaid leave of absence. [ECF No. 32-3, PageID.124; ECF No. 32-4, PageID.127]. He is technically still employed by Panera. [ECF No. 32-7, PageID.137].
Jarrus's complaint alleges disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and the PWDCRA. [ECF No. 1, PageID.4-6]. He claims that he suffered emotional distress, mental anguish, pain, suffering, economic damages, loss of employability and medical expenses as a direct and proximate result of Panera's actions. [Id., PageID.5, 7]. Jarrus seeks compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages under the ADA and the [*3]  PWDCRA. [Id., PageID.7].

III. Analysis

A.
Panera argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 56. [ECF No. 32]. Rule 12(b)(6) tests a complaint's legal sufficiency. "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). The Iqbal Court explained, "[a] claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. The complaint's allegations "must do more than create speculation or suspicion of a legally cognizable cause of action; they must show entitlement to relief." League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Bredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 2007).
"The Court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Rule 56(a). The Court's function at the summary judgment stage "is not [ ] to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the Court of the basis for its motion [*4]  and must specify the portions of the record that show the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the movant satisfies this burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to go beyond the pleadings and set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324. The Court must view the factual evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007).
Here, Panera asserts that Jarrus cannot establish any adverse employment action; that he failed to properly request an accommodation in accordance with Panera's procedures; that the state worker's compensation statute is Jarrus's exclusive remedy for his injuries; that he is estopped from claiming backpay damages; and that Jarrus cannot recover punitive or exemplary damages. All of Panera's arguments except that related to Jarrus's request for exemplary damages under the PWDRA lack merit.

B.
Under the ADA, it is unlawful for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of a disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Unlawful [*5]  discrimination includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical . . . limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability" unless the employer "can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship." § 12112(b)(5)(A). The PWDCRA "substantially mirrors the ADA, and resolution of a plaintiff's ADA claim will generally, though not always, resolve the plaintiff's PWDCRA claim." Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 764 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). An exception is that the PWDCRA requires that a request for an accommodation be made in writing. M.C.L. § 37.1210(18). Thus, the Court's analysis of Jarrus's ADA claim applies equally to his PWDCRA claim, except as it relates to Jarrus's alleged failure to provide written notice of a need for an accommodation.
Jarrus asserts two claims of discrimination under the ADA and PWDCRA: (1) failure to accommodate, and (2) adverse employment action. [ECF No. 35, PageID.202; ECF No. 1, PageID.4-7, ¶¶ 21, 24, 33, 37]. Panera argues that the evidence does not support that Jarrus properly requested a reasonable accommodation and that he did not suffer an adverse employment action. The Court disagrees.

1. Failure to Accommodate under ADA
Jarrus may prove failure to accommodate [*6]  through either direct or circumstantial evidence. Rowan v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., 360 F.3d 544, 547-48 (6th Cir. 2004). "Direct evidence is evidence that proves the existence of a fact without requiring any inferences." Id. at 548. If a claimant relies on circumstantial evidence, the court must consider the evidence under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under that framework, to establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate, Jarrus must show that "(1) [he] is disabled within the meaning of the Act; (2) [he] is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) [his] employer knew or had reason to know about [his] disability; (4) [he] requested an accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide the necessary accommodation." Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Dist., 443 F. App'x 974, 982-83 (6th Cir. 2011). As it relates to this prima facie test, Panera only contests Jarrus's claim that he properly requested a reasonable accommodation. [ECF No. 32, PageID.105-108; ECF No. 36; PageID.268]. The ADA does not require that an accommodation request contain any "magic words" or be made in a specific manner. Moore v. Hexacomb Corp., 670 F. Supp. 2d 621, 630 (W.D. Mich. 2009).
Panera asserts that Jarrus failed to avail himself of its established procedure for requesting an accommodation. [ECF No. 32, PageID.105-108]. It also highlights that Jarrus testified that he did [*7]  not "know what accommodations would need to be provided because [he] never did the job before." [ECF No. 36, PageID.266; ECF No. 36-1, PageID.276]. Panera argues, "The ADA requires that the employee identify a specific accommodation." [ECF No. 36, PageID.266 (emphasis in original)].
Panera is right that the ADA requires a plaintiff to show that he proposed a reasonable accommodation. Rorrer v. City of Stow, 743 F.3d 1025, 1041 (6th Cir. 2014). But as described below, Jarrus presents evidence that he did request reasonable accommodations. And when an employee proposes a reasonable accommodation for a disability, the ADA mandates that the employer and employee engage in a communicative and good faith "interactive process" and "individualized inquiry," the purpose of which "is to identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." Keith v. Cty. of Oakland, 703 F.3d 918, 929 (6th Cir. 2013) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). During this process, the focus must be on "the actual disability and the effect that disability has on the particular individual's ability to perform the job." Keith, 703 F.3d at 923.
As applied to Jarrus's claims, the term "reasonable accommodation" means "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work [*8]  environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(ii). Here, Jarrus's testimony indicates that he requested reasonable modifications to the normal duties of a cashier: not having to bus tables and being able to use a cart.
Jarrus testified that, during his job interview, he told Panera's manager and assistant manager, Laura Forsyth and Sophia Lapuma, that he did not "think [he] would have the capability of bussing any tables." [ECF No. 35-1, PageID.222-223]. More emphatically, he said, "I told them I couldn't, absolutely couldn't do it. I didn't want to try. But I got there and they said it was fine. They would make the accommodation and all that." [Id., PageID.223]. Jarrus testified that he offered Forsyth and Lapuma a copy of a prescription signed by "Dr. G" of Beaumont "explaining what accommodations would be needed," but Forsyth and Lapuma refused to take the prescription and "completely ignored the fact that [he] had a prescription." [Id., PageID.223-225].
Jarrus said that when he began working at Panera, [*9]  he was forced to run to get customer orders, to bus tables and to carry coffee canisters that weighed 50 pounds. [ECF No. 35-1, PageID.223-225]. He testified that he complained to managers, including Lapuma, that he was in pain. [Id.]. He said he asked to be able to use an available cart "numerous times," but his request for that accommodation was rejected. [Id., PageID.223]. "[T]hey said they would not accommodate me with a cart because it was an eyesore to the customers." [Id.]. A manager named Andy said that Jarrus should be grateful because bussing tables was the easiest job. [Id., PageID.225]. Jarrus responded, "I have limited mobility, how can I be grateful." [Id.]. He continued, "It was constant, me telling them it hurt, they're causing me pain. Asking could I have an accommodation. That was all constant." [Id.].
Panera argues that its employees, including Forsyth and Lapuma, denied that Jarrus requested a reasonable accommodation. But "[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge" ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Instead, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant [*10]  is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Id.
Panera also argues that Jarrus failed to follow the established procedure of directing a request for an accommodation to the human resources manager. [ECF No. 32, PageID.106-107]. It is true that "when an employer has an established procedure for requesting an accommodation, the employee must ordinarily avail [himself] of that procedure." Reeves v. Case W. Reserve Univ., No. 1:07-CV-1860, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90308, 2009 WL 3242049, at *12 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 30, 2009). But Forsyth testified that she was "the right person" from whom Jarrus should have requested an accommodation and that Jarrus could have asked "any one of the managers" for an accommodation. [ECF No. 35-2, PageID.244-245]. A reasonable jury could thus find that Jarrus's alleged requests for accommodations made to Panera managers were in accord with the established procedure.
Jarrus's testimony, then, raises questions of fact about whether he asked for the accommodations of not having to bus tables and of using a cart. Panera's briefing does not contest that these accommodations were reasonable as defined under § 1630.2(o)(ii) or explain why it did not provide those accommodations. Jarrus's testimony also sufficiently raises questions for the jury about whether Panera failed to engage [*11]  in a good faith interactive process to address Jarrus's need for accommodations, and also failed to provide him with necessary accommodations. Since Panera has not contested that Jarrus can meet the other elements of a prima facie reasonable accommodation claim, summary judgment of that claim should be denied. See Johnson, 443 F. App'x at 982-83

2. Failure to Accommodate under the PWDCRA
The PWDCRA requires proof that Jarrus notified Panera "in writing of the need for accommodation within 182 days after the date the person with a disability knew or reasonably should have known that an accommodation was needed." § 37.1210(18). The Michigan Court of Appeals recently found that the language of § 37.1210(18) "suggests that the disabled person need only inform the employer that he or she needs an accommodation, without necessarily proposing one, at least within the 182-day time limit." Spraggins v. Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan, No. 345636, 2020 Mich. App. LEXIS 4184, 2020 WL 3621293, at *5 (Mich. Ct. App. July 2, 2020). And "in certain situations a request for accommodation can be inferred by context." Id. at *6 (citation and quotation marks omitted).
During his deposition, Jarrus testified that he did not request an accommodation in writing. [ECF No. 32-19, PageID.183]. But he also testified that, at his interview, he offered Forsyth and Lapuma a copy of a prescription "explaining what [*12]  accommodations would be needed," but they refused to take the prescription and "completely ignored the fact that I had a prescription." [ECF No. 35-1, PageID.223]. The prescription allegedly explained that Jarrus had limited mobility. [Id.]. Jarrus referred to the prescription and Panera's alleged refusal to consider it several times during his deposition. [Id., PageID.223-225]. The Court finds that this testimony creates a question of fact for the jury to decide whether to infer that Jarrus offered a request for accommodation in writing during his interview, as required by § 37.1210(18).

3. Adverse Employment Action
Jarrus alleges that he suffered ADA and PWDCRA discrimination in the form of an adverse employment action, and that he was constructively discharged. [ECF No. 1, PageID.5; ECF No. 35; PageID.204-207]. For this claim, he must show that he "(1) is disabled, (2) otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, with or without accommodation, and (3) suffered an adverse employment action because of his or her disability." Ferrari v. Ford Motor Co., 826 F.3d 885, 891 (6th Cir. 2016). As it relates to this prima facie test, Panera challenges only Jarrus's claim that he suffered an adverse employment action. Panera notes that Jarrus [*13]  must show that he suffered a "materially adverse changes in the terms or conditions" of his employment, and that the change "must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities." Mitchell v. Vanderbilt Univ., 389 F.3d 177, 182 (6th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Panera emphasizes that Jarrus is technically on leave and still employed by Panera. [ECF No. 32, PageID.103-104]. Jarrus counters that the terms of his employment have material changed in that he was forced to go on leave and was constructively discharged because of Panera's failure to accommodate him. [ECF No. 35, PageID.204-207]. In support of his argument, Jarrus relies extensively on Talley v. Family Dollar Stores of Ohio, Inc., 542 F.3d 1099, 1107 (6th Cir. 2008).
In Talley, the defendant prohibited the plaintiff from using a stool for her disability, and the record suggested that the use of a stool was a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 1103-1104, 1108. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had abandoned her job, but the plaintiff argued that she was constructively discharged in "that the defendants' failure to accommodate her disability was the impetus for her involuntary resignation." Id. at 1104-1105. The Sixth Circuit found that her claim withstood the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
Assuming that Talley was denied a reasonable accommodation [*14]  that forced her to work in excess of her medical restrictions, a reasonable jury could infer that the defendants knew that Talley's working conditions would become intolerable to a reasonable person suffering from her particular disability. The plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that her failure to return to work and eventual discharge was a foreseeable and intended result of the company's action in refusing to allow her to use a stool and refusing to hold a meeting to resolve the issue.
Id. at 1109.
The Talley court thus reversed the decision by the district court to grant summary judgment. Id. In granting summary judgment, the district court reasoned that the plaintiff was not formally discharged for months after her last day of work, when she was told that she would have to either work without a stool or resign. Id. Rejecting that reasoning, the Sixth Circuit concluded that there was "a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether her working conditions would have been so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have felt compelled to resign." Id.
Panera argues in its reply that Jarrus did not plead a constructive [*15]  discharge claim, citing a Michigan Court of Appeals opinion stating that "constructive discharge is not in itself a cause of action." Vagts v. Perry Drug Stores, Inc., 204 Mich. App. 481, 487, 516 N.W.2d 102 (1994). But Jarrus does not argue that constructive discharge is a separate cause of action. He argues that, under Tally's interpretation of the ADA, "a complete failure to accommodate, in the face of repeated requests, might suffice as evidence to show the deliberateness necessary for constructive discharge." Tally, 542 F.3d 1109 (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Besides, Jarrus is not required to prove that he was constructively discharged. He must show that he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability—a change in the terms or conditions of his employment that is more than a mere inconvenience or alteration of job responsibilities. Ferrari, 826 F.3d at 891; Mitchell, 389 F.3d at 182. Jarrus alleges that he has been on unpaid medical leave since May 2018. An unpaid medical leave is a change of his employment that is more than a mere inconvenience or alteration of job responsibilities.
Panera notes that Jarrus testified that he does not want to return to work there. [ECF No. 32-8, PageID.139]. But if Jarrus "was denied a reasonable accommodation that forced [him] to work in excess of [his] medical [*16]  restrictions, a reasonable jury could infer that [Panera] knew that [Jarrus's] working conditions would become intolerable to a reasonable person suffering from [his] particular disability." Tally, 542 F.3d. at 1109. As such, "a jury could find that [his] failure to return to work . . . was a foreseeable and intended result of [Panera's] action in refusing to allow [him]" to avoid bussing tables or use a cart, and refusing to engage in a process to resolve the issue of him needing an accommodation. Id.
For these reasons, summary judgment of Jarrus's ADA discrimination claim should be denied.

C.
Panera next argues that Jarrus's damage claims under the ADA and PWDCRA claims are barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Michigan Worker's Compensation Act of 1969, M.C.L. § 418.131. [ECF No. 32, PageID.108-111]. Panera notes that a worker's compensation claim cannot be removed to federal court. 28 U.S.C. § 1445(c). But Panera provides no legal authority or analysis addressing whether § 418.131 bars actions under the ADA or the PWDCRA.
Jarrus, on the other hand, cites Graham v. Ford as holding that "claims seeking recovery for physical, mental, or emotional injury resulting from employer discrimination in violation of [Michigan's] civil rights acts are not barred by the exclusive remedy provision [*17]  of M.C.L. § 418.131(1)." 237 Mich. App. 670, 678, 604 N.W.2d 713 (1999). Graham cited Adams v. Nat'l Bank of Detroit, which held that employer discrimination claims are not barred by § 418.131 because civil rights laws are aimed at a different "evil" than "failures to maintain work place safety, for which workers' compensation benefits are provided." 444 Mich. 329, 338, 508 N.W.2d 464 (1993).
Other courts have found that the ADA preempts state laws, including those stating that worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219, 222, 115 S. Ct. 817, 130 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1995) ("[T]he ADA's preemption prescription bars state-imposed regulation of air carriers, but allows room for court enforcement of contract terms set by the parties themselves."); Wood v. Cty. of Alameda, 875 F. Supp. 659, 665 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (ADA preempted exclusive remedy provision of California Workers' Compensation Act); Nippert v. Gen. Elec. Aircraft Engine, No. 1:04CV703, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64421, 2005 WL 8162485, at *2 (S.D. Ohio May 18, 2005) (ADA claim not barred by Ohio worker's compensation laws).
In deciding whether claims under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., were barred by state worker's compensation exclusivity provisions, the Supreme Court said:
First we must decide whether, as a matter of statutory construction, AWPA permits migrant workers to pursue federal remedies under such circumstances. Second, if AWPA permits simultaneous recovery under federal and state law, we must determine whether, under pre-emption principles, AWPA precludes giving effect to [*18]  state exclusivity provisions that purport to withdraw federal remedies.
Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 642, 110 S. Ct. 1384, 108 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1990). The purpose of the ADA is
(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;
(2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities;
(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and
(4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.
§ 12101(b) (emphasis added). In Wood, the court considered the emphasized language and found that "the express purpose of the enactment of the ADA was to guarantee individuals with disabilities a baseline level of protection through the establishment and enforcement of federal standards." 875 F. Supp. at 663. In light of "the broad remedial purpose expressed by Congress and the fact that defendant's urged construction would significantly limit the scope of relief available to plaintiffs under [*19]  the ADA," the Wood court rejected the defendant's argument that the state's exclusive remedy provision limited the availability of federal remedies. Id. at 665.
In Nippert, the court agreed with the holding of Wood that the state exclusive remedy provision did not bar the plaintiff's ADA claim. 2005 U.S Dist. LEXIS 64421, 2005 WL 8162485 at *2. But because the plaintiff's complaint did not indicate that he sought damages for his workplace injuries allegedly caused by the defendant's failure to accommodate his disability, the court did not address whether the worker's compensation exclusive remedy provision should bar the plaintiff from recovering those damages under the ADA. Id.
The Court believes it is likely that damages from workplace injuries caused by a failure to reasonably accommodate are recoverable under the ADA. The ADA makes failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee a form of discrimination, and courts have held that state exclusive remedy laws cannot bar employees' claims for damages under federal civil rights laws. Karcher v. Emerson Elec. Co., 94 F.3d 502, 509 (8th Cir.1996); Donnelly v. St. John's Mercy Med. Ctr., 635 F. Supp. 2d 970, 989 (E.D. Mo. 2009). But deciding that issue is not required here because Panera failed to develop its argument that Jarrus's recoverable damages under the ADA are limited by Michigan's worker's compensation statute. "It is not sufficient [*20]  for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to . . . put flesh on its bones." McPherson v. Kelsey, 125 F.3d 989, 995-96 (6th Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Panera's argument that Jarrus is precluded for recovering damages because of his workplace injuries should be rejected.

D.
Generally, plaintiffs alleging discrimination under the ADA may recover equitable relief (including backpay), and compensatory and punitive damages. See Chapman v. Olymbec USA, LLC, No. 2:18-CV-02842, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73083, 2020 WL 1976829, at *6 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 24, 2020) (in ADA cases, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981a(a)(2) and § 2000e-5 permit equitable, and compensatory and punitive damages); Goldmeier v. Allstate Ins. Co., 337 F.3d 629, 636 (6th Cir. 2003) (equitable relief under § 2000e-5(g) includes backpay). But Panera argues that Jarrus is estopped from claiming back and front pay for periods during which he has represented that he was disabled. [ECF No. 32, PageID.110-111].
One opinion Panera cites in support is Lathem v. Dep't of Children & Youth Servs., but that court held that "a Title VII claimant is entitled to an award of back pay where the defendant's discriminatory conduct caused the disability." 172 F.3d 786, 794 (11th Cir. 1999). In Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., which Jarrus cited, the court upheld the jury's verdict awarding the plaintiff front and back pay under the ADA. 553 F.3d 121, 142-43 (1st Cir. 2009). The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his [*21]  damages, but the court held in favor of the plaintiff because, "if an employee is unable to work because of a disability 'caused' by the employer, the employee may obtain compensation for the resulting lost pay." Id. at 141 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Because Jarrus claims that his disability was caused by Panera's ADA discrimination, his claim for backpay should not be estopped.
Panera argues in its reply brief that, while Jarrus cited "decisional authority wherein the plaintiffs were injured as a result of discriminatory conduct," the evidence does not show that Panera's actions caused Jarrus's injuries. [ECF No. 36, PageID.269-270]. Panera's estoppel argument in its initial brief did not include this causation argument. [ECF No. 32, PageID.109-111]. The Court cannot consider Panera's causation challenge raised for the first time in its reply. Malin v. JPMorgan, 860 F. Supp. 2d 574, 577 (E.D. Tenn. 2012) ("It is well-settled that a movant cannot raise new issues for the first time in a reply brief.").

E.
Panera's final argument is that Jarrus is not entitled to punitive or exemplary damages. Jarrus does not challenge Panera's argument that exemplary damages are unavailable under the PWDCRA. See Bachman v. Swan Harbour Ass'n, 252 Mich. App. 400, 426, 653 N.W.2d 415 (2002) ("[B]ecause the PWDCRA does not expressly provide [*22]  for exemplary damages, such damages are not allowed."). So Jarrus's claim for exemplary or punitive damages under the PWDCRA should be dismissed.
But under the ADA, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages if he shows that the defendant engaged in a discriminatory practice "with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." § 1981a(b)(1). "The terms 'malice' or 'reckless indifference' pertain to the employer's knowledge that it may be acting in violation of federal law, not its awareness that it is engaging in discrimination." Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 535, 119 S. Ct. 2118, 144 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1999). In other words, the defendant must have perceived the risk that its actions would violate federal law and failed to make good faith efforts to comply. Denoewer v. Union Cty. Indus.,     F.Supp.3d   , 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44966, 2020 WL 1244194, at *12 (S.D. Ohio, 2020) (citing Bates v. Dura Auto. Sys., Inc., 767 F.3d 566, 583 (6th Cir. 2014).
Panera argues that the Court should grant summary judgment of Jarrus's demand for punitive damages under the ADA because it had an anti-discrimination policy in its employee handbook and because Jarrus did not request an accommodation as required under the employee handbook. [ECF No. 32, PageID.114]. But for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that summary judgment should be denied on the issues of whether Jarrus made proper requests for accommodations and [*23]  whether Panera failed to engage in a good faith interactive process to address Jarrus's need for accommodations. For the same reasons, summary judgment should be denied on the questions of whether Panera acted in deliberate indifference to whether it was acting in violation of federal law and still failed to make good faith efforts to comply with that law.

IV. Conclusion
The Court RECOMMENDS that Panera's motion for summary judgment [ECF No. 32] be DENIED, except for Jarrus's claim for punitive or exemplary damages under the PWDCRA.
