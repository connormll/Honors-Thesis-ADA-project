Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
Plaintiff, Katherine J. Williams ("Williams"), claims that Defendant, Bryan Medical Center ("Bryan"), violated the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act ("NFEPA"), Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1101, et seq., when it terminated her employment. Bryan has moved for summary judgment.
Bryan contends that Williams is not a "qualified individual with a disability" because she cannot meet Bryan's legitimate performance expectations, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Bryan states that Williams was terminated for well-documented performance issues, and asserts that Williams cannot prove pretext. Bryan also contends that Williams cannot prevail on a retaliation claim because there is no causal connection between her termination and any protected activity. The court agrees with these contentions and concludes that Bryan's motion for [*2]  summary judgment should be granted in all respects.
I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
"A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).
In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, giving that party the benefit of all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence. See Dancy v. Hyster Co., 127 F.3d 649, 652-53 (8th Cir. 1997). It is not the court's function to weigh evidence in the summary judgment record to determine the truth of any factual issue; the court merely determines whether there is evidence creating a genuine issue for trial. See Bell v. Conopco, Inc., 186 F.3d 1099, 1101 (8th Cir. 1999).
The moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the court of the basis for the motion, and must identify those portions of the record which the moving party believes show the lack of a genuine issue of material fact.1 Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc). If the moving party [*3]  does so, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party, who "may not rest upon mere allegation or denials of his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).
II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT PROCEDURE
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
This court's local rules further specify that "[t]he moving party must include in the brief in support of the summary judgment motion a separate statement of material facts," which "should consist of short numbered paragraphs, each containing pinpoint references to affidavits, pleadings, discovery responses, deposition testimony (by page and line), or other materials that support the material facts stated [*4]  in the paragraph." NECivR 56.1(a) (underlining in original). "The statement must not contain legal conclusions." Id. The opposing party's brief must include "a concise response to the moving party's statement of material facts." NECivR 56.1(b)(1).
"Each material fact in the response must be set forth in a separate numbered paragraph, must include pinpoint references to affidavits, pleadings, discovery responses, deposition testimony (by page and line), or other materials upon which the opposing party relies, and, if applicable, must state the number of the paragraph in the movant's statement of material facts that is disputed." Id. The moving party may, but is not required, to reply to the opposing party's response. See Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Westport Ins. Corp., 131 F. Supp. 3d 888, 892 n. 2 (D. Neb. 2015).
A party's failure to comply with these requirements can have serious consequences: The moving party's "[f]ailure to submit a statement of facts" or "[f]ailure to provide citations to the exact locations in the record supporting the factual allegations may be grounds to deny the motion for summary judgment." NECivR 56.1(1)(a) (underlining in original). On the other hand, "[p]roperly referenced material facts in the movant's statement are considered admitted unless controverted in the opposing party's response." NECivR 56.1(1)(b)(1) (underlining [*5]  in original).
III. BRYAN'S STATEMENT OF FACTS
In this case, Bryan's brief in support of its motion for summary judgment contains a separate, 149-paragraph statement of facts ("SOF").2 (Filing 28, pp. 2-38.) Williams has repeated each paragraph in her opposing brief, and indicates that most are "undisputed." The court therefore finds that all properly referenced statements of material fact contained in paragraphs 1-3, 1-3 (second set), 4-7, 9-12, 14-18, 20-21, 23, 29-47, 49-54, 56-69, 71-80, 84, 86-90, 92-94, 97, 100, 104-117, 119-138, 140, and 141 are considered admitted.
With respect to the remaining paragraphs, the court makes the following findings (by paragraph number):
• ¶¶ 8, 145. Williams does not specifically dispute these paragraphs, which are deemed admitted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); NECivR 56.1(1)(b)(1).
• ¶¶ 139, 143, 144, 146. Williams disputes these paragraphs but does not cite any evidence in opposition. Bryan's statements of fact are therefore undisputed. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A); NECivR 56.1(b)(1).
• ¶¶ 19, 22, 24-27, 48, 55, 70, 81-83, 85, 91, 95, 96, 98, 99, 101-103, 118, 142. Although Williams disputes these paragraphs, the statements of fact are consistent with the evidence cited by Bryan. To the extent Williams' responses include additional [*6]  facts which are supported by evidence, the court has considered such facts. However, the court finds there is no genuine issue of material fact which would preclude the entry of summary judgment in favor of Bryan.3
• ¶ 13. Williams disputes that her cited deposition testimony supports Bryan's statement that she "alleges that she has a disability ... that causes issues with communication at times," and states that she "testified unambiguously that Marcia Kube told her that her disability affected her communication." (Filing 32, p. 8) While it is true that Williams' testimony only concerned a statement that Kube made to her about having communication issues with students, Williams clarified that Kube did not tell her it was her disability that affected communication. (Williams Dep. 37:23-25 (Filing 32-2, p. 11).) In any event, Williams does allege in her complaint that she "reminded Kube that she had repeatedly requested training for communication skills because her disability affected cognitive ability," and that she told a human resources representative on May 12, 2017, "that her disability caused communication barriers and that she had requested accommodations from Kube." (Filing 1, [*7]  ¶¶ 10, 13.)
• ¶ 28. Williams disputes that her cited deposition testimony supports Bryan's statement that "[o]ther than these accommodations with respect to communication, Williams received everything she requested from Kube." (Filing 32, pp. 14-15.) Williams is technically correct. When asked if there was anything else, Williams replied, "Not that I can recall." However, Williams does not indicate in her response that anything else was, in fact, requested.
IV. ANALYSIS OF WILLIAMS' CLAIMS
Bryan hired Plaintiff Williams to be a professor in its nursing school starting in August 2015. (SOF ¶ 1.) A little over a month into her first semester of classes, Williams was involved in a non-work-related bicycle accident that caused her to miss about five weeks of work. (SOF ¶¶ 7, 11.) When she returned, Williams was experiencing headaches and vision issues, which Bryan accommodated by providing a private office, large computer screen, the ability to work from home, and other assistance. (SOF ¶ 18.)
Williams alleges that her injuries from the accident also affected her ability to communicate, but, paradoxically, denies that she had any communication problems with students. (SOF ¶¶ 13, 137.) [*8]  Williams' employment was terminated in May 2017 for alleged performance issues which Bryan has extensively documented with evidence of student complaints about her communication skills, teaching ability, organization, professionalism, and other issues. (SOF ¶ 128, 131.)
Williams' complaint contains three counts, which are brought under both the ADA and the NFEPA. Counts I and II are labeled as "discrimination" claims which, respectively, are "based on disability" and a "record of disability."4 (Filing 1, pp. 5, 7.) Count III is labeled as a "retaliation" claim. (Filing 1, p. 9.) Because the same analysis applies to ADA and NFEPA claims, see Orr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 297 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir. 2003), the court will not separately address Nebraska caselaw.
Under the ADA, prohibited discrimination includes discrimination against a qualified individual because of his or her disability (i.e., intentional discrimination), see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)-(b)(1), as shown by evidence of disparate treatment or other proof that will vary according to the specific facts of the case. Lipp v. Cargill Meat Sols. Corp., 911 F.3d 537, 543 (8th Cir. 2018) (citing Young v. Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc., 152 F.3d 1018, 1022 (8th Cir. 1998)). Prohibited discrimination also includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability" unless [*9]  doing so "would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the" employer's business. Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)). Counts I and II of Williams' complaint include both types of discrimination claims, as it is alleged that Bryan terminated Williams' employment because of her disability,5 and that Bryan failed provide a reasonable accommodation. (Filing 1, ¶¶ 26, 29, 36, 37.)
In the discussion which follows, the court will first address Williams' termination claim, then her failure-to-accommodate claim, and, finally, her retaliation claim.

A. Williams Cannot Prevail on Her Termination Claim
In ADA cases, a plaintiff may survive a defendant's summary judgment motion in one of two ways, presenting either direct or inferential evidence of discrimination. Libel v. Adventure Lands of Am., Inc., 482 F.3d 1028, 1034 (8th Cir. 2007). Direct evidence in this context is not the converse of circumstantial evidence. Id. "Rather, direct evidence is evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision, sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action." Id. (quoting Griffith v. City of Des Moines, 387 F.3d 733, 736 (8th Cir. 2004)). "Direct evidence includes evidence of conduct or statements by persons involved [*10]  in the decisionmaking process that may be viewed as directly reflecting the alleged discriminatory attitude, where it is sufficient to support an inference that discriminatory attitude more likely than not was a motivating factor." Lipp, 911 F.3d at 543 (quotation marks and citations omitted).
However, if the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of discrimination, she must avoid summary judgment by creating the requisite inference of unlawful discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas6 framework. Libel, 482 F.3d at 1034. Under this analysis, the employee bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Id. (citing Kratzer v. Rockwell Collins, Inc., 398 F.3d 1040, 1044-45 (8th Cir. 2005)). The burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's actions. Id. If the employer articulates such a reason, the burden returns to the employee to show the employer's justification is a pretext. Id.
Williams claims there is direct evidence of discrimination because her supervisor, Marcia Kube ("Kube"), told her during the phone call in which her employment was terminated that "We're done accommodating you." (Filing 32, pp. 1, 65, 69-71, 73, 75.) But despite the multiple references to this alleged remark in Williams' brief, there is no competent [*11]  evidence to support it. Williams recorded this phone call and produced the audio recording during discovery. (Williams Dep. 161:3-15; 166:19-167:9 (Filing 32-2, pp.41, 42, 44).) Bryan transcribed the recording and has filed the transcript, as Exhibit A27. (Filing 28-26.) Williams cites Exhibit A27 as proof of the alleged statement, and has admitted that the exhibit "is a true and correct transcript of that recording." (Filing 32, pp. 62, 65.) However, nowhere in the transcript does Kube say that Bryan is "done accommodating" Williams, or anything close to it.
Although Williams does not reference her deposition, she did testify that Kube made the statement. (Williams Dep. 166: 19-167:9; 174:15-19 (Filing 32-2, pp. 43, 45).) A non-movant's self-serving testimony is appropriately considered on a motion for summary judgment when it is "plausible, unchallenged and not circumstantially rebutted." White v. Smith, 696 F.3d 740, 749 n. 8 (8th Cir. 2012) (quoting Thomas v. Runyon, 108 F.3d 957, 961 (8th Cir. 1997)). Here, however, Williams' concession that Exhibit 27A accurately reflects what was said during her telephone conversation with Kube renders her inconsistent deposition testimony unworthy of belief.7
"At the summary judgment stage, facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the [*12]  nonmoving party only if there is a 'genuine' dispute as to those facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007). "When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Id.; see, e.g., Wallingford v. Olson, 592 F.3d 888, 892 (8th Cir. 2010) (affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant where videotape completely discredited plaintiff's version of events upon which she based her excessive force claim); cf. Michael v. Trevena, 899 F.3d 528, 532 (8th Cir. 2018) (in ruling on a summary judgment motion, courts are not bound to credit the plaintiff's version of events, "come what may.").
Consequently, Williams' termination claim must be analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework, which requires the plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating "(1) that the plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that the plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job [with or without a reasonable accommodation]; and (3) a causal connection between an adverse employment action and the disability." Lipp, 911 F.3d at 544 (quoting Oehmke v. Medtronic, Inc., 844 F.3d 748, 755 (8th Cir. 2016)). Only the second and third elements are at issue [*13]  here.

1. Williams Is Not a "Qualified Individual"
The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating against a "qualified individual" on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual" is defined in the ADA as a person "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions" of his or her job. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).8 "The term essential functions means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). "[C]onsideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n).
In this case, Williams was hired for a Professor-Nursing position at Bryan effective August 4, 2015. (SOF ¶ 1 (second).) The written job description for this position accurately describes the job responsibilities and essential duties, which include:
a. [S]erves in a faculty role of advisor, mentor, role model, advocate, facilitator and competent educator and practitioner.
b. Conveys knowledge and principles [*14]  of the discipline clearly and concisely in the classroom ...
c. Utilizes instructional methods that promote student development of critical thinking, problem solving, decision-making, clinical competency, and life-long learning.
d. Manages the educational environment to facilitate an optimal learning experience.
(SOF ¶ 2 (second); Exhibit A2 (Filing 28-3, p. 1).) Williams was hired to help create a doctoral program at Bryan for "nurse educators," i.e., nurses who are teaching others how to become nurses. (SOF ¶ 5.) All of the courses Williams taught were "hybrid courses," meaning that she met with her students "online frequently and then in person infrequently." (SOF ¶ 6.)
To be a qualified individual entitled to ADA protection, Williams "must show that [her] work performance met the employer's legitimate job expectations, with or without reasonable accommodation." Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Prod., Inc., 165 F.3d 1212, 1217 (8th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The plaintiff in Mole was a customer service representative who had performed adequately in that position for many years, but her employer "documented serious performance deficiencies beginning in 1991 and [her] failure to meet repeated demands for improved performance from 1992 until she [*15]  was terminated in June 1994." Id. The Eighth Circuit agreed with the district court that the employee failed to establish that she could perform her essential job functions without accommodation. Id. ("An ADA plaintiff may not rely upon past performance to establish that she is a qualified individual without accommodation when the employer has produced undisputed evidence of diminished or deteriorated abilities.") (emphasis in original); see also Bradley v. Little Rock Wastewater Util., No. 4:10-CV-2019-DPM, 2012 WL 174382, at *2 (E.D. Ark. Jan. 20, 2012) (holding that plaintiff failed to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination because "[t]he record is replete with appraisals rating [his] work as sub-par."), aff'd, 517 F. App'x 530 (8th Cir. 2013); Wilking v. Cty. of Ramsey, 153 F.3d 869, 873 (8th Cir. 1998) (affirming that an ADA plaintiff who received a negative performance evaluation leading to discharge was not meeting legitimate expectations and was therefore not qualified).
In the present case, there was a marked difference between Williams' performance ratings in her annual reviews for 2015 and 2016. (SOF ¶¶ 29-37, 83-90.) Course evaluations prepared by Williams' students during 2016 generally contained low ratings and there were many negative comments.9 (SOF ¶¶ 38-48.) On February 3, 2017, Williams was issued an "initial written warning" regarding the quality and [*16]  timeliness of her work and her poor communication with students. (SOF ¶¶ 57-82.) Mid-term course evaluations for the 2017 spring semester were relatively positive, but Kube was troubled by an email she received from one of Williams' students on May 2, 2017, regarding delayed grading and other concerns. (SOF ¶¶ 91-103.) Kube was also troubled by comments she received from students in connection with end-of-term course evaluations for the 2017 spring semester. (SOF ¶¶ 99-103.) The termination decision was made at this point. (SOF ¶¶ 104-131.)
Although Williams contests some criticisms of her performance (SOF ¶¶ 75, 89, 137), "it is the manager's perception of the employee's performance that is relevant, not plaintiff's subjective evaluation of [her] own relative performance." Brooks v. Ameren UE, 345 F.3d 986, 988 (8th Cir. 2003). Williams also complains that Kube relied too heavily on the students' comments and course evaluation ratings, but courts have recognized that "[i]n judging the qualifications of an individual in a teaching position subjective criteria are essential." Lewis v. St. Louis Univ., 573 F. Supp. 300, 305 (E.D. Mo. 1983), aff'd, 744 F.2d 1368 (8th Cir. 1984).
In Shanklin v. Fitzgerald, 397 F.3d 596 (8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit affirmed dismissal of a teacher's discrimination claim because she failed to show she was meeting the school district's performance [*17]  expectations. The teacher "received unfavorable evaluations, and she failed to cure her serious and repeated performance deficiencies, even after the Board gave her an additional five months to improve." Id. at 602. Like Williams, the teacher in Shanklin offered no evidence to contradict the negative evaluations other than to question the reported deficiencies. Id. at 603. Similarly, in Atuahene v. S. Dakota State Univ., No. CIV07-4099-KES, 2009 WL 1586952, at *11 (D.S.D. June 4, 2009), the court dismissed a Title VII claim brought by a professor who received poor student evaluations, had trouble communicating concepts to students, and failed to improve his teaching when confronted with criticisms from students and his supervisor. The court granted the university's motion for summary judgment after concluding that the professor was not meeting the university's legitimate performance expectations. Id. at *12; see also Mosby v. Webster Coll., 423 F. Supp. 615, 617-18 (E.D. Mo. 1976) (reasoning that a college's decision to terminate a professor was not unlawful discrimination given negative student evaluations and complaints, among other factors), aff'd, 563 F.2d 901 (8th Cir. 1977).
Citing McPheeters v. Black & Veatch Corp., 427 F.3d 1095, 1104 (8th Cir. 2005), Williams argues that the course evaluations are "irrelevant" because students are "non-decisionmakers." (Filing 32, p. 67) In McPheeters, the Eighth Circuit only ruled that emails written by non-decisionmakers who criticized the company's [*18]  decision to terminate an employee were irrelevant to pretext. 427 F.3d at 1104. The case does not suggest that complaints about an employee are irrelevant to whether the employee is meeting legitimate performance expectations. To the contrary, employers "can legitimately expect an employee's performance not to engender customer complaints." Parada v. Great Plains Int'l of Sioux City, Inc., 483 F. Supp. 2d 777, 807 (N.D. Iowa 2007) ("[T]he record shows beyond dispute that [the employee] was not meeting that legitimate expectation, where there is evidence of serious customer complaints against her and no evidence, whatsoever, that the complaints did not occur."). Students are, effectively, Bryan's "customers."
Williams also cites Father Flannagan's Boys Home v. Boys Town Educ. Ass'n, 6 Fed App'x 528 (8th Cir. 2001) to support her argument that student evaluations are an improper method to determine whether a professor is meeting performance expectations. (Filing 32, p. 66.) The narrow issue in that case was whether a teacher's termination was proper under a collective bargaining agreement. See Father Flanagan's Boys Home v. Boys Town Educ. Ass'n, No. 8:99CV505, 2000 WL 1700545, at *2 (D. Neb. July 18, 2000). The Eighth Circuit affirmed the arbitrator's decision that student assessments alone were an invalid basis to deny renewal of the teacher's contract when the agreement required other mechanisms for teacher assessment and did not mention student evaluations. The case does not remotely [*19]  suggest that student evaluations should not or cannot be used to determine whether a professor is meeting legitimate performance expectations in an ADA case.
To the extent Williams is contending that her performance issues were caused by her disability, it must be recognized that "[f]iring an employee because of the job performance consequences of a disability ... rather than the disability itself, is not actionable under the ADA." Mole, 165 F.3d at 1219, n. 3; see also Lippman v. Sholom Home, Inc., 945 F. Supp. 188, 192 (D. Minn. 1996) ("[T]he ADA does not place upon the employer the burden of determining why an employee fails to perform satisfactorily."). Moreover, there is not sufficient evidence to establish that Williams' job performance issues were even related to her disability, or that she could perform satisfactory work with an accommodation. This will be discussed further in the "failure-to-accommodate" section of this memorandum opinion.

2. Williams' Termination Did Not Result from Her Disability
To meet the third element of her prima facie case, Williams must show a causal connection between her disability and her termination that permits an inference of discrimination. Allen v. Interior Const. Servs., Ltd., 214 F.3d 978, 982 (8th Cir. 2000). This inference may arise if the employer failed to follow its own policies, treated similarly situated [*20]  employees more favorably, or shifted its explanation for the employment decision. Young v. Builders Steel Co., 754 F.3d 573, 578 (8th Cir. 2014). Williams has none of this evidence.
Williams only points to her own deposition testimony in which she answered in the negative when asked by her own counsel, first of all, whether she "know[s] if there was any Bryan policy or guideline that limited [Kube's] evaluation of you to consideration of student course and faculty valuations," and, secondly, whether she was "aware of any Bryan policy or guideline that addressed the importance of student course and faculty evaluations." (Williams Dep. 187:16-188:2 (Filing 32-2, p. 48).) The premise of the first question is faulty because, as already discussed, student complaints were not the sole basis for Bryan's decision to terminate Williams. Bryan also identified late and unsatisfactory work product in both her initial written warning and her suspension document. (Ex. A22 at 1 (Filing 28-21); Ex. A26 (Filing 28-25).) And as to the second question, Williams cannot claim to be unaware of the importance of the course evaluations and student comments. Bryan informed Williams that student complaints about her communication and behavior factored into the 2016 annual [*21]  review and the initial written warning, and explained that it expected "immediate and sustained changes" in Williams' communication with students. (Ex. A6 at 3, 8 (Filing 28-5); Ex. A22 at 1 (Filing 28-21).) The reasons cited by Bryan for Williams' termination in the suspension notice are entirely consistent comments contained in the 2016 annual review and the initial written warning, and Williams' claimed lack of knowledge about any policies or guidelines does not give rise to an inference of discrimination.

3. Bryan's Stated Reason for Termination Was Not Pretextual
As explained in the document suspending Williams pending a termination decision, Bryan discharged Williams because of her "pattern of work quality that [was] not consistent with the excellence in teaching expectations" of her position. (SOF ¶ 128.) This is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination. See Hannoon v. Fawn Eng'g Corp., 324 F.3d 1041, 1047 (8th Cir. 2003) ("Under the second step of McDonnell Douglas, the defendants easily met their burden of production by alleging poor performance as the legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for Hannoon's termination. Further, although not required (because the burden is merely one of production and not of proof), the defendants provided a detailed [*22]  and undisputed documentary account of the poor performance.").
To establish pretext, Williams must present sufficient evidence to establish both that Bryan's articulated reason for the termination was false and that discrimination based on disabling effects of her head injury was the real reason. Lindeman v. Saint Luke's Hosp. of Kansas City, 899 F.3d 603, 606 (8th Cir. 2018). In other words, to succeed at the pretext stage, Williams "must prove the prohibited reason was a determinative factor in [Bryan's] decision," producing "substantial evidence of discrimination" because "evidence of pretext is viewed in the light of [an employer's] legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation." Jones v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 461 F.3d 982, 992 (8th Cir. 2006). The issue is not whether Bryan's decision was ill-advised or unwise, but whether its stated reason was false such that it is mere pretext for discrimination. McNary v. Schreiber Foods, Inc., 535 F.3d 765, 769 (8th Cir. 2008); see also Lors v. Dean, 595 F.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir. 2010) (courts "do not sit as a super-personnel department to review the wisdom or fairness of an employer's employment decisions.") (quotations marks and citations omitted).
Williams argues that "[s]ubjective criteria in the evaluation process demonstrates that Bryan's explanation for Dr. Williams' termination lacks credence." (Filing 32, p. 69.) This argument lacks merit. "[T]he presence of subjectivity in employee evaluations [*23]  is itself not a grounds for challenging those evaluations as discriminatory." Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1050 (quoting Wittenburg v. Am. Express Fin. Advisors, Inc., 464 F.3d 831, 839 (8th Cir.2006)). Also, in this case, it was the opinions of third parties—Bryan's students—that played a role in the decision to terminate William's employment. See O'Connor v. Peru State Coll., 781 F.2d 632, 637-38 (8th Cir. 1986) (finding school's decision to terminate basketball coach for performance was not pretext when a player described the team's declining morale). And Williams' performance issues were not limited to subjective failures—she showed objective deficiencies as well by not meeting grading deadlines and failing to submit other work on time. (Ex. A6 at 7 (Filing 28-5); Ex. A21 at 1 (Filing 28-20).) Not only has Williams failed to discredit Bryan's stated reason for her termination, but she has failed to produce any competent evidence that the firing was motivated by discriminatory animus.

B. Williams Cannot Prevail on Her Failure-to-Accommodate Claim
To prevail on a failure-to-accommodate claim, Williams must establish both a prima facie case of discrimination based on her disability and a failure to accommodate it. Kelleher v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 817 F.3d 624, 631 (8th Cir. 2016); see McNeil v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., No. 8:16CV443, 2018 WL 2320643, at *9 (D. Neb. May 21, 2018) (plaintiff could not meet prima facie case for failure-to-accommodate claim because she was unable to work overtime, which was an essential [*24]  function of her job), aff'd, 936 F.3d 786 (8th Cir. 2019); Higgins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 303 F. Supp. 3d 945, 959 (D. Neb. 2018) (plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim failed because he was unable to work regularly, which prevented him from fulfilling an essential function of his position and disqualified him under the ADA), aff'd, 931 F.3d 664 (8th Cir. 2019); Lorenzen v. Taste Traditions of Omaha, L.L.C., No. 8:16-CV-27, 2017 WL 6539024, at *4 (D. Neb. Sept. 29, 2017) (unsuccessful job applicant whose physical limitations prevented him from performing essential functions of the job could not prevail on either his general claim of disability discrimination, or his specific claim of failure to accommodate his disability); Shotwell v. Reg'l W. Med. Ctr., No. 4:14-CV-3210, 2016 WL 4535031, at *4 (D. Neb. Aug. 30, 2016) (plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA because she not a "qualified individual").
A modified burden-shifting analysis applies to a failure-to-accommodate claim, and such a claim must be analyzed separately from a disparate treatment claim.10 Fenney v. Dakota, Minnesota & E. R. Co., 327 F.3d 707, 712 & n. 6 (8th Cir. 2003). A plaintiff "at all times retains the burden of persuading the trier of fact that [she] has been the victim of illegal discrimination due to [her] disability." Id. at 712 (quoting Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 62 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir.1995)). Thus, Williams "must first make a facial showing that [she] has an ADA disability and that [she] has suffered adverse employment action. Then [she] must make a facial showing that [she] is a 'qualified individual.'" Id. "Although the [*25]  plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving that [she] is a qualified individual, if the employer disputes that the employee can perform the essential functions of the job, then the burden shifts to the employer to 'put on some evidence of those essential functions.'"11 Id. (quoting Benson, 62 F.3d at 1113). Further, if the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job without an accommodation, she must only make a "facial showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible ...." Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Benson, 62 F.3d at 1112). The burden of production then shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the employee. If the employer can show that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job even with reasonable accommodation, then the employee must rebut that showing with evidence of [her] individual capabilities. Id. "At that point, the employee's burden merges with [her] ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that [she] has suffered unlawful discrimination." Id. (quoting Benson, 62 F.3d at 1113).
"An individual requesting an accommodation must 'make a facial showing that reasonable accommodation is possible and that the accommodation will allow [him] to perform the essential functions [*26]  of the job.'" Higgins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 931 F.3d 664, 671 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Lipp, 911 F.3d at 546). A plaintiff must present evidence that the requested accommodation is both related to the disability and will offer a benefit not available from already-provided accommodations. Stern v. Univ. of Osteopathic Med. & Health Scis., 220 F.3d 906, 908-09 (8th Cir. 2000). The ADA is not implicated when the "accommodation requested is unrelated to the limitation." Hustvet v. Allina Health Sys., 910 F.3d 399, 411 (8th Cir. 2018) (recognizing that "there must be a causal connection between the major life activity that is limited, and the accommodation sought.").
Williams alleges that "[s]he suffers from a chronic neurological condition that affects her ability to communicate," and that she "spoke to Dean of Graduate Nursing, Marcia Kube, about accommodations that would restore her communication skills." (Filing 1, ¶¶ 7, 29.) More specifically, Williams alleges that she "requested training classes and courses on communication techniques" and "that a recording of her class be evaluated by an independent person." (Filing 1, ¶ 7.)
At her deposition, however, Williams testified she did not agree with Kube's assessment that she had communication issues. (Williams Dep. 48:22-24; 220:23-221:1) (Filing 32-2, pp. 13, 56-57).) Williams also admitted that Kube did not say that Williams' communication issues were related to a [*27]  disability. (SOF ¶ 138; Williams Dep. 37:13-25 (Filing 32-2, p. 11).) Tellingly, when Williams disputed her initial written warning and 2016 annual review in almost 16 single-spaced pages, she never once mentioned that the communication issues noted in those documents resulted from a disability or could be cured with an accommodation. (SOF ¶¶ 76, 77, 90.)
Williams claims she requested an accommodation for her communication issues when they were brought to her attention, although she could not remember when that was. (SOF &21; Williams Dep. 44:2-15 (Filing 32-2, p. 12) ("I want to say it was somewhere in 2016, maybe toward the end, but I'm not positive.").) Williams testified she "talked to Marcia Kube about providing something to help [her] with improving [her] communication," but she did not request a specific accommodation; rather, she "asked for anything [Kube] thought would help." (SOF &22; Williams Dep. 44:21-24 (Filing 32-2, p. 12).) Williams and Kube "talked about a couple of different options," such as "[h]aving [Williams'] class observed [by whomever Marcia thought would be helpful], having it recorded, taking a course at Bryan, taking a course somewhere else, working with [*28]  a third party." (SOF &23; Williams Dep. 45:2-12 (Filing 32-2, p. 13).) Williams testified that Kube had thought a video recording of her class would "show [her] how [her] communication was of issue," but Williams does not know exactly what the purpose would have been. (SOF &25; Williams Dep. 45:13-20 (Filing 32-2, p. 13 ("It was [Kube's] idea, so I'm not positive.").). When Williams was asked if she had any evidence that her communication would have improved if she had received those accommodations, she replied, "I don't know how I would prove something I didn't receive would have helped or not helped." (Williams Dep. 48:9-15 (Filing 32-2, p. 13).)
Williams has produced a note from her neurologist, Chad Whyte, dated March 2, 2018 (about 10 months post-termination), in which Dr. Whyte simply states that he is "currently treating [Williams] for her migraine headaches, and that "[w]hen the acute attacks occur, it can affect her cognitive function as well as her other activities of daily living, making it difficult to communicate with others." (SOF ¶ 145.) Williams testified she would have a migraine headache about once a week, and how she was affected would "depend on how bad the migraine [*29]  is." (Williams Dep. 29:8-15; 30:3-9 (Filing 32-2, p. 9).) The migraines "made it necessary to be in a quiet environment and dim lighting," and Williams "would choose to do less when [she] had a migraine," but she still taught and "tried not to let them affect [her] work." (Williams Dep. 36:1-22 (Filing 32-2, p. 11).)
Bryan provided Williams with a private office where she could turn down the lights and shut the door as needed, allowed her to work from home (about once a week), and provided coverage for days on which she could not make it to work. (SFO ¶ 18.) There is no evidence that any further accommodation would have allowed Williams to perform her job satisfactorily. Even if Williams' communication issues might be attributed to acute migraine attacks, there is no reason to suppose that her taking a course on communication skills or having an independent person evaluate her teaching performance would be of any help. As previously discussed, of course, Williams also had problems with the quality and timeliness of her work, and no accommodation has even been suggested for these problems.
"[An employee's] bare assertion that additional accommodations would have enabled him to perform [*30]  the essential functions of his job is sheer speculation that is insufficient to create a material issue of fact." Tyma v. City of Grand Island, 91 F. App'x 522, 524 (8th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted); see Mole, 165 F.3d at 1218 (rejecting employee's contention that her employer should have offered more breaks and other accommodations, reasoning that the employee "could offer no assurance the requested accommodations would remedy her many job performance deficiencies."); Hill v. Kansas City Area Transp. Auth., 181 F.3d 891, 894 (8th Cir. 1999) (affirming grant of summary judgment for employer where the employee "offered no assurance that [her proposed accommodation] would remedy her job performance difficulties.").
Because Williams has not met her prima facie case, the court need not examine whether Bryan engaged in the interactive process to determine if Williams could be accommodated. See McNeil, 2018 WL 2320643, at *10 ("Under the ADA, if no reasonable accommodation is available, an employer is not liable for failing to engage in a good-faith interactive process.") (quoting Battle v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 438 F.3d 856, 864 (8th Cir. 2006)); Higgins, 303 F. Supp. 3d at 959-60 (same).12

C. Williams Cannot Prevail on Her Retaliation Claim
The ADA prohibits retaliation, providing that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To prevail on a retaliation [*31]  claim, "there must either be direct evidence of retaliation or an inference of retaliation must be created under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework." Hustvet, 910 F.3d at 412 (quoting EEOC v. Product Fabricators, Inc., 763 F.3d 963, 972 (8th Cir. 2014)). Because Williams has not produced any competent direct evidence of retaliation,13 she must instead "produce evidence of a prima facie case by showing three elements: (1) the plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) the employer took an adverse action against the plaintiff; and (3) there existed a causal connection between the adverse action and the protected activity." Id. A retaliation claim under the ADA requires a but-for causal connection between the employee's assertion of her ADA rights and an adverse action by the employer.14 Oehmke, 844 F.3d at 758 (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338 (2013)). The Eighth Circuit applies "the familiar McDonald Douglas burden-shifting analysis even when the applicable standard of proof requires a showing of but-for causation." Donathan v. Oakley Grain, Inc., 861 F.3d 735, 740 (8th Cir. 2017); see Shirrell v. St. Francis Med. Ctr., 793 F.3d 881, 888 (8th Cir. 2015) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework to a Title VII retaliation claim using the but-for standard articulated in Nassar).
Williams claims she engaged in statutorily protected activity by requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disability. See Heisler v. Metro. Council, 339 F.3d 622, 632 (8th Cir. 2003) ("An individual who is adjudged not to be a 'qualified [*32]  individual with a disability' may still pursue a retaliation claim under the ADA as long as she had a good faith belief that the requested accommodation was appropriate.") (quotation marks and citation omitted); Kirkeberg v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 619 F.3d 898, 908 (8th Cir. 2010) (holding that an employee who requests a reasonable accommodation has engaged in protected activity). According to Williams, she "first posed her accommodation requests — 'something to help [her] with improving [her] communication' in 2016," and "restated her request on February 3, 2017 in a meeting with Kube. (SMF ¶ 68)." (Filing 32, p. 74.) While recognizing that "more than two months is too long to support a finding of causation without something more." Lors, 746 F.3d at 866, Williams argues that after she "elevated her accommodation requests and went to Bryan's human resource staff for help," she was fired "within hours." (Ibid.)
The evidence shows that on the morning of May 12, 2017, Williams met with Bryan's Director of Benefits, Paula Fankhauser, who recommended that Williams "do some of the modules that are available for faculty and staff and some of the trainings that are available for faculty and — for leaders at Bryan around communication." (SOF ¶¶ 112-13; Williams Dep. 62:13-20, 150:14151:1 [*33]  (Filing 32-2, pp. 17, 38).) Later that same day, Williams met with Lisa Neddenriep, HR partner. During that follow-up meeting, Williams talked about the "communication accommodations that hadn't been provided," and told Neddenriep about Fankhauser's recommendations. (SOF ¶¶ 112-14; Williams Dep. 145:5-16, 150:14-151:7, 151:25-152:6 (Filing 32-2, pp. 38).) Williams was terminated 4 days later. (SOF ¶ 131.)
But, as Bryan points out, the evidence also shows that the decision to terminate Williams mostly predated these meetings with the Human Resources ("HR") staff. One day earlier, on May 11, 2017, Kube and her immediate supervisor, Dr. Kay Maize, Provost, met with Williams and asked "what [her] intents were, if [she] was planning to leave or be terminated, because that was where [Kube] felt [they] were at with [Williams'] employment." (SOF ¶¶ 104-105; Williams Dep. 143:6-144:4 (Filing 32-2, p. 37).) It was Williams' sense from this meeting that termination was possible, and it was after the meeting that she went to see someone at HR about a request for accommodations. (SOF ¶¶ 106-107.)
Kube, in fact, had intended to give Williams a suspension notice on May 12, 2017, but Williams declined [*34]  Kube's invitation for another meeting after speaking with someone at HR, who had advised against her "not to meet with anyone '[u]ntil they said it was okay.'" (SOF ¶¶ 108-111; Williams Dep. 144:5-24 (Filing 32-2, p. 38).) Kube subsequently met with Dr. Maize, Lisa Neddenriep, and another HR person, and they decided to move forward with the suspension; after obtaining approval from Bryan's administrators, Kube and Dr. Maize met with Williams at 4:00 p.m. on May 15, 1027, to give her the suspension document. (SOF ¶¶ 125-127.) Kube telephoned Williams the next day to let her know that Bryan had decided to terminate her employment. (SOF ¶ 131.)
Bryan argues that Williams' "last-ditch" request for an accommodation was not protected activity because it was not made in good faith. See Kirkeberg, 619 F.3d at 907. While this argument may be meritorious, it involves a question of fact, which is not suitable for determination on a motion for summary judgment.
Bryan also argues that the mere fact Williams was terminated within 4 days after contacting HR to request an accommodation does not create an inference of retaliation. See Lors, 746 F.3d at 865 ("Generally, more than a temporal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse [*35]  employment action is required to present a genuine factual issue on retaliation."). Again, while this argument may have merit, it is also possible that Williams' meetings with HR staff and renewed requests for accommodation precipitated the termination decision.
Establishing a causal connection generally requires more than temporal proximity, "[e]specially where the employer's proffered reason for action is virtually contemporaneous with the protected activity." Hill [v. Walker, 737 F.3d 1209, 121 (8th Cir. 2013).] However, the Eighth Circuit has also recognized that "[p]roximity alone can be enough to establish causation for a prima facie case" in the retaliation context. Gibson v. Geithner, 776 F.3d 536, 541 (8th Cir. 2015). This is particularly true where the adverse action and protected activity are "very close" in time. See Orr [v. City of Rogers, 232 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1067 (W.D. Ark. 2017)] (citing Smith v. Allen Health Sys., Inc., 302 F.3d 827, 833 (8th Cir. 2002)). For example, the Eighth Circuit has held that a plaintiff's protected activity and termination separated by thirteen days were "extremely close" and "sufficient, but barely so, to establish causation" in light of the "minimal showing" required to establish a prima facie case. See Smith, 302 F.3d at 833. The import of timing is ultimately dependent on the facts of a particular case as "there is no definitive line drawn to show at what point a temporal connection establishes [*36]  causation." See Prod. Fabricators, Inc., 763 F.3d at 973 (noting that a length of two months would be too long).
A court should determine temporal proximity based on when the employer decided to take an adverse action rather than when the decision is actually carried out. See Wallace [v. DTG Operations, Inc., 442 F.3d 1112, 1119 (8th Cir. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1043]. Whether an employer previously considered adverse employment action prior to the plaintiff's protected activity is also relevant. Logan v. Liberty Healthcare Corp., 416 F.3d 877, 882 (8th Cir. 2005); cf. Smith, 302 F.3d at 834 ("Evidence that the employer had been concerned about a problem before the employee engaged in protected activity undercuts the significance of the temporal proximity.").
Hanson v. N. Pines Mental Health Ctr., Inc., No. CV 16-2932 (DWF/LIB), 2018 WL 1440333, at *12 (D. Minn. Mar. 22, 2018).
Ultimately, however, the undisputed evidence establishes that Bryan had a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Williams' employment, and Williams has not offered any evidence, apart from the timing of the termination decision, to show that the reason given for her termination was pretextual. "Temporal proximity alone is insufficient to show that an employer's proffered reason for action was a pretext ...." Kelleher, 817 F.3d at 633-34 ("With temporal proximity alone to support her argument for pretext, [the plaintiff] has failed to create a genuine issue for trial on her [ADA] retaliation claim.").
V. CONCLUSION
There is no direct [*37]  evidence that Williams' employment was terminated because of her disability or because she requested a reasonable accommodation, and a causal connection cannot be proved inferentially on the evidence that has been presented by Williams. The record establishes that the termination resulted because of Williams' substandard job performance. Williams cannot prove that the reason given for her termination was a pretext for discrimination or retaliation under the ADA or the NFEPA. Williams' failure-to-accommodate claims brought under those Acts also fail. Williams cannot prove that her performance issues are disability related, or that additional accommodations would have remedied those issues.
