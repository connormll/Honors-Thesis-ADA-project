DECISION & ORDER
WILLAM F. KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge:
Linda Soriero ("Plaintiff") brings this action against Battery Park City Authority ("Defendant"), alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act and New York City Human Rights Law and a claim of discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Defendant now moves to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss ("Def. Mem."), ECF No. 28-3; see also Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss ("Pl. Mem."), ECF No. 29. Plaintiff also filed a cross-motion to file a Third Amended Complaint. Pl.'s Notice of Cross-Motion, ECF No. 31. For the reasons that follow, Defendant's [*2]  motion to dismiss the Complaint is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and Plaintiff's motion to file a third amended complaint is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff worked as a financial assistant for Defendant beginning December 1998 until her termination on or about April 5, 2017. See Second Am. Compl. ("SAC") ¶¶ 6-7, ECF No. 20. Plaintiff was approximately 55 years old when Defendant terminated her employment. Id. ¶ 27.
In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges Defendant's Chief Financial Officer, Robert Serpico, subjected her to nearly twenty years of harassment. See id. ¶¶ 7-9. She alleged Defendant made lewd and sexist remarks to her and also physically harassed her, including allegedly "putt[ing] his knee in her back and forc[ing] her forward, ... which nearly caused her to hit her face on the filing cabinet." Id. ¶¶ 10-12, 18, 31. Plaintiff alleges that after one incident on November 5, 2012, in which Serpico "began screaming at her without reason," Defendant's General Counsel—who witnessed this incident—warned Plaintiff about Serpico's behavior. Id. ¶ 16. In December 2012, Plaintiff emailed Allyson Ford, the Equal Employment Opportunity personnel officer, regarding Serpico's [*3]  behavior. Id. ¶ 17.
In March 2017, Dr. Bleischer, the workers' compensation physician, examined Plaintiff and diagnosed her with carpal tunnel syndrome, a tom rotator cuff, I cervical spine derangement, and a herniated disc. Id. ¶ 20. On April 4, 2017, Plaintiff was diagnosed with a temporary disability and designated to receive worker's compensation. Id. ¶ 21.
On April 5, 2017, Defendant informed Plaintiff via a mailed letter that her employment had been terminated effective immediately. Id. ¶ 22. Plaintiff did not receive severance pay. Id. Defendant has a policy called "involuntary separation," which occurs when an employee is terminated from his or her employment due to "budget reductions, reorganization, workforce downsizing, or other causes not related to job performance or conduct of the employee." Id. ¶ 23. As recently as July 2016, Plaintiff had received performance reviews that indicated her employment performance "greatly exceeds" the requirements of her position. Id. ¶ 26. As alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, Defendant hired a much younger employee to replace Plaintiff after she was terminated. Id. ¶ 28.
On December 27, 2017, Kevin J. Berry, District Director for the [*4]  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), sent a letter informing Plaintiff the EEOC was "unable to conclude that further investigation would result in a finding that '[Defendant] violated Federal law. Therefore, the charge will be dismissed.'" See ECF No. 20-1.
On March 2, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendant. See Compl., ECF No. 1. On September 4, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, which removed a state law claim. See Am. Compl., ECF No. 16. On October 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (the "Complaint"), alleging ten counts: age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"); retaliation under the NYCHRL and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"); failure to accommodate under the ADA and the NYCHIRL; disability discrimination under the ADA and the NYCHRL; and hostile work environment based on gender. See SAC. On March 6, 2019, Defendant filed with the Court a fully briefed Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, along with a Cross-Motion to File a Third Amended Complaint by Plaintiff. See Def. Mem; Pl. Mem; Pl. Notice of Cross-Motion.

LEGAL STANDARD
To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), "a complaint must contain sufficient factual [*5]  matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). So long as a claim is "plausible on its face," dismissal is inappropriate. Sharkey v. Quarantillo, 541 F.3d 75, 92 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. 544). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. But "[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id.
A complaint must be dismissed where, as a matter of law, "the allegations in [the] complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief." Twomblv, 550 U.S. at 558. In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all of the non-movant's factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-movant's favor. Id. at 555. However, the Court is "not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotation marks omitted).

DISCUSSION
Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to satisfy her burden to allege facts giving rise to an inference of any plausible claim, thereby warranting dismissal of the Complaint. Def. Mem. at 1. In response, Plaintiff argues [*6]  she makes out a prima facie case for each of her claims, even though she is not required to plead a prima facie case at this stage, and has provided Defendant with sufficient facts to constitute fair notice of her claims. Pl. Mem. at 1-2. For the reasons discussed below, the Court holds Plaintiff has satisfied her burden with respect to her claims of discrimination based on disability, retaliation based on disability, and hostile work environment, Counts Three through Ten of the Complaint, but has failed to satisfy her burden on her claims of age discrimination and retaliation with respect to her 2012 complaint against Defendant's former Chief Financial Officer, Counts One and Two.

I. Age Discrimination Claims (Count One)
To state a claim for relief under the ADEA, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to state a plausible claim the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff, and that age was the "but for" cause of that adverse action. Boonmalert v. City of New York, 721 F. App'x 29, 32 (2d Cir. 2018). A complaint cannot survive a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss if it only sets forth legal conclusions. Marcus v. Leviton Mfg. Co., Inc., 661 F. App'x 29, 31-32 (2d Cir. 2016) (summary order). Merely replacing an older employee with a younger employee, without more, is insufficient to prove unlawful discrimination under the [*7]  ADEA. Fagan v. N. Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp., 186 F.3d 127,134 (2d Cir. 1999). Parallel state law claims "are analyzed under the same standard as discrimination claims brought under the ADE A." Powell v. Delta Airlines, 145 F. Supp. 3d 189, 198 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (Brodie, J.) (addressing NYSHRL claims).
Defendant argues Plaintiff supports her ADE A and NYCHRL age discrimination claims only with the allegation she was replaced by a younger employee. Def. Mem. at 5-8. As such, Plaintiff failed "to allege facts linking the termination of her employment with her age," and these claims should be dismissed. Id. at 8. In response, Plaintiff argues the Complaint states a prima facie case of age discrimination under both the ADEA and the NYCHRL because it alleges she: (1) was in the protected group at the time (over the age of 40); (2) was qualified for the position in question; (3) suffered from an adverse employment excision and was fired without severance pay; and (4) her replacement was younger. Pl. Mem. at 2-4. Plaintiff relies on LaGrassa v. Autoone Ins. Co., 2008 WL 3887606, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2008) (Hurley, J.), to argue a bare allegation a plaintiff was terminated and replaced by a younger individual, on its own, satisfies the pleading standard under the ADEA. In LaGrassa, Judge Hurley also emphasized that the plaintiff had identified "several other females over the age of forty who were terminated." [*8]  2008 WL 3887606, at *8 n.5.
Here, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts beyond mere conclusions Defendant terminated Plaintiff based on her age. Thus, the Court agrees with the majority of other courts concluding the allegation a plaintiff was replaced by a younger employee, without more, fails to state a claim for relief. See, e.g., Ndremizara v. Swiss Re Amer. Holding Corp., 93 F. Supp. 3d 301, 315-16 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (Karas, J.) ("Plaintiff must allege something that plausibly shows he was a victim of age discrimination."); Payne v. Malemathew, 2011 WL 3043920, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2011) (Seibel, J.) (dismissing pro se complaint with ADEA claim because even reading the complaint liberally, "there is simply nothing in the [Complaint] from which one might reasonably infer that Plaintiff's termination was based on his age"); Zucker v. Five Towns College, 2010 WL 3310698, at *2 & n.2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2010) (Seybert, J.) (listing cases in support of the conclusion that an ADEA plaintiff alleging he was fired and replaced "with someone younger, by themselves, fail to raise his 'right to relief above [a] speculative level'" (alterations in original) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555)).
Indeed, Plaintiff's interpretation of the ADEA would be insupportable because any person over the age 40 would be able to state a claim merely because they were terminated or otherwise not promoted or hired in lieu of a younger individual. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Count [*9]  One of the Complaint is GRANTED.

II. Disability Discrimination and Failure to Accommodate Claims (Counts Three, Four, Six, and Seven)
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: "(1) her employer is subject to the ADA; (2) she was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) she was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) she suffered adverse employment action because of her disability." Snowden v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 612 F. App'x 7, 8-9 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (citing McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120, 125 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also Kinneary v. City of New York, 601 F.3d 151,158 (2d Cir. 201 0) (noting "the same elements that must be proven to establish an ADA claim must be also demonstrated to prove claims under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL"). "An employer may also violate the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation." McMillan, 711 F.3d at 125. To plausibly allege a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA or the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to show she could perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation and that the defendant employer refused to make such an accommodation. Id. at 125-26.
The right to request a leave of absence or modified work schedule is recognized as a reasonable accommodation [*10]  in some circumstances. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); id. § 12111(9) (defining "reasonable accommodation"); Criado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir. 1998). Moreover, while "requesting an indefinite leave extension" is not a reasonable accommodation, see Vangas v. Montefiore Medical Center, 823 F.3d 174, 181 (2d Cir. 2016), requesting an initial leave of absence without being able to provide a fixed date of return is a reasonable accommodation recognized by the EEOC, see EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). Although "it may seem undesirable and perhaps unpalatable," an individual with total disability who cannot perform a job's essential functions "is not entitled to relief." Casellano v. City of New York, 946 F. Supp. 249, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (Stein, J.), aff'd, 143 F.3d 58 (2d Cir. 1998).
Defendant argues Plaintiff fails to allege facts showing either that Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job or that Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Def. Mem. at 8-9. Defendant also argues Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the ADA and the NYCHRL should be dismissed for the same reasons as should her failure to accommodate claims. Id. at 11. In response, Plaintiff avers she performed the job satisfactorily or better for nearly two decades and was terminated only after seeking legal protections for her purported disability. [*11]  Pl. Mem. at 5-6.
The Court holds Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted under the ADA and under the NYCHRL. The Complaint alleges Plaintiff performed her position as a financial assistant for Defendant since 1998 and received positive reviews stating her performance "greatly exceed[ed]" the requirements of her position less than a year before being terminated. SAC ¶ 26. She was also terminated the day after she provided a letter from Dr. Bleicher who informed Defendant she was "temporary totally disabled" and would require a reevaluation in five to six weeks from the date of the letter. Ex. A to Def. Mem (Bleicher's Letter). Although Defendant claims Plaintiff did not establish she could perform the essential functions of the job, her consistent performance before being terminated suggests the opposite. Moreover, although her letter says she was "totally disabled," Defendant ignores the fact Dr. Bleicher wrote Plaintiff was "temporary totally disabled" and woull require reevaluation. Id. (emphasis added). Even if the Court were to accept Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to request an accommodation with its interpretation of Dr. Bleicher's note, see Def. [*12]  Mem. at 8-9, Defendant disregards the clear timeline of events as alleged in the Complaint: Plaintiff requested leave of absence forms on March 22, 2017, and Defendant terminated Plaintiff within 24 hours of receiving the doctor's note on April 4, 2017, thereby precluding Plaintiff from discussing her condition in any further detail. The Court concludes at this stage that a temporary leave of absence can be a reasonable accommodation under both the ADA and NYCHRL, and Defendant's failure to provide that accommodation despite notice of Plaintiff's disability, as alleged in the Complaint, survives dismissal. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.702(b); 9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 466.11(i)(1).
Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Counts Three, Four, Six, and Seven of the Complaint is DENIED.

III. Retaliation Claims (Counts Two, Five, and Eight)
To establish a claim for retaliation under either the ADA or the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must allege: (1) she participated in a protected activity; (2) the defendant knew about that participation; (3) the defendant took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (4) a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Caputo v. Copiague Union Free Sch. Dist., 218 F. Supp. 3d 186, 194 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (Hurley, J.) (applying this framework to ADA and [*13]  NYSHRL claims); see also Fattoruso v. Hilton Grand Vacations Co., 525 F. App'x 26, 27 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order) (setting forth this framework for NYCHRL retaliation claims). Seeking a reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes protected activity under the ADA. See Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N. Y, 287 F.3d 138, 148-49 (2d Cir. 2002) (reversing dismissal of retaliation claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act).
"The causal connection needed for proof of a retaliation claim can be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action." Cifra v. G.E. Co., 252 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); compare Reed v. A. W. Lawrence & Co., 95 F.3d 1170,1178 (2d Cir. 1996) (determining causal connection was established in Title VII action when evidence showed the plaintiff's discharge was "a mere twelve days" after the initial complaint), with Stavis v. GFKHolding, Inc., 769 F. Supp. 2d 330, 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (Sullivan, J.) (granting summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's NYCHRL retaliation claim because "the passage of six months between the protected activity and the adverse employment action prevents Plaintiff from" establishing the causal connection).
a. Worker's Compensation and Disability Retaliation Claims
Defendant argues Plaintiff's retaliation claim based on "requesting and receiving worker's compensation" should be dismissed because she failed to agllege Plaintiff engaged in protected [*14]  activity. Def. Mem. at 15. Defendant also contends this retaliation claim should be dismissed because the Workers' Compensation Board "is the exclusive forum for pursuing a retaliation [claim] based upon seeking Workers' Compensation benefits," citing Prisco v. Air Indus. Group, 2:15-CV-7340, 2017 WL 9485663, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2017) (Shields, M.J.). Def. Mem. at 15-16. In response, Plaintiff argued she sufficiently "alleged a causal link between the Defendant's conduct firing her knowing her need for a leave of [absence]." Pl. Mem. at 10.
Taking Plaintiff's allegations as set forth in the Complaint a true, the Court concludes at this stage of the litigation that Plaintiff's retaliation claims for "among other things, requesting and receiving worker's compensation as a result of her disabilities" survives dismissal. SAC ¶¶ 60, 75. Requests for reasonable accommodations for a disability are protected activity, and there is a causal connection established between Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation and the adverse employment action by Defendant—Plaintiff's termination. For these reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss Counts Five and Eight of the Complaint is DENIED.
b. Retaliation Claim Based on Serpico's Alleged Conduct
Defendant also argues Plaintiffs [*15]  NYCHRL retaliation claim based on her complaining about Serpico's alleged conduct fails to state a claim. Def. Mem. at 16. Specifically, Defendant contends the Complaint fails to provide any plausible connection between Plaintiff's 2012 complaint about Serpico's behavior and her being fired in 2017. Id.
Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support the claim that her termination was plausibly connected to her 2012 complaint against Serpico, and therefore fails to state a claim for retaliation under the NYCHRL. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Count Two of the Complaint is GRANTED. I

IV. Hostile Work Environment Claims (Counts Nine and Ten)
To demonstrate a hostile work environment, Plaintiff must plausibly allege facts to demonstrate: (1) a workplace "with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult... that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment," Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); and (2) "a specific basis ... for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer," Howley v. Town of Stratford, 217 F.3d 141, 154 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, the conduct must be "more than [*16]  episodic." Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 321 (2d Cir. 2015) (Tike VII, § 1981, and § 1983 case). However, a plaintiff may demonstrate the creation of a "sufficiently severe or pervasive" work environment through an "extraordinarily severe" single incident, or through a "series of incidents ... sufficiently continuous and concerted to have altered tie conditions of her working environment." Howley, 217 F.3d at 153. Under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must meet a lower bar, needing to allege only sufficient facts to show plausibly the plaintiff was '"treated less well'" because of a protected class. Nguedi v. Fed. Res. Bank of N.Y, 16-CV-636, 2017 WL 5991757, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2017) (Woods, J.) (quoting Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., 715 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir. 2013)); see Fisher v. Mermaid Manor Home for Adults, LLC, 192 F. Supp. 3d 323, 330-31 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (Kuntz, J.) (denying defendant employer's summary judgment motion on hostile work environment claims, noting "having satisfied the requirements of Title VII, Plaintiff satisfies the minimum requirements for a discrimination claim under [NYCHRL].").
Defendant argues a three-year statute of limitations applies to hostile work environment claims brought under the NYSHRL or the NYCHRL, and claims based on conduct occurring before the date the action commenced on March 2, 2015 should be dismissed as time-barred. Def. Mem. at 11 (citing See N.Y. Exec. Law § 296; N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 8-502(d)). For conduct occurring after that date, Defendant argues "[t]wo isolated comments are mere offensive utterances not sufficiently [*17]  severe or pervasive to create an abusive work environment" under the NYSHRL or the NYCHRL. Def. Mem. at 12, 14 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Even considering incidents that occurred after 2015, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged claims for a hostile work environment at this stage. The Complaint alleges Serpico, Defendant's Chief Financial Officer through 2016, continuously asked Plaintiff questions about whether she was sexually intimate with another employee, "what she was going to make him for dinner and if she would 'take him home.'" SAC ¶¶ 15, 18. Several allegations in the Complaint do not specify dates but instead suggest a pattern and practice of harassment from Serpico created a hostile work environment. See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 9, 10, 18, 19, 30. Plaintiff also alleges Serpico "would consistently make remarks 'you know what I always tell you that we could do this here' and then point to the couch in his office" whenever she requested medical absences for mammography and colonoscopy appointments. Id. ¶ 31. These allegations, taken as true, sufficiently demonstrate a hostile work environment and show a specific basis for imputing the conduct creating the hostile environment to Defendant. [*18]  See Fisher, 192 F. Supp. 3d at 329 (holding, at summary judgment stage for Title VII and NYCHRL claims, a reasonable jury could conclude a single Instagram post "comparing Plaintiff to a fictional chimpanzee from the Planet of the Apes movie, created a hostile work environment").
For these reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss Counts Nine and Ten of the Complaint is DENIED.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim, ECF No. 28, is GRANTED as to Counts One and Two and DENIED as to Counts Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten. Plaintiff's cross-motion to file a third amended complaint, ECF No. 31, is DENIED. Discovery is no longer stayed in this action pursuant to this Court's prior order. See Oct. 10, 2018 Minute Entry. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions pending at ECF Nos. 28, 31.
SO ORDERED.
