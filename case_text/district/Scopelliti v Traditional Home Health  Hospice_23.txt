REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Introduction
This workplace discrimination case, which comes before us for consideration of the defendant's motion for summary judgment, aptly illustrates the limitations of such motions. The factual record in this case presently seems marked by some stubborn ambiguities and stark factual disputes. Thus, it is not entirely clear what disabilities affected the plaintiff, what accommodations she sought, and how those accommodations were met. Further, the circumstances surrounding Scopelliti's employment, and the end of her employment, are hotly disputed. Indeed, it seems that the parties cannot fully agree regarding whether Scopelliti was fired or resigned. These factual disputes and ambiguities, in our view, combine to largely defeat any summary judgment adjudication of this case at this time.
Pending before the court is the defendant's motion for [*2]  summary judgment in an employment dispute case rife with contention between the former employee and current plaintiff, Dina Scopelliti, and her former employer and supervisors. (Doc. 23). Scopelliti, brought the instant suit against her former employer, Traditional Home Health and Hospice (Traditional), alleging violations of her rights under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2611, et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111, et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. Scopelliti contends that she was entitled to FMLA leave, and that after taking such leave consistent with her rights, she was terminated in retaliation for her exercise of these rights. Scopelliti further argues that the defendant discriminated against her because of her alleged disabilities, failed to reasonably accommodate her disabilities, and retaliated against her in violation of the ADA and ADAAA.1
The defendant disputes these claims, arguing initially that Scopelliti had exhausted all of her FMLA leave and had voluntarily resigned before she had notice of any adverse employment action taken against her. Further, the defendant claims that Scopelliti's request for an accommodation was unreasonable and unduly burdensome, and thus the [*3]  defendant was not required to provide her with the requested accommodation. The defendant also asserts that it terminated Scopelliti's employment because of her repeated absenteeism and because she had exhausted her FMLA leave.2
After review of the record, we find that there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude the entry of summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim relating to her termination. [*4]  As for her ADA claims, at this time a series of factual ambiguities prevent us from reaching any final conclusions regarding the merits of these claims. Therefore, we recommend that the defense summary judgment motion be denied. However, we further recommend that the court deny the motion as to the plaintiff's ADA claims without prejudice to the defendant attempting to renew this motion on a more precise and fulsome record.

II. Statement of Facts and of the Case
Dina Scopelliti worked for the defendant as an Insurance Verification Specialist from 2014 until 2017. (Doc. 6, ¶ 1). Beginning in July of 2015, Scopelliti was forced to request and take various forms of FMLA leave for medical issues. (Doc. 42-1, 40-41). One of her treating physicians then authored a report on August 4, 2015 recommending intermittent FMLA leave for a period of one year, during which time Scopelliti could take leave if her conditions flared up or worsened. (Id., at 42). From this time until June 5, 2017, it appears that Scopelliti was covered under either intermittent or extended FMLA leave recommended by at least one of her medical providers. (Id., at 61-63, 68-69, 94-95, 98, 121).
while covered under FMLA leave, Scopelliti attended physical therapy in January [*5]  of 2017, (Id., at 87), had multiple surgical procedures, including one which was scheduled in November of 2016, but was delayed until February 8, 2017 due to insurance concerns and the busy holiday season at work, (Id., at 62-68, 74-75, 79), and two procedures in March of 2017. (Id., at 92). For the surgeries in March of 2017, Scopelliti had originally planned to take minimal time off of work, but after a difficult recovery that was longer than expected, this return date was ultimately amended numerous times by her providers to an eventual return date of June 5, 2017. (Id., at 94-95, 98). On June 5, 2017, however, Scopelliti did not return to work, instead calling off ill and claiming that she needed more time to recover. (Id., at 97). She subsequently called off on June 6, 2017, at which time she told her supervisors that she would not be in to work for the remainder of the week. (Doc. 42-4, 6). Scopelliti did not have a medical provider's recommendation for FMLA leave and was not covered under the FMLA when she requested this additional week to continue her recovery. (Doc. 42-1, 98-99).
On June 6, 2017, after Scopelliti's FMLA leave had expired and she had not yet obtained an extension for her FMLA leave or returned to work, the defendant's Human Resources [*6]  Manager, Tammy Morano, mailed Scopelliti a letter terminating her employment, effective immediately. (Doc. 42-2, 30). This letter informed Scopelliti that her "FMLA entitlement exhausted on June 2, 2017, at which time [she] was expected to return to work on June 5[.]" (Id.) The only real explanation given to Scopelliti for her termination was that the defendant could not hold the position open any longer, and that her extended period of leave could "put the Connections Program at risk as the management of the patients in this program require their oversight on a full time basis." (Id.) The defendant further apologized that Scopelliti's health status was preventing her return to work, but that the position simply needed a full-time employee. (Id.)
While Scopelliti had been away from work on approved FMLA leave, Morano had contacted Scopelliti regarding her reassignment to a new position as the Connections Coordinator, which Morano believed might provide a less physically taxing work environment and would allow Scopelliti to work from home on occasion. (Doc. 42-4, ¶ 23). Due to a difference of opinion on the nature of this position, Scopelliti was unhappy about this potential employment [*7]  move, and believed that she was being relocated as part of a plan to phase out the Connections program, and eventually herself with it. (Doc. 42-1, 142-43). In an effort to avoid what she believed was inevitable, Scopelliti voluntarily resigned from her position on June 8, 2017—the day before she received her termination letter in the mail from the defendant. (Id.)
Thereafter, Scopelliti filed a written complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), which was cross-filed with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ("PHRC") to exhaust her administrative remedies. (Doc. 6, ¶ 7). Within ninety days after receiving her right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Scopelliti filed this action on January 5, 2018. (Doc. 1). Fact discovery in this case concluded on July 30, 2018. (Doc. 18). The defendant then filed the instant motion for summary judgment on August 18, 2018. (Doc. 23). The motion has been fully briefed (Docs. 40, 44, 46, 61, 62) and is ripe for resolution.

III. Discussion

A. Summary Judgment — Standard of Review
The defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is [*8]  no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-0493, 702 F. Supp. 2d 465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31615, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006); accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish [*9]  the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Sch., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark NJ v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). [*10]  "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence, or assess credibility, when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . the opponent [*11]  need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).

B. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Should be Denied as to the Plaintiff's Claims for FMLA Retaliation.
The FMLA's implementing regulations make clear that an employer "is prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used FMLA leave. For example . . . employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c). In the typical FMLA retaliation claim, an employee alleges that after [*12]  taking FMLA-qualifying leave, she was subjected to an adverse employment action, including termination or other retaliatory action, because she took time away from work for FMLA-qualifying reasons. See, e.g., Freeman v. Phila. Hous. Auth., No. 12-1422, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100774, at *31 (E.D. Pa. July 18, 2018) (describing retaliation claims as those "where an employee requested or took FMLA leave, remained at or returned to work, and then was subject to some type of adverse employment action such as termination or demotion"). Indeed, the gist of an FMLA retaliation claim is that the defendant has taken some adverse action against an employee because of her past use of FMLA leave.
To prove a claim for FMLA retaliation, an employee "must show that h[er] employer intentionally discriminated against him for exercising an FMLA right." Mascioli, 610 F. Supp. 2d at 433 (quoting Martin v. Brevard County Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008)). Where, as here, the plaintiff's retaliation claims are based on circumstantial evidence, they are analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting paradigm prescribed by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Naber v. Dover Healthcare Assocs., 765 F. Supp. 2d 622, 633 (D. Del. 2011); Bearley v. Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 322 F. Supp. 2d 563, 571 (M.D. Pa. 2004); Baltuskonis v. U.S. Airways, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 2d 445, 448 (E.D. Pa. 1999). To establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she took leave under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between her protected activity and the employer's adverse employment action. [*13]  Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 302 (3d Cir. 2012); Bearley, 322 F. Supp. 2d at 571.
To demonstrate a causal connection, a plaintiff must show either (1) an unusually suggestive temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action alleged to be retaliatory, or (2) a pattern of antagonism, coupled with timing. Budhun v. Reading Hosp. and Med. Ctr., 765 F.3d 245, 258 (3d Cir. 2014). When temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse is action is "unduly suggestive," it may be "sufficient standing alone to create an inference of causality and defeat summary judgment." Lichtenstein, 691 F.3d at 307 (quoting LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 232 (3d Cir. 2007)). If temporal proximity is not unusually suggestive on its own, courts are to "ask whether 'the proffered evidence, looked at as a whole, may suffice to raise the inference.'" Id. (quoting LeBoon, 503 F.3d at 232). There is no bright-line rule as to what constitutes suggestive temporal proximity, LeBoon, 503 F.3d at 233, although case law indicates that where temporal proximity has been found sufficiently suggestive, it has typically been a matter of days or weeks. See, e.g., Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 1989) (two days). Finally, in conducting this burden-shifting analysis at summary judgment, we must remain mindful of one other consideration. In this setting we are enjoined that "[s]ummary judgment is to be used sparingly in employment discrimination cases." Doe v. C.A.R.S. Prot. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358, 369 (3d Cir. 2008). Guided by these legal tenets, we conclude that [*14]  there are disputed issues of material fact to preclude summary judgment in this case on Scopelliti's FMLA retaliation claim.
Scopelliti's arguments that she faced retaliation for taking FMLA leave are twofold: first, she claims that the defendant instituted a policy in retaliation for her request to take her lunch break at the end of the day to attend medical appointments while on intermittent FMLA leave. Specifically, the policy stated that:
When an employee has an appointment out of the office (such as medical, dental, etc.) he/she [may use] his/her lunch break provided the appointment is less than 1 hour. If the employee anticipates that the appointment will be more than 1 hour, he/she must take [an] absence from the office. An employee can only request to take his/her lunch hour for an appointment once quarterly . . . . An employee cannot schedule his/her lunch break to be taken at the end of the day (ex: leave [at] 4:30 to take [his or her] lunch). This will only be waived if the lunch is being taken for an appointment and then it can only occur quarterly.
(Doc. 6, ¶ 20). She alleges that this policy change was a direct result of her request to attend her medical appointments at [*15]  the end of the day and caused her to miss or cancel future appointments. (Id., ¶ 21). Second, she asserts that she was fired immediately after concluding an extended period of FMLA leave from March through June 5, 2017 after having surgery, that her reasonable request for an extra week off to continue recovering from this procedure was denied, and that she was ultimately terminated as a result of this request and her protracted FMLA leave.
Initially, we find the plaintiff's first argument without merit. It is unclear whether Scopelliti had requested to use her intermittent FMLA leave at the end of the day to attend her medical appointments or whether she had merely requested to take her lunch break at this time, her lunch break being an employer-provided break from the work day which would not have been considered leave from work.3 From what we can tell, the record indicates that the plaintiff had requested, and had been granted intermittent FMLA leave in the time frame leading up to the implementation of the policy at issue. There is also evidence that, while the plaintiff had wanted to use FMLA leave to attend these appointments, the defendant's policies required her to use her personal [*16]  paid time off before her FMLA rights would become effective. It is unclear whether the plaintiff had, in fact, exhausted her personal paid time off to enable her to use her FMLA rights during the pertinent time period.
We reiterate that to prove a claim for FMLA retaliation, an employee "must show that his employer intentionally discriminated against him for exercising an FMLA right." Mascioli, 610 F. Supp. 2d at 433 (quoting Martin v. Brevard County Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008)). Here, we lack clear evidence that the plaintiff had the opportunity to exercise her rights under the FMLA. Given the preliminary and fundamental nature of this omission from the pleadings and the record, we cannot determine that the plaintiff suffered retaliatory treatment under the FMLA for her requests to take her lunch break at the end of the day to attend medical appointments. Furthermore, assuming that Scopelliti had attempted to use FMLA leave at the end of the day on a few occasions, there is no evidence that this new policy preventing employees from taking their lunch break at the end of the day constituted an adverse employment action. Scopelliti's largely unsupported assertion that, as a result of this new policy, she was forced to reschedule and cancel medical appointments [*17]  is not an employment-related effect of this new policy.4 Therefore, this argument is unavailing.
In contrast, we find that Scopelliti's second argument that she faced retaliation after taking an extended period of time off from work for surgery and recovery under the FMLA is sufficient to survive the defendant's summary judgment motion. It is uncontested in this case that Scopelliti invoked her right to FMLA leave in March of 2017, and ended up utilizing that right until her anticipated, yet unfulfilled return to full-time employment on June 5, 2017. It is also undisputed that Scopelliti suffered an adverse employment action shortly after she utilized this leave since she was terminated on June 6, 2017 via letter from Traditional, which stated that her termination was effective immediately. While we recognize that the employment relationship between these parties had devolved such that the plaintiff felt compelled to resign via email on June 8, 2017, the day before her receipt of her termination notice, the plain chronology in this case must control our analysis. Simply stated, the defendant fired Scopelliti on June 6, 2017, effective immediately. Regardless of whether she [*18]  knew it at the time, the plaintiff was, therefore, subject to an adverse employment action on June 6, 2017.
Thus, all that remains is the question of causation—a question which often turns on issues of human motivation and can be proven circumstantially by temporal proximity. In this case, we believe that the evidence would permit, but not compel, an inference of causation. Therefore, this evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to Scopelliti, describes disputed issues of fact which may not be resolved as a matter of law but must be tested at trial as a matter of fact. In particular, we conclude that the temporal proximity of these events, coupled with Traditional's decision in its June 6, 2017 termination letter to link Scopelliti's discharge to her past use of FMLA leave, would permit an inference of causation. Scopelliti argues that Traditional retaliated against her for taking the FMLA leave that was approved from March of 2017 until June 5, 2017. Scopelliti was then fired a mere one day later, following her notice that she would need the remainder of the week off. We acknowledge that Scopelliti's narrative is hotly disputed by the defendant and is the subject of mutually contradictory [*19]  descriptions by Scopelliti and her supervisors. This contest over matters of historical recollection, however, simply defines a factual dispute for trial. Moreover, setting aside these factual disputes, this is a suggestively close chronology of events in our view.
But in any event, the circumstantial evidence which permits an inference of causation is not limited to this temporal proximity alone. When Traditional fired Scopelliti, the termination letter issued by the defendant can be read to do what the law forbids, in that it can be seen as describing "'the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions.' 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c)." Budhun v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 765 F.3d 245, 258 (3d Cir. 2014). In fact, the only explanation given by Morano for releasing Scopelliti in this June 6, 2017 letter was her extended and continued time off from work due to medical problems—the vast majority of which was spent during FMLA leave—which prevented her from devoting full-time work to her position as required by the defendant. The letter states that Scopelliti's employment was terminated because: "Your FMLA entitlement exhausted on June 2, 2017 at which time you were expected to return to work on June 5, 2017 . . . . You did not return to work on June 5th as you called [*20]  off ill on June 5th and June 6th on which date you said you would not be returning for the rest of the week." (Doc. 42-4, 34). Morano went on to explain that "[t]he Agency . . . cannot hold the position open any longer[,]" and that the Agency was "sorry that your health status is preventing you from returning to work . . . ." Taken together, this circumstantial evidence satisfied Scopelliti's prima facie burden of showing that there are disputed factual issues regarding the causation element of this FMLA retaliation claim.
The defendant counters that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing Scopelliti in that her FMLA leave had expired and her request for an additional week off after her expected, yet unfulfilled return to work was unduly burdensome. (Doc. 40, 17). However, other countervailing facts undermine the persuasive power of this defense. Thus, while there is abundant evidence from Scopelliti's supervisors at Traditional that everyone worked closely with the plaintiff throughout her time at Traditional to accommodate her medical needs and allow her to attend her medical appointments and classes when necessary, (see Doc. 42-4, 2-5, 13-14), the defendant opted [*21]  to fire Scopelliti the same day that she requested an additional week off of work to recover on June 6, 2017—a request that, according to the defendant's deposition testimony, likely would have been granted in the past. We find these factors sufficient to create disputed issues of fact concerning the defendant's reasons for Scopelliti's termination, and thus sufficient to survive summary judgment. We accordingly recommend that summary judgment be denied as to the plaintiff's claim for retaliation under the FMLA.

C. Traditional's Motion for Summary Judgment Should be Denied Without Prejudice as to the Plaintiff's ADA and ADAAA Claims.
In contrast to her FMLA claim, which is marked by clear, albeit disputed, factual issues, there is a certain measure of ambiguity to Scopelliti's ADA claims. As we understand it, Scopelliti alleges three claims under the ADA and ADAAA: disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation. We address these arguments in turn.5
Mindful of the effect that the ADAAA amendments had on liberally classifying individuals with disabilities, the purpose of the ADA remains to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "To state a claim [for disability discrimination] under the ADA, an individual must (1) be disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) be otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) have suffered an adverse employment decision." Miller v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 350 Fed. App'x 727, 728-29 (3d Cir. 2009). The ADA's protections extend to all qualified individuals with disabilities, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Qualified individuals with disabilities are defined as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform [*23]  the essential functions of the employment position that [the] individual holds or desires." Id., § 12111(8); Turner v. Hershey Chocolate USA, 440 F.3d 604, 608 (3d Cir. 2006). Thus, we begin our analysis with whether Scopelliti has presented sufficient evidence that she is a disabled person under the ADA. "The ADA defines 'disability' as: (A) 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such [an] individual'; (B) 'a record of such an impairment'; or (C) 'being regarded as having such an impairment.' 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)." Kessler v. AT&T, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, *16 (M.D. Pa. 2015). "Although the statute does not define the term 'major life activities,' the EEOC has issued regulations explaining that major life activities are 'functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.'" Tice v. Ctr. Area Transp. Auth., 247 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)). After the ADAAA amendments, this non-exhaustive list is to be construed liberally in favor of plaintiffs. See Miller v. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48473, *29 (W.D. Pa. 2018).
Scopelliti's pleadings indicate that she is pursuing her case under all definitions of a "disability" under the ADA. (See Doc. 6, ¶¶ 28-30). Likewise, in her amended complaint, Scopelliti paints with a broad brush, generally stating that she has lupus and chronic migraines. (Doc. 6, ¶ 28). She then claims [*24]  that her "disabilities affect her ability to bend, walk, lift and concentrate." (Id., ¶ 29). Scopelliti thus invites us to make a series of assumptions: first, that her disabilities include lupus and chronic migraines; second, that these conditions "affect her ability to bend, walk, lift and concentrate[;]" and third, that these conditions meet the definition of a disabled individual under the ADA and the EEOC's regulations. (Id.) Her subsequent pleadings before this court have not wholly clarified this ambiguity.
The defendant takes issue with these ambiguities, noting that "[t]he record is totally insufficient about what precise impairment is the source of Ms. Scopelliti's purported disability[,]" and claiming that Scopelliti has failed "to adduce sufficient evidence that [her] alleged limitations were substantial." (Doc. 61, 5-6). We agree with the defendant that Scopelliti's allegations of disability are vague and imprecise at best, but that the implementing regulations of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 direct our treatment of this issue:
The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, [*25]  not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.1; see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 ("Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis."); see also Kessler, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, *17. Presented with this statement of congressional intent in the ADA Amendments Act and its implementing regulations and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we find that a jury could conclude that Scopelliti is disabled within the meaning of the ADA by virtue of her migraines and lupus. We come to this conclusion based on Scopelliti's deposition testimony, which also indicates, contrary to the defendant's assertions, that the effects of her disability were substantial under the ADAAA amendments.6 (See Doc. 42-1, 13, 68-69, 134-35).
As to the second element of a prima facie discrimination case under the ADA and ADAAA, the EEOC regulations divide the question of whether an individual is qualified for his or her position into two parts: "(1) whether the individual has the requisite skill, experience, education and other [*26]  job-related requirements of the position sought, and (2) whether the individual, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position." Turner, 440 F.3d at 611 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)); see also Bisker v. GGS Info. Servs., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *5 (M.D. Pa. 2010). In this case, there does not appear to be a dispute over whether Scopelliti had the "requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements" to perform her job with the defendant. Rather, the parties seem to dispute whether consistent, full-time attendance was an essential function of her job, and thus whether Scopelliti could perform this essential function of her job with a reasonable accommodation—i.e., reducing her work hours or modifying her schedule to attend medical appointments and taking an extra week off in June of 2017 to recover from her surgical procedure earlier in the year.
"Whether a job duty is an 'essential function' turns on whether it is 'fundamental' to the employment position," Turner, 440 F.3d at 612 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)), and is a factual determination made on a case by case basis. Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *5 (citing Turner, 440 F.3d at 612). While many cases have held that regular attendance is an essential function of a job, see, e.g., Veltri v. Thompson Consumer Elecs., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31710 (M.D. Pa. 2004); Jovanovic v. In-Sink-Erator Div. of Emerson Elec. Co., 201 F.3d 894, 899-900 (7th Cir. 2000) ("Common sense dictates that regular attendance is usually an essential in most every employment [*27]  setting; if one is not present, he is usually unable to perform his job."); Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994); Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 217 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994); Santiago v. Temple Univ., 739 F. Supp. 974, 979 (E.D. Pa. 1990), aff'd, 928 F.2d 396 (3d Cir. 1991), our precedent in this Circuit indicates that this is a fact-bound inquiry which is inappropriate for summary judgment, except in clear cases. See Miller v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 350 Fed. App'x 727, 729 (3d Cir. 2009) (holding that "[a]ttendance can constitute an essential function under the ADA" where it is "evident that attendance is an essential element of [the] position"). We are not presented with enough evidence on the record to determine as a matter of law that Scopelliti's position with the defendant was such that attendance was essential.7
We thus move to a discussion of whether the defendant provided Scopelliti with reasonable accommodations, as required by the ADA. As the Third Circuit has summarized,
An employer discriminates against a qualified individual when it does "not make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" means measures such as "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant [*28]  position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Id. § 12111(9).
Turner, 440 F.3d at 608. Undue hardships involve "significant difficulty or expense in, or resulting from, the provision of the accommodation." Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *6 (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir. 1999)) (quotation marks omitted); 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. § 1630.2(p). The plaintiff bears the initial burden of "identifying an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Walton, 168 F.3d at 670. The burden then shifts to the defendant to either prove that "the accommodation is unreasonable or that it creates an undue hardship for the defendant." Id. Summary judgment is thus only appropriate where the plaintiff's proposal "is either clearly ineffective or outlandishly costly." Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *6-7 (quoting Walton, 168 F.3d at 670) (quotation marks omitted).
Here, there is both a factual ambiguity and a dispute of material fact regarding whether the defendant honored Scopelliti's requests for accommodations during her employment and whether those requested accommodations were unreasonable.8 This is evidenced by conflicting accounts of the events regarding Scopelliti's planned surgery on the Friday following Thanksgiving in 2016, her routine medical appointments throughout her [*29]  tenure with Traditional, and her request for an additional week off after her scheduled return from an extended period of FMLA leave in June of 2017.9 (Doc. 42-1, 44-45, 54, 58-59, 64, 68-69, 79, 91, 98, 100-02, 107-08, 119-20, 124-25; Doc. 42-4, 2-6, 13-16, 22-23). Scopelliti has also put forth evidence that she offered to work extended hours for the defendant to make up for her time off from work. (Doc. 42-1, 122-23). Even if these factual accounts were not in conflict, the defendant has produced no evidence that Scopelliti's requests for additional time away from work to attend her medical appointments or to continue recovering from her medical procedure in June of 2017 were "outlandishly costly" or that her proposals to work alternate hours were "clearly ineffective."
On the present, incomplete, record, the defendant is therefore not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination under the ADA and the ADAAA. We note that it may well be that a more precisely focused summary judgment motion could address these ambiguities. Therefore, we recommend that the district court deny this motion without prejudice to the defense raising more pointed and directed [*30]  issues for our future review, noting the imprecision with which Scopelliti's alleged disabilities were presented and briefed from both parties.
Having satisfied this initial burden of setting forth a prima facie discrimination case under the ADA and ADAAA, albeit a case rooted in an ambiguous factual record, we turn to Scopelliti's remaining claims for failure to accommodate and retaliation. Under the ADA, an employer must provide reasonable accommodations to a disabled worker.
An employee can demonstrate that an employer breached its duty to provide reasonable accommodations because it failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process by showing that: "1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith."
Moore v. CVS Rx Servs., Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 321, 335 (M.D. Pa. 2015), aff'd, 660 F. App'x 149 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 772 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)). "The burden is on the employee . . . to inform the employer of both the disability and desire for an accommodation."  [*31] Schillaci v. Cargill Meat Solutions, No. 3:CV-12-561, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, at *4 (M.D. Pa. December 18, 2012) (quoting Drozdowski v. Northland Lincoln Mercury, 321 F. App'x 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2009)) (quotation marks omitted).
The ADA also prohibits retaliation against the disabled for exercising any of their rights under federal law. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action." Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997).
These retaliation and failure to accommodate claims suffer from the same shortcomings as Scopelliti's claim for disability discrimination in this case in that the record before us is imprecise and unclear regarding Scopelliti's disabilities and the connection between these disabilities and the defendant's actions in this case. In other words, it is unclear whether Scopelliti's requests for accommodations were attributable to her chronic migraines or lupus diagnosis, recovery from surgery to resolve these conditions, or some other outstanding cause unrelated to her identified disabilities in her amended complaint. Moreover, we find that there is an ambiguity regarding the nature [*32]  of the accommodations that Scopelliti sought. Specifically, it is unclear to us whether Scopelliti was seeking a "blank check" in terms of time off from work when her alleged disabilities flared up or whether she sought a more tailored solution from the defendant. In short, while the plaintiff alleges that she faced retaliation, and ultimately termination due to her disabilities, the record is unclear on these issues, and when we consider a defense motion for summary judgment, this lack of factual clarity often precludes entry of judgment as a matter of law. Thus, taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we cannot say, given the ambiguities in this case, that summary judgment in favor of the defendant is appropriate. As to Scopelliti's claims under the ADA and the ADAAA, however, we recommend that the district court deny the defendant's motion without prejudice, subject to later renewal on a clearer and more precise record.

IV. Recommendation
For the foregoing reasons it is RECOMMENDED that the defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 23) be DENIED with prejudice as to the plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim concerning the termination of her employment, and [*33]  DENIED without prejudice as to the plaintiff's claims under the ADA and ADAAA, subject to later renewal on a clearer and more precise record.
The parties are hereby placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations, or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and [*34]  may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses, or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
