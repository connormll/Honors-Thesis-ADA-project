ORDER RE: MOTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Lance Jackson worked as a track laborer for Defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company until he suffered a stroke in April 2017. Union Pacific then conducted a Fitness for Duty evaluation of Jackson and applied the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) guidelines to issue five-year work restrictions on Jackson. The FMCSA guidelines note risk of sudden incapacitation increases after a stroke. Given the restrictions, Union Pacific informed Jackson it could not identify reasonable accommodations for him to continue working as a track laborer. Jackson's expert opines he was not at risk for sudden incapacitation and should not have been subject to a five-year waiting period. Jackson sues Union Pacific under the Americans [*2]  with Disabilities Act (ADA) alleging disability discrimination (Count I), failure to accommodate (Count II), and impermissible medical examination (Count III). Union Pacific moves to strike a supplemental report by Jackson's expert as untimely. Jackson resists. Union Pacific moves for summary judgment on all counts. Jackson resists Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment as to Count I. Jackson does not respond to Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment as to Counts II and III.
Because the Court may only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, it first addresses Union Pacific's motion to strike the supplemental expert report. The Court finds the supplemental report is untimely and Jackson fails to show its introduction in whole is harmless or substantially justified. But the Court finds portions of the untimely supplemental report are admissible because they address issues previously covered in timely filed reports. The Court strikes the portions of the untimely supplemental report addressing issues not raised in the timely filed reports. The Court grants in part and denies in part Union Pacific's motion to strike.
As to Union Pacific's motion [*3]  for summary judgment on Count I, the Court finds no genuine issues of material fact exist as to Jackson's prima facie case of disability discrimination, and Jackson fails to show he was disabled under the ADA. It also finds Union Pacific has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for imposing a five-year work restriction on Jackson, and Jackson fails to show Union Pacific's reason was pretextual. Finally, the Court finds Union Pacific meets its burden to show Jackson was a direct threat. As to Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Counts II and III, the Court finds no genuine issues of material fact exist as to Jackson's claims alleging failure to accommodate or impermissible medical examination. The Court grants Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Relevant Facts
The following facts are either uncontested or, if contested, viewed in the light most favorable to Jackson for purposes of considering Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Munz v. Michael, 28 F.3d 795, 796 (8th Cir. 1994).

1. Employment and stroke
Jackson's employment with Union Pacific began in 1996. Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Statement Undisputed Facts & Pl.'s Proposed Facts ¶ 1, ECF No. 53-1. Jackson's most recent position [*4]  was as a track laborer for Union Pacific. Id. The written job description specifies a track laborer must:
Observe the condition of the track, track bed, and track right of way for problems and defects . . . . Perform track maintenance, repair, and installation...Handle and move track materials and equipment . . . . Maintain the track bed . . . [w]ork with equipment. . . [such as] air or hydraulic hammer[s][,] . . . wrenches[,] . . . drill[s][,] saw[s][,] . . . [or] sledge hammer[s] . . . . Practice safe work habits . . . [and t]ake appropriate action when conditions threaten safety of self or coworkers.
Id. ¶ 3 (emphases omitted); Def.'s Sealed App. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. APP 110-11, ECF No. 52-2.
On April 22, 2017, Jackson suffered an off-duty stroke. Compl. ¶ 19, ECF No. 1; Pl.'s Resist. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 53; ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 7. Jackson's neurosurgeon, Dr. David Boarini, concluded the stroke was due to untreated hypertension and occurred in his right basal ganglia, which is a part of the brain's subcortical structures. Boarini Dep. 21:11-15, 22:1-5, 22:22-24, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 226-27. Jackson's expert, Dr. Kevin Trangle, confirmed Jackson's stroke was an intracerebral stroke, [*5]  or intracerebral hemorrhage. Trangle Dep. 113:21-23, ECF No. 55-1 at APP000597.
Jackson's stroke qualified as a Reportable Health Event under Union Pacific Medical Rules. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 10; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 505-08. As such, Tchapo Tchaye, Jackson's supervisor, informed Union Pacific's Health and Medical Services about Jackson's stroke. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 11. On April 26, 2017, Health and Medical Services sent correspondence to Jackson recommending medical leave from April 22, 2017 to October 25, 2017, which Jackson accepted. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 14; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 113.
Under the Medical Rules, Union Pacific conducts a Fitness for Duty evaluation of an employee if it has concerns about the employee's ability to safely perform his or her job. See Holland Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 498; see also ECF No. 52-2 at APP 508-13 (Medical Rules describing Reportable Health Events and Fitness for Duty evaluation). Starting on April 26, 2017, Union Pacific subjected Jackson to a Fitness for Duty evaluation. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 14; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 509-13.

2. Union Pacific's review process
To conduct Jackson's Fitness for Duty evaluation, Union Pacific relied, in part, on the Federal Motor Carrier [*6]  Safety Administration (FMCSA) guidelines to assess his risk for sudden incapacitation. Holland Decl. ¶¶ 13, 15-16, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 500; ECF No. 53-1 ¶¶ 40-41. Union Pacific applies the FMCSA guidelines to all workers it considers safety-critical. Holland Decl. ¶ 16, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 502; ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 41. Union Pacific considers the track laborer position safety-critical. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 4.
The FMCSA guidelines provide that intracerebral hemorrhages with a subcortical deficit, like that suffered by Jackson, are associated with an increased seizure risk. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 578. The FMCSA guidelines recommend a five-year minimum waiting period following an intracerebral hemorrhage with a subcortical deficit if the employee is "at risk for seizures." Holland Decl. ¶ 24, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 502; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 579.
On July 13, 2017, Union Pacific Associate Medical Director, Dr. John Charbonneau, reviewed Jackson's medical records. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 17; Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 586. Dr. Charbonneau noted Jackson experienced a "spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke due to a subcortical right basal ganglia intra-parenchymal bleed." Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 52-2 at [*7]  APP 586. Dr. Charbonneau also noted the location of a stroke affected the duration of the risk of future seizures, and that the bleed suffered by Jackson was associated with increased risk of seizure. Id. ¶ 19, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588. He further found episodes noted by Jackson's occupational therapist might indicate Jackson was already experiencing complex partial seizures. Id. ¶ 19; see infra Part II.A.3 (discussing episodes). Based on Dr. Charbonneau's review of Jackson's then-available medical records, he concluded Jackson needed at least five years of sudden incapacitation restrictions. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 21; Charbonneau Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588-89. Dr. Charbonneau stated Union Pacific's decision "did not terminate" Jackson's employment, and Jackson could potentially return to work following a Fitness for Duty evaluation when his five-year restrictions expired. Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 21, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588.
Dr. Matthew Hughes, Associate Medical Director at Union Pacific's Health and Medical Services, reviewed Jackson's medical records the following month. Hughes Decl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 604. Dr. Hughes determined Jackson could resume "light, non-safety-sensitive [*8]  work, with sudden incapacitation restrictions for five years." Id. ¶ 4.
Based on these reviews, Union Pacific created work restrictions for Jackson prohibiting him from: 1) operating company vehicles or mobile equipment; 2) operating cranes or machinery; 3) working on or near moving trains or freight cars; 4) working at unprotected heights over four feet above the work surface; 5) and working on one or two man gangs. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 184. Union Pacific then issued a restriction review form to Tchaye. Id. at APP 583-84. Tchaye signed the form, noting that "[d]ue to the work we do in [the] engineering department in Marshalltown, IA, we cannot accommodate these restrictions." Id. at APP 584.
On August 23, 2017, Union Pacific issued to Jackson its decision following its Fitness for Duty evaluation. Id. at APP 183. The decision included a list of the sudden incapacitation work restrictions applied to Jackson. Id. at APP 183-84. Union Pacific also informed Jackson his department could not identify a reasonable accommodation permitting him to return to his position. Id.

3. Jackson's health care providers
Jackson saw several healthcare providers following his stroke. He met with a speech-language [*9]  pathologist, Joanna Judd, from May 9, 2017 through June 6, 2017. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 170-76. Judd identified Jackson had "[left] facial weakness," "cognitive-communication deficits, specifically with memory," difficulty swallowing, and "mild articulatory imprecision." Id. at APP 170-71. On May 24, 2017, approximately one month after his stroke, Judd's notes indicate Jackson's girlfriend, Nancy Caldwell, reported that Jackson had "episodes of rolling his eyes up to the right and zon[ing] out" for several seconds, and not recalling these episodes immediately after they occurred. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 174; Caldwell Dep. at 4:6-16, ECF No. 56-1 at APP001192. Judd twice encouraged Jackson to talk with his physician because the episodes were a concern for seizures. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 174. Jackson disputes having seizures. Jackson Dep. at 200:6-11, ECF No. 54-1 at APP000054; ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 57. Jackson never informed his treating physicians about these incidents. Peterson Dep. at 106:12-18, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 341; Boarini Dep. at 41:11-22, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 241. Both Dr. Grant Peterson, Jackson's internal medicine physician, and Dr. David Boarini, his neurosurgeon, confirmed the incidents [*10]  possibly indicated seizures. See Peterson Dep. at 106:2-11, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 341; Boarini Dep. at 42:7-9, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 242.
On June 6, 2017, Judd discharged Jackson, noting, "[Jackson] has no further personal goals in the areas of cognition or communication. [Jackson] reportedly functions well in his environment and has no concerns at this time." Id. at APP 174.
Jackson also saw an occupational therapist beginning on June 2, 2017. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 177-78. Jackson attended occupational therapy four times. Id. at APP 181-82. His occupational therapy focused on "oculomotor control" and home exercise to address eye issues with jerkiness in tracking, difficulty sustaining holds with both eyes, and fatigue. Id. On June 15, 2017, the provider reported, "[Jackson] requests that today be his last day so that he can transition to return to work as soon as possible." Id. at APP 181. The provider concluded there were "[n]o concerns from [an] OT perspective that would limit [Jackson] from returning to work." Id.
Jackson saw his neurosurgeon, Dr. Boarini, twice. Boarini Dep. at 11:24, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 222. After reviewing a follow-up MRI scan, Dr. Boarini concluded Jackson had no need [*11]  for surgery and discharged him on July 3, 2017. See id. at 35:8-14, 36:15-24. Dr. Boarini had no information about Jackson's job duties or any opinion as to whether Jackson could perform his job. Id. at 10:15-19, 37:6-38:15.
Jackson saw his internal medicine physician, Dr. Peterson, at least three times. Peterson Dep. at 20:19-24, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 272 (indicating first visit in April 2017); id. at 56:18-21 (indicating second visit July 7, 2017); id. at 70:22-71:4 (referring to third visit July 28, 2017). On July 7, 2017, Dr. Peterson released Jackson to work at full capacity based on a follow-up examination lasting approximately twenty minutes. See id. at 66:11-17, 68:3-7, 69:3-8. Dr. Peterson did not know Jackson's specific job duties, but was aware Jackson worked for the railroad and performed heavy manual labor. Id. at 58:4-59:12. Dr. Peterson opined Jackson had "normal strength," could perform manual labor, and had well-controlled blood pressure. Id. at 66:20-25, 69:25-70:4. Dr. Peterson determined Jackson was not experiencing side effects from his blood pressure medication that would pose a "safety issue with performing physical labor." Id. at 69:21-70:4.

4. Later reviews and [*12]  expert reports
Jackson retained Dr. Kevin Trangle as an expert. Based on a review of Jackson's medical records, Dr. Trangle issued a report on February 7, 2020 ("February Report"). ECF No. 55-1 at APP000663-91. The February Report surveyed Jackson's health history, stroke, and current claim, and disagrees with the FMCSA risk assessment and Union Pacific's Fitness for Duty evaluation. See ECF No. 55-1 at APP000663-91. Dr. Trangle disagreed that the FMCSA guidelines or their application to Jackson were reasonable or correct. See id. at APP000684-90. He opined Jackson was not experiencing seizures and was not at risk for seizures as indicated by the FMCSA. See id. at APP000684-87. Dr. Trangle concluded the "zon[ing] out" episodes were likely not seizures given their reported brevity and the location of his hemorrhage. Id. at APP000684-85; Trangle Dep. 65:24-68:9, ECF No. 55-1 at APP000549-52. Dr. Trangle further concluded Jackson should have been restricted at most for one or two years because he appears to have suffered "a mild insult (intracerebral bleed type of stroke) with quick recovery . . . [and] without fixed neurologic deficit." See id. at APP000685.
On September 17, 2020, Dr. [*13]  Trangle issued a supplemental report addressing subjects covered during Jackson's deposition ("September Letter"). Id. at APP000693-701. The September Letter included an overview of Jackson's testimony about his work—that he typically worked in a gang of "three or four trackmen" and usually "did not work alone." Id. at APP000694. On November 27, 2020, Dr. Trangle issued another supplemental report which Jackson filed to support his resistance to Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment ("November Letter"). ECF No. 56-1 at APP001424-28.
Following the reviews by Dr. Charbonneau and Dr. Hughes, Dr. John Holland, the Chief Medical Officer at Union Pacific at the time, approved the medical restrictions issued to Jackson. See Hughes Dep. at 15:19-16:7, at ECF No. 52-2 at APP 433-34 (noting Dr. Holland had final authority and was one of the providers that determined Jackson's work restrictions). Dr. Holland affirmed they were "medically reasonable" and supported by scientific literature. Holland Decl. ¶¶ 1, 26, 30, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 498, 502-03. Dr. Matthew Rizzo, Union Pacific's expert neurologist, conducted an independent assessment of Jackson's case. See Rizzo Dep. 4:20-25, ECF No. [*14]  52-2 at APP 457; ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 61. He opined the restrictions Union Pacific issued to Jackson were appropriate and concluded it was reasonable to apply the FMCSA guidelines to railroad industry positions. Id. at 7:23-8:6, 16:25-17:19.
Additional factual findings are set forth below as needed.

B. Procedural Background
On March 7, 2019, Jackson filed a complaint in this Court. ECF No. 1. Jackson alleges three claims against Union Pacific under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.: disability discrimination (Count I); failure to accommodate (Count II); and impermissible medical examination (Count III). Id. ¶¶ 30-48. Union Pacific moves for summary judgment on all counts. ECF No. 49; Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 52. Jackson resists as to Count I. ECF No. 53. To support his resistance, Jackson filed supplemental appendices, including the November Letter. ECF Nos. 54-1 to 56-1 (supplemental appendices); see also ECF No. 56-1 at APP001424-28 (November Letter). Jackson's deadline for disclosing rebuttal experts was August 6, 2020. Ruling Mot. Extend Deadlines 2, ECF No. 43. Union Pacific moves to strike the November Letter as an untimely expert report. ECF No. 60. Jackson resists. ECF No. 66.
The parties did [*15]  not request a hearing on either of Union Pacific's motions. See ECF No. 49; ECF No. 53; Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 63; ECF No. 60; ECF No. 66; Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Strike, ECF No. 67. The Court finds no hearing is necessary and decides the motions without oral argument. See LR 7(c); Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). The Court now addresses Union Pacific's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Untimely Expert Report and Union Pacific's Motion for Summary Judgment, in turn. ECF No. 60; ECF No. 49.

III. LEGAL STANDARDS

A. Motion to Strike
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c)(1) states failure to disclose expert reports as required under Rule 26(a) or (e) results in a penalty unless an exception applies. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a), (e). Under Rule 26(a), a party's expert must produce a written report containing "a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them; . . . [and] the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). Under Rule 26(e), a party must "supplement or correct its disclosure . . . in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure . . . is incomplete or incorrect . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). Supplemental reports are for "the narrow purpose of correcting inaccuracies" and not "to provide an extension of the deadline [*16]  by which a party must deliver the lion's share of its expert information." Wells v. Lamplight Farms, Inc., 303 F.R.D. 530, 536 (N.D. Iowa 2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
A party must disclose expert testimony "at the times and in the sequence that the court orders." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D). If a party fails to comply with these disclosure requirements, "the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). "The burden of establishing substantial justification and harmlessness is upon the party who is claimed to have failed to make the required disclosure." United States v. Stabl, Inc., No. 8:11CV274, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72624, 2013 WL 2250279, at *7 (D. Neb. May 21, 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), aff'd, 800 F.3d 476 (8th Cir. 2015); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c).

B. Motion for Summary Judgment
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the Court must grant a party's motion for summary judgment if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine issue of material fact exists where the issue "may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary [*17]  judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 248.
When analyzing whether a party is entitled to summary judgment, a court "may consider only the portion of the submitted materials that is admissible or useable at trial." Moore v. Indehar, 514 F.3d 756, 758 (8th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Walker v. Wayne Cty., 850 F.2d 433, 434 (8th Cir. 1988)). The nonmoving party "receives the benefit of all reasonable inferences supported by the evidence, but has 'the obligation to come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Atkison v. City of Mt. View, 709 F.3d 1201, 1207 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dahl v. Rice Cty., 621 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir. 2010)). "In order to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, '[a] plaintiff may not merely point to unsupported self-serving allegations.'" Anda v. Wickes Furniture Co., Inc., 517 F.3d 526, 531 (8th Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Bass v. SBC Commc'ns, Inc., 481 F.3d 870, 872 (8th Cir. 2005), abrogated on other grounds by Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc)). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial," and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1042-43 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Ricci, 557 U.S. at 586).
At summary judgment, courts do not "treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); accord Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1043. Courts may not "second-guess" [*18]  employers' business decisions because "employers are free to make employment decisions so long as they do not discriminate unlawfully." Robinson v. Am. Red Cross, 753 F.3d 749, 754 (8th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Union Pacific's Motion to Strike Jackson's Supplemental Expert Report
Union Pacific argues the November Letter is an untimely disclosed expert report under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) and contains new information. See Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Strike, ECF No. 61 at 2-3. Union Pacific argues the November Letter must be excluded because Jackson has not met his burden to establish the untimely disclosure of the November Letter was substantially justified or is harmless. See ECF No. 67 at 1-4. Jackson contends the November Letter is not an untimely expert report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) and that the disclosure tardiness is harmless because the November Letter "merely embraces [the] timely produced reports." ECF No. 66 at 1-3.
The Court finds, while the November Letter contains some material that reiterates findings from the February Report, it also contains information not previously discussed. Because Jackson fails to show his failure to timely disclose the new information was substantially justified or is harmless, the Court grants Union [*19]  Pacific's motion in part and strikes the portions of the November Letter that address new issues.
A supplemental expert report is untimely if it is issued after the date set in the pretrial scheduling order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(2), 37(c); see also Trost v. Trek Bicycle Corp., 162 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir. 1998) ("[F]ailure to disclose in a timely manner is equivalent to failure to disclose."). Failure to timely disclose as required by court order results in exclusion of the evidence "unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The pretrial order set an August 6, 2020 deadline for Jackson's rebuttal expert disclosures. See ECF No. 43 at 2. The November Letter was disclosed on November 30, 2020—more than three months after the deadline. See ECF No. 56-1 at APP001424-28. It is therefore untimely and must be excluded unless Jackson shows this failure was substantially justified or is harmless. Cf. Stabl, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72624, 2013 WL 2250279, at *7.
When determining whether to exclude untimely supplemental expert reports, the Eighth Circuit considers the reason for failing to comply; the importance of the evidence; the opposing party's need for time to prepare; and whether a continuance would be useful. See Amplatz v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., 823 F.3d 1167, 1172 (8th Cir. 2016); see also Transclean Corp. v. Bridgewood Servs., Inc., 101 F. Supp. 2d 788, 795-96 (D. Minn 2000). The party seeking to include an untimely report under Rule 37(c) has the burden to show harmlessness. [*20]  Stabl, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72624, 2013 WL 2250279, at *7.
Courts have found failure to disclose "harmless" when a supplemental report only reiterated what was stated in a timely disclosure. See Allianz, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, 2016 WL 4435094 at *6. In Allianz, a products liability case, the parties engaged in a battle of the experts concerning the composition of an allegedly defective plumbing part. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, [WL] at *1-2. The defendant's expert report opined that the part was not an original manufactured by the defendant. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, [WL] at *3. Plaintiff's experts opined that the part in question was an original. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, [WL] at *3-4. Defendant's expert submitted a late reply, focusing only on whether the presence of tin "conclusively establish[ed] that the [part] is not made of [the particular] alloy," which plaintiff moved to strike. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, [WL] at *6. The court denied the motion to strike, finding defendant's expert "had already concluded in his original report that . . . the failed [plumbing part] [is] not alloy." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the court concluded the declaration "does nothing more than reiterate [the expert's] previous opinions, and its admission is harmless." Id.
The February Report discusses a broad range of issues pertaining to Jackson's disability claims. In relevant part, it addresses the FMCSA guidelines and [*21]  the impropriety of a five-year waiting period for Jackson; the aviation industry's development of the one-percent-rule—that is, the rule that imposes restrictions if doctors determine an employee has a one percent or greater chance of sudden incapacitation; and the general job duties of a track laborer. ECF No. 55-1 at APP000689-90. The November Letter opines on related topics, but includes information not previously disclosed—1) the risk of seizure associated with incidents to the basal ganglia, 2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its use of the one-percent-rule, and 3) comparison of the FAA and the FMCSA guidelines and Jackson's job duties. See ECF No. 56-1 at APP001424-28.
The Court finds the November Letter reiterates Dr. Trangle's previous opinions in part. The Court also finds the November Letter supplies new information and opinions. The Court discusses below the three subjects in the November Letter that supplement the information in the timely filed expert reports. Because Jackson fails to show the untimely disclosure of this new information was substantially justified or is harmless, the Court excludes these portions of the November Letter.

1. Data on seizure risk [*22]  incidence rates
The November Letter indicates, for the first time, that Jackson's risk of sudden incapacitation is less than one percent. See ECF No. 56-1 at APP001425-26. For the first time, the November Letter also discusses specific seizure risk rates for individuals who suffer certain neurological conditions, including a basal ganglia stroke. See ECF No. 67 at 2-3. The November Letter states:
Furthermore, the additional 4% of individuals who may have a seizure are spread out over a 4 year period, with the great majority of such events occurring within not only in the first few months following a CVA [cerebral vascular accident], but additionally, such events being much rarer after a two year post CVA incident. Even if one looks arithmetically at the incidence this would be an annual rate of 0.8%, still less than the 1% purported guideline as applied by UP. Furthermore, after 2 years the incidence drops more dramatically, and if one considers the location, mainly the basal ganglia, the actual percentage approaches 0.1% which is only twice the natural occurring seizure rate of 0.05% in large population studies.
ECF No. 56-1 at APP001425 (emphases added).
The November Letter opines a [*23]  second time on "newer . . . and more specific data" for seizure risk after "deep basal ganglion types of infarcts." ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426. These sections conclude:
[I]f one looks at the more relevant data, the newer data and more specific data, deep basal ganglion types of infarcts do not have the same ultimate[] frequency incident that would be determined on a cortical lesion. In other words, even though this is the subcortical area of the brain, one would expect the amount of seizures to be a great deal less than in the cortical area.
After a two year post basal ganglia CVA incident, without seizure, without fixed neurological deficit, even if one looks arithmetically at the incidence this would be an annual rate of 0.8%, still less than the 1% purported guideline as applied by UP. Furthermore, more recent literature shows that after 2 years the incidence drops more dramatically, and if one considers the location, mainly the basal ganglia, the actual percentage approaches 0.1% which is only twice the natural occurring seizure rate of 0.05% in large population studies.
ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426 (emphases added). This data is not in the February Report. See ECF No. 55-1 at APP000663-91. [*24] 
The November Letter's discussion of data on seizure risk incidence rates must be excluded. Because the February Report never identifies data on specific seizure rates for incidents to the basal ganglia, the November Letter does not merely reiterate previously disclosed information. See ECF No. 55-1 at APP000663-91; cf. Allianz, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, 2016 WL 4435094 at *6. The untimely disclosure of these portions of the November Letter is therefore not harmless. Jackson also provides no evidence that his failure to disclose is substantially justified. Cf. Stabl, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72624, 2013 WL 2250279, at *7. Consequently, the Court grants Union Pacific's motion to strike as to this information in the November Letter.

2. One-percent-rule and the FAA
Union Pacific argues the November Letter contains new information about the one-percent-rule and new comparisons of the FMCSA and the FAA. ECF No. 67 at 1-2. Contrary to Union Pacific's framing, the February Report does include some discussion of the one-percent-rule's adoption and use by the aviation industry. ECF No. 55-1 at APP000690. The February Report mentions the historical adoption of the one percent number as "arbitrary but widespread in the aviation industry." Id. But the November Letter provides new material on this subject.
The November [*25]  Letter states:
It was called the 1% rule which many thought, and many still do believe, is arbitrary, not widespread, and actually changing. Many governments now want to do a 2% rule as it has been shown that, in the situation of the 1% rule, that it is quite safe . . . .
The risk of cardiovascular events is roughly (10) ten times that of having a subsequent neurological event in an individual. The 1% rule was actually generated with that potentiality in mind as opposed to a particular neurological event that was only secondary.
ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426.
Unlike the November Letter, the February Report does not express that the rule is "not widespread," "changing," or that a "2% rule" would be "quite safe." Compare ECF No. 55-1 at APP000690 with ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426. The February Report also does not clearly state the risk of cardiovascular events as roughly ten times that of having a subsequent neurological event in an individual. Compare ECF No. 55-1 at APP000690 with ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426. The inclusion of this material is not harmless because it does not reiterate information from the February Report. Cf. Allianz, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113450, 2016 WL 4435094 at *6. Jackson also provides no evidence that his failure to disclose this [*26]  information is substantially justified. Cf. Stabl, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72624, 2013 WL 2250279, at *7. The Court strikes the November Letter's new conclusions that the "2% rule . . . is quite safe" and being considered by "[m]any governments," and that the "1% rule was actually generated with [the cardiovascular risk in an individual] in mind as opposed to a particular neurological event that was only secondary." ECF No. 56-1 at APP001426.

3. Jackson's job duties and comparing the FAA to the FMCSA
For the first time, the November Letter compares Jackson's job to that of a pilot.
In many ways, the job of Mr. Jackson is very similar to multicrew environments in terms of he is not alone, he has at least one person with him if not two or more. In many ways, it is different from what he does in that he is not responsible for the lives of several hundred people in a plane, but rather he is primarily on the ground or on the side of a train and many times only actually doing supervisory sedentary type of work. The potential catastrophic consequences for an individual such as Mr. Jackson having sudden incapacitation in his job are much less than would be noted in the aviation industry.
ECF No. 56-1 at APP001427 (emphasis added).
The February Report briefly [*27]  mentioned Jackson's track laborer job description and noted the job responsibilities included maintaining the track and did not include driving locomotives. ECF No. 55-1 at APP000686. The February Report mentioned the one-percent-rule applied to multi-crew environments in the aviation context. Id. at APP000690. The September Letter further addressed that Jackson seldom worked alone and usually worked on multi-person gangs. Id. at APP000694. But neither the February Report nor September Letter compared Jackson's job to that of a pilot, or discussed the degree or nature of "potential . . . consequences" of Jackson's sudden incapacitation on the job. See id. at APP000690, APP000694.
Finally, for the first time, the November Letter compared the differences between the FAA and the FMCSA's procedures for determining what conditions disqualify a person from a position.
Furthermore, the way the aviation administration operates is different than the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the DOT. The FAA uses a system where there are a certain number of potentially disqualifying conditions that go to the central agency to make decisions. One of them would be a stroke, either hemorrhagic [*28]  or infarct, as would be a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). This is not decided on the level of the Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Some of the disqualifying conditions which need central clarification in decision making includes sudden unconsciousness without explanation of cause or change of neurological control and nervous system function without satisfactory explanation of cause.
ECF No. 56-1 at APP001427; see ECF No. 55-1 at APP000690. It noted no "five-year fast-and-hard rule" existed under the FAA, and concluded the rules applied by Union Pacific were "more restrictive, uncompromising[,] and less individualized than the FAA would apply to the same situation." ECF No. 56-1 at APP001427. No such discussion occurs in the timely filed reports. See ECF No. 55-1 at APP000663-91, APP000693-701.
The untimely disclosure of these portions of the November Letter were not harmless. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). With the November Lettter, Dr. Trangle did not merely reiterate his previously reported opinions or conclusions. He provided new information. Cf. Allianz, 2016 WL 4435094, at *6 (finding declaration reiterated previous opinion where report concluded part was "not [a particular] alloy" and declaration focused [*29]  only on whether the presence of tin "conclusively establish[ed] that the [part] is not made of [the particular] alloy."). In neither the February Report nor the September Letter did Dr. Trangle conclude that Jackson could safely perform his job responsibilities. Nor did Dr. Trangle conclude Jackson's sudden incapacitation would not lead to catastrophic consequences or that the FMCSA guidelines as applied by Union Pacific were more restrictive than those applied by the FAA. Thus, Jackson's failure to timely disclose these portions of the November Letter was not harmless.
Jackson fails to meet his burden demonstrating untimely disclosure of this portion of the November Letter was substantially justified. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). Jackson has not proffered any justification for failing to timely disclose the contents of the November Letter. Cf. Amplatz, 823 F.3d at 1171-72 (excluding portions of a supplemental expert report disclosed after the deadline where plaintiff lacked an excuse for the extremely tardy disclosure). Thus, the Court strikes any conclusion offered in the November Letter opining on the consequences of sudden incapacitation for Jackson.
Because Jackson fails to meet his burden, the Court grants Union Pacific's motion [*30]  to strike in part and strikes the portions of the November Letter containing previously undisclosed information, as identified in this Order. The Court denies Union Pacific's motion to strike as to the remainder of the November Letter addressing opinions previously disclosed in the February Report or September Letter. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e), 37(c).

B. Union Pacific's Motion for Summary Judgment
Union Pacific moves for summary judgment on all counts alleged in Jackson's complaint. ECF No. 52. Union Pacific argues it is entitled to summary judgment because Jackson cannot establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination (Count I). Id. at 2-16. Union Pacific further contends it is entitled to summary judgment on Count I because it establishes a direct threat affirmative defense. Id. at 17-21. Union Pacific argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Jackson's failure to accommodate claim (Count II) because Jackson is not entitled to reasonable accommodations or, in the alternative, because it engaged in a good-faith interactive process to find reasonable accommodation for Jackson. Id. at 21-24. Finally, Union Pacific argues it is entitled to summary judgment on Jackson's ADA unlawful medical examination claim (Count III) because its [*31]  requests for Jackson's medical records were justified by legitimate business necessity. Id. at 24-25.
Jackson appears to resist Union Pacific's motion on Count I only. See ECF No. 53. He argues he has set forth a prima facie case for disability discrimination. See id. at 5-6. Jackson contends he is "disabled" or was "regarded as" disabled, and that he was qualified to perform his job's essential functions. See id. at 6-17. He also argues genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Union Pacific properly determined he was a direct threat. Id. at 11-17. Jackson does not respond to Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Counts II and III. See id. The Court addresses each count in turn.

1. Disability discrimination (Count I)
Jackson alleges Union Pacific discriminated against him on the basis of disability in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 30-35. The ADA makes it unlawful to discriminate against a qualified individual "on the basis of disability" by terminating that individual's employment or otherwise classifying the individual in a way that adversely affects employment. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), (b). Discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability includes "limiting, segregating, or classifying a[n]...employee [*32]  in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of such . . . employee because of the disability of [the] . . . employee." Id.
A plaintiff establishes a disability discrimination claim either by offering direct evidence of discrimination or by creating an inference of discrimination under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Oehmke v. Medtronic, Inc., 844 F.3d 748, 755 (8th Cir. 2016) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)); Thompson v. Bi-State Dev. Agency, 463 F.3d 821, 824-25 (8th Cir. 2006). Direct evidence of discrimination is evidence that "establishes a specific link between alleged discriminatory animus and an adverse action of such causal strength that the plaintiff can forgo the burden-shifting framework." Oehmke, 844 F.3d at 755 n.3. In Oemke, evidence that the manager did not believe plaintiff had cancer despite medical records provided to the defendant was not direct evidence of discrimination. Similarly, in St. Martin v. City of St. Paul, the court found no direct evidence of discrimination despite oral and written statements indicating plaintiff was not promoted, in part, due to his knee injury. 680 F.3d 1027, 1033 (8th Cir. 2012).
Jackson argues he provides direct evidence of discrimination because Union Pacific fails to identify any reason other than his alleged disability as the basis for its actions against him. See ECF No. 53 at 6. Union Pacific contends [*33]  Jackson lacks any direct evidence anyone at Union Pacific harbored discriminatory animus or intentionally discharged him because of a disability. Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2, ECF No. 65.
Courts have applied the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework where an employer terminated employment due to a perceived safety risk related to the employee's alleged disability. See Krehbiel v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., No. 19-2002-JAR, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, 2020 WL 5503363, at *7-8 (D. Kan. Sept. 11, 2020); see also Lundvall v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., No. C18-127-LTS, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27137, 2020 WL 806648, at *7-8 (N.D. Iowa Feb. 18, 2020). Here, Union Pacific issued work restrictions to Jackson after concluding Jackson was at risk of sudden incapacitation following his stroke. Consistent with other similarly situated courts, the Court applies the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to Jackson's disability discrimination claim. Cf. Krehbiel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, 2020 WL 5503363, at *7-8.
Under McDonnell Douglas, Jackson has the burden to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. See 411 U.S. at 802. If he is able to do so, "[t]he burden of production then shifts to the employer to show a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action." Oehmke, 844 F.3d at 755. If the employer does so, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate evidence from which a reasonable juror could find the articulated [*34]  reason was pretextual. See id. The burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff throughout. See Fenney v. Dakota, Minn. & E. R. Co., 327 F.3d 707, 712 (8th Cir. 2003).
a. Prima facie case
"To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, an employee must show that [he] (1) is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, (2) is a qualified individual under the ADA, and (3) has suffered an adverse employment decision because of the disability." Kallail v. Alliant Energy Corp. Servs., Inc., 691 F.3d 925, 930 (8th Cir. 2012). If a plaintiff fails to establish any element of his prima facie case, summary judgment is proper. Kellogg v. Union Pac. R. Co., 233 F.3d 1083, 1086 (8th Cir. 2000).
i. Disabled within the meaning of the ADA
Union Pacific argues Jackson is not disabled under the ADA. ECF No. 52 at 2. It argues Jackson cannot show he has an actual disability and cannot demonstrate he was "regarded as" disabled by Union Pacific.1Id. at 2-4. Jackson contends he is disabled under the ADA because his stroke substantially limits his ability to care for himself and because he takes blood pressure medication. ECF No. 53 at 9. Jackson also argues Union Pacific regarded him as disabled because Union Pacific restricted him from returning to work due to alleged safety concerns related to his stroke. Id. The Court finds Jackson does not demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether he was actually disabled, [*35]  or whether Union Pacific regarded him as disabled.
The ADA prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual "on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Under the ADA, an individual is disabled if he "[has] a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual . . . or [is] regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); accord Gardea v. JBS USA, LLC, 915 F.3d 537, 541 (8th Cir. 2019). A physical impairment is "[a]ny physiological disorder or condition . . . or anatomical loss affecting one or more body systems, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory (including speech organs), cardiovascular . . . [or] circulatory." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(h)(1). "[M]ajor life activities include . . . caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating" and the operation of a major bodily function, including "functions of the . . . neurological, brain, respiratory, [or] circulatory" systems. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A), (B).
Under the ADA, the term "substantially limits" is to "be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA" and "is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether [*36]  covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(iii). While not every impairment constitutes a disability, an impairment need not "prevent, or significantly or severely restrict an individual in order to be considered substantially limiting." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). In the 2008 amendments to the ADA, Congress emphasized these definitions must "be construed in favor of broad coverage." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A); see ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553.
The Eighth Circuit has noted the amendments' directive to "construe[] broadly in favor of expansive coverage" does not apply to the definition of "physical impairment." Morriss v. BNSF Ry. Co., 817 F.3d 1104, 1111 (8th Cir. 2016); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i). In Morriss, the Eighth Circuit recognized Congress intended the ADAAA to abrogate certain Supreme Court rulings that narrowly interpreted when an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity. Id. at 1110. But Congress did not disagree with judicial interpretations of "physical impairment" under the pre-amended ADA. Id. at 1111. The court noted, even under the ADAAA, "an individual must first establish that he has a qualifying impairment before the less extensive analysis is applied to determine [*37]  whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity." Id. at 1112 (internal quotation marks omitted).
A stroke causing long-term deficits may be a "physical or mental impairment" under the ADA. In Ginnery v. Blake, the district court recognized plaintiff's remaining deficits following a stroke may constitute a "physical impairment." No. 4:06-CV-579 CAS, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85526, 2007 WL 4178624, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 19, 2007)  (internal quotation marks omitted).2 There, the plaintiff suffered a stroke years prior that left him with deficits in his left side, including numbness, partial deafness, and leg endurance issues when he walked long distances. 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85526, [WL] at *2-4. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Wega v. Center For Disability Rights, Inc. found appellant presented substantial evidence showing mental and physical impairments under the ADA after suffering a stroke with apparently permanent effects. 395 F. App'x 782, 785 (2d Cir. 2010) (unpublished). The "substantial evidence" showed that, as a direct result of the stroke, the appellant experienced weakness on his left side, a slight limp, and reduced movement, which impacted his daily activities involving two hands and requiring stamina. Id. The evidence also indicated he experienced an inability to prioritize, a lack of [*38]  focus, and a lack of organizational abilities. Id. The court concluded appellant "presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that he is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA." Id.
Jackson fails to show he was actually disabled because his stroke-related deficits do not constitute "physical impairment[s]" under the ADA. See ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 56. No evidence indicates Jackson's stroke left him with permanent or long-lasting physical or mental deficits. Cf. Ginnery, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85526, 2007 WL 4178624, at *4; Wega, 395 F. App'x at 785. After Jackson's stroke in April 2017, he experienced stroke-related deficits, including slurred speech, weakness, and difficulty with oculomotor control. ECF No. 53-1 ¶¶ 7, 56. But by July 2017, he was released to work without restrictions at his own request and with his providers' approval. See ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 56. This suggests his stroke-related deficits resolved. See id. The only ongoing impairment Jackson alleges is his continued taking of blood pressure medication. ECF No. 53 at 9; ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 67. But Jackson points to no authority supporting his contention that taking blood pressure medication alone indicates a physical impairment and the Court is aware of none. See ECF No. 53. [*39]  Additionally, the record contains no medical testimony indicating any ongoing "problem with the operation of [Jackson's] circulatory system" sufficient to generate a fact issue. Morissette v. Cote Corp., 190 F. Supp. 3d 193, 204-05 (D. Me. 2016) (finding a fact issue existed as to whether plaintiff's stroke, blocked carotid artery, or circulatory condition qualified as a substantial limitation on a major life activity where a treating nurse testified plaintiff had a circulatory system problem due to his carotid artery disease). Because Jackson fails to show any stroke-related deficits left him with permanent or long term physical or mental impairments, Jackson fails to demonstrate he was actually disabled.
Jackson also fails to demonstrate any stroke-related deficits substantially limited his major life activities. Even assuming Jackson's stroke-related deficits or hypertension requiring medication constitute a physical impairment under the ADA, he points to no evidence demonstrating these conditions substantially limit his major life activities as compared to most people in the general population. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). Although the Court broadly construes whether an impairment "substantially limits" an individual's major life activities, "not every impairment . . . constitute[s] [*40]  a disability." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i)-(ii). Here, the evidence shows Jackson was released to work at his own request two months after his stroke. This indicates his willingness to return to work, despite his hypertension or other stroke-related deficits. Cf. Smart v. DeKalb Cty., Ga., No. 1:16-CV-826-WSD, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30117, 2018 WL 1089677, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 26, 2018) (finding plaintiff's hypertension did not demonstrate disability because he continued to accomplish daily tasks and was "more than willing to return to work despite his hypertension"). There is nothing in the record from which a reasonable jury could find Jackson's stroke or related deficits substantially limit any major life activities. As such, Jackson fails to establish he is actually disabled.
Under the ADA, a plaintiff may establish the first prong of his prima facie case if he shows his employer regarded him as disabled. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3). To state a "regarded as" claim, a plaintiff must show his employer "subjected him to an adverse action because of . . . [a] perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." Fischer v. Minneapolis Pub. Sch., 792 F.3d 985, 988 (8th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1), (3)(A). But an employer does not "regard" an employee as disabled when the employer's adverse action is [*41]  based on belief that the employee cannot perform the job. Fischer, 792 F.3d at 989-90; Watt v. City of Crystal, No. 14-cv-3167 (JNE/JJK), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, 2015 WL 7760166, at *5 (D. Minn. Dec. 2, 2015).
In Fischer, the Eighth Circuit found the defendant did not regard the plaintiff-employee as disabled when it refused to reinstate him after he failed a strength test required for his job. 792 F.3d at 989. Plaintiff alleged he had a back condition that caused his insufficient physical strength score. See id. at 987-88. He argued the defendant discriminated against him when it declined to reinstate him because of this physical impairment. Id. at 988. The Eighth Circuit concluded the record merely showed defendant believed its test indicated plaintiff did not possess the strength required to safely perform the job. Id. at 989-90. This was insufficient to show defendant regarded plaintiff as disabled. Id.
Similarly, in Watt, the court affirmed there was "a difference between being perceived as impaired and being perceived as unable to perform a job duty." See 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, 2015 WL 7760166, at *5. There, the defendant-employer terminated plaintiff's employment after becoming concerned about plaintiff's ability to perform his police officer duties. See 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, [WL] at *1-5. Plaintiff's "regarded as" claim failed, in part, because defendant based its termination decision on the belief that plaintiff [*42]  was "too angry or erratic to carry a firearm or patrol the streets." 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, [WL] at *5. The court held plaintiff failed to show defendant regarded plaintiff as disabled. Id.
Jackson fails to present sufficient evidence to suggest Union Pacific regarded him as disabled when it placed him on a five-year waiting period with work restrictions. Rather, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson, Union Pacific issued work restrictions and a five-year waiting period because it believed Jackson was "temporarily not physically qualified to perform the essential functions of his position." ECF No. 52 at 9; cf. Fischer, 792 F.3d at 989. Additionally, Union Pacific had concerns about Jackson's ability to safely perform his job due to the increased risk of sudden incapacitation its doctors associated with his stroke. ECF No. 52 at 9; cf. Watt, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, 2015 WL 7760166. Jackson's job as a track laborer required responding to situations with "sustained concentration and the capacity to perceive and act in dangerous situations to . . . mitigate errors in the presence of risk." ECF No. 52 at 13; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 183-84. Union Pacific believed Jackson could not perform this job. Union Pacific's decision to issue work restrictions and a five-year waiting [*43]  period do not indicate Union Pacific believed Jackson had a physical impairment. Cf. Fischer, 792 F.3d at 989. It shows Union Pacific believed Jackson was at risk of becoming physically impaired and creating a safety hazard while performing his job. Cf. id. Further, Union Pacific was willing to reevaluate Jackson after the five-year waiting period and reinstate him as a track laborer. Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 21, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588.3 This is further evidence Union Pacific did not regard Jackson as having a physical impairment. Rather, Union Pacific believed Jackson's risk of sudden incapacitation rendered him unqualified to safely perform his job for a period of time. Cf. Fischer, 792 F.3d 985 at 990.
Because Union Pacific believed Jackson was unqualified to perform his job duties due to his risk of sudden incapacitation, Jackson cannot demonstrate Union Pacific regarded him as physically disabled when it issued work restrictions for a five-year waiting period. Jackson fails to demonstrate he was actually disabled. He also fails to demonstrate Union Pacific regarded him as disabled when it issued restrictions on his work. Thus, Jackson fails to establish the first prong of his prima facie case—that he was disabled under the ADA.
ii. Qualified [*44]  individual
Jackson's disability discrimination claim also fails because he cannot show a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his ability to safely perform his job duties. He thus fails to meet the qualified individual element of his prima facie case.
"To be a qualified individual under the ADA, an employee must (1) possess the requisite skill, education, experience, and training for [his] position; and (2) be able to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation." Kallail, 691 F.3d at 930 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m). "Essential functions of the position are the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Gardea, 915 F.3d at 541 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). Any of the following may establish an essential job function:
(1) [t]he employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; (2) [w]ritten job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (3) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (4) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; and (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
Moritz v. Frontier Airlines, Inc., 147 F.3d 784, 787 (8th Cir. 1998) (alterations [*45]  in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)). Although not conclusive, the Eighth Circuit considers the "employer's judgment of what constitutes an essential function highly probative." Scruggs v. Pulaski Cnty., Ark., 817 F.3d 1087, 1093 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). An individual may not be a qualified individual if he poses a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others. Burroughs v. City of Springfield, 163 F.3d 505, 508 (8th Cir. 1998).
Essential functions of Jackson's job included safely operating equipment and maintaining the track. ECF No. 53-1 ¶ 3. The track laborer job description specifically listed "[p]ractic[ing] safe work habits" and "[t]ak[ing] appropriate action when conditions threaten [the] safety of self or coworkers" as requirements of the job. ECF No. 52-2 at APP 111. Jackson confirmed his job involved identifying problems with and repairing the track, engaging in tasks such as pulling spikes, knocking anchors, digging in ties, occasionally using ride-on machines, and regularly using handheld machines, such as a bolt machine, drills, and an impact machine. Jackson Dep. at 58:20-60:14, 62:23-66:4; 66:12-66:24 ECF No. 54-1 at APP000019, APP000021. These facts support an inference that having the capacity to safely operate and maintain [*46]  the track were essential functions of the track laborer position.
Union Pacific's only argument Jackson was not qualified is that he could not safely perform his job. See ECF No. 52 at 8-15. Thus, the dispositive issue is whether Jackson posed a direct threat to the safety of himself or others. The Court notes an employer's safety concerns are not part of the prima facie case for disability discrimination. See Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 477 F.3d 561, 568 (8th Cir. 2007) (stating three elements of a prima facie case). Whether an individual poses a danger to himself or others is relevant for evaluating the employer's affirmative defense of direct threat. See id. at 571-72; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12113(b). Where, as here, the employer's proffered reason for why an individual is not qualified relates to its direct threat defense, the two analyses are sometimes discussed together. See Henningsen v. City of Blue Earth, 184 F. Supp. 3d. 710, 720-21 (D. Minn. 2016). An individual may not be qualified for a position if he poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Burroughs, 163 F.3d at 508; see 42 U.S.C. § 12113(b).
The Court discusses below whether Jackson could safely execute his job duties under Union Pacific's direct threat affirmative defense. See infra Part IV.B.1.d. For the reasons stated in the section to follow, the Court finds Union Pacific meets its burden to show Jackson posed a direct [*47]  threat. See infra id.
iii. Causal relationship between disability and adverse employment action
To satisfy the third prong of his prima facie claim, Jackson must make a showing he "suffered an adverse employment action because of the disability." Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., 403 F.3d 1026, 1034 (8th Cir. 2005). Because the Court finds Jackson fails to show he was disabled, he cannot establish any causal connection between an adverse employment action and a disability under the ADA.
Even if Jackson was disabled, he cannot show Union Pacific issued the five-year restrictions "because of" his stroke, stroke-related deficits, or his taking of blood pressure medication. As discussed below, the Court concludes Union Pacific has demonstrated it issued the work restrictions because of its legitimate concern for the safety of Jackson and others on the job based on its doctors' reasonable medical judgments. See infra Part IV.B.1.b. Because Jackson cannot show the he suffered an adverse employment action because of a disability, he cannot establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA.
b. Legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
Union Pacific argues that even if Jackson can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, it had a legitimate, [*48]  nondiscriminatory reason for issuing work restrictions—"safety concerns" about Jackson's ability to perform the job. ECF No. 52 at 16-17.
"[A]n employer [is] entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The employer's burden at this stage is of production, not of proof. Floyd v. State of Mo. Dept of Soc. Servs., Div. of Family Servs., 188 F.3d 932, 936 (8th Cir. 1999). The employer's burden "is not onerous, and the explanation need not be demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence." Id.
Terminating an employee on the belief he cannot safely perform his essential job functions is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. See, e.g., Clark v. Lyman-Richey Corp., No. 8:06CV669, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, 2008 WL 1733603, at *8 (D. Neb. Apr. 10, 2008); Lundvall, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27137, 2020 WL 806648, at *15; cf. Robertson, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48773, 2015 WL 1650367, at *6 (finding legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to terminate plaintiff who suffered two seizures on duty, worked an inherently dangerous job, and failed to comply with defendant's medical release request).
Union Pacific proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for restricting Jackson from work: its assessment that he was unable to safely perform the essential functions of his job. The track laborer job description, as well as Jackson's own testimony about his job duties, demonstrate safely using [*49]  ride-on and handheld machines around other workers was a necessary part of Jackson's job. See ECF No. 52-2 at APP 110-11; Jackson Dep. 58:20-60:14, ECF No. 54-1 at APP000019. Because Union Pacific believed Jackson was at risk of seizures, it had a legitimate concern about his ability to safely operate equipment and maintain the track. The burden on Union Pacific at this stage is "not onerous." Floyd, 188 F.3d at 936. As such, the Court finds Union Pacific meets its burden to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for imposing the five-year waiting period on Jackson.
c. Pretext
Union Pacific contends Jackson presents no evidence its concerns about safety were pretext for discrimination. ECF No. 52 at 16-17. Jackson argues Union Pacific's safety rationale is inherently discriminatory. See generally ECF No. 53. The Court finds Jackson points to no evidence Union Pacific's proffered nondiscriminatory reason for its conduct—safety concerns—was motivated by discriminatory animus. Because Jackson fails to identify a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext, his claim for disability discrimination fails on this ground also.
To demonstrate pretext, a plaintiff must present "sufficient evidence to demonstrate [*50]  both that the employer's articulated reason for the adverse employment action was false and that discrimination was the real reason." Lors v. Dean, 595 F.3d 831, 834 (8th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting McNary v. Schreiber Foods, Inc., 535 F.3d 765, 769 (8th Cir. 2008)). The plaintiff must do more than create a factual dispute as to the pretext and "must offer sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to infer discrimination." Id. The plaintiff "must demonstrate that a discriminatory animus lies behind the defendant['s] neutral explanations." Wilking v. Cnty. of Ramsey, 153 F.3d 869, 874 (8th Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing the employer's explanation "has no basis in fact" or by showing that the employer "shifted its explanation, that the [plaintiff] received a favorable review shortly before termination[,] or that the employer deviated from policies." Sieden v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 846 F.3d 1013, 1017 (8th Cir. 2017). "Ultimately, the plaintiff must show[] that a prohibited reason, rather than the employer's stated reason, actually motivated the employer's action." Nelson v. USAble Mut. Ins. Co., 918 F.3d 990, 993 (8th Cir. 2019) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "A trial judge [is allowed] to decide on a motion for summary judgment that the evidence is insufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to infer discrimination even though the [*51]  plaintiff may have created a factual dispute as to the issue of pretext." Christopher v. Adam's Mark Hotels, 137 F.3d 1069, 1073 (8th Cir. 1998) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
When the employer claims its adverse action was motivated by safety concerns, a plaintiff must establish pretext by providing sufficient evidence to show the stated rationale was false and the employer's action was because of the disability. See Clark, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, 2008 WL 1733603, at *8. The Clark plaintiff, a commercial vehicle driver, was terminated after defendant's doctors suspected the plaintiff had epilepsy and a risk of recurrent seizure. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, [WL] at *2, 8. A doctor evaluated plaintiff and determined he could not continue his job because the Department of Transportation imposed a five-year prohibition on recertification of commercial licenses when a driver has a seizure and takes anti-seizure medication. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, [WL]  at *2. Three doctors determined plaintiff suffered from seizures that kept him from operating a commercial vehicle for five years. Id. The record indicated some of plaintiffs' doctors found no evidence of seizures, released him to return to work, and opined his purported seizure was likely provoked by sleep deprivation. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, [WL]  at *3. However, the court found this conflicting evidence was insufficient to [*52]  establish evidence of pretext. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, [WL]  at *8.
Jackson does not present sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude Union Pacific's safety rationale was pretextual. Union Pacific issued work restrictions to Jackson after three doctors concluded he suffered a stroke with risk for sudden incapacitation. See Charbonneau Decl. ¶¶ 18-19, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588; see ECF No. 53-1 ¶¶ 27-28, 40, 51-54. Because of this safety concern, Union Pacific concluded Jackson needed five years of sudden incapacitation restrictions. ECF No. 53-1 ¶¶ 21, 27-28. Similar to Clark, Union Pacific's doctors determined Jackson had a risk of seizures, preventing him from operating machinery safely. Cf. Clark, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29683, 2008 WL 1733603, at *2. Jackson fails to show Union Pacific shifted its explanation for issuing the work restrictions, or deviated from its stated policies regarding issuing work restrictions after a qualifying medical event to prevent him from returning to work. Cf. Sieden, 846 F.3d at 1017. On this record, a reasonable jury could not infer Union Pacific discriminated against Jackson. See Christopher, 137 F.3d at 1073; Lors, 595 F.3d at 834. Because Jackson fails to meet his burden to establish pretext, his claim of disability discrimination also fails on this ground.
d. Direct threat
Union Pacific raises [*53]  the affirmative defense of direct threat. Jackson argues genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on this ground. ECF No. 53 at 12. Even if Jackson could establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA and show Union Pacific's rationale for restricting him from work was pretextual, his claim would still fail because Union Pacific establishes a direct threat affirmative defense. The Court first determines whether Union Pacific properly conducted its direct threat assessment. Then the Court determines if there are any genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment for Union Pacific on its direct threat affirmative defense. Because the Court finds Jackson fails to generate a genuine issue of material fact as to direct threat and Union Pacific has established its direct threat defense, Jackson's claim of disability discrimination also fails on this ground.
Summary judgment is appropriate on a disability discrimination claim if an employer demonstrates an employee poses a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals in the workplace. Wal-Mart Stores, 477 F.3d at 571-72. Direct threat is an affirmative defense for which the employer bears the burden of proof. [*54]  Id. at 571-72. As discussed above, an individual who cannot safely perform the essential functions of his job because he poses a direct threat to himself or others may not be qualified for a position. See supra Part IV.B.1.a.ii; Burroughs, 163 F.3d at 508; Henningsen, 184 F. Supp. 3d at 720; 42 U.S.C. § 12113(b) ("The term 'qualification standards' may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.").
"Whether an employer has properly determined that a person poses a direct threat depends on the objective reasonableness of [the employer's] actions." Nall v. BNSF Ry. Co., 917 F.3d 335, 342 (5th Cir. 2019) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 650, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540, (1998)). "[T]he fact-finder does not independently assess whether it believes that the employee posed a direct threat" but "determines whether the employer's decision was objectively reasonable." Krehbiel, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161673, 2020 WL 5503363, at *9 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Jarvis v. Potter, 500 F.3d 1113, 1122 (10th Cir. 2007)).
The Supreme Court requires an individualized direct threat analysis based on the best current medical or other objective evidence to protect disabled individuals from discrimination based on "prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear." Wal-Mart Stores, 477 F.3d at 571 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. Under 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r), specific factors to consider include: "(1) the duration [*55]  of risk, (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm, (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and (4) the imminence of the potential harm." Wal-Mart Stores, 477 F.3d at 571. An employer may demonstrate it conducted an individualized assessment based on objective evidence if it based the decision to terminate an employee on a doctor's evaluations and facts contained in an incident report. Onken v. McNeilus Truck & Mfg., Inc., 639 F.Supp.2d 966, 980-81 (N.D. Iowa 2009). In contrast, an employer's policy may permit no individualized assessment if the policy categorizes employees without regard to independent evaluations. See Krocka v. Bransfield, 969 F. Supp. 1073, 1086-87 (N.D. Ill. 1997), aff'd sub nom. Krocka v. City of Chicago, 203 F.3d 507 (7th Cir. 2000) (noting defendant police department's policy required all officers taking psychotropic medication to remain in a program for safety reasons as long as they took the medication, despite that an evaluation concluded the plaintiff was not a direct threat). A plaintiff-employee may create a factual issue on this ground if he supplies evidence that, in spite of the employer's determination, the plaintiff's treating physician repeatedly indicated he could perform the job. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 246 F. Supp. 2d 916, 926 (W.D. Tenn. 2002).
No reasonable jury could find Union Pacific's direct threat determination was not objectively reasonable. Union Pacific's determination was based on an individualized assessment [*56]  of Jackson and it relied on doctors' evaluations and facts contained in medical documentation. Cf. Onken, 639 F.Supp.2d at 980-81. Union Pacific did not categorically issue restrictions, but considered Jackson's individual medical conditions. Cf. Krocka, 969 F. Supp. at 1086-87. Union Pacific doctors reviewed Jackson's posthospitalization clinical records, as well as his speech and occupational therapy reports to conduct their Fitness for Duty evaluation. Charbonneau Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9-10, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 586-87; Hughes Decl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 602; cf. Onken, 639 F. Supp. 2d at 980-81. Because Union Pacific relied on objective evidence specific to Jackson, Union Pacific based its decision to issue work restrictions on the required individualized assessment.
The record further indicates Union Pacific considered the factors outlined in 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r). As to duration of risk, Union Pacific, determined Jackson needed five-years of sudden incapacitation work restrictions after its doctors considered Jackson's stroke, its location, and Jackson's specific health conditions putting him at risk for future seizures. Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 20, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588; cf. Onken, 639 F.Supp.2d at 980-81. As to nature and severity of the potential harm, Union Pacific evaluated Jackson with regard to his specific job duties as [*57]  a track laborer. Because a track laborer must operate machinery, sustain concentration, and respond to dangerous situations on the job, Union Pacific determined Jackson's risk of incapacitation on the job posed a serious safety risk. See ECF No. 52-1 ¶ 55; Holland Decl. ¶ 26, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 502. As to likelihood of harm, Dr. Charbonneau and Dr. Hughes considered the location of the stroke, in combination with factors particularized to Jackson's medical history—hypertension, high BMI, and potential seizure episodes noted by Judd. From this assessment on likelihood of harm, they determined Jackson had an increased risk of seizures. Charbonneau Decl. ¶¶ 18-20, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588; see Charbonneau Dep. 20:8-24:11, ECF No. 54-1 at APP000247-51; see also Hughes Dep. 19:9-21:7, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 435-37; ECF No. 53-1 ¶¶ 52-54.
Finally, as to imminence of the potential harm, Dr. Holland concluded Jackson's stroke history posed a significant and imminent risk of substantial harm. Holland Decl. ¶ 26, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 502. Dr. Charbonneau considered the potential seizure episodes reported to the speech therapist one month after Jackson's stroke to assess Jackson's future risk of seizures. [*58]  See Charbonneau Decl. ¶ 19, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 588; ECF No. 52-2 at APP 174. Unlike in Northwest Airlines, the record contains no evidence Jackson's treating physicians repeatedly indicated he could safely perform his specific job duties. Cf. Nw. Airlines, 246 F. Supp. 2d at 926. In fact, there is no indication from the record Jackson's physicians knew of or understood his specific job duties. Cf. id. Dr. Holland's assessment reasonably relied on Jackson's health and job duties to consider the imminence of harm. The Court concludes no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Union Pacific conducted an individualized assessment of Jackson in making its direct threat assessment. Considering the relevant factors under § 1630.2(r), no reasonable jury could conclude Union Pacific's direct threat determination was not objectively reasonable.
Jackson contends genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Union Pacific's determination was objectively reasonable. See ECF No. 53 at 15. In support of this argument, he asserts factual issues exist as to each of the factors under § 1630.2(r). He also contends contrary evidence shows he was not suffering from or at risk for seizures and the FMCSA guidelines are not the best or most current [*59]  objective medical evidence. See ECF No. 53 at 12-15.
In a direct threat analysis, the factfinder does not resolve disagreements between experts, so long as the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows the individualized assessment was objectively reasonable. Cf. Krehbiel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, 2020 WL 5503363, at *9. A plaintiff does not generate a factual issue as to the objective reasonableness of the employer's direct threat determination merely by supplying its doctor's contrary opinions. Id. at 6, 11. The plaintiff in Krehbiel received work restrictions after defendant learned of the plaintiff's serious alcohol abuse problems and suicidal ideation. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, [WL] at *9. While the plaintiff's treating physician released the plaintiff to work, the employer issued restrictions after two of its doctors reviewed the plaintiff's medical records and determined his behavior caused safety concerns related to the job duties. Id. Additionally, the plaintiff's treating physician did not have complete information about the plaintiff's medical records or job duties, and released him to work based on the plaintiff's self-reports. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, [WL] at *10. The court concluded the plaintiff could not demonstrate any questions of fact as to the objective reasonableness [*60]  of defendant's direct threat determination. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, [WL] at *11.
An employer cannot make a direct threat determination based on "a categorical conclusion" that an employee with a particular disability cannot safely perform a job. Nall, 917 F.3d at 344 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In Nall, the plaintiff with Parkinson's disease provided evidence showing: he submitted doctors' reports concluding he could perform the specific job duties listed on the medical status form defendant provided; he successfully completed a field test; and defendant's employees made comments that plaintiff was never returning to work because people with his condition did not recover. Id. at 344-46. On these facts, the Fifth Circuit determined a reasonable jury could conclude defendant failed to conduct an individualized assessment based on the best objective evidence. Id. at 343.
Jackson fails to point to evidence in the record sufficient to generate a factual dispute as to Union Pacific's objective reasonableness in making its direct threat determination. Jackson received work restrictions after Union Pacific conducted its Fitness for Duty evaluation in response to his stroke. Although Jackson's doctors released Jackson to work without restrictions, they [*61]  did not know Jackson's specific job duties and released Jackson partially based on self-reports and his request to be released to work. Peterson Dep. 69:3-70:17, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 316-17; id. 71:24-72:9, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 318-19; Boarini Dep. 36:15-38:15, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 236-38. Jackson's treating physicians also did not know about the potential seizure episodes noted by the speech therapist. Peterson Dep. 65:10-66:10, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 312-13; Boarini Dep. 40:12-41:22, ECF No. 52-2 at APP 240-41. Further, unlike Nall, Jackson presented no evidence he passed a field test, or that Union Pacific employees made comments that he was never returning to work. Cf. Nall, 917 F.3d at 344-46. Consequently, the facts here, like those in Krehbiel, do not generate any material factual dispute. Cf. Krehbiel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166393, 2020 WL 5503363, at *9-10. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson, the record shows Union Pacific made its decision to issue work restrictions based on its doctors' evaluations of Jackson's physical condition and his job duties. Union Pacific did not categorically apply the FMCSA guidelines, or make its determination based on "prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear." Cf. Nall, 917 F.3d at 344-46; see Wal-Mart Stores, 477 F.3d at 571. On this record, no reasonable jury could [*62]  conclude Union Pacific failed to conduct an individualized assessment based on objective evidence.
Because Jackson fails to point to evidence in the record demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact as to the objective reasonableness of Union Pacific's direct threat assessment, he fails to overcome the affirmative defense. The Court finds Union Pacific conducted an individualized direct threat assessment of Jackson. The Court also finds this assessment was based on objective evidence and considered the § 1630.2(r) factors. The Court thus finds Union Pacific meets its burden on its affirmative defense and grants its motion for summary judgment on Count I.

2. Failure to accommodate (Count II)
In Count II, Jackson alleges Union Pacific "had a duty to explore whether a reasonable accommodation existed that would allow Jackson to perform the essential functions of his job." ECF No. 1 ¶ 39. Jackson argues Union Pacific failed to engage with him in the interactive process and failed to offer him a reasonable accommodation for his disability in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12112. Id. ¶¶ 36-40. Union Pacific argues Jackson's claim fails for two reasons. First, it contends Jackson fails to establish a failure to accommodate [*63]  claim because an individual "regarded as" disabled is not entitled to reasonable accommodation under the ADA. ECF No. 52 at 21 Second, even if Jackson meets the statutory definition of "disabled" and is entitled to reasonable accommodation, Union Pacific argues it engaged in the interactive process to resolve his accommodation needs in good faith. Id. at 22-23. Jackson does not respond to Union Pacific's arguments.
After an independent review of the record and the law, the Court finds Union Pacific engaged in a good-faith interactive process with Jackson to identify reasonable accommodations. See Burchett v. Target Corp., 340 F.3d 510, 517 (8th Cir. 2003). It further finds Jackson fails to establish a failure to accommodate claim because he is not disabled and is not entitled to reasonable accommodation as a "regarded as" disabled plaintiff. Duello v. Buchanan Cty. Bd. of Sup'rs, 628 F.3d 968, 972 (8th Cir. 2010) ("'[R]egarded as' plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable accommodations because the ADA was not intended to grant reasonable accommodations to those who are not actually disabled."). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Jackson, the Court finds no genuine issue of material fact exists on this issue and Union Pacific is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count II. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Bills v. Cactus Fam. Farms, LLC, 470 F. Supp. 3d 948, 958 (N.D. Iowa 2020) ("Courts may grant summary [*64]  judgment as to unresisted claims if the motion is properly supported."). The Court grants Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Count II.

3. Impermissible medical examination (Count III)
In Count III, Jackson alleges Union Pacific discriminated against him in violation of the ADA, § 12112(d)(4), by unlawfully inquiring into his medical records. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 43-48. Union Pacific argues its requests for Jackson's medical records were justified by legitimate business necessity. ECF No. 52 at 24-25. Jackson does not respond to Union Pacific's argument.
Employers may not inquire about an employee's disabilities "unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). Courts will find business necessity if an employer can demonstrate "a medical examination or inquiry is necessary to determine . . . whether the employee can perform job-related duties when the employer can identify legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons to doubt the employee's capacity to perform his or her duties." Thomas v. Corwin, 483 F.3d 516, 527 (8th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Conroy v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Servs., 333 F.3d 88, 98 (2d Cir. 2003)). The Court has conducted an independent review of the materials and concludes that, viewing all facts in the light most favorable [*65]  to Jackson, no genuine issues of material fact exist on this issue. The Court finds Union Pacific's requests for medical records were justified by legitimate business necessity of determining whether Jackson could perform his job-related duties. Cf. Thomas, 483 F.3d at 527. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Jackson, the Court finds no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Union Pacific's request for medical records was justified. The Court grants Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Count III. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Bills, 470 F. Supp. 3d at 958.

V. CONCLUSION
Jackson submitted the untimely November Letter, introducing new opinions not previously discussed in his timely filed expert reports. Because Jackson fails to meet his burden to show the new opinions contained in the November Letter were substantially justified or harmless, the Court strikes those portions of the report containing new information as identified in this Order.
Because Jackson fails to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to his prima facie case for disability discrimination under the ADA, Jackson's claim on Count I fails. Additionally, Jackson fails to show Union Pacific's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory justification for imposing [*66]  the restrictions on Jackson is pretextual. Union Pacific also meets its burden to show a direct threat affirmative defense. The Court grants Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Count I.
Finally, because the Court finds no genuine issues of material fact exist as to Jackson's claims for failure to accommodate (Count II) or impermissible medical examination (Count III), Union Pacific is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these counts. The Court grants Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment on Counts II and III.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant Union Pacific's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Untimely Expert Report, ECF No. 60, is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant Union Pacific's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 49, is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
Dated this 29th day of March, 2021.
