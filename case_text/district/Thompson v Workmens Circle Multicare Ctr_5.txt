REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
PITMAN, United States Magistrate Judge:
TO THE HONORABLE DEBORAH A. BATTS, United States District Judge,
I. Introduction
Plaintiff Nadine Thompson commenced this pro se action against her former employer Workmen's Circle Multicare Center ("WCMC") pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112-12117 ("ADA"), alleging that WCMC discriminated against her based on her disability and that she was constructively discharged (Complaint, dated September 27, 2011 (Docket Item ("D.I.") 2), at 1, 8). Defendant has moved for an Order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 granting it summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff's complaint in its entirety. For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully recommend that defendant's motion be granted.
II. Facts
The following facts are supported by the record [*2]  and are undisputed, unless otherwise noted.1
A. Plaintiff's Work at WCMC
WCMC operates a nursing home in the Bronx for over 500 residents (Declaration of Elena Zaretsky in Support Of Defendant's Motion For [*3]  Summary Judgment, dated July 24, 2015, (D.I. 25) ("Zaretsky Decl.") ¶ 2). WCMC's food service department is called the "dietary department" and is comprised of dietary aides, dietitians, and cooks (Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 4).
In or about February or March 2010, Workmen's Circle implemented a new system of serving food to nursing home residents (Declaration of Slawomir Filipczuk in Support Of Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment, dated July 24, 2015, (D.I. 26) ("Filipczuk Decl.") ¶ 2)). Under this new system, WCMC's dietary aides served hot meals to residents directly from wheeled steam trucks that were transported from the facility's kitchen to each unit in the facility (Filipczuk Decl. ¶ 2). Dietary aides also served food items on trays that were delivered to residents in their rooms and that were transported on hospital tray delivery carts, also known as food trucks (Plaintiff's Deposition ("Pl. Dep.") 87, 91, annexed as Ex. C to Declaration of Ravindra K. Shaw, Esq. In Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, dated July 24, 2015, (D.I. 24) ("Shaw Decl."); Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 28-29; Filipczuk Decl. ¶ 2). An empty steam truck weighs approximately fifty pounds; an empty food [*4]  truck weighs approximately twenty pounds (Pl. Dep. at 98-100; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34).
WCMC's Dietary Director Slawomir Filipczuk amended the dietary aides' job descriptions for the new system (Filipczuk Decl. ¶ 4). The jobs were broken down into eight Assignments, each of which had a morning component and an evening component (Pl. Dep. 86; Filipczuk Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, B). The sixteen job descriptions identified particular tasks that the assigned dietary aide was required to perform during the appropriate time period (Pl. Dep. 86; Filipczuk Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. A). WCMC posted the revised job descriptions on a bulletin board in its kitchen (Pl. Dep. 85-87; Filipczuk Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Exs. A, B).
Plaintiff began working at WCMC on July 2, 1993 (Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 3). At all times relevant to this action, plaintiff was employed as a full time dietary aide and was assigned to the 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. shift (Pl. Dep. 85-87; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 3, 23-24). Her duties included preparing trays and delivering and serving snacks and meals to residents (Pl. Dep. 87-90; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 27, 34, 48; Filipczuk Decl. Ex. B). Plaintiff delivered the food using a food truck or a steam truck (Pl. Dep. [*5]  85-87; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34, 48; Filipczuk Decl. Ex. B). Plaintiff testified that at times she would receive help moving the trucks (Pl. Dep. 90; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 48-49).
B. Plaintiff's Injury at Work
On April 27, 2010, plaintiff injured herself in WCMC's facility (Pl. Dep. 103; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 27, 32; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. B). While attempting to reach for items in a kitchen supply room, plaintiff tripped on a dunnage rack and fell backwards, hitting her head and hand on the concrete floor (Pl. Dep. 77-78, 134-139; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 39-40; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. B). Following this incident, plaintiff went on medical leave from work (Pl. Dep. 145, 164; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 39-41; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 12). While on medical leave, plaintiff received treatment for injuries to her right shoulder, right arm, and right knee (Pl. Dep. 58-65, 78; Shaw Decl. & Ex. I-P, R-V, X-CC).
C. Plaintiff's Medical Record Before The Worker's Compensation Board
Plaintiff filed a worker's compensation claim in connection with her injury at work and received payments after the accident. (Pl. Dep. 54, 245-46). As further described below, the New York State Worker's Compensation Board [*6]  ("WCB") received sworn reports from several medical professionals who treated or examined plaintiff, including plaintiff's orthopedic surgeon, Eial Faierman, M.D., plaintiff's neurologist, Teresella Gondolo, M.D., an independent medical examiner, Carl B. Friedman, M.D., plaintiff's chiropractor, Gregory Pasqua, D.C. and plaintiff's physical therapist, Albert Villafuerte, M.D.
1. Dr. Eial Faierman
Dr. Faierman was plaintiff's principal treating physician for her right knee and right shoulder (Pl. Dep. 150-51). In eight sworn reports to the WCB from May 13, 2010 through August 29, 2011, Dr. Faierman consistently stated that: (1) plaintiff was 100 percent impaired, although the impairment was temporary and (2) plaintiff could not return to work because of pain or severe pain (Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13. 15, 17, 21, 22, 25, 29 & Ex. I, L, N, P, T, U, X, BB). Dr. Faierman's progress notes also consistently reported that plaintiff experienced right shoulder and right knee pain (Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13. 15, 17, 21, 22, 25, 29 & Ex. I, L, N, P, T, U, X, BB).
2. Dr. Teresella Gondolo
In a sworn report to the WCB dated May 26, 2010, plaintiff's neurologist, Teresella Gondolo, M.D., stated that: (1) plaintiff [*7]  was temporarily 100 percent impaired and (2) plaintiff could not return to work because of severe pain (Shaw Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. J).
3. Dr. Carl B. Friedman
Dr. Friedman interviewed plaintiff and performed a independent medical examination on plaintiff on June 1, 2010; he submitted a written report of his findings to the WCB (Pl. Decl. Ex. F (D.I. 34-1) at 34-41). Dr. Friedman wrote that plaintiff's "job requires her to transport food from the kitchen to each floor and assist in the feeding of the residents in this nursing home" (Pl. Decl., Ex. F (D.I. 34-1) at 34-41). With respect to plaintiff's ability to return to work and his evaluation of her disability, Dr. Friedman wrote:
At the present time she has difficulty ambulating and would not be able to return to work unless she only does sedentary work activity. This would eliminate her from her present job as a food service worker where she is required to transport food.
* * *
[C]laimant has a temporary, total disability due to her poor ambulation and pain in her right shoulder.
At the present time she should be considered to be disabled and not able to return to her full work which requires transportation. She can only return to sedentary work activity [*8]  with assistance in getting to work.
(Pl. Decl., Ex. F (D.I. 34-1) at 40-41). Following his review of a magnetic resonance image ("MRI") of plaintiff's spine and neck, Dr. Friedman prepared a second written report dated June 14, 2010, which was also submitted to the WCB (Pl. Decl., Ex. G (D.I. 34-1) at 46-50). In that report, Dr. Friedman no longer considered plaintiff to have a total disability and instead diagnosed her with having a "moderate disability"; he also stated that plaintiff "should not return to a job that requires her to have active ambulation as a major part of her job. She could return to a more sedentary mild work activity" (Pl. Decl., Ex. G (D.I. 34-1) at 48).
4. Dr. Gregory Pasqua
Dr. Pasqua treated plaintiff's right shoulder (Pl. Dep. 80-81). In eight sworn reports to the WCB between June 22, 2010 and September 8, 2011, Dr. Pasqua consistently stated that: (1) plaintiff was 100 percent temporarily impaired and (2) plaintiff could not return to work and that she "[could not] sit/stand/walk > 20 minutes; can't carry/lift/bend/push/pull" (Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 26, 30, Ex. K, M, 0, R, S, V, Y, CC).
5. Dr. Albert Villafuerte
Dr. Villafuerte, plaintiff's physical [*9]  therapist, treated plaintiff's right knee and right shoulder (Pl. Dep. 81). In a sworn report to the WCB dated August 20, 2011, Dr. Villafuerte stated that he examined plaintiff from July 6, 2011 through July 26, 2011 and found that: (1) she was 100% impaired although the impairment was temporary and (2) she cannot return to work because of severe pain (Shaw Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. A).
6. The WCB Decisions
In three written decisions, the WCB granted plaintiff worker's compensation benefits through April 2011 for her April 27, 2010 accident (Shaw Decl. Ex. Q, W, DD; Pl. Dep. 245). The ALJ found that plaintiff's "average weekly wage" was $697.23 and awarded her compensation from April 28, 2010 through June 14, 2010 at a rate of $464.82 for "[t]emporary total disability" and separately awarded compensation from June 14, 2010 through April 13, 2011 at a "tentative" rate of $232.41 (Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 18, 24, Exs. Q, W). On November 8, 2011, the WCB authorized surgeries for plaintiff's right knee and right shoulder and physical therapy after her operations (Shaw Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. DD).
D. Plaintiff's Leave of Absence and her Communications with WCMC
After her April 27, 2010 accident, WCMC put plaintiff on a medical leave [*10]  of absence (Pl. Dep. 145; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 12). Plaintiff asserts that she provided WCMC and/or its lawyers with copies of her doctors' reports to the WCB as she received them (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 32).
In addition to their reports to the WCB, plaintiff's physicians also wrote "doctor's notes" that they either sent directly to WCMC or that they gave to plaintiff to forward to WCMC. In a note dated May 1, 2010, Dr. Davis wrote that plaintiff had a "medical problem" and that he did not know when she would be able to return to work for "full duty" (Pl. Dep. 79, 106-109; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. D). This note did not indicate whether plaintiff would be subject to any restrictions when she returned to work (Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. D).
In a note dated May 18, 2010, Dr. Davis wrote that plaintiff could return to work for "full duty" on June 18, 2010; this note also did not state whether plaintiff would have any restrictions on her ability to work (Pl. Dep. 108-09; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. E).
In a note dated June 12, 2010, Dr. Davis wrote that plaintiff had a "medical problem" and that she could return to work for "full duty" on July 19, 2010; again, the note did not indicate that plaintiff [*11]  would be subject to any restrictions upon her return to work (Pl. Dep 109-110; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. F).
Plaintiff returned to work on July 19, 2010 and presented a new note from Dr. Davis that stated that plaintiff could return to work for "light duty" on July 19, 2010 because she had a "medical problem" (Pl. Dep. 110-12, 114; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. H). The note did not identify any specific work restrictions (Pl. Dep. 110-11; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. H). Plaintiff testified that she wanted to return to work and told Dr. Davis that she could return to work (Pl. Dep. 189). Plaintiff testified that because she was feeling so much pain at the time, Dr. Davis told plaintiff that "he's going to put me on light duty and see what I can do" (Pl. Dep. 111-12). Plaintiff and Dr. Davis did not discuss what "light duty" meant, and plaintiff did not tell Dr. Davis what duties her work entailed (Pl. Dep. 111-12). Upon receiving Dr. Davis's note, an employee at WCMC informed plaintiff that there was no "light duty" available (Pl. Dep. 83, 122-29). WCMC provided plaintiff with a note addressed to Dr. Davis's office stating that "[w]e do not have light duty. Please let us know when Ms. Thompson is [*12]  cleared for Full Duty so we may put her back on the schedule to return to work" (Pl. Dep. 83, 124; Shaw Decl. Ex. H). Plaintiff left WCMC on July 19, 2010 and remained on a leave of absence (Pl. Dep. 145-46, 149; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. L).2
Plaintiff and WCMC's Director of Human Resources Elena Zaretsky spoke in early March 2011 and several times thereafter regarding plaintiff's return to work (Pl. Dep. 67-71, 146-48, 151-554, 157-62; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 20-29). During these discussions, Ms. Zaretsky asked plaintiff to clarify her work restrictions and what her doctor meant by "light duty" (Pl. Dep. 67-71, 146-48, 151-554, 157-62; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 20-21, 25, 27-29). Ms. Zaretsky also asked plaintiff to identify any jobs in the dietary department plaintiff felt she could perform given [*13]  her disability (Pl. Dep. 67-71, 146-48, 151-554, 157-62; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 27-29).
As part of these discussions, WCMC received a doctor's note dated March 16, 2011 where Dr. Faierman stated that plaintiff had an unspecified medically diagnosed condition with respect to her right knee and right shoulder, that she had a follow-up appointment for re-evaluation in six weeks, that she was continuing to receive physical therapy, and that she "may return to work limited duty no lifting /pushing or pulling > 15 lbs. No standing for prolonged periods and no kneeling" (Pl. Dep. 146-50; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. H). Ms. Zaretsky asked plaintiff to identify the jobs in the dietary department plaintiff felt she could perform in light of her restrictions (Pl. Dep. 152-54; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 26 & Ex. I). In subsequent discussions, plaintiff responded to Ms. Zaretsky's inquiries by identifying positions at WCMC that she was interested in, but plaintiff and Ms. Zaretsky were not able to identify any available job at WCMC that plaintiff could do given her qualifications and work restrictions (Pl. Dep. 67-71, 146-48, 151-554, 157-62; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 20-21, 25, 27-29).
E. Plaintiff's Termination
On July [*14]  6, 2011, Ms. Zaretsky sent a letter to plaintiff stating that plaintiff's contractually provided one-year medical leave of absence was exhausted and requesting that plaintiff contact her to discuss her return to work (Pl. Dep. 164; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 30 & Ex. L). On July 12, 2011, plaintiff responded and stated that she required continued medical treatment because she had made "no real progress" in her recovery from the injury she suffered in April 2011 (Pl. Dep. 164-66; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 31 & Ex. M). Plaintiff further wrote that she required surgery but that it had not yet been scheduled (Pl. Dep. 164-66; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 31 & Ex. M). She stated that her doctor would keep WCMC informed about the surgery and the time needed for recovery (Pl. Dep. 164-68; Zaretsky Decl. Ex. M).
On or about July 15, 2011, Ms. Zaretsky sent a letter to plaintiff informing her that her employment was terminated because she was unable to return to work (Pl. Dep. 171-73; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 32 & Ex. N).
III. Analysis
A. Legal Standards
1. Summary Judgment
The standards applicable to a motion for summary judgment are well-settled and require only brief review.
Summary judgment may be granted only where there is no genuine [*15]  issue as to any material fact and the moving party . . . is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). To grant the motion, the court must determine that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). A genuine factual issue derives from the "evidence [being] such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505. The nonmoving party cannot defeat summary judgment by "simply show[ing] that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts," Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986), or by a factual argument based on "conjecture or surmise," Bryant v. Maffucci, 923 F.2d 979, 982 (2d Cir. 1991). The Supreme Court teaches that "all that is required [from a nonmoving party] is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-89, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); see also Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552, 119 S. Ct. 1545, 143 L.Ed.2d 731 (1999). It is a settled rule that "[c]redibility assessments, choices between conflicting versions of the events, and the weighing of evidence are matters for the jury, not for the court on a motion for summary judgment." Fischl v. Armitage, 128 F.3d 50, 55 (2d Cir. 1997).
McClellan v. Smith, 439 F.3d 137, 144 (2d Cir. 2006) (ellipsis added; brackets in original); accord [*16]  Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 124 (2d Cir. 2011).
"Material facts are those which 'might affect the out-come of the suit under the governing law,' and a dispute is 'genuine' if 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Coppola v. Bear Stearns & Co., Inc., 499 F.3d 144, 148 (2d Cir. 2007), quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "'[I]n ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a judge must ask himself not whether he thinks the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the [non-movant] on the evidence presented[.]'" Cine SK8, Inc. v. Town of Henrietta, 507 F.3d 778, 788 (2d Cir. 2007) (brackets in original), quoting Readco, Inc. v. Marine Midland Bank, 81 F.3d 295, 298 (2d Cir. 1996).
Entry of summary judgment is appropriate "against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "In such a situation, there can be 'no genuine issue as to any material fact,' since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra, 477 U.S. at 322-23, citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.
As noted in McClellan v. Smith, supra, 439 F.3d at 144, a court cannot make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.
"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing [*17]  of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge." [Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)]. Thus, although the court should review the record as a whole, it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe. See Wright & Miller 299. That is, the court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that "evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses." Id., at 270.
Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150-51, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)3; accord In re Dana Corp., 574 F.3d 129, 152 (2d Cir. 2009).
Local Civil Rule 56.1(a) requires that a party moving for summary judgment submit a "separate, short and concise statement, in numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue to be tried." In response, the non-moving party is required to submit a counter-statement that "include[s] a correspondingly numbered paragraph responding to each numbered paragraph in the statement of the moving party, and if necessary, additional paragraphs containing a separate, [*18]  short and concise statement of additional material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried." Local Civil Rule 56.1(b). A non-moving party's "failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1 is [a sufficient ground] for deeming admitted the facts contained in [the movant's] Rule 56.1 statement" and granting the motion. Taylor v. Local 32E Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, 286 F. Supp. 2d 246, 248 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (Conner, D.J.), aff'd, 118 F. App'x 526 (2d Cir. 2004); Watt v. N.Y. Botanical Garden, 98 Civ. 1095 (BSJ), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1611, 2000 WL 193626 at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2000) (Jones, D.J.). Here, plaintiff has not submitted a counter-statement in opposition to defendant's 56.1 statement.
"A district court[, however,] has broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a party's failure to comply with local court rules," and, thus, "may . . . opt to conduct an assiduous review of the record even" when a party has not complied with Rule 56.1. Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has further explained that
in determining whether the moving party has met [its] burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue for trial, the district court may not rely solely on the statement of undisputed facts contained in the moving party's Rule 56.1 statement. It must be satisfied that the citation to evidence in the record supports the assertion[s].
 [*19] Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 BEARGRAM Co., 373 F.3d 241, 244 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Giannullo v. City of New York, 322 F.3d 139, 140 (2d Cir. 2003); Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., supra, 258 F.3d at 74 ("The local rule does not absolve the party seeking summary judgment of the burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and a Local Rule 56.1 statement is not itself a vehicle for making factual assertions that are otherwise unsupported in the record."). Finally, "[i]t is well established that a court is ordinarily obligated to afford a special solicitude to pro se litigants," which includes "liberal construction . . . of motion papers" and "leniency in the enforcement of . . . procedural rules." Tracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 101 (2d Cir. 2010).
Accordingly, given plaintiff's pro se status, as well as the strong preference in this Circuit for resolving cases on the merits, see, e.g., Jamison v. Fischer, 11 Civ. 4697 (RJS), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144307, 2012 WL 4767173 at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2012) (Sullivan, D.J.), I shall overlook plaintiff's failure to submit a Rule 56.1 statement and review the record independently. See Am. Med. Ass'n v. United HealthCare Corp., 00 Civ. 2800 (LMM), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44196, 2007 WL 1771498 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 18, 2007) (McKenna, D.J.) (conducting review of the record "to fill . . . gaps" resulting from the nonmoving parties' failure to file a 56.1 counter-statement in response to movants' 56.1 statement); Burke v. Royal Ins. Co., 39 F. Supp. 2d 251, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (analyzing a defendant's motion for summary judgment against a pro se plaintiff "in light of the entire record before [*20]  the Court" where the plaintiff did not submit a 56.1 statement and failed to "present factual evidence in evidentiary form"); Citibank, N.A. v. Outdoor Resorts of Am., Inc., 91 Civ. 1407 (MBM), 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9624, 1992 WL 162926 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 1992) (Mukasey, D.J.) (declining to grant summary judgment based on nonmoving party's failure to submit a Rule 56.1 statement).

"The ADA prohibits discrimination against any 'qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to,' inter alia, discharge from employment." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., 445 F.3d 161, 169 (2d Cir. 2006), quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). "ADA employment discrimination claims are subject to the familiar burden-shifting analysis established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 . . . (1973)." Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., supra, 445 F.3d at 169; see also McMillan v. City of New York, 711 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2013).
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, plaintiff's claims are assessed through a three-part, burden-shifting analysis:
[T]he initial burden rests with the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. "A plaintiff's establishment of a prima facie case gives rise to a presumption of unlawful discrimination" that then "shifts the burden of production to the defendant, who must proffer a 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason' for the challenged employment action." Woodman v. WWOR-TV, Inc., 411 F.3d [69, 76 (2d Cir. 2005),] (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir. 2001)). If the defendant satisfies this burden, "the [*21]  presumption of discrimination drops out" of the case, and the plaintiff must prove that a defendant's proffered reasons were not the true reasons for its actions but a pretext for discrimination. Roge v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 257 F.3d 164, 168 (2d Cir. 2001).
Cross v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 417 F.3d 241, 248 (2d Cir. 2005). A covered employer's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to a disabled individual constitutes discrimination under the ADA. See McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009), citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006), citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) and 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
In order to meet her burden with respect to a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, plaintiff must offer admissible evidence sufficient to give rise to an issue of fact as to four elements: "'(1) [her] employer is subject to the ADA; (2) [she] was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) [she] was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of [her] job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) [she] suffered adverse employment action because of [her] disability.'" Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., supra, 445 F.3d at 169 (citation omitted); see also Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir. 2001); Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 95, 98-99 (2d Cir. 1999); Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 135 (2d Cir. 1995) (Rehabilitation Act4).
"The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment, including the existence of a vacant position for which she is qualified." McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 97; see also McMillan v. City of New York, supra, 711 F.3d at 126; Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 63 F.3d at 137-38; Jackan v. New York State Dept. of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 565-66 (2d Cir. 2000). Once plaintiff "suggest[s] the existence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits," then "defendant's burden of persuading the factfinder that the plaintiff's proposed accommodation is unreasonable merges, in effect, with its burden of showing, as an affirmative defense, that the proposed accommodation would cause it to suffer an undue hardship." Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 63 F.3d at 138; see also Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, supra, 205 F.3d at 566 ("If the plaintiff meets that burden [of proving that an accommodation exists], the analysis shifts to the question whether the proposed accommodation is reasonable; on this question the burden of persuasion lies with the defendant," citing Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 63 F.3d at 138); 42 U.S.C. § 12111(10) (defining undue hardship under the ADA).
"In the context of the ADA, reasonable accommodation may include, inter alia, modification of job duties and schedules, alteration of the facilities in which a job is performed, acquisition of devices [*23]  to assist the performance of job duties, and, under certain circumstances, 'reassignment to a vacant position.'" McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 97, quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); see also Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, supra, 205 F.3d at 566.
When an employer is on notice of a plaintiff's disability, it is required to engage in an interactive process to determine if a reasonable accommodation exists, including by "meet[ing] with the employee who requests an accommodation, request[ing] information about the condition and what limitations the employee has, ask[ing] the employee what he or she specifically wants, show[ing] some sign of having considered [the] employee's request, and offer[ing] and discuss[ing] available alternatives when the request is too burdensome." Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 218-19 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted; alterations in original); McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 102 ("[even] in the absence of a request for specific accommodation, an employer should engage in an interactive process to discover an accommodation workable to both parties[.]"); Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, supra, 205 F.3d at 568 n.4 (when an employee requests an accommodation, an employer has an obligation "to take affirmative steps to assist an employee in identifying potential accommodations"); see also Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135-36 (2d Cir. 2008); Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., supra, 457 F.3d at 185. The plaintiff also has an obligation to provide defendant with sufficient information regarding her disability to facilitate defendant's inquiry, and a plaintiff's ADA claim will fail if [*24]  plaintiff is responsible for the breakdown in the process. See Nugent v. St. Lukes—Roosevelt Hosp. Ctr., 303 F. App'x 943, 946 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order); Zito v. Donahoe, 915 F. Supp. 2d 440, 447-448 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (Marrero, D.J.).
If plaintiff is unable to work because defendant refused to provide a reasonable accommodation, a discharge based on plaintiff's inability to perform essential job functions is a discriminatory discharge. Parker v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., 260 F.3d 100, 107 (2d Cir. 2001); Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000). Plaintiff needs to demonstrate that the disability was a "motivating factor" or played a "substantial role" in the discharge but need not show that it was the "sole cause of the adverse employment action," Parker v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., supra, 260 F. 3d at 108, citing Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., supra, 204 F.3d at 337 and Fields v. New York State Office of Mental Retardation & Dev. Disabilities, 115 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).
B. Application of Law to the Facts of this Case
Defendant argues that summary judgment should be granted on plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim because her WCB award judicially estops her from claiming that she was not totally disabled, and in any event, she cannot demonstrate that she could perform the essential functions of her job with or without a reasonable accommodation.5 Defendant also argues that the fifteen-month leave of absence WCMC provided plaintiff was a reasonable accommodation.
In her opposition, plaintiff argues that she was only partially disabled and that she could have performed the essential functions of her job or another job at WCMC with or without a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff also argues that defendants failed to engage with her in an interactive process to determine if there was a reasonable accommodation that would permit plaintiff to return to work. Plaintiff argues that these facts demonstrate that defendant terminated her because of her disability in violation of the ADA.
1. Judicial Estoppel
Defendant first argues that plaintiff is judicially estopped from asserting that she could perform her essential job functions, with or without a reasonable accommodation, based on her doctors' representations to the WCB that she was totally disabled and unable to return to work.6 Even if I assume, without deciding, that plaintiff's physicians' statements can be attributed to her, summary judgment should be denied on this ground because there is an issue of fact as to whether the WCB adopted the proposition that plaintiff was totally disabled during in the months preceding the termination [*26]  of her employment.
Judicial estoppel "prevents a party from asserting a factual position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken by [that party] in a prior legal proceeding." Bates v. Long Island R.R. Co., 997 F.2d 1028, 1037 (2d Cir. 1993). The purpose of the doctrine is "to protect the integrity of the judicial process . . . by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment." New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749-50, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); accord Adelphia Recovery Trust v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 748 F.3d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 2014). "A party invoking judicial estoppel must show that (1) the party against whom the estoppel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and (2) that position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner, such as by rendering a favorable judgment." Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal citations omitted).
Statements made to administrative agencies, including to the WCB in an application for benefits, can give rise to judicial estoppel. See Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 190 F.3d at 6-8; see also Robinson v. Concentra Health Servs., 781 F.3d 42, 45-47 (2d Cir. 2015) (plaintiff's application for, and receipt of, disability benefits based on her statements to Social Security Administration that she was fully [*27]  disabled judicially estopped her from making prima facie showing that she was qualified for her position as required to support race and color discrimination claims); Ramos-Boyce v. Fordham Univ., 419 F. Supp. 2d 469, 471, 473-74 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (McMahon, D.J.) (plaintiff was estopped from arguing that she was 27 a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA because "on repeated occasions . . . plaintiff told [the WCB] that she was totally unable to work, submitted medical documentation in support of her claim" and continued to receive benefits). However, "pursuit and receipt of Social Security disability benefits, without more, neither estops the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim nor creates any special presumption against the recipient showing, for purposes of an ADA action, that with reasonable accommodation he or she could perform the essential functions of the job." See Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 190 F.3d at 6-7, citing Cleveland v. Policy Management Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 801, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999); Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., supra, 204 F.3d at 333-34.
Even if plaintiff's doctors' submissions to the WCB can be imputed to her, there remains an issue of fact as to whether the WCB adopted those assertions during the period plaintiff argues she could return to work. Because plaintiff asserts that she was able to return to work on July 19, 2010 with a reasonable accommodation, the relevant question is whether the WCB [*28]  found that she was totally disabled on that date or any subsequent date. Defendant points to progress reports provided by plaintiff's treating physicians to the WCB and argues that these "sworn reports on her behalf . . .[affirmed] that Plaintiff was 100% temporarily impaired and could not return to work, and that the WCB adopted these statements by awarding 'full' worker's compensation payments to Plaintiff from April 2010 to October 2011 based on an express finding that Plaintiff had a '[t]emporary total disability'" (Def. Mem. of Law In Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, dated July 24, 2015 (D.I. 23) at 14). Although defendant states that the WCB awarded plaintiff "full" benefits, plaintiff claims that the WCB adopted the assessment of the independent medical examiner -- Dr. Friedman -- that she was partially disabled and cites as evidence the fact that, after initially granting her full benefits, the WCB reduced the award to partial benefits (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 31, 45; Pl. Dep. 245). A finding of partial disability by the WCB on or after July 19, 2010 would be consistent with plaintiff's claim here that she was qualified to work with a reasonable accommodation.
The WCB's decisions [*29]  with respect to the post-July 19, 2010 time period do not clearly state whether it found plaintiff 100% or partially disabled or awarded her "full" or "partial" benefits (Shaw Decl. Exs. Q, W); moreover, the record tends to contradict defendant's position that plaintiff received "full" benefits after July 19, 2010. The WCB found that plaintiff's "average weekly wage" was $697.23 (Shaw Decl. Ex. Q). The WCB initially awarded plaintiff a $464.82 weekly rate through June 14, 2010 for a "[t]emporary total disability" (Shaw Decl. Ex. Q). The WCB then reduced plaintiff's award to a "tentative" weekly rate of $232.41 for the period from June 14, 2010 through April 13, 2011 (Shaw Decl. Exs. Q, W).
New York's Workers Compensation Law provides that an individual who suffers a temporary total disability is entitled to an award of two-thirds of her average weekly wage. With respect to individuals who are not totally disabled, it appears that the practice of the Workers' Compensation Board is to award the percentage of the total disability benefit that corresponds to the percentage of the individual's disability. For example, an individual who is 50% disabled would receive one-half of two thirds of her average [*30]  weekly wage. N.Y. Workers' Comp. L. §§ 15(2),(5), (5-a); Workers' Compensation (On-the-Job Injury or Illness), Cash Benefits, available at http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/onthejob/wcBenefits.jsp (Last visited 2/19/2016). Plaintiff here initially received a Workers' Compensation award of $464.82 per week which is exactly two-thirds of her pre-accident weekly salary of $697.23; this award suggests that the Workers' Compensation Board concluded that plaintiff was initially temporarily totally disabled. However, for the period from June 14, 2010 through April 13, 2011, plaintiff's benefits were reduced to $232.41 or one-half of the award for the earlier period. This reduced award implies that for the period from June 14, 2010 through April 13, 2011, the Workers' Compensation Board found that plaintiff was only 50% disabled.
The foregoing is consistent with plaintiff's deposition testimony that, at first, she received "full pay," and "then, after that, that I wasn't 100 percent disabled, they changed it" (Pl. Dep. 245). The change as of June 14, 2010 is also consistent with Dr. Friedman's June 14, 2010 report to the WCB that he no longer considered plaintiff to have a total disability and instead diagnosed her as having a "moderate disability" (Pl. Decl., Ex. G (D.I. 34-1) at 46-50). [*31]  Thus, based on its award, it appears that the WCB found that plaintiff was only 50 percent disabled after June 14, 2010.
Therefore, there is compelling evidence in the record that the WCB never found that plaintiff was totally disabled after June 14, 2010 and that there is, at the very least, a question of fact as to the existence of the second element of judicial estoppel. Thus, I conclude that defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on its judicial estoppel theory.
2. Reasonable Accommodation
Defendant next argues that, given her medical restrictions, plaintiff has not put forth any evidence that she could perform the essential functions of her job or another available job at WCMC for which plaintiff was qualified with or without a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff disputes defendant's definition of the essential functions of her job and argues that under her definition of those functions, she could perform her essential duties and that her non-essential duties could be performed by other employees of WCMC.
a. Plaintiff Could Not Perform Her Essential Job Functions Without an Accommodation
As explained below, there is no genuine issue of fact that plaintiff's essential job functions [*32]  require standing for more than 30 minutes at a time, the pushing and pulling of food trucks that weigh over fifteen pounds, as well as repetitive bending and/or kneeling and reaching to prepare or serve food to residents. I also find that plaintiff has not offered sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she could perform these essential functions without an accommodation.
Although the term "essential functions" is not defined by the ADA, EEOC regulations indicate that "it encompasses the fundamental job duties of the employment position." McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 98, quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1); see also Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 120 (2d Cir. 2004); Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, 11 Civ. 8934 (AJN), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2014) (Nathan, D.J.), appeal dismissed (May 14, 2014). A job function can be essential for several reasons including that "the reason the position exists is to perform that function;" further, relevant evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes the "consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i), (n)(3); see also Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997). Although courts should give deference to an employer's judgment and written description regarding what job functions are essential, [*33]  the resolution of the question depends on the totality of the circumstances. McMillan v. City of New York, supra, 711 F.3d at 126; McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 98; Rodal v. Anesthesia Group of Onondaga, P.C., supra, 369 F.3d at 120-21.
Plaintiff's written job description and plaintiff's own testimony demonstrate that plaintiff's essential job functions involved prolonged standing, pushing and pulling of heavy food trucks, and repetitive bending and kneeling. Plaintiff does not dispute that a document titled "Assignment 4" accurately reflects the schedule and daily activities required by her job assignment and that she had seen a copy of it before she was injured in April 2010 (Pl. Dep. 86; Filipczuk Decl. Ex. B).7 This written job description allocates more than 30 minutes to set up the food trucks or steam trucks, deliver the food, and return the trucks; it also requires the dietary aides to push the food trucks to the south and north sides of each floor to deliver the food (Filipczuk Decl. Ex. B). Plaintiff acknowledged in her deposition that she served lunch and supper on the north side and south side of one floor, went from floor to floor to serve snacks to the residents, and that in the course of serving snacks she moved the snack food truck from the north side to the south side of each floor (Pl. Dep. 88-93; see also Pl. Decl. [*34]  (D.I. 34) at 35, 48, 88-93 ("pushing, pulling, lifting, standing, walking, reaching might be involved in me performing my work duties"; "as a dietary aide my essential functions involved preparation of food, delivery of food to the floor, and serving the residents at Workmen's circle")). Plaintiff also acknowledged that her job required repetitive arm motions and that she would serve "dozens" of residents by reaching into the steam truck with a spoon or other utensil to scoop up the food and put it on the tray (Pl. Dep. 88-89, 91-93).
Despite the written job description and her own testimony, [*35]  plaintiff now disputes that the essential functions of her job involved pushing and pulling the steam truck and standing for more than 30 minutes at a time. With respect to moving the steam truck, plaintiff asserts that this was a task that was "normally" performed by others on their own initiative or at the direction of a supervisor (Pl. Dep. 91-92, 94, 95, 97). Further, plaintiff argues that her job functions did not require her to stand for more than thirty minutes at a time (Pl. Dep. 90-91, 205, 207). With respect to the bending and kneeling required by her job, plaintiff simply states that she could perform those tasks without accommodation (Pl. Dep. 92-93).
Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the pushing and pulling of steam trucks and standing for prolonged periods of time are essential functions of her job. As plaintiff admits, plaintiff's job was to deliver and serve food to multiple floors. The delivery of that food from the kitchen to the floors, therefore, was essential to her job; if plaintiff did not perform that work, someone else would have to do it. Further, the written job description on its face requires more than 30 minutes of standing [*36]  or walking at a time, including the time taken to prepare meals and deliver them (See, e.g., Flipczuk Decl. Ex. B (serving north and south side units from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. followed by returning steam truck and cleaning and taking all empty pots and pans to pot room area from 6:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. followed by labeling supplements for next day from 6:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m.). Plaintiff's conclusory assertion that it took her less than thirty minutes to complete these tasks is insufficient to create a dispute as to the time required to do the work. See, e.g., McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 99 (on summary judgment, plaintiff's conclusory affidavit that she was qualified for then-available positions could not counter documentary evidence demonstrating that she was not).
Further, the undisputed medical evidence and plaintiff's testimony demonstrates that she could not perform the essential job functions of pushing the steam truck, standing for more than 20 minutes at a time and bending, kneeling and reaching to serve food. Plaintiff admits in her papers that "[p]rior to my injuries, I would move the steam truck from the north side to the south side; with my injuries, I would have definitely needed help to move the steam truck [*37]  from the north side to the south side" (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34).8 During plaintiff's medical leave, Dr. Pasqua consistently reported to the WCB that plaintiff "[c]an't sit/stand/walk > 20 minutes; can't carry / lift / bend / push / pull" (Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 26, 30, Ex. K, M, 0, R, S, V, Y, CC). On July 14, 2010, just days before plaintiff's first attempt to return to work, Dr. Faierman reported to the WCB that plaintiff's right shoulder pains were "unchanged" and prevented her from going back to work (Shaw Decl., Ex. L). Dr. Faierman's March 16, 2011 note to WCMC also stated that plaintiff "may return to work limited duty no lifting /pushing or pulling > 15 lbs. No standing for prolonged periods and no kneeling" (Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. H). In July 2011, Dr. Villafuerte reported to the WCB that "patient complains of pain on right shoulder and right knee. Pain is worse when reaching out or overhead, reaching behind back and lifting, pushing or carrying heavy object" (Shaw Decl. Ex. Z). Plaintiff also admitted at her deposition that her disability limits her ability to push, pull, lift, and stand (Pl. Dep., 61:9-25;9 62:12-18;10 62:19-63:10;11 64:17-2312). She also did not [*38]  dispute her doctor's assessment that she should not kneel at all (Pl. Dep. 151). Thus, plaintiff's own medical evidence demonstrates that plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job without an accommodation.
b. Plaintiff Has Not Identified A Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff has also failed to present any evidence, other than mere speculation, that there was a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job.
i. Shifting Her Essential Functions to Other Employees Is Not a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff's argument that defendant should have re-assigned the movement of food trucks and/or steam trucks to another employee as a reasonable accommodation fails because a reasonable accommodation cannot include the elimination of an essential function of the job.
Plaintiff asserts that she received help moving food trucks and steam trucks prior to her accident, (Pl. Dep. 90-92, 94-97; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34, 36), and she is correct to the extent she argues that assistance from other employees or the shifting of responsibilities [*41]  can be a reasonable accommodation if the duties at issue are not essential functions of the job. See Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 63 F.3d at 140. However, when the essential functions of a job include heavy lifting or similar physical labor, a plaintiff cannot claim that shifting such tasks to another employee is a reasonable accommodation. Borkowski v. Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 63 F.3d at 140 ("individuals whose physical condition precludes them from engaging in heavy lifting, and who seek jobs for which such lifting is shown to be an essential function, need not be accommodated by shifting responsibility for the lifting to other individuals"); Gilbert v. Frank, 949 F.2d 637, 643-44 (2d Cir. 1991) (because the carrying of mail bags was an essential function of plaintiff's job as a postal worker, it was not a reasonable accommodation to shift or waive those functions away from plaintiff); McLean-Nur v. Dept. of Transp., City of New York, 98 Civ. 819 (NRB), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3495, 2000 WL 297176 at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2000) (Buchwald, D.J.) ("When an employee is restricted from heavy lifting due to a medical condition, and heavy lifting is an essential function of his job, his employer need not accommodate him by shifting responsibility for lifting to other employees."); Bunis v. Runyon, 92 Civ. 6577 (JFK), 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11516, 1994 WL 445722 at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 1994) (Keenan, D.J.) (not reasonable to request elimination of essential functions of letter [*42]  carrier which included ability to lift, pull and box mail over ten pounds and move packages up to 70 pounds), aff'd, 60 F.3d 810 (2d Cir. 1995). Thus, even if WCMC had "exceeded its legal obligations" in the past by providing plaintiff with assistance moving food trucks and steam trucks, the ADA does not "does not compel [WCMC] to continue to accommodate [her] beyond what the law requires." Uhl v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 08-CV-3064 (JS)(ETB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84565, 2010 WL 3282611 at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2010) (emphasis in original). Moreover, even if the pushing and pulling of food trucks and steam trucks were re-assigned to other employees, plaintiff also has not presented any evidence that she could perform the other essential functions of her job, including kneeling and prolonged standing.
ii. Plaintiff Has Failed to Offer Evidence Sufficient to Give Rise to a Genuine Issue of Fact that a Motorized Truck Would Have Been a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff suggests for the first time in her opposition papers that defendant could have accommodated her disability by purchasing a motorized food truck or steam truck. However, plaintiff presents no evidence that she ever requested this accommodation, that it was available or suitable to WCMC's facility or that it would have allowed her [*43]  to perform the other essential functions of her job, such as prolonged standing, kneeling and reaching. Thus, there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether a motorized cart would have been a reasonable accommodation.
Where a plaintiff suggests an accommodation, "to survive summary judgment there must be evidence in the record that is at least sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact that the claimed accommodation would have enabled the plaintiff to perform the position's essential functions." Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, supra, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *9 (citations omitted). Further, it matters whether the plaintiff requested that his or her employer investigate the feasibility of the proposed accommodation, because "generally, 'it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.'" Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., supra, 457 F.3d at 184, quoting 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. at 363 (2003); Nixon-Tinkelman v. New York City Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, 434 F. App'x 17, 19 (2d Cir. 2011) (summary order).
For example, in Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, supra, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge, granted defendant's motion for summary judgment and rejected plaintiff's unsupported contention in her brief that "proper seating, and a motorized cart to transport her equipment" could have enabled plaintiff to do her job as a care management coordinator at a healthcare [*44]  management company. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *9. Judge Nathan found that there was an "absence of any actual evidence . . . whether from [plaintiff], a doctor, or any other source" that the proposed accommodation would have allowed the plaintiff there to perform the essential functions of her job. Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, supra, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *9. Judge Nathan also noted that the evidence in the record demonstrated that plaintiff never suggested to her employer that she could perform the care management coordinator position with such a cart (or any other accommodation) and that the "failure to make such a request under the circumstances of [that] case corroborate[d] the evidence of the unsuitability of the proposed accommodation." Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, supra, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *9.
Similarly here, there is no evidence that plaintiff ever requested a motorized truck nor is there any evidence in the record that this accommodation would have allowed her to perform all the essential functions of her job. The only accommodation plaintiff requested was "light duty" (plaintiff defines light duty as a "request for reasonable accommodation" (see, e.g., Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 27, 30-34)) and it was not reasonable for plaintiff to expect WCMC to have inferred from this request that plaintiff would be able to do her job if WCMC purchased [*45]  a motorized truck. Rather, based on the record, the only reasonable inference is that plaintiff's request for light duty was a request to be reassigned to another job or to be relieved from some or all of the physically demanding tasks that were essential functions of her job. Plaintiff herself understood light duty to mean "nothing too heavy" (Pl. Dep. 112). Further, following the request for "light duty," plaintiff's doctor specified that she could return to work with minimal standing, kneeling, pushing and pulling (Pl. Dep. 146-50; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 21 & Ex. H); a motorized truck would not have diminished plaintiff's need to stand and kneel. Thus, like the plaintiff in Seivright, although plaintiff has proposed a "hypothetical accommodation, the record is devoid of proof that [her] position could, in fact, have been performed without the standing, walking or moving of [carts] or other heavy objects that is otherwise required." Seivright v. Montefiore Med. Ctr., Hosp. of Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, supra, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30137, 2014 WL 896744 at *9. Accordingly, I find that plaintiff has failed to offer evidence of a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to perform all of the essential functions of her previous position at WCMC.13
iii. Plaintiff Fails to Create a Genuine Issue of Fact As to Whether Permitting Her to Sit More Would Allow Her to Perform Her Essential Job Functions
Plaintiff also argues that instead of standing to prepare food and serve the residents, a reasonable accommodation would have been to allow her to sit to perform these functions (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34-35, 49). Plaintiff argues that it is "obvious" that she could complete the functions of "preparing supplements and nourishments, loading the food trucks, and serving on trays" while sitting rather than standing (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34). Defendant does not address this argument in its submissions, but it is apparent from the record that plaintiff's [*47]  proposed accommodation does not create an issue of fact that warrants the denial of summary judgment. Plaintiff does not assert that she ever requested this accommodation. Further, plaintiff's proposed accommodation would presumably require her to constantly switch from sitting to standing, and plaintiff fails to address her doctors' statements that she was precluded from prolonged sitting as well as standing (Pl. Decl., Ex. Z, (D.I. 34-5) at 3; Shaw Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27, 30, Ex. K, M, 0, R, S, V, Y, Z, CC).14 In addition, this proposed accommodation does not address the kneeling, reaching, walking, and pushing and pulling of food trucks or other heavy objects that is otherwise required by plaintiff's job.
iv. WCMC Had No Light Duty Positions And Was Not Obligated to Create One
Plaintiff's catch-all assertion that WCMC should have simply provided her with "light duty" also fails because there is no evidence that light duty positions for which plaintiff was qualified were available.
Although reassignment to a "light duty" position can be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, an employer has no obligation to create a new light duty position for a disabled employee. See, e.g., Davidson v. LaGrange Fire District, 523 F. App'x 838, 839 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order) ("Davidson has failed to demonstrate . . . that there were any light-duty positions available for career firefighters, and our case law makes clear that defendants were not required to create a new position to accommodate Davidson."); Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., supra, 457 F.3d at 187 (employer was not required to reassign plaintiff to a "new, sedentary desk job" because "the ADA does not require creating a new position for a disabled employee"); Whitfield v. Am. Storage & Transp., Inc., 12-CV-1622 (SJF)(GRB), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6527, 2014 WL 204705 at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2014) ("Defendant is not required to create a new position to accommodate plaintiff's physical [*49]  limitations."), aff'd, 588 F. App'x 58, 59 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order); King v. Town of Wallkill, 302 F. Supp. 2d 279, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (Connor, D.J.) ("plaintiff's request for a permanent light-duty assignment fails as a matter of law because the record clearly demonstrates that these positions do not exist in the Town's police department"). Plaintiff does not dispute defendant's assertions that WCMC informed her that WCMC did not have "light duty" or other available positions that plaintiff could perform given plaintiff's qualifications and physical limitations (Pl. Dep. 124-26, 151-54, 156-163; Shaw Decl. Ex. H; Zaretsky Decl ¶¶ 22-29). Nor does she claim that these statements by WCMC was untrue. Thus, plaintiff's argument that she was denied "light duty" as a reasonable accommodation is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.
v. Plaintiff Has Not Identified Other Positions at WCMC that She Could Have Performed with her Disability
Plaintiff is also unable to offer any evidence that defendant failed to accommodate her by a transfer to a different, less demanding job assignment; those positions were either unavailable or plaintiff was not qualified for the position.
"[I]n order to recover under the ADA . . . for a failure to reasonably accommodate by transfer, a plaintiff bears [*50]  the burden of establishing that a vacancy existed into which he or she might have been transferred." Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, supra, 205 F.3d at 566. If a plaintiff is not qualified for a position or if it is occupied by another employee, then it is not an available accommodation. McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 97-99; Shannon v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 104 (2d Cir. 2003); Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 99 (2d Cir. 1999).
Although plaintiff does not address her request for reassignment in her opposition papers, she did raise it in her deposition testimony. Plaintiff testified that she requested reassignment to two different positions, one in the Dietary Department and one in the "Activities" department. Plaintiff does not dispute that these positions were either full, that she was not qualified for them or that they had essential job functions that plaintiff could not perform with her disability (Pl. Dep. 20-22, 68-74, 154-58, 161-62; see also Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 28-29; Filipzcuk Decl. Ex. A, at D000227). Accordingly, plaintiff cannot predicate a failure-to-accommodate claim on WCMC's failure to transfer plaintiff to a less demanding position.
vi. Plaintiff's Fifteen Month Leave of Absence Was a Reasonable Accommodation
Given plaintiff's limitations and the work requirements at WCMC, the fifteen month leave of absence that WCMC granted her was a reasonable accommodation. [*51] 
Although the Court of Appeals has not resolved the question of whether paid or unpaid leave can constitute a reasonable accommodation under the ADA,15 it has held that the ADA does not require an employer to give an employee an indefinite leave of absence nor provide a finite leave without a reasonable expectation that the leave would enable the employee to return to work and perform the essential functions of her job. See Petrone v. Hampton Bays Union Free Sch. Dist., supra, 568 F. App'x at 8 (plaintiff "failed to make a prima facie case that his requested accommodation of unpaid leave was reasonable, because he gave [his employer] no assurance whatsoever that he would be able to return to work"); Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 353 F. App'x 558, 560-61 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order) (two weeks unpaid leave sought by plaintiff was not reasonable because plaintiff made no showing that the accommodation would likely result in his return to work to perform the essential functions of his job); see also Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., supra, 457 F.3d at 185 n.5; Mitchell v. Washingtonville Cent. Sch. Dist., supra, 190 F.3d at 9. Thus, where a leave of absence is the requested accommodation, the employer must have some assurance that the employee will be able to return to work and perform the essential functions of his job. See Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., supra, 204 F.3d at 338 ("[t]he duty to make reasonable accommodations does not, of course, require an employer to hold an injured employee's position open [*52]  indefinitely while the employee attempts to recover"); Nandori v. City of Bridgeport, No. 12 Civ. 673 (JBA), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5581, 2014 WL 186430 at *5—*7 (D. Conn. Jan. 16, 2014) (plaintiff's request was unreasonable where he requested "sufficient leave to receive treatment and recover, but provided no description of that treatment, nor an estimate of how long might be needed"); McNamara v. Tourneau, Inc., 496 F. Supp. 2d 366, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (Chin, then D.J., now Cir. J.) ("it was not reasonable for [plaintiff] to expect [defendant] to hold his job open indefinitely, particularly as he had already been out of work some six weeks"), aff'd, 326 F. App'x 68 (2d Cir. 2009); Stamey v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 358 F. Supp. 2d 317, 326-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Daniels, D.J.) (plaintiff's request for an indefinite leave of absence was unreasonable).
It is undisputed that WCMC granted plaintiff a leave of absence beginning on the date of her injury, April 27, 2010, and that plaintiff never gave WCMC any assurance that she would be able to return to work and perform the essential functions of her job by a specific date. After more than one year of leave, plaintiff responded to WCMC's request that she return to work by asking WCMC for an indefinite extension [*53]  of her leave. On July 12, 2011, plaintiff sent Ms. Zaretsky a note indicating that she was getting surgery for her knee, that she did "not know when the surgery will be scheduled," and did "not know how much time will be needed for recovery" (Pl. Dep. 165-70; Zaretsky Decl. Ex. M). Given the lack of any assurance of her return within a reasonable time, WCMC justifiably enforced its one-year medical leave policy and terminated plaintiff on July 15, 2011 (Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 30-32). Moreover, plaintiff's doctors' reports to the WCB in the months following her termination continued to indicate that she could not return to work for an "unknown" or "n/a" period of time (Shaw Decl. Ex. AA, BB, CC). Therefore, to the extent plaintiff is asserting that WCMC should have accommodated her disability by granting her an indefinite leave of absence, her claim fails.
3. Interactive Process
Because plaintiff has failed to identify any reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to continue working at WCMC, her claim that defendant failed to engage her in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation also fails. See McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., supra, 583 F.3d at 101 (an "employer's failure to engage in such an interactive process [*54]  . . . does not relieve a plaintiff of her burden of demonstrating, following discovery, that some accommodation of her disability was possible.").
Further, even if plaintiff could put forth evidence of a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled her to return to work, the record demonstrates that defendant did engage plaintiff in an interactive process to attempt to identify her restrictions and an appropriate accommodation for her disability. Plaintiff argues that defendant failed to participate in an interactive process because WCMC informed her on July 19, 2010 that she could only return to work if she was cleared for "full duty"; however, both plaintiff and defendant acknowledge that following plaintiff's injury, plaintiff and one or more employees of WCMC communicated by phone, email, fax, and/or in person to identify when plaintiff could return to work, what plaintiff's restrictions were and what possible jobs or tasks she could do at WCMC (Pl. Dep. 67-71, 146-48, 151-54, 157-62; Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 11; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 20-29).
Plaintiff's first request for accommodation occurred on July 19, 2010, when plaintiff arrived at work and presented a note to the supervisor [*55]  in the Dietary Department, stating that she could perform "light duty" (Pl. Dep. 114, 117, 122). Plaintiff believed "light duty" meant "nothing too heavy" (Pl. Dep. 111-12; Zaretsky Decl. Ex. G). On July 19, 2010, the Assistant Director of Food Services at WCMC told plaintiff that WCMC did not have "light duty" positions and provided plaintiff with a written statement to that effect (Pl. Dep. 124-26; Shaw Decl. Ex. H).
Plaintiff also testified that she spoke to Ms. Zaretsky at some point after July 19, 2010 and that Ms. Zaretsky asked her what her doctor meant by "light duty" and whether there were jobs at WCMC that she could do given her restrictions. At her deposition, plaintiff testified:
So basically I spoke to her about it, I think she asked me something about [light] duty, what it is, and I tried -- the knowledge, as I can recall, I think trying to explain to her, trying to plead to her mercy to see what we can do for me to go back to work, basically.
* * *
Since July 19, 2010, between those periods I tried to contact her to see, because I think she asked me sometime what is light duty. I am not exactly sure. And I tried to explain to her, and she asked me, you know, it's like we [*56]  were talking and she asked me if I can let her know, I can try my best to see what I can do. We was talking, actually, you know, trying to figure out what to do.
(Pl. Dep. 146-47).16
Plaintiff also provided Ms. Zaretsky with a note from her orthopedic surgeon dated March 16, 2011 in which he listed plaintiff's work restrictions as "[l]imited duty, no lifting, pushing or pulling greater than 15 pounds" and "[n]o standing for prolonged periods and no kneeling" (Pl. Dep. 151-152; Zaretsky Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. H). Plaintiff discussed this note with Ms. Zaretsky and explained to her that she could "try to do the best" she could (Pl. Dep. 152). According to Ms. Zaretsky, [*57]  this note "presented significant problems" because the duties and responsibilities for dietary aides are "physically demanding" and could not be performed with plaintiff's restrictions (Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 21-25). When plaintiff met with Ms. Zaretsky to discuss this note and in subsequent conversations, Ms. Zaretsky asked plaintiff to identify positions at WCMC that she felt she could do (Pl. Dep. 157-62; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 27-29). Plaintiff identified two positions, one in the Dietary Department and one in the Activities Department; Ms. Zaretsky informed plaintiff that the positions were either unavailable to her, that she was not qualified for them or that her work restrictions did not permit her to perform the essential functions of those jobs (Pl. Dep. 151-54, 156-163; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 27-29). Ms. Zaretsky informed plaintiff that there was "basically no light duty" (Pl. Dep. 153, 155).17
Plaintiff argues that defendants delayed the process and that they should have asked her for clarification of "light duty" on July 19, 2010; she argues that by failing to engage her in a discussion on that date and by giving her a note asking her doctor to inform WCMC when she was cleared for "Full Duty," defendant violated her rights under the ADA (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 34; Pl. Dep. 124-26; Shaw Decl. Ex. H (note addressed to "Bridge Medical Corp." stating "[p]lease let us know when Ms. Thompson is cleared for Full Duty so we may put her back on the schedule to return to work")). However, to the extent the delay was due to defendant's failure to reach out more quickly to plaintiff or her doctors for a clarification of the meaning of "light duty," there is no evidence that that delay was caused by discriminatory intent. See Logan v. Matveevskii, 57 F. Supp. 3d 234, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Karas, D.J.) ("[C]ourts in the Second Circuit have consistently held that a plaintiff is required to provide evidence that the delay was motivated by the employer's discriminatory intent, as opposed to mere [*59]  negligence." (citing cases)). Dr. Davis' note was vague on its face and did not give WCMC any indication as to what plaintiff could or could not do. Indeed, despite the lack of "light duty" as an accommodation, WCMC allowed plaintiff to remain on leave of absence. Further, once defendant and plaintiff resumed discussions, plaintiff does not dispute that Ms. Zaretsky communicated with her several times and attempted to identify what work she could do. That plaintiff and Ms. Zaretsky were unable ultimately to identify a reasonable accommodation for plaintiff does not change the fact that WCMC engaged plaintiff in an interactive process to determine if an accommodation was possible. Defendant is, therefore, also entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim that it failed to engage in an interactive discussion.
4. Discriminatory Discharge
Plaintiff claims that she was constructively discharged when WCMC failed to provide her with a "light duty" job on July 19, 2010 and that WCMC discriminated against her when they terminated her in July 2011.
Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that she was constructively discharged on July 19, 2010 because she did not resign and instead remained on a medical [*60]  leave of absence. A constructive discharge occurs when an employer, "rather than directly discharging an individual, intentionally creates an intolerable atmosphere that forces an employee to quit involuntarily." Flaherty v. Metromail Corp., 235 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 230 (2d Cir. 2004); Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., 223 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2000). In addition, in an ADA case, the plaintiff must establish that the constructive discharge occurred in circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination on the basis of plaintiff's disability. Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 152 (2d Cir. 2003). Plaintiff does she allege that she resigned on July 19, 2010 or anytime after that date. She continued to communicate with WCMC regarding her return to work "several" times over the course of the next year (Pl. Dep. 147, 152, 163; Zaretsky Decl. ¶¶ 20-29). Indeed, plaintiff acknowledged in her July 12, 2011 letter that she was on a leave of absence and requested that WCMC extend that leave of absence until she was fully recovered (Zaretsky Decl. Ex. M). Therefore, plaintiff was not constructively discharged on July 19, 2010.18
Further, plaintiff has not offered evidence to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her termination in July 2011 was motivated by discrimination rather than her inability to return to work for an indefinite period of time. As discussed above, defendant engaged plaintiff in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation for her disability and discharged her only after a fifteen-month leave of absence and upon receipt of plaintiff's letter stating that she would be unable to return to work for an indefinite period of time. Defendant's termination of plaintiff based on plaintiff's inability to perform the essential functions of her job was not discriminatory. Parker v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., supra, 260 F.3d at 108; Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., supra, 457 F.3d at 185.
C. Summary
Accordingly, for all of the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted.
D. Motion to Amend
Plaintiff identifies various new claims in her opposition to this motion, including a breach of contract claim, violation of "EEO Act, FMLA, 1199 contract, and Workmen's Circle FMLA policy" (Pl. Decl. (D.I. 34) at 40-41). These claims [*62]  are not alleged in the complaint. Nevertheless, in light of my obligation to construe the papers of pro se litigants leniently, I shall interpret plaintiff's discussion of these matters as an attempt to amend her complaint to add new claims. See, e.g., Benjamin v. Health & Hosps. Corp., 07 Civ. 2487 (KAM)(LB), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83051, 2009 WL 2959622 at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2009) (construing plaintiff's opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment as including a request for leave to amend her complaint to raise new claims), aff'd, 394 F. App'x 829 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order); Carter v. Cash, 92-CV-5526 (JG), 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22209, 1995 WL 347028 at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 31, 1995) (construing allegations in plaintiff's letters in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss, or in the alternative for summary judgment, as an amendment to his complaint).
Deeming plaintiff's arguments and references to various statutes and claims to be a motion to amend, it is denied without prejudice. The motion is procedurally defective because it does not include a proposed amended complaint. See, e.g., Abercrombie v. Andrew College, 438 F. Supp. 2d 243, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Karas, D.J.) ("[I]n making a motion for leave to amend, plaintiffs must attach a proposed amended complaint so that the Court and the opposing party has an opportunity to understand the exact changes proposed."); accord  [*63] Garnett-Bishop v. New York Community Bancorp, Inc., 12-CV-2285 (ADS)(ARL), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157806, 2014 WL 5822628 at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 2014); Am. Tissue, Inc. v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec. Corp., 233 F.R.D. 327, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (Lynch, then D.J., now Cir. J.); Jonas v. Rich, 02 Civ. 498 (BSJ), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12713, 2004 WL 1542231 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2004) (Jones, D.J.); 6 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1485 at 688-89 n.3 (3rd ed. 2010). The proposed new claims are so vaguely described, it is impossible to assess intelligently whether the proposed amendments are viable. See generally Holmes v. Grubman, 568 F.3d 329, 334 (2d Cir. 2009) (A "district court has discretion to deny leave [to amend] for good reason, including futility, bad faith, undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party."); accord Sissel v. Rehwaldt, 519 F. App'x 13, 17 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order).
Accordingly, to the extent plaintiff's opposition can be construed as a motion to amend, the application should be denied without prejudice to renewal.
IV. Conclusion
Accordingly, for all the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted and that plaintiff's motion to amend be denied without prejudice.
