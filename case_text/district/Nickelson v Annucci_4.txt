ORDER AND REPORT-RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Darrell Nickelson commenced this pro se action alleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on February 27, 2015. (Dkt. No. 1.) The Defendants remaining in the action are Anthony Annucci ("Annucci"), Commissioner of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision ("DOCCS"); Theresa Knapp-David ("Knapp-David"), sued by Plaintiff as DOCCS Director of Inmate Placement and Movement; and Carl J. Koenigsmann, M.D., sued by Plaintiff as DOCCS Chief Medical Officer. The three Defendants are sued solely in their official capacity. (Dkt. No. 44 at 3.1 ) The single claim remaining against the three Defendants is the alleged failure to grant Plaintiff's written requests for a reasonable accommodation in violation of Title II of the ADA.2 Presently before the Court for report and recommendation [*2]  is Defendants' motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. No. 82.) For reasons explained below, the Court recommends that the motion be granted.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiff entered DOCCS custody most recently on May 8, 2014. (Dkt. No. 82-20 at 1.) Plaintiff transferred into Great Meadow Correctional Facility ("Great Meadow") on or about June 7, 2014, and was incarcerated there at the time he commenced this action. (Dkt. Nos. 1 at ¶ 3; 82-6 at ¶ 12.3 ) According to Plaintiff, he was involved in a car accident that resulted in a spinal injury in July of 2000. (Dkt. No. 35 at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff's "Incoming Draft Review" at the time he was transferred to Great Meadow noted that Plaintiff had undergone a laminectomy. (Dkt. No. 82-6 at ¶ 12.)
When Plaintiff saw Dr. Karandy, Facility Health Services Director at Great Meadow, on June 18, 2014, he told Dr. Karandy he had chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease. Id. ¶ 15. Dr. Karandy issued Plaintiff a permit allowing Plaintiff to be fed in his cell and lock on the flats, i.e., first or second floor of a housing unit, and provided Plaintiff with a back brace, a cane, and a TENS unit. Id. at ¶ 16. Dr. Karandy did not believe Plaintiff [*3]  required a restriction on stair climbing based upon his examination of Plaintiff and review of his history and did not include that restriction in the permit issued on June 19, 2014. Id. at ¶ 18.
When Plaintiff was admitted to the infirmary for observation on June 23, 2014, after allegedly falling on the stairway, Dr. Karandy ordered an MRI of Plaintiff's lumbar spine. Id. at ¶¶ 19-21. The MRI done at the Albany Medical Center on August 15, 2014, revealed normal alignment of the spine, circumferential disc bulges in multiple areas, and "[m]ultilevel degenerative changes worst at the L4-L5 level which results in moderate spinal canal stenosis and severe bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis." (Dkt. No. 83-1 at 1-2.)
DOCCS Directive # 2614 sets forth a multi-step process whereby inmates with physical or mental disabilities may request reasonable accommodations under the ADA. (Dkt. Nos. 82-8 at ¶¶ 4-8.) Directive # 2614 provides that an inmate who is dissatisfied with the decision on his request may file a grievance under the DOCCS IGP set forth in Directive # 4040. (Dkt. Nos. 82-7 at 3; 82-8 at ¶ 9.)
On July 9, 2014, Plaintiff submitted a Request for Reasonable Accommodations claiming that [*4]  he was unable "to ambulate on stairs [and] ramps due to a severe spinal injury which causes spasms and falling." Id. at ¶ 24; Dkt. 83-2. The accommodation requested by Plaintiff was a 'transfer to a facility where stairs are not an issue and where I may receive appropriate medical care." (Dkt. No. 83-2.) Dr. Karandy, who was required to review the request as part of his duties, recommended that Plaintiff be transferred to a flats facility because of arthritis of the spine. (Dkt. No. 82-6 at ¶¶ 26-27.) The Deputy Superintendent of Security, who has the final say on a request for accommodations, modified Dr. Karandy's recommendation August 27, 2014, by approving having Plaintiff lock on flats. (Dkt. Nos. 82-6 at ¶ 27; 83-2.) Plaintiff signed the response denying his request for transfer to a flats facility which specifically provided that "I understand my right to file a grievance in accordance with Directive # 4040, 'Inmate Grievance Program.'" (Dkt. No. 83-2.)
Dr. Karandy did not conclude then, or at any time, that Plaintiff was incapable of climbing stairs at Great Meadow. (Dkt. No. 82-6 at ¶¶ 27-28.) When Dr. Karandy saw Plaintiff on September 14, 2014, he determined Plaintiff should [*5]  continue locking on the flats at Great Meadow and utilizing his brace, cane, and TENS unit. Id. at ¶ 28.
Plaintiff was transferred to Fishkill Correctional Facility ("Fishkill"), a medium security facility, on June 4, 2015, as a result of a reduction in his security classification. (Dkt. No. 82-9 at ¶ 9.) Plaintiff's transfer history noted he required a facility with a cell available on the flats. Id. at ¶ 11. Fishkill was found to meet Plaintiff's mental health and medical needs, including his need for a facility that could provide a flats location. Id. at ¶ 13. On June 15, 2015, while at Fishkill, Plaintiff filed a second request for reasonable accommodations in which he referenced his initial request. The request was denied with a finding that Plaintiff's housing should not be above the second floor. (Dkt. No. 83-4.) Again, Plaintiff signed the response denying his request for transfer to a flats facility which provided that "I understand my right to file a grievance in accordance with Directive # 4040, 'Inmate Grievance Program.'" (Dkt. No. 83-4.)
Plaintiff was transferred to Midstate Correctional Facility ("Midstate") on September 29, 2015, in response to his request for an "out [*6]  of hub" transfer. (Dkt No. 82-9 at ¶ 14.) Plaintiff filed a third request for reasonable accommodations on December 2, 2015, while he was housed at Midstate. (Dkt. Nos. 82-8 at ¶ 14; 83-5.) Plaintiff requested transfer to a facility where stairs would not be an issue and steep grades would not make walking difficult. (Dkt. No. 83-5.) The request was granted, and Plaintiff was transferred to Franklin Correctional Facility, where he remained until May 3, 2016, when he was transferred for a brief period to facilities closer to home and released from incarceration on June 27, 2016. (Dkt. Nos. 82-8 at ¶ 19; 82-9 at ¶¶ 16-17; 83-5.)

III. APPLICABLE SUMMARY JUDGMENT LEGAL STANDARDS
Summary judgment may be granted only if the submissions of the parties taken together "show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing, through the production of admissible evidence, that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 272-73 (2d Cir. 2006). A dispute of fact is "genuine" if "the [record] evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving [*7]  party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
Only after the moving party has met this burden is the nonmoving party required to produce evidence demonstrating that genuine issues of material fact exist. Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 272-73. The nonmoving party must do more than "rest upon the mere allegations . . . of the [plaintiff's] pleading" or "simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). "Conclusory allegations, conjecture and speculation . . . are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact." Kerzer v. Kingly Mfg., 156 F.3d 396, 400 (2d Cir. 1998).
A party opposing summary judgment is required to submit admissible evidence. See Spiegel v. Schulmann, 604 F.3d 72, 81 (2d Cir. 2010) ("It is well established that in determining the appropriateness of a grant of summary judgment, [the court] . . . may rely only on admissible evidence.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff's verified complaint is to be treated as an affidavit.4 Colon v. Coughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 872 (2d Cir. 1995) ("A verified complaint is to be treated as an affidavit . . . and therefore will be considered in determining whether material issues of fact exist . . . .") (citations omitted).
In Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005), the Second Circuit reminded that on summary judgment motions "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence [*8]  on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." "To defeat summary judgment, . . . nonmoving parties may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation." Jeffreys, 426 F.3d at 554 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "At the summary judgment stage, a nonmoving party must offer some hard evidence showing that its version of the events is not wholly fanciful." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "[T]o satisfy Rule 56(e), affidavits must be based upon 'concrete particulars,' not conclusory allegations. "Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). "Statements that are devoid of any specifics, but replete with conclusions, are insufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 452 (2d Cir. 1999).
In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 309 (2d Cir. 2008). Where a party is proceeding pro se, the court is obliged to "read [the pro se party's] supporting papers liberally, and . . . interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest." Burgos v. Hopkins, 14 F.3d 787, 790 (2d Cir. 1994). However, "a pro se party's 'bald assertion,' unsupported by evidence, is not sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment." [*9]  Cole v. Artuz, No. 93 Civ. 5981 (WHP) (JCF), 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16832, 1999 WL 983876 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 28, 1999)5 (citing Carey v. Crescenzi, 923 F.2d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1991)).

IV. PLAINTIFF'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH L.R. 7.1(a)(3)
Where, as in this case, a party has failed to respond to the movant's statement of material facts as required by L.R. 7.1(a)(3), the L.R. provides that facts in the movant's statement will be accepted as true (1) to the extent they are supported by evidence in the record, and (2) the nonmovant if proceeding pro se, has been specifically advised of the possible consequences of failing to respond to the motion.6 Champion, 76 F.3d at 486. In light of Plaintiff's failure to respond, the facts set forth in Defendants' statement of material facts pursuant to L.R. 7.1(a)(3) (Dkt. No. 108-6) that are supported by record evidence and are uncontroverted by nonconclusory allegations in Plaintiff's second amended complaint and his affidavit in opposition to Plaintiff's motion, will be accepted as true. See McAllister v. Call, No. 9:10-CV-610 (FJS/CFH), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152785, 2014 WL 5475293, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 29, 2014) (finding allegations in plaintiff's verified complaint sufficient to controvert facts in statement of material facts on motion for summary judgment).
Although this Circuit adheres to the view that nothing in Rule 56 imposes an obligation on a court to conduct a search and independent review of the record to find proof of a factual dispute where a non-movant willfully [*10]  fails to respond to a properly filed summary judgment motion, Amnesty Am. v. Town of West Hartford, 288 F.3d 467, 470 (2d Cir. 2002), the Second Circuit has ruled that "[a] district court has broad discretion to determine whether to overlook a party's failure to comply with local court rules," including local rules relating to requirements regarding the submission of and response to statements of material facts on summary judgment motions, and to "conduct an assiduous review of the record." Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., Inc., 258 F.3d 62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In deference to Plaintiff's pro se status, the Court has opted to review the entire summary judgment record on the Defendant's present motion as well as the record on Defendants' first summary judgment motion in this case.

V. ANALYSIS

A. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies on Plaintiff's Claims under Title II of the ADA
Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim under Title II of the ADA for failure to exhaust.
1. Legal Standard for Exhaustion for § 1983 Claims
Under the PLRA, "[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 . . . by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); see also Ross v. Blake,     U.S.    , 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1854-55, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117 (2016). "[T]he [*11]  PLRA's exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong." Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S. Ct. 983, 152 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2002). "There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court." Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007).
The PLRA requires "proper exhaustion," which means using all steps required by the administrative review process applicable to the institution in which an inmate is confined and doing so properly. Jones, 549 U.S. at 218 (citing Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006)); see also Amador v. Andrews, 655 F.3d 89, 96 (2d Cir. 2011) (exhaustion necessitates "using all steps that the [government] agency holds out, and doing so properly") (internal quotations omitted). In New York State prisons, DOCCS has a well-established three-step IGP. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. ("N.Y.C.R.R.") tit. 7, § 701.5.
First, an inmate must file a complaint with the facility IGP clerk within twenty-one days of the alleged occurrence. Id. § 701.5(a)(1). A representative of the facility's Inmate Grievance Resolution Committee ("IGRC") has sixteen calendar days from receipt of the grievance to informally resolve the issue. Id. § 701.5(b)(1). If there is no such informal resolution, the full IGRC conducts a hearing within sixteen [*12]  calendar days of receipt of the grievance, id. § 701.5(b)(2), and issues a written decision within two working days of the conclusion of the hearing. Id. § 701.5(b)(3).
Second, a grievant may appeal the IGRC's decision to the facility superintendent within seven calendar days of receipt of the IGRC's written decision. Id. § 701.5(c)(1). If the grievance involves an institutional issue (as opposed to a DOCCS-wide policy issue), the superintendent must issue a written decision within twenty calendar days of receipt of the grievant's appeal. Id. § 701.5(c)(3)(ii). Grievances regarding DOCCS-wide policy issues are forwarded directly to the Central Office Review Committee ("CORC") for a decision under the process applicable to the third step. Id. § 701.5(c)(3)(i).
Third, a grievant may appeal to CORC within seven working days of receipt of the superintendent's written decision. Id. § 701.5(d)(1)(i). CORC is to render a written decision within thirty calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Id. § 701.5(d)(3)(ii).
There are special procedures that may be used when, as in this case, the relevant grievances are code 49 involving staff misconduct. Id. § 701.8. A grievance alleging staff misconduct, once it is given a number and recorded, must be sent directly to the superintendent, and the superintendent [*13]  must issue a decision within twenty-five days. Id. § 701.8(f). If the grievant wishes to appeal a decision by the Superintendent to CORC, he must file a notice of decision to appeal with the inmate grievance clerk at the bottom of the Superintendent's decision within seven days of receipt of the decision. Id. § 701.8(h). CORC is required to render a written decision within thirty calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Id. § 701.8(i) (incorporating § 701.5).
As set forth above, at each step of the IGP, a decision must be rendered within a specified time period. "Where the IGRC and/or superintendent do not timely respond, an inmate must appeal 'to the next step,'" assuming there is another step in the IGP. Eleby v. Smith, No. 9:15-CV-0281 (TJM/DEP), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35483, 2017 WL 986123, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2017) (quoting 7 N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.6(g)(2)); see also Smith v. Kelly, 985 F. Supp. 2d 275, 281 (N.D.N.Y. 2013) ("[A]ny failure by the IGRC or the superintendent to timely respond to a grievance . . . can and must be appealed to the next level . . . to complete the grievance process.").
Generally, if a plaintiff fails to follow each of the required steps of the IGP, including receipt of a decision from CORC, prior to commencing litigation, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required under the PLRA. See Ruggiero v. Cnty. of Orange, 467 F.3d 170, 176 (2d Cir. 2006) ("[T]he PLRA requires proper exhaustion, which means [*14]  using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly (so that the agency addresses the issues on the merits.") (internal quotations and citations omitted)).
While the PLRA mandates exhaustion of administrative remedies, it also "contains its own, textual exception to mandatory exhaustion." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858. More specifically, section 1997e(a) provides that only those administrative remedies that "are available" must first be exhausted. 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); see also Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1858 ("[T]he exhaustion requirement hinges on the availability of administrative remedies[.]" (quotations and citations omitted). In the PLRA context, the Supreme Court has determined that "availability" means that "an inmate is required to exhaust those, but only those, grievance procedures that are capable of use to obtain some relief for the action complained of." Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859 (quotations and internal citations omitted).
The Ross Court identified three circumstances in which a court may find that internal administrative remedies are not available to prisoners under the PLRA. Id. at 1859-60. First, "an administrative procedure is unavailable when (despite what regulations or guidance materials may promise) it operates as a simple dead end with officers unable or consistently unwilling to [*15]  provide any relief to aggrieved inmates." Id. at 1859. "Next, an administrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of use." Id. Finally, an administrative remedy is not "available" when "prison administrators thwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation." Id. at 1860.
In Williams v. Corr. Officer Priatno, 829 F.3d 118, 123 n.2 (2d Cir. 2016), the Second Circuit noted that, "the three circumstances discussed in Ross do not appear to be exhaustive[.]" The illustrations of unavailability in Ross nonetheless guide the Court's inquiry. See Mena v. City of New York, No. 13-CV-2430 (RJS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94188, 2016 WL 3948100, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2016).
Because non-exhaustion is an affirmative defense, defendants bear the burden of showing that a prisoner has failed to satisfy the exhaustion requirements. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 216; Johnson v. Testman, 380 F.3d 691, 695 (2d Cir. 2004). Plaintiff must then establish that the IGP grievance procedure was unavailable to him under Ross. Jones, 549 U.S. at 216.
2. Plaintiff's Failure to Exhaust Title II ADA Claims
Claims under Title II of the ADA are subject to the PLRA's exhaustion requirements. See Colón v. New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, No. 15 Civ. 7432 (NSR), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151035, 2017 WL 4157372, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2017); Carlson v. Parry, No. 06-CV-6621P, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44292, 2012 WL 1067866, at *12 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2012) (under the PLRA, ADA claims must be exhausted prior to raising them in federal court); see also O'Guinn v. Lovelock Corr. Center, 502 F.3d 1056, 1061-62 (9th Cir. 2007) (ADA claims are subject to the exhaustion requirements of the PLRA).
According to Plaintiff's original complaint [*16]  and the declaration of Jeffrey Hale ("Hale"), IGP Supervisor at Great Meadows, filed in support of Defendants' summary judgment motion, on October 7, 2014, while he was confined at Great Meadows, Plaintiff filed Grievance GM-58490-14, entitled "Flats facility order." (Dkt. Nos. 1 at ¶¶ 9-10; 82-13 at ¶ 16; 82-14 at pp. 1-2.) The grievance complained of the unsatisfactory modification of Dr. Karandy's recommendation that Plaintiff be sent to a flats facility in response to Plaintiff's July 9, 2014, "Request for Reasonable Accommodation" asking that he be transferred to facility where stairs would not be an issue and he could receive satisfactory medical care. (Dkt. No. 82-14 at 1-3.) The IGRC denied Plaintiff's grievance on or about November 3, 2014, and Plaintiff appealed to the superintendent. (Dkt. No. 82-13 at ¶ 16.)
On December 1, 2014, Plaintiff filed a second grievance, Grievance GM-587348-14, entitled "Wants flats order," in which he made a request identical to the request which had been denied on Grievance GM-58490-14. (Dkt. No. 82-15 at 1.) Grievance GM-587348-14 was denied by the IGRC, which noted in its decision that it had previously denied the identical request in Grievance [*17]  GM-58490-14. Id. at 5. Plaintiff appealed Grievance GM-587348-14 to the superintendent, and the superintendent issued a denial. Id. at 5-6.
Rachel Seguin ("Seguin"), DOCCS Assistant Director of the IGP, also submitted a declaration in support of Defendants' motion. (Dkt. No. 82-1 at ¶ 2.) Seguin is custodian of records maintained by CORC and her duties and responsibilities include maintaining records of appeals of grievances to CORC filed by inmates. Id. at ¶¶ 2, 17. DOCCS policy requires that grievances filed be retained for the current year and four previous years, and the CORC database contains records of all appeals heard and decided by CORC back to 1990. Id. at ¶ 16.
Seguin conducted a diligent search of the CORC records for appeals received at CORC from Plaintiff and has submitted a computer printout of CORC records which reveals that during his entire period of DOCCS incarceration, Plaintiff submitted only two appeals of facility level grievances to CORC, neither of which involved grievances filed by Plaintiff relating to requests for reasonable accommodations at Great Meadow. Id. at ¶¶ 19-20, 25; Dkt. No. 82-3.
Grievance FCF-36934-15, entitled "See Doctor," the first of the two grievances appealed [*18]  to CORC by Plaintiff, was filed on June 22, 2015. (Dkt. No. 82-4 at 4.) Plaintiff complained that the physician assistant he had seen at Fishkill had only given him a thirty day pass from school and work and had told Plaintiff the pass would not be renewed. Id. Plaintiff stated in the grievance that he had gone to sick call three times and asked to see a doctor, and he requested he be allowed to see a doctor due to the physician assistant's failure to provide him with proper medical care. (Dkt. Nos. 82-1 at ¶ 24; 82-4 at 4.)
The grievance did not attach or reference the submission of a request for reasonable accommodation at Fishkill and, according to Seguin, DOCCS Directive #2614 requires an inmate to complete a request for reasonable accommodation, have it processed, and receive a final decision from the deputy superintendent at the facility before pursuing a grievance under DOCCS Directive # 4040. (Dkt. No. 82-1 at ¶ 24.)
Grievance FKN-12524-16, the second of the two grievances appealed to CORC by Plaintiff, was filed on March 1, 2016, and involved burns caused by faulty wiring at Midstate. (Dkt. Nos. 82-1 at ¶¶ 22-23; 82-5 at 5-6.) Therefore, the grievance does not relate to the [*19]  subject matter of this action. Moreover, the only two grievances appealed to CORC by Plaintiff were filed by Plaintiff subsequent to the commencement of this action on February 27, 2015, and, even if they had dealt with reasonable accommodation issues, could not possibly have been exhausted under the IGP prior to the commencement of the action. (See Dkt. Nos. 1; 82-4 at 1-35; 82-5 at 1-23.)
Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied their burden of establishing that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the DOCCS IGP before commencing this action. Moreover, Plaintiff has not submitted evidence that the IGP was unavailable to him, or that he was in any way prevented from filing appeals of Grievances GM-58490-14 and GM-587348-14, which sought identical relief regarding denial of his request for reasonable accommodations, or that appeal through to CORC from the denial of those grievances was unavailable to him.
In his affidavit in opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff states that "Defendants never informed me of any internal procedure I needed to avail myself of in order to be accommodated. I dispute the accuracy and authenticity [*20]  of the declarations and documents submitted by Defendants to the contrary." (Dkt. No. 87 at ¶ 10.) Prior to Ross, 136 S.Ct. at 1856, the Second Circuit suggested that grievance procedures might be found unavailable where an inmate "was not timely provided an inmate handbook" and was therefore "unaware of the grievance procedures contained within it or . . . did not understand those procedures." Ruggiero, 467 F.3d at 178. District courts thereafter considered an inmate's awareness of grievance procedures when determining availability for purposes of exhaustion. See, e.g., Abdallah v. Ragner, No. 12 Civ. 8840 (JPO), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184490, 2013 WL 7118083, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2013) (administrative remedy found unavailable where inmates were not informed a remedy existed). Post-Ross, a plaintiff must show more than mere unawareness of an existing grievance procedure; he must show that he was unaware because, for example, DOCCS personnel were unable or unwilling to make him aware, or prevented him from becoming aware "through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation." Ross, 136 S.Ct. at 1859-60.
The Court finds Plaintiff's bald assertion he was not informed of internal administrative procedures he needed to follow to be accommodated insufficient to establish an issue of material fact regarding the availability of the grievance procedure. See Burgos, 14 F.3d at 790. DOCCS Directive [*21]  # 2614 sets forth a clear multi-step process whereby inmates with physical or mental disabilities may request reasonable accommodations under the ADA. (Dkt. Nos. 82-8 at ¶¶ 4-8.) Directive # 2614 provides that an inmate who is dissatisfied with the decision on his request may file a grievance under the DOCCS IGP set forth in Directive # 4040. (Dkt. Nos. 82-7 at 3; 82-8 at ¶ 9.)
Plaintiff signed the response denying his July 9, 2014, request for transfer to a flats facility which specifically provided that "I understand my right to file a grievance in accordance with Directive # 4040, 'Inmate Grievance Program.'" (Dkt. No. 83-2.) Moreover, Plaintiff's own actions belie his claim of ignorance. Plaintiff pursued the procedure set forth in Directive # 2614. (Dkt. No. 83-2.) Moreover, Plaintiff filed Grievances GM-58490-14 and GM-587248-14 challenging the denial of his request for reasonable accommodation prior to the commencement of this action, thereby demonstrating his awareness of the applicability of the IGP procedures for challenging the denials. (Dkt. Nos. 82-14 at 1-2; 82-15 at 1.) Although Plaintiff did not exhaust those grievances through an appeal to CORC, he demonstrated his [*22]  knowledge of the appeals procedure by appealing Grievances FCF-36934-15 and FKN-12524-16 to CORC. (Dkt. Nos. 82-1 at ¶¶ 19-20, 25; 82-3.)
Based upon the foregoing, the Court recommends that Defendants Annucci, Knapp-David, and Koenigsmann be granted summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Dismissal without prejudice on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies grant of summary judgment is appropriate when "a prisoner who brings suit without having exhausted these remedies can cure the defect simply by exhausting them and then reinstituting his suit." Berry v. Kerik, 366 F.3d 85, 87 (2d Cir. 2004) (Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111-12 (2d Cir. 1999)). Conversely, dismissal with prejudice is appropriate "where a plaintiff is effectively barred from administrative exhaustion." McCoy v. Goord, 255 F. Supp. 2d 233, 252 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); see also Berry, 366 F.3d at 88. Here it has become impossible for Plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies under the DOCCS IGP, as he failed to fully exhaust Grievances GM-58490-14 and GM-587348-14 by appealing to CORC within the requisite time limits and awaiting a decision from CORC on the appeals before filing this lawsuit.7 See 7 N.Y.C.R.R. § 701.5(d)(1)(i); Berkley v. Ware, No. 9:16-CV-1326 (LEK/CFH), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113521, 2018 WL 3736791, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. July 6, 2018) (plaintiff must exhaust administrative remedies, including receipt of a response from CORC, prior to filing [*23]  a federal lawsuit). Because Plaintiff's failure to exhaust is at this point incurable, the Court recommends that the District Court grant Defendants summary judgment for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and that the dismissal be with prejudice.

B. Defendants' Argument for Summary Judgment on the Merits
Defendants also seek summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff cannot establish a claim under Title II of the ADA. Because the Court is recommending summary judgment in Defendants' favor and dismissal with prejudice on failure to exhaust administrative remedies grounds, the Court finds it unnecessary to address Defendants' request for summary judgment on the merits of Plaintiff's claim under the ADA.
ACCORDINGLY, it is hereby
RECOMMENDED that Defendants Annucci, Knapp-David, and Koenigsmann be GRANTED summary judgment (Dkt. No. 82) on the ground that Plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies on his ADA claim, and that the action be DISMISSED with prejudice against Defendants Annucci, Knapp-David, and Koenigsmann; and it is hereby
ORDERED that the Clerk provide Plaintiff with a copy of this Order and Report-Recommendation, along with copies of the unpublished [*24]  decisions cited herein in accordance with the Second Circuit decision in Lebron v. Sanders, 557 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam).
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the parties have fourteen days within which to file written objections to the foregoing report.8 Such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court. FAILURE TO OBJECT TO THIS REPORT WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS WILL PRECLUDE APPELLATE REVIEW. Roldan v. Racette, 984 F.2d 85 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Small v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 892 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1989)); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72.
