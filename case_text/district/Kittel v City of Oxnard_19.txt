CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE AND/OR FOR MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT [34]; DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS [35]
Before the Court is Defendants City of Oxnard and Sylvia Paniagua's (together, "Defendants") Motion to Strike and/or for More Definite Statement re Plaintiff's Second Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Strike Motion"), filed on January 10, 2018. (Docket No. 34). Plaintiff April Kittel filed an Opposition (the "Strike Opposition") on January 22, 2018. (Docket No. 37). Defendants replied (the "Strike Reply") on January 29, 2018. (Docket No. 41).
Also before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Dismissal Motion"), also filed on January 10, 2018. (Docket No. 35). Plaintiff filed an Opposition (the "Dismissal Opposition") on January 22, 2018 (Docket No. 36), and Defendants replied (the "Dismissal Reply") on January 29, 2018. (Docket No. 38).
The Court has reviewed and considered the papers on the Motions, and held a hearing on February 12, 2018. For the reasons discussed below, the Strike Motion is DENIED. [*3]  The Dismissal Motion is GRANTED in part as follows:
• The Motion is GRANTED without leave to amend as to Plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Eleventh Claims, to the extent they are brought on a class-wide basis. To the extent they allege claims on behalf of Plaintiff individually, they survive.
• The Motion is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the Seventh, Ninth, and Thirteenth Claims for Relief.
• The Motion is DENIED as to the Tenth Claim for Relief.
Defendants do not address Plaintiff's First, Second, and Third Claims for Relief against the City in the Motion to Dismiss, so they survive the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff commenced this putative class action on July 24, 2017 in Ventura County Superior Court. (Notice of Removal at 1-2 (Docket No. 1)). Defendants removed the action to federal court on September 12, 2017, after being served with the Complaint and Summons on August 14, 2017. (Notice of Removal at 3). Defendants then promptly moved to dismiss and strike Plaintiff's Complaint. (Docket Nos. 7, 8). Before the Court held a hearing on the motions, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint ("FAC") on October 10, 2017. (Docket No. 16).
On December 6, 2017, the Court granted Defendants' Motion to Strike the FAC to the extent the Motion sought a [*4]  more definite statement pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e). (December 6 Order (Docket No. 32)). The Court ordered Plaintiff to amend the FAC to "streamline the allegations to remove the excessive redundancy, clarify the title and nature of each claim for relief, and simplify which relevant factual allegations are incorporated by each claim." (Id. at 14). Accordingly, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") on December 27, 2017. (Docket No. 33). Defendants then filed the present Motions.
The SAC alleges the following facts, which, for purposes of these Motions, the Court assumes are true and construes any inferences arising from those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See, e.g., Schueneman v. Arena Pharm., Inc., 840 F.3d 698, 704 (9th Cir. 2016) (restating generally-accepted principle that "[o]rdinarily, when we review a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept a plaintiff's allegations as true 'and construe them in the light most favorable' to the plaintiff" (quoting Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 989 (9th Cir. 2009)).

A. Allegations Regarding Plaintiff Personally
Plaintiff is a former Police Records Technician within the Records Unit of the Administrative Services Bureau of the Police Department of the City of Oxnard. (SAC ¶ 20). She brings this action against the City; Plaintiff's former supervisor and [*5]  the manager of the Property and Evidence Unit and Records Unit, Sylvia Paniagua; physical therapy business Advantage Physical Therapy ("APT"); and APT principal Blayne Liparoto. (Id. ¶¶ 11-19).
Since early 2013, Plaintiff has had a physical disability in her wrists and elbows resulting from a pinched ulner nerve and carpal tunnel/cubital tunnel syndrome that causes extreme pain after repetitive upper extremity use, and prevents her from typing continuously without breaks. (SAC ¶ 21). Plaintiff provided to the City documentation from her doctors that restricts her from typing continuously without appropriate breaks. (Id. ¶ 23).
Plaintiff first provided work restrictions from her doctor to the Paniagua and the City on April 16, 2013, which resulted in the City forcing her to sign a Temporary Modified Duty Agreement, expiring on June 21, 2013. The Agreement permitted her to take five-minute breaks after every hour of continuous typing. (SAC ¶ 94). From April 2013 through her constructive discharge in May 2016, Plaintiff repeatedly provided Paniagua and the City with medical documentation of her work restrictions. (Id. ¶ 95).
On August 28, 2013, Plaintiff's doctor ordered more restrictive [*6]  work requirements, after which Plaintiff was immediately suspended indefinitely until she could return to work without any restrictions. (SAC ¶ 96, 110-12). Paniagua was verbally hostile while suspending Plaintiff, and ordered her not to return until her doctor cleared her completely. (Id. ¶ 107). The next day, a representative of Plaintiff's union wrote an email on Plaintiff's behalf to the Director of Human Resources formally requesting a meeting with Plaintiff to discuss accommodations. The City did not respond. (Id. ¶ 108-09).
Plaintiff had various surgeries to correct her disability, resulting in Plaintiff's temporary release from work restrictions in August 2014 and March 2015. (SAC ¶ 97). Paniagua refused to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff for personal reasons from August 28, 2013 to March 2015, and then from September 14, 2015 to the present. Paniagua relied on the City's Modified Duty Policy, which permitted her not to reasonably accommodate disabled employees from more than a specified, short period of time. (Id. ¶ 98). Plaintiff was ultimately suspended for over 18 months, from August 28, 2013 to March 11, 2015. (Id. ¶ 116).
Throughout this period, Plaintiff pleaded with [*7]  the City, Paniagua, other supervisors and management, and ultimately with the City's Human Resources Department to allow Plaintiff to work another assignment in her position as a Police Records Technician that would require less continuous typing. Her position contained several other assignments that Plaintiff was able to do within her work restrictions. (SAC ¶ 99). In response to Plaintiff's multiple requests for reassignment, Paniagua rebuked her for seeking special treatment even though she knew the typing-intensive assignment was causing Plaintiff pain. (Id. ¶¶ 100-01).
On November 13, 2013, Paniagua requested the City's Human Resources Department send an investigator to follow Plaintiff to determine whether she was engaged in activities during her industrial leave in violation of City rules. This request was made to harass Plaintiff and make her working conditions intolerable. (SAC ¶ 118).
Even without reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of the Police Records Technician position and was otherwise fully qualified for the position. (SAC ¶ 102). Other employees in the same position were given assignments with less typing even though they [*8]  were not disabled. (Id.). At no time from April 16, 2013 to the present did the City engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 106, 129).
Throughout the latter part of 2013, and in 2014 and 2015, Plaintiff sought employment elsewhere in the City, applying for five different positions. Although Plaintiff was entitled to preferential treatment as a reasonable accommodation, the City gave her virtually no consideration for the positions. Plaintiff was qualified for all of these positions. (SAC ¶ 119-25, 130-31).
After surgery in July 2014, Plaintiff's doctor released her from all work restrictions. Rather than putting Plaintiff back to work after receiving medical documentation of her release, the City forced her to undergo a Functional Capacity Evaluation ("FCE") at Advantage Physical Therapy ("APT"), the City's chosen healthcare provider. (SAC ¶ 126). After the FCE, Plaintiff requested a copy of the results, but APT and Liparoto denied the request pursuant to an agreement they had with the City to refuse all such requests from City employees. (Id. ¶¶ 60, 127). After the FCE, the City told Plaintiff she would not be reasonably accommodated, and ordered Plaintiff's [*9]  doctor to write work restrictions contrary to the doctor's conclusions. (Id. ¶ 128).
Following another surgery in December 2014, her doctor again released her from all work restrictions in March 2015, and the City forced her to undergo another FCE at APT. (SAC ¶ 132). Again, Plaintiff's requests for the results of the exam were refused. (Id. ¶ 133). Immediately following the second FCE, Plaintiff was brought back to work on March 11, 2015, but Paniagua's harassment and intimidation continued. Plaintiff was once again assigned to a typing-heavy assignment over her objections, though no current medical documentation explicitly restricted her work. (Id. ¶ 134). Paniagua wrote in an email to another supervisor that she "was really hoping [Plaintiff] did not come back!" (Id. ¶ 135).
After two weeks of working the assignment, Plaintiff's disability flared up, and her doctor renewed her work restrictions. Paniagua and the City again suspended Plaintiff, and she did not return until April 6, 2015. (SAC ¶ 136). However, Paniagua soon had Plaintiff enter additional wrongful Modified Duty Agreements. (Id. ¶¶ 138, 145).
When Plaintiff signed her last Modified Duty Agreement on July 22, 2015, Paniagua [*10]  told her it would not be extended past September 14, 2015, after which Plaintiff would have to leave the Police Department. (SAC ¶ 147). When September 14 arrived, Plaintiff was ordered not to return to work, despite the fact that the assignment she had been working did reasonably accommodate her disability. (Id. ¶ 148).
In December 2015, Plaintiff's doctor declared she had reached the maximum improvement with respect to her work-related injury, and that the injury was permanent for the purposes of Plaintiff's worker's compensation claim. In response, the City arranged for Plaintiff to be examined by a Qualified Medical Examiner ("QME"). (SAC ¶ 150). Following the QME, the City held two "reasonable accommodation meetings" in May 2016. However, the City did not engage in good faith in the interactive process during those meetings. The City did not meaningfully suggest reasonable accommodations or other employment in the City that Plaintiff could perform. (Id. ¶¶ 161-80). Ultimately, the City successfully induced Plaintiff to take a disability retirement, constituting a constructive discharge. (Id. ¶¶ 180-82).
Plaintiff alleges that she has exhausted her administrative remedies before [*11]  bringing this action. (SAC ¶¶ 4-10).

B. Allegations Regarding City Policies and Practices
Plaintiff alleges that since 2003, the City has had policies and practices that wrongfully discriminate against disabled employees. (SAC ¶ 27). Since 1974, the City has never engaged in timely, good faith interactive processes to reasonably accommodate its disabled employees. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29). Since 1974, the City has had no policy or practice of reasonably identifying employees whose absence from work might be due to disability; notifying employees of their rights to reasonable accommodations when the City reasonably suspects the employees might need them; or educating employees about their rights to an interactive process. (Id. ¶¶ 30-32). Instead, absent a workers compensation claim, the City puts the burden on the employees to initiate the interactive process and suggest reasonable accommodations. (Id. ¶¶ 33-39).
Since 2003, the City has had a policy, pattern, or practice of forcing employees who present work restrictions from a doctor to enter into a Temporary Modified Duty Agreement with the City pursuant to the City's Modified Duty policy, regardless of the nature of the work restrictions. (SAC [*12]  ¶ 40). The Modified Duty policy, by its own terms, is only applicable to employees who are unable to perform regularly assigned duties. (Id. ¶ 41). The City also has had a practice since 2003 of limiting an employee to a fixed number of days of reasonable accommodation, regardless of the employee's doctor's prognosis or how that prognosis might change. (Id. ¶ 43). The City also imposes a "100 percent healed" or "fully healed" policy on disabled employees through the Modified Duty policy. (Id. ¶ 44). The City has never provided "Permanent 'Modified Duty'" to any disabled employees, even when it was readily available. (Id. ¶¶ 45-46).
The City's written job descriptions, which are used to conduct the interactive process, fail to distinguish between essential and nonessential functions of the positions or to specify how long essential functions are required to be performed. Virtually all of the job descriptions are pretextual and designed to screen out qualified applicants with disabilities. (SAC ¶¶ 58-59).

C. Class Allegations
Pursuant to Federal Rule of 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3), Plaintiff seeks to represent five Classes with multiple subclasses each:
(1) City Disabled Employees Class; [*13] 
(2) City Disabled Employees Class — Discrimination under 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e);
(3) Class of City Employees Subjected to an Employer-Controlled Fitness for Duty Examination;
(4) Class of City Employees Subjected to an Employer-Controlled Fitness for Duty Examination Class — Discrimination Under 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e); and
(5) Class of all City of Oxnard Employees — Discrimination under 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e).
(SAC ¶¶ 61-68). The first two proposed Classes each contain six Subclasses. (Id. ¶ 63, 65).
Plaintiff alleges that the proposed class meets the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements of Rule 23. (SAC ¶¶ 66-91).

D. Claims for Relief
Based on the allegations described above, Plaintiff brings thirteen claims for relief:
(1) Failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA, brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually against the City only (SAC ¶¶ 183-95);
(2) Failure to accommodate in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, § 504,, brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 196-209);
(3) Failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA, brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually against the City only. (Id. ¶¶ 210-223);
(4) Employment discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, § 504, brought by Plaintiff [*14]  on behalf of herself and all similarly situated persons against the City only (SAC ¶¶ 224-34);
(5) Employment discrimination in violation of the ADA, brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all similarly situated persons against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 235-45);
(6) Employment discrimination in violation of FEHA, brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all similarly situated persons against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 246-56);
(7) Employment discrimination in violation of 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e), brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all similarly situated persons against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 257-67);
(8) Failure to engage in interactive process under Cal. Gov. Code section 12940(n), brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all similarly situated persons against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 268-77);
(9) Harassment, intimidation, coercion, and retaliation resulting in personal injuries and constructive discharge in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually against Paniagua only (Id. ¶¶ 278-92);
(10) Harassment, intimidation, coercion, and retaliation resulting in personal injuries and constructive discharge in violation of FEHA, brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually against Paniagua [*15]  only (Id. ¶¶ 293-300) (the Court notes that, in the Opposition, Plaintiff has clarified that, contrary to the title given to this Claim in the SAC, the Claim only addresses harassment (Dismissal Opp. at 22));
(11) Declaratory Relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated against the City only (Id. ¶¶ 301-14);
(12) Denial to Plaintiff of access to the records of her Fitness for Duty Examination in violation of 45 C.F.R. § 164.524(a)(b), Cal. Health & Safety Code sections 123100, 123110, and 123148(a), brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, against Advantage Physical Therapy and Liparoto (Id. ¶¶ 315-23); and
(13) Denial to Plaintiff of access to the records of her Fitness for Duty Examination in violation of Cal. Gov. Code section 12940(n), brought by Plaintiff on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, against the City Only (Id. ¶¶ 324-31).

III. MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendants again move to strike Plaintiff's SAC in its entirety pursuant to Rule 12(f) for failure to comply with Rule 8 and the Court's instructions in the December 6 Order, or alternatively, for a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e). (Strike Mot. at 1). Defendants request that, should the Court permit a Third Amended Complaint, the Court imposed a page limit of 50 pages. [*16]  (Id.).

A. Legal Standards
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that courts "may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). "The function of a 12(f) motion to strike is to avoid the expenditure of time and money that must arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial." Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi—Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). In determining whether to grant a motion to strike, courts must determine whether the matter the moving party seeks to have stricken is (1) an insufficient defense; (2) redundant; (3) immaterial; (4) impertinent; or (5) scandalous. Id. at 973-74. Motions to strike are not favored and "should not be granted unless it is clear that the matter to be stricken could have no possible bearing on the subject matter of the litigation." Colaprico v. Sun Microsystems, Inc., 758 F. Supp. 1335, 1339 (N.D. Cal. 1991). When considering a motion to strike, the court "must view the pleading in a light most favorable to the pleading party," and deny the motion if there is any doubt regarding whether the allegations might be relevant. In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Lit., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 965 (C.D. Cal. 2000).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e) provides that a "party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading . . . which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot [*17]  reasonably prepare a response." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e). Motions for a more definite statement are also disfavored, and are "restricted to situations where a pleading suffers from unintelligibility rather than want of detail." Dri—Eaz Products, Inc. v. Nguyen, No. CV 11-1654, 2012 WL 1537598, at *1 (W.D. Wash. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted); Sagan v. Apple Computer, Inc., 874 F.Supp. 1072, 1077 (C.D.Cal.1994) ("Motions for a more definite statement are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted because of the minimal pleading requirements of the Federal Rules."). "A Rule 12(e) motion is proper only if the complaint is so indefinite that the defendant cannot ascertain the nature of the claim being asserted in order to frame a response." Medrano v. Kern Cty. Sheriff's Officer, 921 F. Supp. 2d 1009, 1013 (E.D. Cal. 2013). If the complaint is specific enough to notify defendant of the substance of the claim being asserted, the motion must be denied. See Bureerong v. Uvawas, 922 F. Supp. 1450, 1461 (C.D. Cal.1996).

B. Discussion
As Defendants acknowledge, the SAC does address many of the instructions in the Court's December 6 Order. (Strike Mot. at 1). For example, the claims for relief, for the most part, no longer have exceedingly long titles referencing a multitude of statutory provisions and case names, and no longer incorporate by reference every single paragraph in the SAC regardless of relevance. Moreover, the SAC is slightly shorter than the FAC. That said, the SAC [*18]  still contains excessive redundancy, resulting a complaint that is far longer than necessary.
Although, as the Court set forth in its December 6 Order, courts do routinely dismiss excessively verbose or redundant complaints for failure to comply with Rule 8, the Court declines to do so here. Despite the repetition and length of the SAC, the allegations are largely relevant, and they are not so confusing that it is impossible to derive the bases for Plaintiff's claims. Cf. Bureerong, 922 F. Supp. at 1461-62 ("While Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint is not always a model of clarity . . . . Defendants' briefs amply demonstrate that they do understand the issues presented by the First Amended Complaint."); Medrano, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 1018 ("[A]lthough the Court agrees that portions of the Complaint are inelegantly pleaded, the nature of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs are intelligible and unambiguous.").
Defendants point to a handful of errors in the SAC (Strike Mot. at 5-6; Strike Reply at 4), which Plaintiff acknowledges to be drafting oversights, as evidence that the Strike Motion must be granted. It does not appear that these oversights have significantly affected Defendants' understanding of the SAC, and in any case, Plaintiff has corrected them in [*19]  writing in the Strike and Dismissal Oppositions, and during the parties' meet and confer.
Accordingly, the Strike Motion is DENIED, and the Court will consider Plaintiff's claims on the merits.

IV. MOTION TO DISMISS

A. Legal Standard
"Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when the complaint either (1) lacks a cognizable legal theory or (2) fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory." Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 959 (9th Cir. 2013)
In ruling on the Motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court follows Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter . . . to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). The Court must disregard allegations that are legal conclusions, even when disguised as facts. See id. at 681 ("It is the conclusory nature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth."); Eclectic Properties E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 996 (9th Cir. 2014). "Although 'a well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof is improbable,' plaintiffs must include sufficient 'factual enhancement' to cross 'the line between possibility and plausibility.'" Eclectic Properties, 751 F.3d at 995 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556-57) (internal citations omitted).
The Court must then determine whether, based [*20]  on the allegations that remain and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, the Complaint alleges a plausible claim for relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; U.S. ex rel. Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 2011). "Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is 'a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.'" Ebner v. Fresh, Inc., No. 13-56644, 2016 WL 5389307, at *2 (9th Cir. Sept. 27, 2016) (as amended) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). Where the facts as pleaded in the Complaint indicate that there are two alternative explanations, only one of which would result in liability, "plaintiffs cannot offer allegations that are merely consistent with their favored explanation but are also consistent with the alternative explanation. Something more is needed, such as facts tending to exclude the possibility that the alternative explanation is true, in order to render plaintiffs' allegations plausible." Eclectic Properties, 751 F.3d at 996-97; see also Somers, 729 F.3d at 960.

B. Discussion

1. Class Claims
First, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's class claims fail to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23 and Local Rule 23-2.2. (Dismissal Mot. at 4). Specifically Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Claims for Relief are all inherently personal to Plaintiff and are not suitable for treatment as class claims. (Id. at 6). Defendants [*21]  also argue that the class claims are time-barred. (Id. at 11).
In the Ninth Circuit, the "plaintiff bears the burden of advancing a prima facie showing that the class action requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 are satisfied or that discovery is likely to produce substantiation of the class allegations." Mantolete v. Bolger, 767 F.2d 1416, 1425 (9th Cir. 1985); Kohler v. Hyatt Corp., No. EDCV 07-782-VAP (CWx), 2008 WL 11342629, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2009) ("Rule 23 does not provide an explicit basis for striking or dismissing class allegations before the filing of a certification motion, but the Ninth Circuit nevertheless has affirmed a trial judge's authority to do so.").
Rule 23's typicality and commonality requirements "tend to merge." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 n.5 (2011). The typicality requirement "limit[s] the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff's claims" General Tel. co. of Nw. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980), while the commonality requirement concerns whether "there are questions of law or fact common to the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). To satisfy these requirements, the lead plaintiff in a putative class action must demonstrate that all of the class members "have suffered the same injury." Dukes, 564 U.S. at 351. "Their claims must depend upon a common contention . . . . of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution — which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that [*22]  is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke." Id. at 350.
Defendants argue that Rule 23's commonality and typicality requirements cannot be met where an employment discrimination claim is based on the employees' physical disability because such a claim inherently requires individualized, fact-driven determinations regarding the employee's disability, qualifications, work restrictions, and type of injury. (Dismissal Mot. at 8-9).
In response, Plaintiff argues that the City's policies and practices are facially discriminatory, and affect Plaintiff as well as the putative class, rendering these claims suitable for class treatment. Plaintiff argues that the class action claims may be litigated pursuant to the "pattern-or-practice framework" articulated in Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977). In that case, the Supreme Court set forth a two-stage framework for class treatment of Title VII pattern-or-practice cases. Id. at 329. Under the first stage, the plaintiff must prove the existence of a discriminatory employment policy. Id. at 360-61. Then, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that plaintiff's prima facie showing is inaccurate or insignificant. Id. If the employer fails to do so, the court concludes a violation occurred and [*23]  enters the second stage to determine the appropriate remedy. Id.
However, as Defendants point out, the framework established in Teamsters has been rejected in the context of private plaintiff class actions under the ADA because of individualized inquiries necessary under the ADA. Hohider v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 183-85 (3d Cir. 2009). In Hohider, the Third Circuit acknowledged that the Teamsters framework might be useful in establishing the existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination, but then noted "[t]hat the existence of the policies alleged by plaintiffs can be adjudicated on a classwide basis, however, does not mean that these policies . . . would amount to a classwide showing of unlawful discrimination under the ADA." Id. at 184. The ADA, not the Teamsters framework, controls the substantive assessment of the elements of a claim. Id. at 185. The Third Circuit determined that the district court erred "to the extent [it] relied upon the Teamsters method of proof to reach a certification decision incompatible with the substantive requirements of the ADA." Id.
Upon concluding the district court erred, the Third Circuit in Hohider held that the plaintiffs' claims could not be adjudicated on a classwide basis because establishing unlawful discrimination [*24]  would require determining whether the class members were "qualified" under the ADA, a determination that "encompasses inquiries . . . too individualized and divergent with respect to this class." Id. at 186.
Likewise, here, the many necessary individualized inquiries necessary render Plaintiff's citation to the Teamsters framework inadequate to render these claims amenable to class treatment. Even if a policy or pattern is proven to exist, the ADA requires a threshold showing that the employees are "qualified individuals." See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(m) ("qualified individual with a disability" is one "who satisfies the requisite skills, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment positions such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position").
There are simply too many individualized inquiries necessary for Plaintiff to possibly meet the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23. See Mantolete, 767 F.2d at 1425 ("Whether a particular individual is a 'qualified handicapped individual' under the law will necessitate an inquiry into the individual's medical and work history as well as an inquiry into other factors bearing on the person's [*25]  fitness for a given position. The district court did not err by . . . dismissing the class action allegations."); Forrisi v. Bowen, 794 F.2d 931, 933 (4th Cir. 1986) ("The question of who is a handicapped person under the [Rehabilitation] Act is best suited to a 'case-by-case determination'"); McCullah v. S. Calif. Gas. Co., 82 Cal. App. 4th 495, 500 (2000) (class action under FEHA untenable because the "question of whether the employer must provide reasonable accommodation involves a case-by-case inquiry").
The allegations of the class claims in the SAC themselves belie Plaintiff's apparent argument in the Opposition that because she is challenging a discriminatory policy, no individualized inquiries will be necessary. For example, Plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Claims for Relief for employment discrimination under § 504, the ADA, and FEHA, respectively, all have titles with the phrase "resulting in constructive discharge". They, and Plaintiff's Seventh and Eighth Claims for Relief, all state that as a result of the City's misconduct, Plaintiff and the class have been "deprived of reasonable accommodation", "deprived of a timely good faith interactive process", and "constructively discharged by the City". The individualized inquiries are plainly stated in the allegations of the SAC.
As Defendants [*26]  point out, the cases Plaintiff cites in support of her argument that the Teamsters framework may be applied here to reserve the individualized inquiries for a later date are distinguishable and inapplicable. (Dismissal Reply at 10). For example, in Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp., 154 F.3d 685, 688 (7th Cir. 1998), former employees filed a class action alleging Excel's medical layoff policy violated the ADA. The district court certified the class on the ground it was only attacking Excel's layoff policy, and, significantly, "was not pursuing plaintiffs' individualized claims." Id. Moreover, the parties agreed that the plaintiffs were "otherwise qualified disabled employees." Id. n.3. Here, there is no undisputed class of qualified disabled employees, and Plaintiff is plainly pursuing her individualized claims.
As the Court stated at the hearing, it is possible to imagine an overarching policy that is so clearly discriminatory on its face that there would be no need to engage in individualized inquiries. But the SAC does not allege that kind of policy here. Rather, it alleges specific acts taken against Plaintiff, allegedly pursuant to a pattern or practice. Plaintiff does not cite to any cases in the Ninth Circuit, or any other circuit, in which the [*27]  Teamsters framework was successfully applied to a class action like this one that is so dominated by individualized allegations.
The Court also notes that the class claims seek relief going back to 1974, over 40 years ago, apparently based on the continuing violations doctrine. (Dismissal Opp. at 18). Plaintiff explains that the applicable statutes of limitations are tolled because the SAC alleges a "systematic policy or practice of intentional discrimination for many years." Id. As Defendants explain, although the continuing violations doctrine can toll the limitations period in some circumstances, "A discriminatory practice, though it may extend over time and involve a series of related acts, remains divisible into a set of discrete acts, legal action on the basis of each of which must be brought within the statutory limitations period." Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1108 (9th Cir. 2002) (Title VII context).
Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2003), is illustrative. In Cherosky, a group of employees sued the Postal Service for denying their requests for respirators four years prior, pursuant to the Postal Service's policy regarding respirators. The employees alleged the denials were in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 1244. The district court concluded the claims were time barred, and the [*28]  Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding:
We conclude that the Employees cannot challenge conduct that occurred prior to the limitations period merely by alleging that the conduct was undertaken pursuant to a policy that was still in effect during the limitations period. Each of the Postal Services denials of the Employees' requests for respirators constitutes a discrete act of alleged discrimination.
Id. at 1248. Thus, Plaintiff's claims, which allege that the class members have been deprived of an interactive process and reasonable accommodation, and therefore constructively discharged, will not be rendered timely to the extent they involve discrete acts in a series, even if those discrete acts were made pursuant to an alleged discriminatory policy.
The class claims are unsuitable for class treatment, and are largely time-barred. Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED in part without leave to amend as to Plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth Claims for Relief, to the extent they are brought on a class-wide basis. To the extent they are brought on behalf of Plaintiff individually, they survive, except as noted below regarding Plaintiff's Seventh and Thirteenth Claims for [*29]  Relief. The Twelfth Claim for Relief is also a class claim, but because it is brought only against Defendants APT and Liparoto, the present Motion does not address it.

2. Seventh Claim for Relief Against the City
Defendants additionally argue that the Seventh Claim for Relief should be dismissed entirely for, among other reasons, being duplicative of Plaintiff's Fourth Claim for Relief. (Mot. at 12-13). The Fourth Claim for Relief alleges employment discrimination in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations against the City. (SAC ¶¶ 224-34). The Seventh Claim for Relief likewise alleges employment discrimination in violation of 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e), as it implements the Rehabilitation Act, against the City. (Id. ¶¶ 257-67). The Seventh Claim does appear to duplicate the Fourth Claim. Plaintiff does not address in the Opposition why the Seventh Claim is different than the Fourth Claim. Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the Seventh Claim for Relief.

3. Ninth Claim for Relief Against Paniagua
Plaintiff's Ninth Claim for Relief is brought by Plaintiff individually against Paniagua under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Defendants argue that this claim fails [*30]  as a matter of law because there is no individual liability for Paniagua under § 504. (Dismissal Mot. at 13).
Indeed, Paniagua cannot be held individually liable under the Rehabilitation Act. Roberts v. Cal. Dep't of Corrections & Rehabilitation, No. EDCV 16-1929-CJC (JCx), 2017 WL 3635175, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2017) (holding § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act "do[es] not encompass public officials sued in their individual capacities"). Cf. Vinson v. Thomas, 288 F.3d 1145, 1156 (9th Cir. 2002) (plaintiff cannot sue state officials in their individual capacities pursuant to Section 1983 to vindicate rights created by Title II of the ADA or § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act). See also Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Ctr. Of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 104 ("Insofar as Garcia is suing the individual defendants in their individual capacities, neither Title II of the ADA nor § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides for individual capacity suits against state officials.").
Plaintiff argues that her Ninth Claim for Relief is based on Paniagua's violation of 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e), "in relation to Plaintiff's rights under §504 against the City." (Dismissal Opp. at 21). However, regulations must be interpreted "so as to harmonize with and further and not to conflict with" the statutes they implement. Barrientos v. 1801-1825 Morton, LLC, No. CV 06-6437-ABC (FMOx), 2007 WL 7213972, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2007). To the extent 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e) implements the Rehabilitation Act, Paniagua cannot be held liable in her individual [*31]  capacity for violation of that regulation.
At the hearing, Plaintiff argued that, as a matter of first impression, this Court should interpret 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e) to create a cause of action under the Rehabilitation Act against Paniagua in her individual capacity because that regulation specifically states, "No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege . . . ." 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e) (emphasis added). Plaintiff argued that the phrase "or other person" suggests an action may be maintained against an individual, not just a recipient of federal funds, under the Rehabilitation Act.
The Court is not willing to stretch the Rehabilitation Act that far, especially in light of the authorities cited above, which clearly state that the Act does not permit plaintiffs to sue officials in their individual capacities. The Motion is therefore GRANTED without leave to amend as to the Ninth Claim for Relief.

4. Tenth Claim for Relief Against Paniagua
Plaintiff's Tenth Claim for Relief is brought by Plaintiff individually against Paniagua for harassment in violation of FEHA. Defendants argue that this claim, too, fails as a matter [*32]  of law because there is no individual liability for harassment where the alleged conduct constitutes ordinary personnel and management decisions. (Dismissal Mot. at 14).
To prevail on a claim for harassment in violation of FEHA, an employee must demonstrate that the conduct complained of was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a work environment that qualifies as hostile or abusive to employees because of" a plaintiff's protected classification. Lyle v. Warner Bros. Television Prods., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2 (2006); see also Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 63 (1996) ("harassment consists of conduct outside the scope of necessary job performance, conduct presumably engaged in for personal gratification, because of meanness or bigotry, or for other personal motives"). "[C]ommonly necessary personnel management actions such as hiring and firing, job or project assignments, office or work station assignments, promotion or demotion, performance evaluations, . . . and the like, do not come within the meaning of harassment. Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 646-47, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 499 (1998).
Some of the conduct alleged against Paniagua constitutes ordinary personnel decisions, such as her decisions regarding work assignments and suspensions. However, Plaintiff alleges that Paniagua verbally abused Plaintiff, and [*33]  continued to assign Plaintiff to typing-heavy assignments despite knowledge that the assignment was causing extreme physical pain to Plaintiff. As Defendants themselves argue, in determining whether an alleged course of conduct is severe enough to state a claim for harassment, "California Courts look to several factors . . . including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." (Reply at 13 (quoting Niami v. Fed. Express Print Servs., Inc., 2010 WL 958045, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2010))).
Plaintiff has alleged that Paniagua was hostile to Plaintiff, verbally abused Plaintiff, and knowingly subjected Plaintiff to painful assignments. At this stage, this is enough to state a claim for harassment. The Motion is therefore DENIED as to Plaintiff's Tenth Claim for Relief.

5. Thirteenth Claim for Relief Against Paniagua
Defendants additionally argue that the Thirteenth Claim for Relief should be dismissed entirely. (Mot. at 12-13). The Thirteenth Claim alleges that the City violated FEHA by conspiring to deny Plaintiff access to the records of her fitness for duty examination. (SAC ¶¶ 324-31). Defendants argue [*34]  that the statute cited does not authorize a private right of action for denial of access to records of fitness for duty examinations.
Plaintiff purports to bring this Claim for Relief under Cal. Gov. Code section 12940(n), which states only that is unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov. Code section 12940(n). As Defendants argue, the statute says nothing about access to medical records. And, to the extent the Thirteenth Claim is actually for failure to engage in the interactive process under section 12940(n), as Plaintiff states in the Opposition (Dismissal Opp. at 25), the Thirteenth Claim for Relief is entirely duplicative of the Eighth Claim for Relief, which is also brought for failure to engage in the interactive process pursuant to section 12940(n).
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the Thirteenth Claim for Relief.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Strike Motion is DENIED.
The Dismissal Motion is GRANTED in part without leave to amend. Considering that Plaintiff [*35]  has had several opportunities to amend, it is apparent that further amendment would be futile. Moreover, even at this early stage in the litigation it is apparent that a class action cannot be maintained based on the allegations of the SAC.
Defendants must file an Answer to the remaining claims on or before March 12, 2018.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
