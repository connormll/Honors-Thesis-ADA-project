Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 31). Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1) alleges Defendant discriminated against him based on his disability, Defendant failed to accommodate his disability, and Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment requests this Court enter judgment as a matter of law and dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The following facts are not in dispute. The legal conclusions derived from the facts are in dispute by the parties.
Plaintiff Dean A. Keller ("Plaintiff") was hired by Defendant Tucson Unified School District ("Defendant"), post-retirement, as a contract math teacher at Sahuaro High School in Spring 2017. In July 2017, Plaintiff had surgery to remove his kidney due to renal cancer. Plaintiff notified Defendant of his diagnosis before his surgery and requested two "Leave of Absence Requests," which were granted [*2]  by Defendant. In August 2017, Plaintiff requested FMLA leave that was denied because he had not accrued sufficient hours to qualify. Plaintiff then requested participation in Defendant's Medical Leave Assistance Program ("MLAP"), which would allow other TUSD employees to donate sick leave. Defendant's MLAP request was also denied. Plaintiff resumed work at Sahuaro High School on September 5, 2017.
In September 2017, Plaintiff presented his story to a local television news station ("KVOA"). See Exhibit E. In an email to KVOA, Plaintiff stated his grievance with Defendant regarding their denial of his MLAP request. Id.
In light of KVOA's involvement, Defendant's Director of Human Resources offered to meet with Plaintiff to discuss his grievances. Exhibit H, p. 1-2. Plaintiff stated, "[a]t this meeting I want to find out how my hours were computed for FMLA purposes as well as who was on the committee that made this decision this school year [with regards to] sick leave bank hours and the FMLA qualification." Id. at p. 3. Ultimately, the meeting did not occur because the scheduled date was not communicated to Plaintiff.
In December 2017, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination ("Charge") with the [*3]  Arizona Attorney General. See Exhibit G. The Charge alleged Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff based on his age and disability when they denied his MLAP request. Id. Plaintiff amended his Charge to claim the refusal of the MLAP request was a denial of a reasonable accommodation. See Exhibit M. In August 2018, Plaintiff's Charge was dismissed by the Arizona Attorney General, and a right to sue letter was issued. See Exhibit N.
On October 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second Charge with the Arizona Attorney General. See Exhibit O. Plaintiff's second Charge claimed Defendant's failure to schedule their planned meeting with Plaintiff, in October 2017, constituted a denial of a reasonable accommodation. Id. The second charge also stated he resigned his position in May 2018 due to Defendant's failure to engage in an interactive process. Id. at p. 2. The Arizona Attorney General also dismissed Plaintiff's second Charge.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate where a party can show, as to any claim or defense, "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment "is to isolate [*4]  and dispose of factually unsupported claims...." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). It is "not a disfavored procedural shortcut," but is instead the "principal tool[ ] by which factually insufficient claims or defenses [can] be isolated and prevented from going to trial with the attendant unwarranted consumption of public and private resources." Id. at 327, 106 S.Ct. 2548. "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). There must be a genuine dispute as to any material fact—a fact "that may affect the outcome of the case." Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.
The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to material fact. Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001). To carry this burden, the moving party need not introduce any affirmative evidence (such as affidavits or deposition excerpts) but may simply point out the absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, 212 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 2000).
This shifts the burden to the non-moving party to produce evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict in its favor. Devereaux, 263 F.3d at 1076. The non-moving party must go beyond the pleadings and show "by [ ] affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions on file" that a genuine dispute [*5]  of material fact exists. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548.
However, the Court is "not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment." Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). Instead, the "party opposing summary judgment must direct [the Court's] attention to specific triable facts." Southern California Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2003).

III. ANALYSIS

a. Timeliness of Plaintiff's Claims
Defendant first argues Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed because the second Charge was untimely and barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
A plaintiff bringing a claim of discrimination must exhaust all administrative remedies before filing suit. Scott v. Gino Morena Enterprises, LLC, 888 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2018). Any claim not brought properly before the EEOC, or like agency, is unexhausted and is therefore barred. Nilsson v. City of Mesa, 503 F.3d 947, 953 (9th Cir. 2007). A claim or charge of discrimination must be filed with the agency "within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1). In the event the agency determines there is "n[o] reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true," the agency is to dismiss the charge and notify the complainant of his or her right to sue in court. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(b), f(1); 29 CFR § 1601.28. Whether or not the agency acts on the charge, a complainant is entitled to a "right-to-sue" notice 180 days after the charge is filed. § 2000e—5(f)(1); [*6]  29 CFR § 1601.28. Within 90 days after such notice, the complainant may commence a civil action against the allegedly offending employer. § 2000e-5(f)(1).
The limitations period prescribed by 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1) operates as a statute of limitations. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393-94, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982). Accordingly, a claim of discrimination will not be sustained if untimely. Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir. 1998). Furthermore, even if a right-to-sue notice is issued by the agency which dismisses the claims on the merits, the issue of timeliness may be litigated later. Boyd v. U.S. Postal Service, 752 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir. 1985) ("The mere receipt and investigation of a complaint does not waive objection to a complainant's failure to comply with the original filing time limit when the later investigation does not result in an administrative finding of discrimination.")
The failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that must be pled and proved by a defendant. Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1168 (9th Cir. 2014). A defendant has the initial burden to prove there is an available administrative remedy and the plaintiff did not exhaust that available remedy. After the defendant has met that burden, the plaintiff must produce evidence showing there is something in his particular case that made the existing and generally available administrative remedy effectively unavailable to him. Id. at 1172.
Plaintiff filed two Charges [*7]  with the Attorney General's Office. In order to be timely, (1) the Charge must be filed with the Attorney General within 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred; and (2) the Complaint in this case must have been filed within 90 days of receipt of the right to sue letter.
Plaintiff received a right to sue letter for his first Charge on August 24, 2018. See Exhibit N. The instant action was commenced over ten months after receipt of the right-to-sue letter, well beyond the 90-day limitation period. Accordingly, any claims contained within the first Charge are time barred in this action by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1).
Plaintiff's second Charge was filed with the Attorney General on October 31, 2018. See Exhibit O. In order to comply with 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1), the alleged discriminatory practice must have occurred within the 300 days preceding the October 31, 2018 filing; thus the alleged discriminatory practice must have occurred between January 4, 2018 and October 31, 2018.
Plaintiff's second Charge contains the following allegations: (1) Defendant became aware of Plaintiff's disability around June 2017; (2) On October 5, 2017 Plaintiff received an email from Defendant's HR department requesting a meeting, but [*8]  that meeting never took place; (3) Between October 2017 and May 2018 Plaintiff repeatedly attempted to request a meeting with Defendant to discuss the interactive process; and (4) On May 25, 2018 Plaintiff resigned due to Defendant's failure to engage in an interactive process.
Plaintiff's date of resignation occurred within the statutory period; however, because his resignation was a subsequent nondiscriminatory act resulting from past discrimination it does not prompt a new violation for purposes of 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1). See Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982 (holding for purposes of determining timeliness of filing of a charge of employment discrimination a new violation does not occur, and new charging period does not commence, upon occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from past discrimination.).
Plaintiff's claim he repeatedly attempted to request a meeting with Defendant to discuss the interactive process "between October 2017 and May 2018," is also not timely. The continuing violations theory allows a plaintiff to pursue an ADA claim for employment practice which began outside the limitations period if he can demonstrate the conduct alleged is part of "an ongoing pattern of discrimination [*9]  effected by the employer." Draper v. Coeur Rochester, 147 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1998). However, the continuing violations theory is inapplicable to discrete discriminatory acts. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). A discrete discriminatory act consists of conduct that "occurred" on the day it "happened," which includes, for example, "termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire." Id. For discrete discriminatory acts, "[e]ach incident of discrimination ... constitutes a separate actionable 'unlawful employment practice.'" Id. As a result, "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." Id. at 113.
Plaintiff has identified one discrete act regarding the failure to engage in an interactive process: Defendant's Director of Human Resources offer to meet with Plaintiff to discuss his grievances in October 2017 and subsequent failure to schedule the meeting. Exhibit H, p. 1-2. In Plaintiff's October 16, 2017 email to Defendant, Plaintiff acknowledged he "assumed" the request for a meeting was withdrawn. Exhibit P. Plaintiff does not allege he ever contacted Defendant again about an accommodation or initiating the interactive process. Plaintiff has not alleged any subsequent violations [*10]  to substantiate an "ongoing pattern of discrimination" which would allow the Court to consider the act outside the statutory period.
In light of the foregoing, the Court finds the claims presented in Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1) are untimely because the second Charge was not filed within 300 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.

b. Equitable Tolling
Plaintiff evidently agrees his claims are not timely, because he makes no arguments defending their timeliness. Instead, the bulk of Plaintiff's response to Defendant's summary judgment motion argues the Court should equitably toll the statutory period prescribed by 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1).
Filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC, or like agency is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to equitable tolling. Zipes, 455 U.S. at 393. However, employment discrimination limitations periods, while guaranteeing the protection of the civil rights laws to those who promptly assert their rights, also protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past. Delaware State College v. Ricks, 101 S.Ct. 498, 449 U.S. 250, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431. Accordingly, equitable tolling is available in "extreme cases," Scholar v. Pac. Bell, 963 F.2d 264, 267 (9th Cir. 1992), and is [*11]  to be "applied only sparingly." Nelmida v. Shelly Eurocars, Inc., 112 F.3d 380, 384 (9th Cir. 1997) (citing Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990). Equitable tolling may be available to a plaintiff who:
(1) diligently pursued his claim; (2) was misinformed or misled by the administrative agency responsible for processing his charge; (3) relied in fact on the misinformation or misrepresentation of that agency, causing him to fail to exhaust his administrative remedies; and (4) was acting pro se at the time.
Josephs v. Pac. Bell, 443 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir.2005) (emphasis added).
Plaintiff fails to allege any misrepresentation by the investigating agency upon which he detrimentally relied. Rather, Plaintiff argues the time investigating his first charge must be tolled because the Attorney General's Office should have investigated "the denial of reasonable accommodations."1 The Court does not agree. There is no basis for Plaintiff's assertion the Attorney General was obligated to investigate claims beyond those contained in the charge. In fact, the Attorney General permitted Plaintiff to timely amend the charge after he mistakenly omitted the allegation.
Plaintiff was also not diligent in pursuing his claim. He admits he received a right to sue letter after the Attorney General's office completed their investigation on the first Charge. The right [*12]  to sue letter included an admonition regarding the 90-day limitation on filing a civil suit stemming from the Charge. Despite receiving the warning in the right to sue letter, Plaintiff failed to file a timely civil complaint stemming from his first Charge.
The Court finds the Attorney General acted properly in their investigation into Plaintiff's two Charges. Plaintiff's noncompliance with the statutory deadlines was due to his own lack of diligence. Accordingly, the Court does not find it appropriate to apply equitable tolling to this case.
c. Reasonable Accommodation and Interactive Process
Although the Court finds Plaintiff's claims untimely here, it further finds the claims would have been dismissed as a matter of law even if they were properly before the Court.
The bases of Plaintiff's claims are, Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation, and Defendant failed to participate in the interactive process. Plaintiff's claims fail because he never made a request for reasonable accommodation or initiated the interactive process.
Plaintiff argues Defendant was aware of his disability and should have assumed he would require an accommodation; however, awareness does not trigger [*13]  an affirmative obligation for Defendant to provide an accommodation or initiate the interactive process. Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001). "The exception to the general rule that an employee must make an initial request applies, however, only when the employer (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation." Id. quoting Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Plaintiff has made no assertion he was unable to request a reasonable accommodation on his own, therefore, Defendant was under no obligation to initiate the interactive process.

IV. CONCLUSION
Plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter for his first Charge on August 24, 2018. See Exhibit N. The instant action was commenced over six months beyond the time limit prescribed in the right-to-sue letter. Id. Accordingly, any claims contained within the first Charge are time barred in this action. Plaintiff's second Charge was filed on October 31, 2018. See Exhibit O. Plaintiff's second charge did not allege any discriminatory practice within [*14]  the statutory period stated in 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(e)(1). Furthermore, equitable tolling is not appropriate in this case because, (1) Plaintiff did not diligently pursue his claim; and (2) an agency misrepresentation did not precipitate Plaintiff's filing errors. Thus, both Plaintiff's first and second Charges are untimely and not actionable. Plaintiff's claims also fail as a matter of law because he did not initiate an interactive process or request a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly,
IT IS ORDERED Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 31) is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. 1) and all claims contained therein are DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court shall docket accordingly and close the case file in this matter.
Dated this 24th day of November, 2020.
