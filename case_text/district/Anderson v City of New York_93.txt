Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
TO: THE HONORABLE GEORGE B. DANIELS, United States District Judge
FROM: KATHARINE H. PARKER, United States Magistrate Judge
Plaintiff brings this [*2]  action for employment discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. ("ADEA"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("Section 1981"), 42 U.S.C. § 1983 ("Section 1983"), the New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"), New York City Admin. Code §§ 8-101, et seq., and Article I, §§ 6, 8, and 11 of the New York Constitution.1 Before me for report and recommendation is a motion by Defendants New York City, New York City Health & Hospitals Corporation ("HHC"), Miriam Carasa, Abdul Mondul, David Nadal, Athena Motal, Milly Toro, Nicole Robinson, and Maria Kazaki-Maher2 (collectively, "Defendants") to dismiss the First Amended Complaint ("FAC") filed by Alexander Anderson ("Plaintiff") pursuant to Rules 4(m) and 12(b)(4), (5) and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("Rules"). For the reasons set forth below, I respectfully recommend that Defendants' motion be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

BACKGROUND

I. The Parties
Plaintiff is an African-American male who has worked professionally with the substance abuse population since 1989. In 2008, Plaintiff became a Credentialed Alcohol and Substance Abuse Counselor ("CASAC"). In 2009, Plaintiff became a New York State Licensed Master Social Worker ("LMSW"). Plaintiff maintains [*3]  that his passion is helping substance abusers. He is currently employed by Lincoln Hospital.
Defendant HHC is a public benefit corporation created under the laws of the State of New York to operate New York City's municipal hospitals. HHC operates a network of hospitals, trauma centers, neighborhood health centers, nursing homes, and post-acute care centers, including Lincoln Hospital, through several health care networks. The individually named Defendants (the "Individual Defendants") all have worked with or supervised Plaintiff at Lincoln Hospital.

II. Plaintiff's Employment With Lincoln Hospital
Plaintiff began working for HHC at Lincoln Hospital on August 2, 2011 as a Social Worker Level I, the lowest level Social Worker.3 His initial assignment was to work in HHC's Program to Address Substance Abuse ("PASA"). PASA is a specialized counseling program designed to diagnose, monitor, and treat alcohol withdrawal. To qualify as a PASA Social Worker, an applicant must be a (1) LMSW or Licensed Clinical Social Worker ("LCSW"), and (2) CASAC certified. Plaintiff contends that he also was responsible for supervising Alex Aleman, a PASA addiction counselor, and Dwayne Murray, a PASA CASAC Counselor. [*4] 
At the time of his hire, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor was Helen Esanbor, who was a Social Worker Level V and the PASA Program Supervisor. Defendant Abdul Mondul, Chief Patient and Safety Officer, oversaw the entire PASA program.
In November 2013, Plaintiff interviewed for a Social Worker Level I position at Lincoln Recovery, a position outside the PASA program. Plaintiff was offered and accepted the position at Lincoln Recovery. When he informed Defendant Mondul of the news, Defendant Mondul offered Plaintiff a promotion to a Social Worker Level II position if he agreed to remain on the PASA team. Plaintiff accepted Mondul's offer. As discussed below, however, the promotion was delayed and not formalized until November 2014.

III. Plaintiff Seeks Promotion
In December 2013, Ms. Esanbor was reassigned. Plaintiff asked Defendant Athena Motal, then Executive Director of Social Services, and Defendant Mondul if he could replace Ms. Esanbor as the PASA Program Supervisor. Plaintiff alleges he had the qualifications and experience to be the PASA Program Supervisor. However, another individual, Defendant Maria Kazaki-Maher ("Maher"), was selected for the position. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant [*5]  Maher is a younger white female social worker who had no experience in the field of addiction treatment and did not meet the pre-requisite of being CASAC certified.
Plaintiff complained to Defendant Motal and Dr. Judith Branch, the PASA Medical Director, that the decision to hire Maher instead of him as PASA Program Supervisor was racially discriminatory. In response to Plaintiff's complaint, Defendant Motal purportedly told Plaintiff that she had given him an outstanding job evaluation, which should help him feel better about not receiving the promotion. Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant Mondul conceded that Plaintiff was qualified to be the PASA Program Supervisor but stated that Plaintiff did not "fit in." Id. ¶ 120.
In January 2014, Plaintiff sought another internal promotion to the position of Social Worker Supervisor Level III in the Psychiatric Mobile Crisis Unit ("MCU"). In March 2014, however, Plaintiff learned that another individual, Jessica Erickson, was hired for the position. Erickson is a younger African-American female. Plaintiff alleges he was more qualified for the position than Erickson because Erickson had less than one year of experience as a LMSW compared to [*6]  Plaintiff's six years of experience, and that Erickson was a temporary employee, not a regular employee like Plaintiff. According to Plaintiff, regular employees are typically given preference over temporary employees for internal promotions.

IV. Plaintiff's 2014 Complaint Concerning A Subordinate
On March 27, 2014, not long after learning that Erikson received the position within the MCU, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to Defendants Mondul, Maher, and Milly Toro, the Associate Director of Social Services of Lincoln Hospital, criticizing his subordinate Aleman's quality of patient care.
The next day, Defendants Maher and Toro met with Plaintiff to discuss Plaintiff's e-mail about Aleman. According to Plaintiff, during the meeting, Defendant Toro advised Plaintiff that Aleman had filed a harassment complaint against Plaintiff in response to learning of Plaintiff's e-mail. Toro also indicated that she viewed Plaintiff's e-mail to be threatening to Aleman and informed Plaintiff that she was relieving Plaintiff of his supervisory responsibility over Aleman. Plaintiff disputed that his e-mail was threatening and complained about the removal of his supervisory responsibility to Defendants Mondul, [*7]  Toro, and Maher, as well as to Dr. Branche, Anette Burwell, a PASA Addiction Counselor, and Melissa Schoir, the former Chief Medical Director of Lincoln Hospital. Plaintiff alleges that in response to his complaint, Burwell stated to Plaintiff, "they don't like the fact that you've been complaining about discrimination." Id. ¶ 159.

V. Plaintiff Seeks Position In MICA Program
In May 2014, Plaintiff expressed interest in the position of Addiction Counselor Supervisor for Lincoln Hospital's Mentally Ill Chemical Abuse ("MICA") program, which was in a psychiatric unit of Lincoln Hospital. Defendants Motal and Nicole Robinson, Director of Behavioral Health Department, interviewed Plaintiff for this position. During the interview, Plaintiff stated that he regretted having had the argument in March with Defendants Toro and Maher about Aleman, and that Motal should consider hiring him for the position because she had discriminated against him and other African-American males by not hiring African-American male supervisors in her department.
Ultimately, Plaintiff did not receive the position. Rather, in June 2014, Plaintiff learned that another individual, Ilana Holowitz, a younger white female, [*8]  had been selected for the position of MICA Addiction Counselor Supervisor. Plaintiff alleges Holowitz was less qualified than he was because she lacked supervisory experience and a CASAC certification.

VI. Plaintiff's Promotion Is Delayed And He Is Denied Requested Vacation And LCSW Supervision
In July 2014, Plaintiff learned that Defendant Motal had attempted to cancel his promotion to Social Worker Level II within PASA due to his allegedly threatening e-mail to Aleman. However, after complaining that the cancellation was retaliation for his complaints about discrimination, Plaintiff received the promotion and his title was changed to Social Worker Level II on November 7, 2014.
At the end of November 2014, Plaintiff alleges that he submitted a request for vacation leave to Defendant Maher but that Maher refused to approve the vacation request in retaliation for Plaintiff's discrimination complaints.
Plaintiff also alleges that between March and September 2014, Defendant Maher discriminated against him by refusing to meet with him to provide the supervision needed to complete his hours to become a LCSW on the ground that she was too busy. He asserts this was a false excuse because she [*9]  found time to meet with one of Plaintiff's female co-workers for this purpose and endorsed his co-worker's LCSW application during this period.

VII. Plaintiff Is Transferred To MICA But Is Denied MICA Supervisor Promotion
On February 12, 2015, Plaintiff expressed interest in another open Addiction Counselor Supervisor position in the MICA program, located in psychiatric unit 10C. However, Defendant Robinson stated the position was not available to Plaintiff.
On February 19, 2015, Plaintiff was informed that he was being involuntarily transferred into psychiatric unit 10C, where he allegedly no longer performed the same type or quantity of substance abuse counseling. His title of Social Worker Level II remained the same, however. The next month, Plaintiff learned that a younger African-American female social worker received the Addiction Counselor Supervisor position in the MICA program.

VIII. Plaintiff's Medical Leave Of Absence
On June 16, 2015, while working in the psychiatric unit 10C, Plaintiff suffered an emotional breakdown at work and was taken to the psychiatric emergency room. On June 19, 2015, Plaintiff's treating psychologist recommended Plaintiff take a medical leave of absence [*10]  from work "because of his overwhelming feelings of emotional distress, anger and anxiety related to manager's discriminatory actions against him." Id. ¶ 257. Plaintiff's leave request was granted and he remained on leave through January 3, 2016. On January 4, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a letter from his medial provider to Lincoln Hospital's Human Resources Department recommending that he be "transferred to another HHC facility to support his recovery and avoid reoccurrences of mental health problems." Id. ¶ 259. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants denied Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation and failed to engage in the interactive process. Nevertheless, Plaintiff returned to work as a Level II Social Worker in the psychiatric unit 10C at that time and remains employed at Lincoln Hospital.

IX. Plaintiff's External Complaints
In early August 2014, Plaintiff informed his union representative that he believed he was being "retaliated against for stating he was victim of discrimination by HHC management." Id. ¶ 190. On August 11, 2014, he filed a grievance against Defendant Motal for cancelling his promotion from Social Worker Level I to Social Worker Level II because he is an African-American [*11]  male.4 On August 25, 2014, he filed another grievance against Defendants Motal, Toro, and Maher asserting that all three had "violat[ed] his rights as a whistleblower" for complaining about his subordinate's poor quality of patient care. Id. ¶ 197. Plaintiff alleges that he filed an Intake Questionnaire with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on September 15, 2014, but that Intake Questionnaire has not been submitted to this Court. He ultimately filed a formal charge of discrimination with the EEOC against Lincoln Hospital on December 10, 2014, and then an amended charge on February 26, 2015, asserting race and sex discrimination and retaliation.

X. Defendants' Alleged Discrimination Against Plaintiff And Other African-American Males
Plaintiff alleges that in addition to not hiring him for the higher level Social Worker positions in the instances specified above, he applied at least 27 times for various other unspecified positions with Defendant HHC between October 24, 2013 and January 2016. Plaintiff also asserts that Lincoln Hospital has not had a male African-American supervisor in thirty years since the 1980s even though qualified African-American males have applied for [*12]  supervisory positions.

XI. The Instant Action
On December 16, 2015, the EEOC issued Plaintiff a Dismissal and Notice of Right to Sue and advised Plaintiff of his right to file a lawsuit. Proceeding pro se, Plaintiff then commenced this action on February 11, 2016 alleging violations of his rights to free speech, equal protection, and due process under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, age discrimination under the ADEA, race, color and sex discrimination, as well as retaliation, under Title VII, Sections 1981 and 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code, and a violation of New York Labor Law § 741(2)(a).
After obtaining counsel, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the FAC) on August 3, 2016 asserting nineteen causes of action for violations of: (1) Title VII based on color, (2) Title VII based on race, (3) Title VII based on sex, (4) Title VII based on retaliation, (5) the ADEA based on age, (6) Section 1981 based on race and color discrimination, (7) Section 1983 under the First Amendment, (8) Section 1983 based on violation of Plaintiff's right to due process, (9) Section 1983 based on violation of Plaintiff's right to equal protection, (10) Sections 1981 and 1983 based on retaliation, (11) the New York State Constitutional right to due process, (12) the New York State Constitutional right to freedom of speech, (13) the New York State Constitutional right to equal [*13]  protection, (14) the NYCHRL for discrimination based on race, (15) the NYCHRL for discrimination based on color, (16) the NYCHRL for discrimination based on gender, (17) the NYCHRL for discrimination based on age, (18) the NYCHRL for discrimination based on disability, and (19) the NYCHRL based on retaliation.
Defendants have moved to dismiss the FAC as against all Defendants for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defendants also have moved to dismiss Defendants New York City and Maria Kazaki-Maher pursuant to Rules 4(m), 12(b)(4) and 12(b)(5) because those parties have not been served a copy of the Summons and Complaint.

DISCUSSION

I. Plaintiff's Voluntarily Dismissed Claims
In response to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his Section 1981 claims (Counts 6 and 10 of the FAC) and ADEA age discrimination claims (Count 5 of the FAC) against all Defendants, as well as his Title VII claims against the individually named Defendants. Thus, those claims should be dismissed with prejudice.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff implicitly abandoned several other claims because Plaintiff failed to address all of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss arguments. Because Plaintiff explicitly dismissed certain claims, the Court [*14]  finds Plaintiff did not intend to abandon the remainder of his claims and analyzes them on the merits below.

II. Legal Standard Governing Motions To Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)
When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322, 92 S. Ct. 1079, 31 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1972); Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, 306 (2d Cir. 2015). To survive the motion, the court must determine whether the complaint contains "sufficient factual matter . . . to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). While detailed factual allegations are not required, the complaint must contain more than mere "labels and conclusions." Id. It must contain more than naked assertions devoid of "further factual enhancement." Id. And, it must contain more than a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Id. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the "plausibility standard" asks for "more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." Id.
In Littlejohn v. City of New York, 795 F.3d 297, the Second Circuit further elaborated on the "plausibility standard" in the context of claims for unlawful discrimination under Title VII. It held that the facts asserted in the complaint [*15]  must "give plausible support to a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation" — the inference needed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the burden-shifting paradigm applicable to Title VII cases under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Id. at 311. However, the court made clear that it is not necessary at the pleading stage for a plaintiff to provide additional facts that would support the plausibility of "the ultimate question of whether the adverse employment action was attributable to discrimination." Id. Of course, some facts in a complaint may go to the plausibility of both a prima facie case of discrimination and the ultimate question of whether there was intentional discrimination. But for purposes of a motion to dismiss, the court's analysis is focused only on whether the facts in the complaint plausibly support a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation, i.e., the level needed as part of the plaintiff's prima facie case of discrimination.
When a motion to dismiss is granted, the usual practice is to dismiss the claims without prejudice and grant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. Hayden v. Cnty. of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 53 (2d Cir.1999); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) ("The court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires."). Leave to amend [*16]  should be granted unless there is evidence of undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice, or futility. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962).

III. Plaintiff's Claims Of Discrimination Under Title VII And The NYCHRL
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled a prima facie case of race, color, or gender discrimination under Title VII. Likewise they claim that Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled a prima facie case of race, color, gender, or age discrimination under the NYCHRL. Accordingly, they seek dismissal of Counts 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17 of the FAC for failure to state a claim.
To establish a prima facie claim of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) membership in a protected class, (2) satisfactory job performance, (3) an adverse employment action, and (4) circumstances surrounding the employment action that give rise to an inference of discrimination. Ruiz v. County of Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 491-92 (2d Cir. 2010). In promotion cases, the second and third elements of the prima facie case are, more specifically, that the plaintiff applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants and was rejected for the position. Lomotey v. Connecticut-Dep't of Transp., 355 F. App'x 478, 480 (2d Cir. 2009). The burden of proving a prima facie case is "minimal." Fisher v. Vassar College, 114 F.3d 1332, 1335 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993)).
The standard for establishing [*17]  a prima facie case of discrimination under the NYCHRL is similar to the Title VII standard, but with some differences. Under the Local Civil Rights Restoration Act of 2005, N.Y.C. Local L. No. 85, courts must construe claims under the NYCHRL independently from similar provisions of federal and state law and "broadly in favor of discrimination plaintiffs, to the extent that such a construction is reasonably possible." See Mihalik v. Credit Agricole Cheuvreux N. Am., Inc., 715 F.3d 102, 109 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Albunio v. City of New York, 16 N.Y.3d 472, 477-78, 947 N.E.2d 135, 922 N.Y.S.2d 244 (2011)). Therefore, there is a lower bar to establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the NYCHRL than under Title VII. Under the third prong of a prima facie case of discrimination under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff need only show that he was treated differently from others in a way that was more than trivial, insubstantial, or petty. Kellman v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 8 F. Supp. 3d 351, 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Similarly, the fourth prong of a prima facie case of discrimination under the NYCHRL is satisfied if a member of a protected class was treated differently than a worker who was not a member of that protected class. Id. at 380. To the extent that a plaintiff states a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, he necessarily states one under the NYCHRL. Taylor v. City of N.Y., No. 15-cv-7454 (RA), 207 F. Supp. 3d 293, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124289, 2016 WL 4768829, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2016).

A. Adverse Employment Actions
Defendants [*18]  argue that most of the acts alleged in Plaintiff's FAC are not adverse employment actions. In response, Plaintiff argues that he suffered multiple adverse employment actions, including (i) being denied promotion to a supervisory title on four occasions, (ii) being denied interviews for supervisory positions 27 times, (iii) being stripped of his supervisory duties, and (iv) being involuntarily transferred from PASA to the psychiatric unit and thereby stripped of his duties related to substance abuse and counseling.
Under Title VII, an adverse employment action is "a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment." Sanders v. NYC Human Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Being denied a promotion unquestionably is an adverse employment action. See Stewart v. City of N.Y., No. 11-cv-6935 (CM), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96998, 2012 WL 2849779, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 2012). But, failure to identify specific open positions for which a plaintiff was qualified dooms a failure to promote claim under both Title VII and the NYCHRL. See Taylor, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124289, 2016 WL 4768829, at *8-9 (dismissing Title VII and NYCHRL failure to promote claims under Rule 12(b)(6) because Plaintiff failed to allege specific instance in which she applied for promotion). Here, Plaintiff's allegations concerning the four specific promotions he sought and was [*19]  denied adequately identify adverse promotion decisions for purposes of both Title VII and the NYCHRL. However, his conclusory allegations that he was denied interviews for 27 unspecified supervisory positions are insufficient to satisfy the second criteria for stating a prima facie claim of discriminatory failure to promote. Therefore, Plaintiff's Title VII and NYCHRL claims with respect to these alleged actions should be dismissed without prejudice to replead and identify the specific open positions to which he applied and was denied.
Like a denial of a promotion, being demoted or stripped of supervisory duties or responsibilities can constitute an adverse action under both Title VII and the NYCHRL. Stewart, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96998, 2012 WL 2849779, at *5 (examples of materially adverse change include "termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation") (internal quotation marks omitted). A job transfer also can constitute an adverse employment action under both statutes if the plaintiff can show that the new work assignment was "materially less [*20]  prestigious, materially less suited to his [or her] skills and expertise, or materially less conducive to career advancement." Bowen-Hooks v. City of N.Y., 13 F. Supp. 3d 179, 214 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). Here, with respect to Plaintiff's March 2015 involuntary transfer to a psychiatric unit, Plaintiff asserts that he was stripped of duties related to substance abuse and counseling, which undermined his "professional focus on substance abuse" and "harmed his professional development as a substance abuse social worker." FAC ¶¶ 239, 245. Given that Plaintiff alleges his new assignment in the psychiatric unit was materially less suited to his expertise as a substance abuse counselor and less conducive to advancement in that field, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled that his transfer to the psychiatric unit constituted an adverse employment action for purposes of Title VII and the NYCHRL. Similarly, Plaintiff's allegation that he was stripped of his supervisory duties likewise is sufficient to establish a plausible adverse employment action. See Vaigasi v. Solow Mgmt. Corp., No. 11-cv-5088 (RMB) (HBP), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42277, 2014 WL 1259616, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2014) (finding plaintiff's allegations of transfer and loss of seniority sufficient to survive 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss). In sum, Plaintiff has alleged [*21]  sufficient facts to plausibly support an inference that he suffered adverse employment actions when he was transferred to the psychiatric unit, demoted, and denied a promotion on four specific occasions.

B. Inference Of Discrimination
Given that Plaintiff has identified a number of adverse employment actions, the Court next must analyze whether, as Defendants argue, the facts pled in the FAC fail to plausibly support a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation with respect to these adverse actions.
"An inference [of discrimination] may derive from a variety of circumstances, including but not limited to: 'the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in ethnically degrading terms; or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group; or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group . . . ." Stewart v. City of N.Y., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96998, 2012 WL 2849779, at *8 (quoting Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994)). Facts that can establish such an inference with respect to a claim of failure to promote include that the employer filled the position with a person outside the protected class who was similarly or less qualified than the plaintiff. See Yu. v. N.Y. City Hous. Dev. Corp., 494 F. App'x 122, 125 n.4 (2d Cir. 2012).
Plaintiff alleges that he was denied promotion to a supervisory title on four occasions. In December [*22]  2013, he asserts that he applied for the PASA Program Supervisor position but was rejected and a younger, less qualified white female was instead hired. In January 2014, he asserts that he applied and interviewed for a Supervisor Level III position but, in March, was rejected for that position and a less qualified, younger African-American female was hired instead. In May 2014, he asserts he applied and interviewed for an addiction counselor supervisor position but was rejected and a less qualified, younger white female was hired instead. Finally, in February 2015, he asserts he applied for a supervisor position but was rejected and a younger African-American female was hired instead. In each instance, Plaintiff sought a specific supervisory position for which he was qualified but an individual outside of his protected class, either white and/or a female, and younger, was hired. Thus, when viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, his allegations plausibly support a minimal inference of discrimination under Title VII and the NYCHRL with respect to these four promotion decisions.5 See Velez v. McHugh, No. 09-cv-0925 (GAY), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20710, 2011 WL 778693, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2011) (it is sufficient to establish this final element of [*23]  a prima facie case of discrimination "where, as here, the plaintiff shows that the position sought went to a person outside his protected class").
With respect to Plaintiff's allegation that he was involuntarily transferred to the psychiatric unit, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts that plausibly could support an inference of discrimination. Although Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Esanbor, Plaintiff's direct supervisor, stated to Plaintiff "you were moved from PASA to 10C because you're a trouble maker," FAC ¶ 238, Plaintiff alleges no facts from which it would be fair to infer that he was labeled a trouble maker because of his race, color, or gender. Nor does Plaintiff point to other employees outside of Plaintiff's protected group who were treated more favorably with respect to transfers. Plaintiff merely alleges the transfer was discriminatory. But "naked assertions of discrimination without any specific factual allegation of a causal link between the defendants' conduct and the plaintiff's protected characteristic are too conclusory to withstand a motion to dismiss." Soloviev v. Goldstein, 104 F. Supp. 3d 232, 249 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Doe v. Columbia Univ., 101 F. Supp. 3d 356, 2015 WL 1840402, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. 2015)).
Similarly, with respect to Plaintiff's allegation that he was [*24]  stripped of his supervisory duties after criticizing the quality of Aleman's patient care, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts suggesting he was removed as a supervisor because of a protected characteristic. Plaintiff's allegation that Geo Joseph, a social worker supervisor who also criticized Aleman's improper conduct but was not disciplined, could plausibly give rise to an inference of discrimination. See Stewart, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96998, 2012 WL 2849779, at *8 (finding more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group can give rise to inference of discrimination). But even if Plaintiff argued this, which he did not, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts establishing that Joseph is in fact outside of Plaintiff's protected class. As a result, the Court cannot draw any inferences of discrimination regarding Plaintiff's transfer and the removal of his supervisory duties from the facts presented.
Indeed, even under the more liberal NYCHRL discrimination standard, "[a] complaint must still allege facts on the basis of which a court can find differential treatment—i.e., the plaintiff was 'treated less well—because of a discriminatory intent.'" Soloviev, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 250 (quoting Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 110). "[D]istrict courts must be mindful that the NYCHRL is not a general civility code. [*25]  The plaintiff still bears the burden of showing that the conduct is caused by a discriminatory motive . . . [i.e.] because of [the protected characteristic]." Id. Plaintiff fails to meet even this more liberal pleading standard with respect to the alleged transfer and being stripped of his supervisory duties because, as discussed above, Plaintiff fails to allege any facts that give rise to an inference of discrimination. Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff has not alleged facts that plausibly support a minimal inference of discriminatory motivation with respect to his transfer and being stripped of supervisory duties.
Finally, Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff has established a prima facie discrimination case, his claims still must be dismissed unless he can show that Defendants' legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons were pretexual. Defendants argue that Plaintiff must allege that "his credentials are so superior to the credentials of the person selected for the job that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the [plaintiff] for the job in question." Abraham v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 398 F. App'x 633, 635 (2d Cir. 2010). Defendants are incorrect in their assertion that Plaintiff [*26]  must demonstrate Defendants' legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual at the motion to dismiss stage. Title VII discrimination claims are assessed using the burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under this framework, a plaintiff has the burden of stating a prima facie case of discrimination, after which point the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate business reason for the adverse employment action. Only at this point does the burden shift to the plaintiff to demonstrate pretext. At the pleading stage, a plaintiff does not need to prove discrimination, or even allege facts establishing every element of a prima facie case; rather, the facts alleged must give "plausible support to the reduced requirements" of the prima facie case. Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 311. Defendants are free to raise this argument again should they file a motion for summary judgment.
Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to plausibly state a claim for discriminatory failure to promote under Title VII and the NYCHRL. The court thus recommends denial of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the FAC with respect to Plaintiff's [*27]  claim of discriminatory failure to promote him to the four positions identified in the FAC, subject to the other restrictions discussed herein. However, for the reasons set forth above, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16 and 17 should be granted without prejudice to replead additional facts with respect to the other alleged adverse employment actions.

IV. Plaintiff's Claims For Retaliation Under Title VII And The NYCHRL
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims of retaliation under Title VII and the NYCHRL, Counts 4 and 19 of the FAC, also should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Here again, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to plausibly support a prima facie claim of retaliation. Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 316.
To state a prima facie retaliation claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must allege (1) participation in a protected activity, (2) defendants' knowledge of the protected activity, (3) an adverse employment action, and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Id. The elements of a prima facie retaliation claim under the NYCHRL differ only in that the plaintiff need not prove any adverse employment [*28]  action; instead, he must prove that something happened that would be reasonably likely to deter a person from engaging in a protected activity. Mayers v. Emigrant Bancorp, Inc., 796 F. Supp. 2d 434, 446 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).

A. Protected Activity
Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in September 2014 when he filed a formal internal complaint of discrimination. They argue that other complaints of discrimination asserted in the FAC post-date alleged retaliatory action, and they appear to overlook Plaintiff's numerous informal internal complaints of discrimination. Protected activity is not limited to a formal internal complaint of discrimination. See Wright v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., 493 F. App'x. 233, 236 (2d Cir. 2012). Title VII "protects employees in the filing of formal charges of discrimination as well as in the making of informal protests of discrimination, including making complaints to management . . . ." Summa v. Hofstra Univ., 708 F.3d 115, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Matima v. Celli, 228 F.3d 68, 78-79 (2d Cir. 2000)). Similarly, under the more liberal NYCHRL standard, protected activity can "include situations where a person, before the retaliatory conduct occurred, merely made clear [his] disapproval of the defendant's discrimination by communicating to him, in substance that [he] thought [the] treatment of the victim was wrong." Mihalik, 715 F.3d at 112 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Here, Plaintiff [*29]  pled that he first complained of race discrimination to Defendant Motal in December 2013 after being denied promotion to PASA Supervisor. He then complained about race and sex discrimination to Defendant Motal in May 2014. He also complained about discrimination and retaliation to Defendants Motal, Toro, and Maher in July 2014 after he learned that Defendant Motal had attempted to cancel his promotion to Social Worker Level II within PASA. On August 7, 2014, Plaintiff complained in a union meeting that he was a victim of discrimination and retaliation. And on August 11, 2014, Plaintiff filed a grievance for race and sex discrimination against Defendant Motal for attempting to cancel his promotion to Social Worker Level II. The next month in September 2014, Plaintiff complained about discrimination to Defendants Carasa, Mondul, and Nadal regarding Defendant Maher's refusal to meet with him for supervision and endorsement of his LCSW application. In October 2014, Plaintiff e-mailed Defendant Carasa requesting the Defendant Motal be investigated for discriminating against him and other African-American males. Also in October 2014, Plaintiff complained to Mr. Williams, Executive Vice President [*30]  of Defendant HHC's Equal Employment Office, about Defendant Carasa's refusal to remedy discrimination against him. In December 2014, Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, which he then amended in February 2015. Finally, in February 2015, Plaintiff also complained internally about discrimination and retaliation after being involuntarily transferred away from PASA into a psychiatric unit as a social worker. Thus, Defendants are incorrect in their contention that Plaintiff did not engage in protected activity. The FAC details numerous formal and informal complaints about discrimination and/or retaliation Plaintiff made between December 2013 and February 2015.

B. Causation
Defendants do not argue that Plaintiff has failed to plead retaliatory adverse actions and, therefore, concede that Plaintiff has satisfied this element of his prima facie case. They argue, however, that Plaintiff's allegations do not plausibly support the fourth prong of Plaintiff's prima facie retaliation case because the allegations do not establish a causal connection, temporally or otherwise, between the protected activity and the adverse employment actions.
Causation can be proven indirectly by [*31]  showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory or retaliatory treatment. See Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000). While there is no "bright line" for determining when temporal proximity is sufficient to plausibly allege causation, courts within the Second Circuit generally have held that "the temporal nexus between the protected activity and the adverse employment action must be three months or less to establish a causal connection." Jackson v. N.Y. State Office of Mental Health, No. 11-cv-7832 (GBD)(KNF), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114531, 2012 WL 3457961, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2012) (collecting cases).
The Court finds that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to plausibly support the forth prong of a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII and NYCHRL. For example, Plaintiff alleges that in December 2013 and January 2014 he complained that Defendant Motal discriminated against him by not promoting him to PASA Program Supervisor because he is an African-American male. Plaintiff then interviewed for a Social Worker Supervisor Level III position in January 2014. In the interview, Plaintiff complained to Lily Hill about Defendants Mondul's and Motal's race discrimination. In March 2014, Defendant Motal rejected Plaintiff for the Supervisor position and hired an allegedly less [*32]  qualified, younger African-American female for the position. Additionally, Plaintiff contends that in March he also was subjected to unfair discipline, stripped of his supervisory duties, and that Defendant Maher began refusing to meet with Plaintiff to supervise and endorse his LCSW application. Then, in May 2014, Plaintiff interviewed with Defendant Motal for the Addiction Counselor Supervisor position. During the interview he complained again about being discriminated against in promotion decisions because he is an African-American male. The next month, Defendant Motal hired an allegedly less qualified Caucasian female for the position. In July, Plaintiff contends his promotion to Social Worker Level II was cancelled. The adverse promotion decisions and other alleged discriminatory and retaliatory acts in the spring and summer of 2014 occurred within less than three months of Plaintiff's complaints about discrimination. Finally, he was involuntarily transferred to the psychiatric unit less than three months after filing a charge with the EEOC. Thus, the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's complaints and the various alleged discriminatory and retaliatory acts is sufficient at [*33]  the pleading stage to support the causation element of Plaintiff's prima facie case of retaliation.
To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to plead a but-for connection between the alleged adverse acts and Plaintiff's protected activity, their argument is premature. While a Title VII plaintiff must show that retaliation was a but-for cause of the retaliatory adverse action, "the but-for causation standard does not alter the plaintiff's ability to demonstrate causation at the prima face stage . . . through temporal proximity." See Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC, 737 F.3d 834, 845 (2d Cir. 2013).6 Defendants' argument, therefore, is not appropriate at this stage of the litigation. See Littlejohn, 795 F.3d at 320. Given the close temporal proximity between Plaintiff's complaints of discrimination and Defendants' alleged adverse employment actions, the Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to plausibly satisfy a prima facie claim of retaliation. Therefore, the Court recommends that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's retaliation claims under Title VII and NYCHRL be denied, and Counts 4 and 19 be allowed to proceed.

V. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Claims
Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the FAC assert various claims under Section 1983. Defendants move to dismiss these claims [*34]  in their entirety. For the reasons set forth below, this Court recommends that Defendants' motion be granted as to all Counts against New York City and HHC, granted as to Counts 7, 8, and 10 with respect to the Individual Defendants, and granted as to Count 9 with respect to Individual Defendants Nadal, Maher, or Toro but denied as to the remaining Individual Defendants.

A. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Claims Against New York City And HHC Under Monell
Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims (Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the FAC) against Defendants New York City and HHC, as well as the Individual Defendants to the extent they are sued in their official capacity, arguing that the FAC falls far short of what is needed to render such claims plausible under the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Monell v. Dep't of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978). As a municipality, New York City is subject to municipal liability. As a public benefit corporation, HHC also is subject to municipal liability. See Rookard v. Health and Hosps. Corp., 710 F.2d 41, 45 (2d Cir. 1983). When a municipality is sued under Section 1983, the plaintiff must show that the challenged acts were performed pursuant to a municipal policy or custom. Monell, 436 U.S. at 690. The plaintiff can do so by showing that "a discriminatory practice of municipal officials was so persistent or widespread as to constitute a [*35]  custom or usage with the force of law, or that a discriminatory practice of subordinate employees was so manifest as to imply the constructive acquiescence of senior policy-making officials." Patterson v. Cty. of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206, 226 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "A claim against a municipal officer acting in his official capacity is equivalent to a claim against the municipality, and is subject to the limitations of Monell." Odom v. Kerns, No. 99-cv-10668 (DLC), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12411, 2000 WL 1229849, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2000).
Here, Plaintiff does not allege that New York City or HHC had a persistent or widespread municipal policy or "custom with the force of law" that served as the catalyst for the alleged discrimination against Plaintiff other than his general and conclusory allegation that there was such a policy. The only assertions arguably related to such a claim are the allegations that "Lincoln Hospital has not had an African-American male supervisor since the 1980's" and that the "failure to promote [Plaintiff] into a supervisory social worker title is consistent with nearly 30 years of discriminatory hiring and promotional practices at Lincoln Hospital." FAC ¶¶ 265, 267. These allegations relate to only one health care facility within HHC and are conclusory at best. [*36] 
Conclusory assertions of a custom or policy are insufficient to state a claim in the absence of allegations of fact tending to support such an inference. Santos v. New York City, 847 F. Supp. 2d 573, 576 (S.D.N.Y.2012) (citing Dwares v. City of New York, 985 F.2d 94, 100 (2d Cir. 1993)). Here, Plaintiff merely alleges that "upon information belief, qualified African-American males had applied for supervisory positions, but were not hired." Id. ¶ 114. He gives no detail in support of this claim. Nor does he assert that HHC or New York City had a specific policy that was implemented by Lincoln Hospital and served as the catalyst for the alleged discrimination against him. Accordingly, the Court finds that the FAC fails to state sufficient facts to plausibly support a Monell claim under Section 1983 against New York City, HHC, and the Individual Defendants in their official capacities. See Ideyi v. State Univ. of N.Y. Downstate Med. Ctr., No. 09-cv-1490 (ENV)(RML), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106370, 2010 WL 3938411, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2010) (dismissing Monell claim under Rule 12(b)(6) because bare allegation that "HHC had a custom or practice of discriminating against plaintiff based on his race and national origin" was mere speculation and insufficient to state a Monell claim). Thus, this Court recommends dismissal of the Section 1983 claims against HHC, New York City, and the Individual Defendants in their official capacities [*37]  without prejudice.

B. Duplicativeness of Plaintiff's Section 1983 And Title VII Claims
Having found that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under Section 1983 against New York City, HHC, and the Individual Defendants in their official capacities, the Court must next analyze whether the FAC plausibly supports a Section 1983 claim against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims must be dismissed as duplicative of Plaintiff's Title VII claims. However, it is well established that individuals cannot be found liable under Title VII. Patterson, 375 F.3d at 221. And, as Plaintiff correctly notes in his brief in opposition to Defendants' motion, it is further well settled that "a § 1983 claim is not precluded by a concurrent Title VII claim, when the former is based on substantive rights distinct from Title VII." Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., 4 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal quotations omitted). Here, Plaintiff bases his Section 1983 claims on alleged violations the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims, which are brought against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities, are not duplicative of his Title VII claims.
Defendants' citation to Davidson v. Lagrange Fire Dist., No. 08-cv-3036 (VB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99452, at *57 (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 2012), is inapposite. In that case, the court did not dismiss the plaintiff's Section 1983 claims [*38]  because they were duplicative. Id. Rather, the claims were dismissed on the merits. Id. The court merely noted that the same facts that failed to support the plaintiff's claims under Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the ADEA also failed to support plaintiff's claims under Section 1983. Id.

C. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Free Speech Claim
Count 7 of the FAC alleges "illegal discrimination in violation of the First Amendment" under Section 1983. Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege a free speech retaliation claim.
In order to establish a First Amendment claim of retaliation, plaintiff must show (1) that he engaged in speech addressing a matter of public concern, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection existed between the speech and adverse employment action, so that it can be said that his speech was a motivating factor in the determination." Cobb v. Pozzi, 363 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 2003). To demonstrate that he engaged in protected speech, plaintiff must plead that he spoke (i) as a citizen, not an employee, and on (ii) a matter of public concern. Matthews v. City of N.Y., 779 F.3d 167, 172 (2d Cir. 2015). "[W]hen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications [*39]  from employer discipline." Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S. Ct. 1951, 164 L. Ed. 2d 689 (2006).
Because Plaintiff did not address this argument in his opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff does not set forth what speech he believes was protected under the First Amendment. Considering the fact that Plaintiff has a separate cause of action (Count 10) for Defendants' retaliation "when [Plaintiff] opposed illegal discrimination by Defendant," FAC ¶ 313, the Court will construe Plaintiff's First Amendment claim as concerning Plaintiff's speech in e-mailing a complaint about his subordinate Aleman. Plaintiff alleges that in March 2014, he e-mailed a complaint concerning Aleman's improper quality of care to Defendants Mondul, Maher, and Toro. In response to the e-mail, Defendant Toro allegedly retaliated against Plaintiff by discharging him as the addiction counselor supervisor and interfering with Plaintiff's promotion to Social Worker Level II.
Plaintiff's e-mail concerning Aleman cannot be considered protected speech, however, because Plaintiff's e-mail was sent pursuant to his official duties. Plaintiff alleges that when Defendant Toro and Maher stated the e-mail was a threat against Aleman, Plaintiff responded that the e-mail was not a threat but rather a complaint [*40]  about Aleman's improper treatment of a patient. Plaintiff "handed Defendant Toro the HHC patient safety policy called Failure to Escalate . . . and read the relevant sections that supported his actions." FAC ¶148. Thus, it is clear that Plaintiff's speech was pursuant to his duties as laid out by the patient safety policy. Where, as here, the speech "'owes its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities,' it can properly be said to have been made pursuant to that party's official duties." Looney v. Black, 702 F.3d 701, 710-11 (2d Cir. 2012). Because the speech at issue is alleged to have been made in the course of Plaintiff's official duties, Plaintiff fails to establish facts to support the first prong of a First Amendment retaliation claim. Thus, the Court recommends dismissal of Count 7 in its entirety as against all Defendants with prejudice.

D. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Due Process Claim
Count 8 of the FAC alleges illegal discrimination in violation of Plaintiff's "due process" rights under Section 1983. The Court construes this as being an alleged violation of due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Defendants argue that Plaintiff's due process claim should be dismissed because Plaintiff does not identify a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest. [*41] 
Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no state may deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. To successfully state a claim under Section 1983 for denial of due process, a plaintiff must establish both the existence of a protected liberty or property interest, and that he or she was deprived of that interest without being afforded sufficient process. Shakur v. Selsky, 391 F.3d 106, 118 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Kentucky Dep't of Corrs. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S. Ct. 1904, 104 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1989)).
Although Plaintiff does not specify his alleged property or liberty interest, construing the complaint broadly, the Court presumes that Plaintiff is referring to his allegations that he was denied a promotion on several occasions, and that Defendants cancelled (but ultimately approved) his promotion to Social Worker Level II, denied his requested vacation days, and involuntarily transferred Plaintiff to the psychiatric unit. However, none of these allegations involve legally protected property interests. See Bertram v. Metro. Transp. Auth., No. 13-cv-338 (RA), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25715, 2014 WL 748933, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2014) ("There is no constitutionally protected right to have, or not have, a specific position with specific duties in a specific location.") (internal quotations omitted); McNill v. N.Y. City Dep't of Correction, 950 F. Supp. 564, 572-73 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (finding vacation preference too insubstantial to warrant the protection of the due process clause); McMenemy v. City of Rochester, 241 F.3d 279, 286 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding civil servants have [*42]  no property interest in promotion, even if promised). Because Plaintiff fails to point to the existence of a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest, the Court recommends dismissal of Count 8 as against all Defendants in its entirety with prejudice.

E. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Equal Protection Claim
Count 9 of the FAC alleges a violation of Plaintiff's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's equal protection claim arguing that Plaintiff fails to allege facts that demonstrate Plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated persons.
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that "no State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1. This is "essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). To state a claim under Section 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States and show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. Feingold v. N.Y., 366 F.3d 138, 159 (2d Cir. 2004). Municipal employees acting in the performance of their duties are considered to be acting under color of state law. Thomas v. N.Y. City Health & Hosps. Corp., No. 02-cv-5159 (RJH), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17694, 2004 WL 1962074, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2004) [*43] . Once an action under color of state law is established, except for the issue of individual liability, a plaintiff's equal protection claim parallels his Title VII claim. Feingold, 366 F.3d at 159. "The elements of one are generally the same as the elements of the other and the two must stand or fall together." Id.
Here, Defendants do not dispute that the Individual Defendants were acting under color of state law with respect to hiring decisions made on behalf of HHC. See Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 89 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding plaintiff's undisputed allegations that individual defendants were acting under color of state law for Section 1983 claim sufficient because each defendant had input into personnel decisions including hiring, firing, evaluations, and discipline of employees); Philippeaux v. N. Cent. Bron1 Hosp., 871 F. Supp. 640, 652 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (finding City hospital employees were acting under color of state law in not hiring applicant for city hospital position, as required for plaintiff's Section 1983 claim.). Additionally, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged discriminatory failure to promote claims under Title VII, as explained above. Accordingly, Plaintiff plausibly states an equal protection claim under Section 1983 with respect to the four specific promotion decisions identified in the FAC. Accordingly, the Court recommends [*44]  Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count 9 of the FAC be denied as against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities, subject to the limitations on individual liability discussed in subsection G below.

F. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Retaliation Claim
Count 10 of the FAC alleges a violation of Section 1983 based on Defendants' retaliation against Plaintiff when he opposed illegal discrimination.7 Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to state a plausible retaliation claim.
As with Title VII discrimination claims, once action under color of state law is established, "the elements of a retaliation claim based on an equal protection violation under § 1983 mirror [the elements of a retaliation claim] under Title VII." Vega, 801 F.3d at 91. For a retaliation claim under Section 1983 to survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must allege facts plausibly showing that defendants acted under the color of state law and took an adverse employment action against him because he complained of or otherwise opposed discrimination. Id.
Because Plaintiff states a claim for retaliation under Title VII, as discussed above, the court finds that Plaintiff also states a claim for retaliation based on an equal protection violation under Section 1983. However, as discussed below, [*45]  the Individual Defendants are subject to qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiff's equal protection retaliation claim. Thus the Court recommends Count 10 be dismissed as against all Defendants in its entirety.

G. Plaintiff's Section 1983 Claims Against The Individual Defendants
Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims against the Individual Defendants because (i) Plaintiff failed to plead that the Individual Defendants were personally involved in the deprivation of Plaintiff's federal rights and (ii) the Individual Defendants are subject to qualified immunity. Because this Court has recommended dismissal of all of Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims except those against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities for alleged denial of equal protection and equal protection retaliation, these arguments are relevant only to what remains of Counts 9 and 10 of the FAC.

i. Personal Involvement
"Personal involvement of defendants in an alleged constitutional deprivation is a prerequisite to an award of damages under Section 1983." Stevens v. N.Y., 691 F. Supp. 2d 392, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting Moffitt v. Town of Brookfield, 950 F.2d 880, 886 (2d Cir. 1991)). To the extent that officials are sued in their individual capacities, a Section 1983 claim will fail if there are no allegations of personal involvement. Stevens, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 400. The type of personal involvement [*46]  necessary to impose individual liability includes situations where "the defendant directly participated in the infarction [sic]" or where "the defendant failed to remedy the wrong after learning of the constitutional violation." Longo v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep't Cty. of Suffolk, 429 F. Supp. 2d 553, 558-59 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). Therefore, Plaintiff must assert personal involvement of each of the Individual Defendants in order to proceed with his Section 1983 claims.
With respect to Plaintiff's equal protection claim for discriminatory failure to promote, in each of the four instances where Plaintiff applied for a promotion but a less qualified applicant outside of Plaintiff's protected class was chosen, Defendants Carasa, Mondul, Robinson, and Motal were alleged to have made or influenced the challenged promotion decisions. There is a dearth of facts in the FAC regarding whether Defendants Nadal, Maher, or Toro made or significantly influenced promotion decisions. Therefore, they should be dismissed as Defendants with respect to Count 9 of the FAC, as Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts that would render their potential liability for discrimination plausible. In contrast, the FAC complaint contains sufficient facts to plausibly implicate each Individual Defendant to the alleged equal [*47]  protection retaliation. For example, Plaintiff alleges that after several complaints about discrimination against him, as outlined above, Defendants Toro and Maher stripped Plaintiff of his supervisory duties, Defendants Toro and Motal attempted to cancel his promotion to Social Worker Level II, Defendants Nadal and Robinson transferred Plaintiff to an undesired position in the psychiatric unit, Defendant Maher refused to supervise and endorse Plaintiff's LCSW application, and that despite Plaintiff's complaints to Defendant Carasa, she failed to remedy any of the alleged discrimination. Accepting these allegations as true and construing the FAC in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is plausible that each Individual Defendant was personally involved in alleged retaliation. However, as discussed below, the Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to alleged equal protection retaliation.8

ii. Qualified Immunity
Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, "government officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional [*48]  rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982) (citations omitted). To be clearly established, "existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate" at the time of the challenged conduct. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 179 L. Ed. 2d 1149 (2011). Even when a plaintiff's federal rights are clearly established, qualified immunity may still bar a plaintiff's suit if it was objectively reasonable for the public official to believe that his acts did not violate the plaintiff's rights. Moray v. City of Yonkers, 924 F. Supp. 8, 11 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).
With respect to Plaintiff's equal protection claim for discriminatory failure to promote, it has long been clearly established that individuals have the right to be free from intentional race and gender discrimination. Griffin v. N.Y., 122 F. App'x 533, 534-35 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding state employee's right to be free from alleged adverse employment actions based on race was clearly established at the time the actions allegedly occurred for purposes of a qualified immunity defense asserted by defendants on employee's § 1983 employment discrimination claims); Back v. Hastings on Hudson Union Free School Dist., 365 F.3d 107, 118 (2d Cir. 2004) ("[i]ndividuals have a clear right . . . to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex in public employment"). Without a factual record to support an argument that the Individual Defendants Carasa, Mondul, Robinson, [*49]  and Motal were reasonable in their belief that their acts did not violate Plaintiff's clearly established right to be free from race or gender discrimination, the Court finds that these Individual Defendants (the only ones remaining with respect to this claim) are not entitled to qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage as to this claim. See Moray, 924 F. Supp. 8 at 12 (denying motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds because preliminary discovery was required to decide whether public officials' belief that terminating employee did not violate his freedom of speech rights was objectively reasonable). Thus, Defendants' motion in this regard should be denied.
On the other hand, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiff's equal protection retaliation claims, because the right to be free from retaliation under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not clearly established in the Second Circuit until September 2015. In Vega v. Hempstead Union Free School District, 801 F.3d at 80, the Second Circuit held that "retaliation claims alleging an adverse action because of a complaint of discrimination are actionable under § 1983." In Vega, the Second Circuit acknowledged "considerable confusion surrounding the viability of retaliation claims under § 1983" because it had "sent [*50]  conflicting signals in this respect." Id. at 80-81. At least one other case within the Southern District of New York has recognized that due to these conflicting signals, it could not be said that the viability of a retaliation claim under Section 1983 was established with reasonable clarity until September 2015. See Warburton v. John Jay Coll. of Criminal Justice of the City Univ. of N.Y., No. 14-cv-9170 (JPO), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87979, 2016 WL 3748485, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2016) (quoting Roland v. McMonagle, 12-cv-6331, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138728, 2015 WL 5918179, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2015)). Because the last retaliatory act alleged by Plaintiff occurred in June 2015, before the law was clearly defined, the Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Plaintiff's equal protection retaliation claims. See Warburton, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87979, 2016 WL 3748485, at *3 (finding Defendants entitled to qualified immunity because the right to be free from retaliation under the Equal Protection Clause was not yet established at the time of the alleged retaliation). Accordingly, Count 10 of the FAC should be dismissed as against the Individual Defendants with prejudice.

VI. Hostile Work Environment Claims
Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII and NYCHRL hostile work environment claims, as set forth within Counts 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 16, and 17 of the FAC, arguing that Plaintiff's allegations do not rise to [*51]  the level necessary to support a hostile work environment claim under either law.

A. Title VII Hostile Work Environment Claim
In order to establish a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must produce enough evidence to show that "the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Demoret v. Zegarelli, 451 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir. 2006). In determining whether a plaintiff meets the "severe or pervasive" standard, courts must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with the plaintiff's job performance. Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 352 F.3d 733, 745 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation marks omitted).
In support of Plaintiff's claim for a hostile work environment, Plaintiff argues that he has dedicated 27 years to working as a substance abuse social worker, and Defendants have created a hostile work environment by transferring him out of the substance abuse unit and failing to provide the supervision necessary for him to become a LCSW. [*52]  Even accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true and construing the FAC liberally, Plaintiff fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting that the hostility in his work environment was objectively severe or pervasive enough to amount to a hostile work environment for purposes of Title VII. For example, in Bowen-Hooks v. City of N.Y., 13 F. Supp. 3d 179, 236 (E.D.N.Y. 2014), Plaintiff alleged that she was subject to a hostile work environment by being assigned to an undesirable unit, being denied a transfer to a desirable location, and being subject to a barrage of disciplinary actions and excessive scrutiny. There, the court found Plaintiff's allegations insufficient to constitute a hostile work environment because the court did not find her change in assignment and denial of a transfer to have had a severe or pervasive impact on her working conditions. Id. And in Murray-Dahnir v. Loews Corp., No. 99-cv-9057 (LMM), 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12973, 1999 WL 639699, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 1999), the court found plaintiff's allegations that: (1) unlike non African-American managers, he was compelled to work extraordinary hours without proper staffing and support; (2) his supervisor ceased direct communication with him and publicly unjustifiably admonished him on numerous occasions; and (3) he received a memo from his supervisor containing [*53]  illegitimate and pretextual criticism, did not amount to a hostile work environment as a matter of law because none of the allegations were objectively hostile. Here, Plaintiff's allegations do not rise to the level of hostility as the acts alleged in Bowen-Hooks v. City of N.Y or Murray-Dahnir v. Loews Corp. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to support the conclusion that he was faced with "harassment . . . of such quality or quantity" that a reasonable employee would find it to be hostile or abusive. Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 148 (2d Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the Court recommends that Plaintiff's Title VII hostile work environment claims be dismissed without prejudice.

B. NYCHRL Hostile Work Environment Claim
The standard for maintaining a hostile work environment claim is lower under the NYCHRL than under Title VII. As mentioned above, the NYCHRL was intended to be more protective than its state and federal analogs. Farrugia v. N. Shore Univ. Hosp., 13 Misc.3d 740, 747, 820 N.Y.S.2d 718 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2006). Under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff need not demonstrate that the treatment was "severe or pervasive" to demonstrate a hostile work environment. Williams v. N.Y. City Hous. Auth., 61 A.D.3d 62, 73-78, 872 N.Y.S.2d 27 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009). Instead, a plaintiff need only show that he has been treated "less well" than other employees because of his protected characteristic. Id. at 78. Here, Plaintiff [*54]  alleges that Defendant Maher was supposed to meet with Plaintiff monthly in order to provide the necessary supervision to become a licensed clinical social worker. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Maher refused to meet with Plaintiff because she was too busy, but met with at least one of Plaintiff's female coworkers for the same purpose. FAC ¶¶ 198-201. While these facts are quite scant, at the pleading stage Plaintiff's allegations plausibly support, though barely, a minimal inference that he was treated less well by Defendant Maher than his younger, Asian, female counterpart. See Donahue v. Asia TV USA Ltd., No. 15-cv-6490 (NRB), 208 F. Supp. 3d 505, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129048, 2016 WL 5173381, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2016) (finding plaintiff's claim insufficient to meet the Title VII pleading standard but holding allegations supported plaintiff's claim that he was treated less well than other employees under the NYCHRL). Thus, the Court recommends that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's NYCHRL hostile work environment claims with respect to gender, race, color, and age be denied as against HHS and Defendant Maher. But, because Plaintiff has failed to allege facts demonstrating that other Individual Defendants treated him less well than other similarly situated employees because [*55]  of his protected characteristics, the NYCHRL hostile environment claim should be dismissed without prejudice as against the other Defendants.

VII. Disability Discrimination Under The NYCHRL
Count 18 of the FAC asserts a claim of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the NYCHRL. Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to state a reasonable accommodation claim under the NYCHRL. To establish a prima facie failure to accommodate claim under the NYCHRL, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he has a "disability" within the meaning of the statute, (2) the employer had notice of the disability, (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation, and (4) the employer refused to make a reasonable accommodation. Vinokur v. Sovereign Bank, 701 F. Supp. 2d 276, 293 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (describing standard under NYCHRL). An employer is required to engage in an interactive process upon notice of the need for an accommodation. Romanello v. Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., 97 A.D.3d 449, 451, 949 N.Y.S.2d 345 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012).
Plaintiff alleges that he was suffering from an2iety and depression from June 2015 through January 2016 while working in the psychiatric unit. After suffering an emotional breakdown and being taken to the psychiatric emergency room for treatment, his doctor recommended that [*56]  he take a medical leave of absence due to overwhelming feelings of emotional distress, anger, and an3iety. Plaintiff was granted leave and, upon returning to work, asserts that he sought the accommodation of a transfer to a different unit. Plaintiff takes issue both with the denial of his request for a transfer and the hospital's failure to engage in the interactive process regarding his requested accommodation.
Defendants first dispute that Plaintiff had a disability within the meaning of the NYCHRL. Under the NYCHRL, "the term 'disability' means any physical, medical, mental or psychological impairment, or a history or record of such impairment" including "a mental or psychological impairment." New York City Admin. Code § 8-102 (emphasis added). This is a very broad definition of the term "disability." Tebbenhoff v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., No. 02-cv-2932 (TPG), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29874, 2005 WL 3182952, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 2005) (characterizing NYCHRL disability definitions as broad). Plaintiff's allegations that he was diagnosed with and granted medical leave for an4iety and other psychological issues and that a doctor recommended certain changes to his job in order for him to return to work are sufficient at the pleading stage to show he had a "disability" within [*57]  the meaning of the NYCHRL.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff does not allege he was disabled after returning from medical leave because he was "in recovery." Plaintiff does, however, allege that upon his return to work, he submitted a letter to the hospital's Human Resources Department about his doctor's recommendation that he be transferred away from the psychiatric unit "to support his recovery and avoid reoccurrences of mental health problems." FAC ¶ 259. Given that Plaintiff provided a letter to HHC from his doctor upon return to work in January 2016, Plaintiff appears to have been under the continuing care of a doctor at the time he returned from leave. Id. The fact that Plaintiff alleges he was in recovery does not mean he was fully recovered. Furthermore, the NYCHRL protects individuals with a history or record of an impairment. See New York City, N.Y., Code § 8-107 (requiring employers governed by the NYCHRL to "make reasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability to satisfy the essential requisites of a job" and defining disability as including a history or record of mental or psychological impairment). Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently pled, at this [*58]  initial stage of the case, that he had a disability with the meaning of the NYCHRL.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff failed to explain in the FAC how a transfer from the psychiatric unit to another facility would allow him to perform the essential functions of his job and to identify a different post where he could have been transferred. In response, Plaintiff asserts that the hospital did not engage in the interactive process that might have permitted such an explanation. At this early stage of the case, this Court cannot say that the FAC fails to plausibly support a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the NYCHRL. See Jacobsen v. N.Y. City Health & Hosps. Corp., 22 N.Y.3d 824, 835, 988 N.Y.S.2d 86, 11 N.E.3d 159 (2014) (finding "employer's response to the employee's request and any ensuing dialogue about the impact of the proposed accommodation on the employer's business inform the determination of whether a reasonable accommodation exists"). Defendants' argument is not appropriate at the pleading stage given Plaintiff's assertion that the hospital failed to engage in the interactive process. Id. at 837; see also Thomson v. Odyssey House, No. 14-cv-3857 (MKB), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125887, 2015 WL 5561209, at *19 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2015) (holding that the NYCHRL requires that an employer engage a disabled employee in a good-faith interactive process to identify [*59]  reasonable accommodations). Further, the NYCHRL "places the burden on the employer to show the unavailability of any safe and reasonable accommodation and to show that any proposed accommodation would place an undue hardship on its business." See Jacobsen, 22 N.Y.3d at 835. Thus, the Court recommends that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count 18 of the FAC be denied as against HHS. However, the Court recommends that this claim be dismissed without prejudice as against the Individual Defendants because the FAC is devoid of specific facts linking any Individual Defendant to the alleged failure to accommodate.

VIII. Plaintiff's State Constitutional Claims
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's due process claims under the New York State Constitution, Counts 11, 12, and 13 of the FAC, must be dismissed because Plaintiff failed to serve Defendants with a notice of claim as required by General Municipal Law § 50-e and because Plaintiff has no private right to suit under the New York State Constitution.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 50-e, in order to litigate a claim sounding in tort against a public corporation like HHC or New York City, a plaintiff is required to serve a notice of claim on the entity within 90 days after the claim [*60]  arises. Gen. Mun. L. § 50-e(1)(a). Under New York law, state constitutional claims are subject to the notice of claim requirement. Mosdos Chofetz Chaim, Inc. v. Vill. of Wesley Hills, 815 F. Supp. 2d 679, 709 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Further, "New York courts will only imply a private right of action under the state constitution where no alternative remedy is available to the plaintiff." Felmine v. City of N.Y., No. 09-cv-3768 (CBA) (JO), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77299, 2012 WL 1999863, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. June 4, 2012).
Plaintiff neither addresses these issues in his opposition to the Motion to Dismiss nor alleges in his FAC that he served Defendants with a notice of claim. Further, there are alternative remedies available to Plaintiff because he states a claim under Title VII, the NYCHRL, and Section 1983. Accordingly, Plaintiff's State Constitutional claims should be dismissed with prejudice. See Alexander v. City of N.Y., No. 02-cv-3555 (TPG), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17042, 2004 WL 1907432, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2004) (dismissing plaintiff's claim against New York City where plaintiff did not refute in his opposition that he did not file a notice of claim); Hershey v. Goldstein, 938 F. Supp. 2d 491, 520 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (dismissing Plaintiff's state constitutional claims where remedies were available under Section 1983).

IX. Statute of Limitations
Defendants move to dismiss part of Plaintiff's Title VII discrimination claims as untimely to the extent they concern conduct that occurred more than 300 days prior to the day Plaintiff filed his charge of discrimination with the EEOC. [*61] 9 They also move to dismiss part of Plaintiff's NYCHRL and Section 1983 claims as untimely to the extent they are based on acts occurring more than three years before Plaintiff filed his complaint.

A. Title VII Statute of Limitations
As a general matter, Title VII's statute of limitations bars claims based on events occurring more than 300 days before filing a charge of discrimination in states like New York where there is a state and/or local employment agency. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1); Riddle v. Citigroup, 449 F. App'x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2011). Plaintiff argues that the 300 days should run from the day he filed an EEOC intake questionnaire on September 15, 2014, which would allow him to pursue Title VII claims based on acts occurring on or after November 19, 2013.
In determining whether an EEOC intake questionnaire constitutes a charge for purposes of Title VII, "it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee." Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402, 128 S. Ct. 1147, 170 L. Ed. 2d 10 (2008). That is, "the filing must be examined from the standpoint of an objective observer to determine whether, by a reasonable construction of its terms, the filer requests the agency to activate its machinery and remedial [*62]  processes . . . ." Id. To examine the EEOC intake questionnaire, the Court must necessarily have access to it. While Plaintiff refers to the EEOC intake questionnaire as an exhibit to the FAC, it appears that the questionnaire was never in fact filed with the Court. Nor is the intake questionnaire attached to any motion papers. Thus, the Court is unable to locate the questionnaire and therefore cannot examine it. In this situation, where a plaintiff has failed to provide the Court with the relevant questionnaire, courts have held that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show a claim was timely. See Scott v. City of Kewanee, No. 13-cv-01292 (SLD), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42582, 2014 WL 1302025, at *3-4 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2014) (dismissing plaintiff's claim as untimely and declining to decide whether plaintiff's intake questionnaire was a charge under Holowecki because the questionnaire was not properly before the court); Vaughn v. Wal-Mart, No. 10-cv-00031 (JLK), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120033, 2010 WL 4608403, at *4 (W.D. Va. Nov. 12, 2010) (same); Rivera v. Prince William Cty. Sch. Bd., No. 09-cv-341 (GBL), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63647, 2009 WL 2232746, at *4 (E.D. Va. July 22, 2009) (same).
Plaintiff also argues that none of his Title VII claims is time-barred because he was subject to an ongoing policy of discrimination constituting a continuing violation. "[A] continuing violation may be found 'where there is proof of specific [*63]  ongoing discriminatory policies or practices, or where specific and related instances of discrimination are permitted by the employer to continue unremedied for so long as to amount to a discriminatory policy or practice.'" Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp, 159 F.3d 759, 766 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting Cornwell v. Robinson, 23 F.3d 694, 704 (2d Cir. 1994)). "Conduct that has been characterized as a continuing violation is 'composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.'" Washington v. Cty. of Rockland, 373 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 111, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted)). A "pattern of 'related discrete acts' [does not] constitute one continuous unlawful employment practice for purposes of the statute of limitations." Chin v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & New Jersey, 685 F.3d 135, 156 (2d Cir. 2012). Such discrete acts may include termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire. Hewitt v. N.Y. City Dep't of Health & Mental Hygiene, 535 F. App'x 44, 45 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting McGullam v. Cedar Graphics, Inc., 609 F.3d 70, 75 (2d Cir.2010)).
Here, Plaintiff's only argument in support of a continuing violation is that the discrimination he suffers from goes back to the 1980s because HHC has not employed an African-American supervisor for nearly 30 years. An employer's choice of who to hire is a discreet act and therefore does not constitute a continuous unlawful employment practice. See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp, 536 U.S. at 114 (identifying refusal to hire as a discrete act for purposes of calculating statute of limitations for Title VII claims). Thus, Plaintiff [*64]  does not sufficiently allege a continuing violation.
In sum, the statute of limitations period for Plaintiff's Title VII claims should be calculated from the date of the EEOC charge filed on December 10, 2014. Accordingly, Title VII claims based on adverse acts occurring before February 13, 2014 should be deemed time-barred.

B. New York City Human Rights Law Statute Of Limitations
Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims are governed by a three-year statute of limitations. Bermudez v. City of N.Y., 783 F. Supp. 2d 560, 573 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); New York City Admin. Code §8-502(d).
Defendants argue that the statute of limitations for Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims runs from the date the Complaint was filed. Plaintiff argues that the NYCHRL statute of limitations is tolled while the EEOC investigates cases. The EEOC maintains work-sharing agreements with state and local Fair Employment Practices Agencies ("FEPAs"), including the New York City Commission on Human Rights, to avoid duplication of work. Under EEOC procedures, when an individual files a charge with EEOC and the charge is also covered by state or local law, the EEOC dual files the charge with the state or local FEPA. This means that the local FEPA, in this case, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, will receive a copy [*65]  of the charge but the EEOC, rather than the local FEPA, will investigate and process the charge. See U.S. Equal Emp't Opp. Comm'n, State and Local Agencies, https://www.eeoc.gov/field/newyork/fepa.cfm (last visited January 9, 2017) (listing the New York City Commission on Human Rights as having a work sharing agreement with the EEOC). Here, Plaintiff expressly requested on the face of his EEOC charge that it be dual-filed with the New York City Commission on Human Rights pursuant to the agencies' work-sharing agreement. Thus, Plaintiff raised his race, color, sex, and retaliation claims under the NYCHRL at the same time, and based on the same facts, as he raised his Title VII claims. He did not raise age or disability discrimination in the EEOC charge, however. The first time Plaintiff asserted age and disability discrimination claims was in the FAC.
Most courts in the Second Circuit have held that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to claims under the NYCHRL is tolled during the period a charge based on the same facts is pending with the EEOC. Although some courts have held otherwise, see, e.g., Collier v. Boymelgreen Developers, 06-cv-5425 (SJ), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25096, 2008 WL 835706, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2008) (collecting cases), the trend in recent decisions has been in favor of [*66]  finding tolling. See Lee v. Overseas Shipping Corp., No. 00-cv-9682 (DLC), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10622, 2001 WL 849747, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2001) (finding the statute of limitations is tolled during the period in which a complaint is filed with the EEOC); Siddiqi v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., No. 07-cv-2740 (CM) (RLE), 572 F.Supp.2d 353, 373 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (same); Esposito v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 07-cv-6722 (RJS), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101460, 2008 WL 5233590, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2008) (same); Butler v. N.Y. Health & Racquet Club, 768 F. Supp. 2d 516, 536 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (same); Morse v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 941 F. Supp. 2d 274, 291-92 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (same); Taylor, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124289, 2016 WL 4768829, at *5 (same). Interests of governmental and judicial economy support the tolling of NYCHRL claims that have been raised in a dual-filed charge. Additionally, there can be no alleged prejudice to the Defendant who is on notice of such claims. The Court thus recommends that the statute of limitations on Plaintiff's NYCHRL claims of race, color, and sex discrimination and retaliation be deemed tolled by virtue of Plaintiff's EEOC charge.
Plaintiff commenced the instant action on February 11, 2016, making NYCHRL claims based on acts occurring before February 11, 2013 untimely. But because of the tolling provision under the NYCHRL, the February 11, 2013 three-year limitations period is extended by the 371 days between the December 10, 2014 filing of Plaintiff's EEOC charge and the December 16, 2015 EEOC Dismissal and Notice of Rights. Thus all race, color, and sex discrimination [*67]  and retaliation claims under the NYCHRL based on acts occurring before February 6, 2012 should be deemed time-barred. See Berlyavsky v. N.Y. City Dep't of Envtl. Prot., No. 14-cv-03217 (KAM) (RER), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133647, 2015 WL 5772266, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2015) (extending the limitations period by the number of days between the date plaintiff filed his complaint with the EEOC and the date the EEOC denied plaintiff's charge.).
The same rationale for tolling does not apply to Plaintiff's NYCHRL age and disability discrimination claims. Plaintiff's EEOC charge did not claim discrimination based on age or disability, and Defendants had no notice of such claims until Plaintiff filed the FAC. Plaintiff's allegations of age discrimination, which arise out of the same conduct as his other discrimination claims, relate back to the date the original complaint was filed (that is, February 11, 2013). Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). Applying the NYCHRL's three-year statute of limitations, New York City Admin. Code §8-502(d), all NYCHRL age discrimination claims based on acts occurring before February 11, 2013 should be deemed time-barred. Plaintiff's NYCHRL disability discrimination claim arises from conduct occurring in 2016 and, therefore, is timely because it was filed well within the three-year [*68]  statute of limitations.

C. Section 1983 Statute Of Limitations
Section 1983 claims are governed by a three-year statute of limitations in New York. Patterson, 375 F.3d at 225. Because Plaintiff commenced this action on February 11, 2016 and the parties do not dispute that Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims are subject to a three-year limitations period, Plaintiff's Section 1983 claims based on acts occurring on or before February 11, 2013 should be deemed time-barred.

X. Punitive Damages
Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's claim for an award of punitive damages arguing that punitive damages are not recoverable against New York City and HHC as municipal defendants, and that the Individual Defendants are entitled to the same protection.
Defendants are correct that punitive damages are not recoverable against New York City and HHC. See City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271, 101 S. Ct. 2748, 69 L. Ed. 2d 616 (1981) ("a municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983"); Garcia v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosps. Corp., No. 15-cv-2119 (DAB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101952, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 2016) (finding punitive damages unavailable against City Defendants for NYCHRL and Title VII claims). Defendants are incorrect in their assertion that Individual Defendants are entitled to the same protection. "Although a municipality itself is immune from a claim for punitive damages, that immunity does not extend to a municipal [*69]  official sued in his individual capacity." New Windsor Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. v. Meyers, 442 F.3d 101, 122 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). At this stage in the action, therefore, it is premature to dismiss the request for punitive damages as against the Individual Defendants in their individual capacities to the extent they remain Defendants with respect to Plaintiff's Section 1983 equal protection and NYCHRL claims. The motion on the claim for punitive damages should be granted in all other respects.

XI. Extension Of Time To Serve The Amended Complaint
Defendants move to dismiss the claims against Defendants Maria Kazaki-Maher10 and New York City pursuant to Rules 4(m), 12(b)(4), and 12(b)(5) because neither party has been served a Summons and Complaint. Plaintiff requests additional time to serve these defendants.

A. Defendant Maria Kazaki-Maher
Plaintiff argues that he should have served Defendant Kazaki-Maher within 120 days after he filed the complaint on February 11, 2016 but that he failed to properly serve her because her last known addressed provided by Defendant HHC turned out to be outdated. In response, Defendants request she be dismissed from this action pursuant to Rule 4(m).
The Court first notes that Rule 4 requires service of a complaint within 90 days after the complaint is filed, not [*70]  120 days. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). Under Rule 4(m), "if a defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period." Id. The plaintiff bears the burden of proof to show he had good cause in not timely serving the defendant. AIG Managed Mkt. Neutral Fund v. Askin Capital Mgmt., L.P., 197 F.R.D. 104, 108 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). "Good cause . . . is evidenced only in exceptional circumstances, where the insufficiency of service results from circumstances beyond the plaintiff's control." Feingold v. Hankin, 269 F. Supp. 2d 268, 276 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). Where good cause is not shown, a court may exercise discretion to grant extensions. Zapata v. City of N.Y., 502 F.3d 192, 196 (2d Cir. 2007).
Plaintiff provides no valid explanation as to why he waited almost five months (from the expiration of time to serve the complaint to the filing of his opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss) to request additional time to obtain the correct address for and serve Defendant Kazaki-Maher. All he states is that the last known address Defendants provided for Kazaki-Maher was not current. See DeLuca v. AccessIT Grp., Inc., 695 F. Supp. 2d 54, 67 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding good cause extension of time [*71]  to serve under Rule 4(m) not warranted where plaintiff was not diligent in rectifying deficient service). Plaintiff does, however, argue that the Court should exercise its discretion in granting Plaintiff an extension to serve Defendant Kazaki-Maher because she will not be prejudiced as discovery has not yet commenced. Defendants do not dispute that Defendant Kazaki-Maher will not be prejudiced by an extension of time to serve her. Thus, the Court recommends that Plaintiff be granted an extension of thirty days to serve Defendant Kazaki-Maher, but only with respect to the claims that remain against her. See De La Rosa v. N.Y. City 33 Precinct, No. 07-cv-7577 (PKC) (KNF), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43197, 2010 WL 1737108, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2010) (granting plaintiff an extension to serve defendant despite lack of good cause for delay). If Plaintiff cannot locate and serve Maher within this time period, the Court recommends that she be dismissed as a Defendant.

B. Defendant New York City
Defendants also seeks to dismiss New York City as a defendant because it has not been served a copy of the Summons and Complaint. Because the FAC was filed in August 2016, the the City should have been served by November 2016. Although Plaintiff claims he was allowed 120 days to serve the Complaint, [*72]  ignorance of the law is no excuse to untimely service. See George v. Prof'l Disbosables Int'l, Inc., No. 15-cv-3385 (RA), 221 F. Supp. 3d 428, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158779, 2016 WL 6779957, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2016) (quoting Feingold, 269 F. Supp. 2d at 276 ("An attorney's ignorance of the rules, inadvertence, neglect, or mistake do not constitute good cause.")). Plaintiff provides no reason for his failure to serve New York City. Nor does he plead any facts that implicate the City specifically in any wrongdoing. See Jackson v. City of N.Y., No. 14-cv-5755 (GBD) (KNF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130386, 2015 WL 5698535, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2015) (dismissing claims against New York City because the "complaint [was] devoid of any allegations against the City of New York"). And, as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a Monell claim against New York City. Thus, any extension of time to serve New York City would be futile. Accordingly, the Court recommends that Plaintiff's request for additional time to serve New York City be denied with prejudice.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, this Court respectfully recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be GRANTED with respect to: (i) Counts 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 as to all Defendants; (ii) Counts 9 as to New York City, HHC, and Individual Defendants Nadal, Maher, or Toro; (iii) Plaintiff's Title VII hostile [*73]  work environment claims within Counts 1, 2, 3 as to all Defendants; (iv) Plaintiff's NYCHRL hostile work environment claims within Counts 14, 15, 16, and 17 as to all Defendants except HHC and Maria Kazaki-Maher (if she is timely served); (v) Count 18 as to all Defendants except HHC; and (vi) Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages as to HHC, New York City, and the Individual Defendants to the extent they have been dismissed as Defendants from Plaintiff's Section 1983 and NYCHRL claims. This Court further recommends that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16 and 17 be GRANTED with respect to the allegations held not to be adverse employment actions, as outlined above. Defendants' motion should be DENIED in all other respects. This Court respectfully recommends Plaintiff's request for additional time to serve New York City be DENIED, but his request for additional time to serve Defendant Kazaki-Maher be GRANTED.
SO ORDERED.
