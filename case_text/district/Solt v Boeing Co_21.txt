Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This action has been filed by the Plaintiff, a former employee of the Defendant, asserting claims for discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. (First Cause of Action). See Complaint.
The Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P., on September 25, 2017. Plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the Defendant's motion on October 10, 2017, to which the Defendant filed a reply memorandum on October 17, 2017. Defendant's motion for summary judgment is now before the Court for disposition.1

Background and Evidence2
Plaintiff testified at his deposition that he started working for a company called Global Aeronautica beginning in 2008.3 The Defendant acquired Global Aeronautica at some point later, while Plaintiff was working there. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 47. Although [*2]  Plaintiff could not recall the dates, he then quit the Defendant's employ at some point to move to Texas to care for his mother. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 63-64. However, on or about June 2, 2012, after he had moved back to Charleston and had worked at Fatz Restaurant for a while, he was rehired by the Defendant. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 64-65; Perry Declaration, ¶ 3.
The Defendant is a global aerospace company that assembles large commercial jetliners in North Charleston. Perry Declaration, ¶ 3. Plaintiff worked as an Assembler B mechanic in Building 20. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 54; Perry Declaration, ¶ 3. Assembler B mechanics are responsible for a wide range of duties, including, among other things, the installation of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electrical systems into the jetliners' interiors and exteriors. Perry Declaration, ¶ 4. Plaintiff testified that his job involved a lot of walking, some climbing, some going up and down stairs, occasional sitting, and continuous standing for some jobs. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 56-57. Plaintiff testified that when he came to work each day, he was assigned a task for that day, and if he finished that task [*3]  prior to the end of his shift, he would receive another assignment. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 54-55. While Plaintiff assisted where he was needed, he testified that he mainly installed airplane passenger doors. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 58; Perry Declaration, ¶ 4. With regard to that job assignment, Plaintiff testified that he sometimes kneeled for a few minutes, sometimes squatted, bent and twisted at his waist, occasionally lay down, rarely reached overhead, occasionally reached shoulder level or below, walked to and from his job, once in a while climbed ladders or work platforms, climbed stairs, did not have to lift any significant weight (maybe a wrench), and said he might have to lift between 10 and 20 pounds occasionally. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 58-60. Throughout his employment, Plaintiff received favorable performance reviews and he was considered a good employee. Perry Declaration, ¶ 7; Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 92.
Christopher Perry, a Production Manager for the Defendant, attests that the position of Assembler B mechanic is a physically demanding job that requires, among several other things, (a) six to eight hours of continuous standing on cement production floors, [*4]  temporary floor panels, ladders or work platforms; (b) up to six hours of reaching overhead; and (c) up to three hours of walking on cement floors and temporary floor panels, as well as climbing ladders, kneeling, crawling, squatting, stooping, bending, and lifting more than 25 pounds. Perry Declaration, ¶ 5.4 Perry also attests that while the doors team, which Plaintiff belonged to, was not required to crawl, the mechanics on that team are required to lay down, kneel, squat, reach, climb, stand, and walk for most of the shift. Perry attests that more than half of the work completed by the doors team must be completed below waist level. Perry attests that if an Assembler B mechanic cannot perform the physically demanding and often varying aspects of the job, they cannot perform the essential functions of that position. Perry Declaration, ¶ 6.
Plaintiff was diagnosed in early 2014 with a vascular necrosis, which resulted in excruciating sharp pains that would prevent him from putting weight on his legs. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 80-81. Plaintiff testified that the pain was not constant, but would come and go. Plaintiff saw [*5]  Dr. Marshall Hay, an orthopaedic surgeon, for his condition, and Dr. Hay performed surgeries in March and June of 2014, replacing both of Plaintiff's hips. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 79. In anticipation of Plaintiff's hip replacement surgeries, in early 2014 Dr. Hay placed Plaintiff on temporary medical restrictions that 1) limited his walking, climbing stairs, bending, and kneeling to an hour a day or less per shift, 2) prohibited squatting, crawling and climbing ladders, and 3) allowed only occasional standing. Hay Deposition, p. 8; Exhibits 3 and 4. As these restrictions precluded Plaintiff from working at his regular job, he was provided some light work jobs to perform. Davis Deposition, pp. 19, 41-43; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 98-99. Plaintiff was eventually approved for a leave of absence in February, 2014, which continued to September 11, 2014. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 100; Davis Deposition, pp. 41-43, Defendant''s Exhibits 1 and 2; see also Defendant's Exhibit G. As a result, Plaintiff filed at least one claim for short-term disability benefits and at least one claim for long term benefits with the Defendant, and received benefits both times. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. [*6]  37-40. While Plaintiff could not recall the specific dates,5 he testified that he received long-term benefits after his first hip replacement surgery in March 2014. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 41.
The evidence shows that following Plaintiff's initial hip surgery on March 4, 2014, Dr. Hay completed a Return to Work form for the Plaintiff that stated Plaintiff was medically unable to work from 3-14-14 through 6-9-14. Dr. Hay placed the following limitations on the Plaintiff during that time: prohibited from crawling, limited kneeling, and prohibited from climbing ladders. Hay Deposition, p. 15. Plaintiff"s second hip surgery was completed on June 10, 2014, and Plaintiff thereafter remained on approved medical leave until September 11, 2014, when Dr. Hay medically cleared him to return to full duty without any limitations or medical restrictions. Plaintiff then resumed his work as an Assembler B mechanic. Hay Deposition, pp. 15-16, 22-23; Exhibit 13; Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 101; Davis Deposition, pp. 41-43.
However, after being back at work for approximately one (1) month, Plaintiff went to the Defendant's Medical office complaining that he was experiencing [*7]  pain in his knees and stating that he was trying to get in touch with his physician. The Defendant's nurse sent Plaintiff home for the remainder of the shift to allow him to follow up with his physician. See Defendant's Exhibit H. On October 6, 2014, Dr. Hay completed a return to work/functional capacities form providing some temporary 2 month restrictions for the Plaintiff, as follows: 1-3 hours (occasional) bending and kneeling, 0-1 hour (limited) crawling, squatting, and climbing stairs and ladders. Hay Deposition, p. 22; see also Court Docket No. 25-3, p. 2. The next day, October 7, 2014, David Keller, a nurse in the Defendant's Health Services, sent an email to Plaintiff's managers stating that Plaintiff had received a Boeing Medical Restriction and/or Return to Work clearance. See Court Docket No. 24-6, pp. 90-91; see also Davis Deposition, p. 29. Plaintiff's temporary restrictions were communicated to the Plaintiff; his then-current manager, Martin Crandall6; DMRs Davis, Watson, and Timothy Brandon; and to the Defendant's Accommodation Services. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 107-110; Exhibit 4.
Plaintiff's temporary restrictions did not include any limitations on Plaintiff's walking [*8]  or standing, or preclude any other activities, and Plaintiff testified that after he submitted his return to work form in October 2014, he continued to work as an Assembler B and report to Mr. Perry. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 110. Plaintiff testified that during this two month period he performed work in excess of the temporary limitations listed on the October 6, 2014 form, although other than speaking to Perry, he has no recollection of making any complaints or of making any requests for accommodations for the work assigned to him. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 107-110, 148, 150-151, 154. At the expiration of the temporary two month medical restrictions from Dr. Hay, Plaintiff returned to full duty as an Assembler B without medical restrictions or other limitations. Plaintiff thereafter performed his regular job from December 7, 2014, to July 8, 2015. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 108-111; Hay Deposition, pp. 23-24.
However, on July 9, 2015, Dr. Edward M. Newton (Plaintiff's family physician) completed a new return to work/functional capacities form for the Plaintiff. This form set forth the following permanent work restrictions for the Plaintiff: 0-1 hour (limited) standing and walking, [*9]  and prohibited certain activities including lifting/carrying 25 to 50 lbs., bending, kneeling, crawling, squatting, climbing stairs, and climbing ladders. See Court Docket No. 25-4, p. 2. Plaintiff submitted this return to work form to the Defendant; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 112-113; and on July 10, 2015, Melody Nelson sent a notice of these restrictions to Plaintiff, Daniel George7; DMRs Davis, Brandon and Watson; and to Boeing Accommodation Services. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 116-118, Exhibit 6; Davis Deposition, pp. 28-30; Court Docket No. 24-6, pp. 93-94. On July 24, 2015, DMR Lisa Davis met with Plaintiff; George;8 Pearline Peterson, the Reassignment focal; and Sonya Ramirez, a Human Resource Generalist, to discuss Plaintiff's now permanent medical restrictions, the physical aspects of Plaintiff's position as an Assembler B mechanic, and whether there were any feasible accommodations that would allow Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job in light of his permanent restrictions. Davis Deposition, pp. 25-28; 44-49; Defendant's Exhibit 3; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 118-123. Defendant contends that there were no reasonable accommodations which would have allowed [*10]  Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of his job, so at that point Davis explained to the Plaintiff that he would have to explore reassignment as a reasonable accommodation. For his part, Plaintiff testified he does not recall the specific details of their conversation. Davis Deposition, pp. 31-33; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 119-120. Although the Defendant provided Plaintiff with some temporary light duty work for a few days following the issuance of these permanent restrictions, Defendant contends that it had no long term (i.e. permanent) light duty assignments available, so Plaintiff was ultimately sent home. Plaintiff believes it was Davis who called him in and told him to go home. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 95.
Plaintiff testified that he did not recall working with Davis with regard to any accommodations, and when asked if he recalled talking with Davis about things that could be done or not done with regard to his job and his performance of his job, Plaintiff testified that he did not recall those conversations, although he affirmed that those conversations may have occurred. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 95-96, 120-121. For her part, Davis testified that [*11]  she explained to Plaintiff that he would work with Pearline Peterson, the Reassignment focal, to seek any available reassignment since he could no longer perform his job. Davis Deposition, pp. 31-33. Further, although Plaintiff's last day of being present at the workplace was in July 2015, as an accommodation provided by the Defendant, Plaintiff thereafter remained an employee on inactive status/approved leave for approximately nineteen (19) months, and was eligible for long term disability. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 37-41, 128, 136-137.
Plaintiff was eventually terminated by the Defendant in March 2017. Defendant contends that it terminated the Plaintiff because there was no reasonable expectation that he would be able to return to an open position for which he was qualified. See also Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 136-137; Defendant's Exhibit L (a portion of Defendant's Leave of Absence Policy Handbook). After receiving a Right to Sue letter from the EEOC, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit alleging that the Defendant violated his rights under the ADA.

Discussion
The Defendant has moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, [*12]  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P. The moving party has the burden of proving that judgment on the pleadings is appropriate. Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, 945 F.2d 716, 718 (4th Cir. 1991). Once the moving party makes this showing, however, the opposing party must respond to the motion with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 977 F.2d 872, 874-75 (4th Cir. 1992).
Here, after careful review and consideration of the evidence and arguments presented, the undersigned finds for the reasons set forth hereinbelow that the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment in this case.

(ADA Claims)
The ADA prohibits an employer from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112. Although Plaintiff only alleges a "First Cause of Action" in his Complaint, Plaintiff actually asserts at least two distinct ADA claims: 1) that he had a qualifying condition under the ADA for which he requested a reasonable accommodation, but that the Defendant failed to accommodate his disability; and 2) that the Defendant wrongfully terminated him on the basis of his disability. [*13]  Complaint, ¶ ¶ 17-43. Plaintiff also references (and according to his brief is also asserting) a separate ADA retaliation claim. Id., at ¶ 44. See also Plaintiff's Brief, pp. 9-10.9
The undersigned has addressed each of these claims, in turn.

I.

Failure to Accommodate
The ADA makes it unlawful for an employer to fail to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that (1) he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the statute; (2) the Defendant had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of his position; and (4) the Defendant refused to make such accommodations. See Reyazuddin v. Montgomery County, Maryland, 789 F.3d 407, 414-416 (4th Cir. 2015); Wilson v. Dollar General Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013); Donaldson v. Clover School District, No. 15-1768, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155431, 2017 WL 4173596 at *3 (D.S.C. Sept. 21, 2017). For purposes of this claim only, the Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff is a person with a disability and that it had notice of Plaintiff's disability. See Defendant's Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, pp. 7 n. 1, 19. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to present evidence sufficient [*14]  to establish a genuine issue of fact with respect to the third and fourth elements of his accommodation prima facie case, and that it is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Shin v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., 369 Fed.Appx. 472, 481 (4th Cir. 2010) [Plaintiff "bears the burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, as well as the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating such an accommodation is reasonable."].
With respect to the third element, Plaintiff initially makes two assertions: first, that he could perform the essential functions of his position even without an accommodation (although he then concedes he would have needed to at least use a stool), and second, that he was fired for accommodations he never requested. Plaintiff's Brief, pp. 6-8. With regard to Plaintiff's contention that he could perform the essential functions of his job, Plaintiff argues that Dr. Newton's restrictions were in obvious contradiction with the opinion of Dr. Hay, which was already on file with the Defendant. Dr. Hay had opined that Plaintiff could return to full duty work and perform the essential functions of his position. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Summary Judgment, [*15]  pp. 4-5. However, it was the Plaintiff himself who provided the updated restrictions from Dr. Newton to the Defendant, and Plaintiff offers no rationale for how the Defendant could have then ignored Dr. Newton's restrictions after receiving notice of them and allow Plaintiff to continue to do his full duty work, a decision which could have resulted in liability to the Defendant if Plaintiff had been further injured due to his condition. As such, the Defendant was entitled to rely on the work restrictions imposed by Dr. Newton in assessing whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of his job, either with or without an accommodation for these restrictions. Wulff v. Sentara Healthcare, Inc., 513 Fed.Appx. 267, 269, n. 2 (4th Cir. 2013); Alexander v. Northland, Inn, 321 F.3d 723, 727 (8th Cir. 2013)[Finding that the employer "was entitled to rely and act upon the written advice from [the employee's] physician that unambiguously and permanently restricted her from vacuuming. In this situation, the employee's belief or opinion that she can do the function is simply irrelevant."].
With regard to whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of his job with the restrictions imposed by Dr. Newton, the Fourth Circuit has held,
In determining whether a responsibility is an essential function of a job, we look [*16]  to the general components of the job rather than to the employee's particular experience. That an employee may typically be assigned to only certain tasks of a multifaceted job "does not necessarily mean that those tasks to which [ ]he was not assigned are not essential" . . . Even though [the plaintiff in that case] worked primarily in the copy room, [ ]he could have, at any time, been called upon to move heavy furniture or carry heavy packages.
EEOC v. Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, LLP, 616 Fed. Appx. 588, 594 (4th Cir. 2015); see also Lucarelli v. Conrail, No. 98-5904, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12201, at * 29 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 26, 2002) ["In determining what job functions are essential to a particular position, consideration is given to the employer's judgment"]. In this case, it is clear that Dr. Newton's restrictions precluded Plaintiff from performing the essential elements of his job without an accommodation. See generally, Plaintiff's Deposition, Exhibits 2, 5, 6; Davis Deposition, pp. 25-28, 44-49; see also Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 54-60, 121. Accordingly, the evidence (even considered in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff) does not support Plaintiff's argument that he could have continued to perform the essential functions of his job without an accommodation once the Defendant received Dr. Newton's restrictions. Rather, an accommodation would have [*17]  been required at that time.
With regard to accommodation, the Defendant has detailed evaluation and accommodation procedures that it purports to use in handling all employee requests for job modifications triggered by medical restrictions. See Defendant's Exhibit B Defendant's Reasonable Accommodation Procedure ("Reasonable Assignment Pro"); Defendant's Exhibit C Defendant's Temporary Light Duty Assignments Procedures ("Temporary Light Duty Pro"); Davis Deposition, pp. 13-16, 28-30, 40. The Defendant contends that to ensure fairness, all such employee requests are handled pursuant to these procedures. Davis attests that when a physician places an employee on temporary medical restrictions that temporarily preclude him from performing the essential functions of his job, with or without accommodation, the Defendant's procedures provide for the employee to engage with a disability management representative ("DMR") or a manager to identify any available and feasible light duty assignments that the employee might be able to perform. Davis Deposition, pp. 13-16; 28-30; Defendant's Exhibits B & C. Davis also attests that the medical restrictions by the employee's physician, whether temporary [*18]  or permanent, are provided to the Defendant's Heath Services, which sends a notice listing all of the restrictions to the employee, any managers supervising the employee, the DMR, and to the Defendant's Accommodation Services. Davis Deposition, pp. 28-30; See Court Docket No. 24-6, pp. 90-91, 93-94. The notice also provides information on where to turn for further assistance, questions, concerns and additional information about reasonable accommodations. Id. Davis attests that the DMR or manager compares the medical restrictions to the employee's job duties and works interactively with the employee to identify appropriate job assignments or to coordinate light duty. Davis Deposition, pp. 13-15, 28-30; Defendant's Exhibit B, pp. 4-16; Defendant's Exhibit C, pp. 3-6. Davis further attests that a light duty assignment is appropriate when an employee is anticipated to return to full duty, or sometimes during the permanent reassignment process, if a feasible job is available for which the candidate is qualified. Davis Deposition, pp. 20-21; Defendant's Exhibit C, pp. 3-4.
When an employee is placed on permanent medical restrictions by his physician (as Plaintiff was by Dr. Newton) and is [*19]  not anticipated to return to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation, he may be reviewed for reassignment to a vacant position under the Defendant's procedures. Davis Deposition, pp. 25-28, 31-33; Defendant's Exhibit B, pp. 4-16. The Defendant's reassignment process provides an employee with the opportunity to seek positions that fit within the permanent restrictions. Id. To be reassigned, the Defendant's policies provide that there must be a vacant position and the employee must meet the qualifications of the position, meaning that he must have the requisite skills, experience, education, and other job-related requisites of the position, and that he can perform all of the essential functions of the position, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id.
The evidence before the Court shows that in early 2014, Dr. Hay placed the Plaintiff on temporary medical restrictions. Hay Deposition, pp. 8-19, Exhibits 3 and 4. By then, as Plaintiff testified, the vascular necrosis was causing him to have "excruciating sharp pains" in his hips that would not allow him to put weight on his legs: "I would fall into walls, chairs, people. It was not constant, [*20]  it would come and go. There were days where I could be fine, but then there were days where I couldn't walk." Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 81-82. The temporary medical restrictions imposed by Dr. Hay went into effect on January 24, 2014, and were to remain in effect until March 7, 2014, at which time they were to be reevaluated. Hay Deposition, Exhibits 3 and 4. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was given at least two different light duty assignments during this period, and was eventually placed on an approved leave of absence during which he underwent hip replacement surgery in March 2014 and June 2014. Davis Deposition, pp. 19-21, 41-43; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 76-80, 98-99; Hay Deposition, pp. 8-9. Subsequently, in September, 2014, Plaintiff was cleared to return to work without restriction. However, when Plaintiff began experiencing pain in his knees after about a month, Dr. Hay placed him on a temporary two month restriction period, following which he was again cleared for regular full time work as an Assembler B Mechanic. Hay Deposition, pp. 22-24.
Although Plaintiff testified that he needed accommodations during this two month restriction period which were not provided, he could [*21]  not recall in his deposition whether he had actually sought ADA accommodations during that period of time. See generally, Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 107-110, 148, 150-151, 154. In any event, although the Defendant addressed the issue of whether it provided any appropriate accommodations to the Plaintiff during this time period in its motion for summary judgment; see Defendant's Brief, pp. 27-28; Plaintiff did not address this issue in his response, and does not argue any claim regarding lack of accommodation during this time period. See Plaintiff's Brief, pp. 4-9. Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiff had initially intended to bring an ADA claim for this time period, he has abandoned such claim, as he has failed to provide any evidence to refute the Defendant's arguments and evidence that it did not discriminate against him under the ADA during this time period or to prosecute any such claim. See Coker v. International Paper Co., No. 08-1865, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25511, 2010 WL 1072643, at *2 (D.S.C. March 18, 2010) ["[A] plaintiff can abandon claims by failing to address them in response to a summary judgment motion."]; Jones v. Danek Medical, Inc., No. 96-3323, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23813, 1999 WL 1133272 at *3 (D.S.C. Oct. 12, 1999)["The failure of a party to address an issue raised in summary judgment may be considered a waiver or abandonment of the relevant cause of action."].
Instead, Plaintiff addresses [*22]  his ADA accommodation claim as beginning in July 2015, when he was sent home after he gave the Defendant the new return to work functional capacities form from Dr. Newton. See Court Docket No. 25-4, p. 2; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 112-113; see also Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Summary Judgment, pp. 3-4. Plaintiff's argument is essentially that he could have performed the essential functions of his job if he had been allowed to use a stool. See Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 179. However, this appears to be a post hoc argument, as Plaintiff has presented no evidence that he ever asked for a stool or a chair as an accommodation for his condition during his employment, or that he ever asked his physicians for a note or requirement that he be allowed to have a chair or other equipment as an aid in his work. See Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 122, 164-165. Defendant contends that since Plaintiff never requested to be allowed to use a stool as an accommodation for his condition, it did not have a duty to even offer this as an accommodation (assuming it would even be appropriate) in the absence of any such request. Cf. Gwendolyn Jarrett v. Retzer Group, Inc., No. 14-744, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172904, 2015 WL 9581875 at *3 (E.D.Ark. Dec. 30, 2015) ["If an employee does not make a request for accommodation, then [*23]  the employer has no duty to accommodate."] (citing Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir. 2002)); see also Godlove v. Martinsburg Senior Towers, LP, No. 14-132, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51808, 2015 WL 1809325 at *4 (4th Cir. Apr. 21, 2015) ["A reasonable accommodation claim requires proof of such a specific request."].
Further, Davis testified that the possibility of Plaintiff being allowed to use a stool was actually discussed during an interactive meeting held shortly after the Defendant received Dr. Newton's restrictions in July 2015. This meeting, at which Plaintiff was present, was for the purpose of determining whether there was work available that Plaintiff could do with his restrictions or whether a reasonable accommodation was available for the Plaintiff. With respect to use of a stool by the Plaintiff, it was determined that having a stool in the area or having Plaintiff on a stool would create a possible hazard to other employees due to the tight areas and spaces involved in Plaintiff's work. Davis Deposition, pp. 26-28. She also testified that Plaintiff (who was at the meeting) agreed that use of a stool would not be feasible. Rather, Davis testified that Plaintiff suggested he might could be given a different job, possibly in I.T. Id. Plaintiff has provided no evidence to refute this testimony.10 Instead, he testified that he does not recall if [*24]  he ever spoke with Davis about whether use of a stool could possibly be a reasonable accommodation for his condition. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 122.
However, Plaintiff does recall that he told Davis he believed he could still do his job, even with Dr. Newton's permanent restrictions. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 121. Plaintiff testified that he just "needed help. Small accommodations. I could still do almost all of my work. For what I did, I could've still." Plaintiff testified that he believed that he could still perform his job even though he could not do a number of postural requirements (according to Dr. Newton's restrictions), and while Plaintiff could not testify that he was 100% sure that he expressed this sentiment to Davis, he felt that he would have expressed that to her. Id., pp. 121-122. However, Dr. Newton's permanent restrictions included: 0-1 hour (limited) standing and walking, and prohibited certain activities including lifting/carrying 25 to 50 lbs., bending, kneeling, crawling, squatting, climbing stairs, and climbing ladders. Plaintiff's regular job requirements were well in excess of these requirements. See Perry Declaration [*25] , ¶ ¶ 5-6; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 56-60; see also Court Docket No. 25-4, p. 2. Although Plaintiff testified that he "could still do almost all of my work" and "just needed help"; Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 121; Defendant correctly points out that not requiring the Plaintiff to himself perform the full range of his job requirements, thereby shifting at least some of Plaintiff's duties to other employees, would not be a viable accommodation for him. Irving v. Chester Water Authority, No. 08-5156, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60415, 2010 WL 2512370, at *5 (E.D.Pa. June 17, 2010) ["Employers] are not required to shift responsibilities to other employees in order to comply with the reasonable accommodation requirement"]; cf. Lombardo v. Air Products & Chems., Inc., No. 05-1120, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46077, at *38 (E.D.Pa. July 7, 2006) [Finding that lifting was an essential function of the warehouse positions occupied by the plaintiff, and that reassigning those tasks to other employees was not required as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA]; Lucarelli v Conrail, 2002 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 12201, at * 29 ["Employers are not . . . required to assign existing employees . . . to perform the essential functions of an employee's job which he . . . cannot perform because of an impairment"]; see also Hall v United States Postal Service, 857 F.2d 1073, 1078 (6th Cir. 1988) ["An accommodation that eliminates an essential function of the job is not reasonable"].
Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Defendant failed to work with him in good faith to find a reasonable accommodation or to help him find another position. Plaintiff's Brief, pp. 3-4. "The ADA imposes upon employers a good faith duty to engage with their employee in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation." Clark v. Sch. Dist. Five of Lexington & Richland Ctys., 247 F. Supp. 3d 734 (D.S.C. 2017)(quoting Jacobs v. North Carolina Administrative Office of Courts, 780 F.3d 562, 581 (4th Cir. 2015)).
However, the interactive process "is not an end in itself; rather it is a means for determining what reasonable accommodations are available to allow a disabled individual to perform the essential job functions of the position sought." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 347 (4th Cir. 2013). "Liability for failure to engage in an interactive process depends on a finding that, had a good faith interactive process occurred, the parties could have found a reasonable accommodation that would enable the disabled person to perform the job's essential functions." Id. An employee must demonstrate that the employer's "failure to engage in the interactive process resulted in the failure to identify an appropriate accommodation for the disabled employee." [*26]  Crabill [v. Charlotte Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.], 423 Fed.Appx. [314], 323 [4th Cir. 2011].
Clark, 247 F. Supp.3d 734 at 745 (D.S.C. 2017).
Here, Plaintiff testified that Pearline Peterson, the Reassignment focal in Defendant's Human Resources Department, was specifically assigned to him and tasked with trying to find him other positions with the Defendant.11 Although Plaintiff testified that Peterson never actually met with him, Davis testified that she took Plaintiff over to meet with Peterson on at least one occasion. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 123-124; Davis Deposition, p. 31-32. With respect to what efforts were made, Plaintiff testified that there may have been "[s]ome emails. And I think there might have been one, maybe two phone conversations, something. There was not a lot of interaction at all. In fact, I remember it was hard to even get a reply." Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 123. Plaintiff also testified that he did not recall whether he heard from Ms. Davis following his leaving the workplace in July 2015. Plaintiff's Deposition, p. 139. For its part, the Defendant has submitted testimony from Davis as well as several emails detailing the efforts that were made to determine if other work was available for the Plaintiff. Davis Deposition, pp. 31-33, 35, 41-43, Exhibits 1 and 2; Defendant's Exhibit [*27]  I.
The undersigned does not find that, even crediting just Plaintiff's testimony, the Defendant did not engage in a good faith effort to work with the Plaintiff. Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the Defendant failed to engage in an interactive process, Plaintiff has still presented no evidence that there was a reasonable accommodation available that would have enabled him to perform his job's essential functions with the limitations set forth by Dr. Newton. See Wilson, 717 F.3d at 347; see also Shin, 369 Fed.Appx. at 481 [Plaintiff "bears the burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified individual to perform the job, as well as the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating such an accommodation is reasonable."]. Plaintiff requesting that he be allowed to perform only some of the essential functions of his job is not a reasonable accommodation. Barber v. Columbia Coll., No. 05-3405, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73360, 2007 WL 2891657 at *3 (D.S.C. Sept. 28, 2007)[holding that the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation does "not require [the employer] to relieve [the employee] of any of the essential physical demands of her position . . . . "]; see also Irving, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60415, 2010 WL 2512370, at n. 2; cf. Lombardo, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46077, at *38 [Finding that lifting was an essential function of the warehouse positions occupied by the plaintiff, and that reassigning [*28]  those tasks to other employees was not required as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA]; Lucarelli, 2002 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 12201, at * 29 ["Employers are not . . . required to assign existing employees . . . to perform the essential functions of an employee's job which he . . . cannot perform because of an impairment"].
Defendant has also submitted evidence to show that there were no other positions available for which Plaintiff was qualified, while Plaintiff has presented no evidence on this issue to dispute Defendant's evidence. Specifically, Defendant refers to three positions that Plaintiff applied for during this process: Programmer Analyst Level 1 position, Production Coordinator B, and Production Control Coordinator B. Ramirez Declaration, ¶¶ 4-6; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 130-133; Davis Deposition, pp. 32-33, 35, 41-43 & Exhibits 1-3. The Programmer Analyst Level 1 position required a minimum education requirement of a technical bachelor's degree; Ramirez Declaration, ¶¶ 4-5; Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 128-131; and Plaintiff admitted in his deposition that he only had a GED and did not possess the proper educational qualifications for this position. Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 128-131, 133. Cf. Domek v. Schafer, No. 07-1469, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42416, 2008 WL 2312730 at *5 (D.Md. May 29, 2008)[holding that an employer [*29]  is not required to reassign an individual to a position for which he is not qualified to accommodate the individual's disability]; Prioleau v. Potter, No. 05-2331, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66893, 2007 WL 2688608 at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 10, 2007)[holding that employer has no duty to create a position matching an employee's qualifications to accommodate the employee's disability](addressing § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). As for the Production Coordinator B and Production Control Coordinator B positions for which Plaintiff applied, the physical demands of those jobs included continuous standing and walking, as well as frequent climbing of stairs, and kneeling, bending and lifting more than 25 pounds - all functions prohibited by Dr. Newton's permanent medical restrictions. Ramirez Declaration, ¶ 6. See Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 132-133. Therefore, Plaintiff was not qualified to perform the essential functions of those jobs. Riley v. Weyerhaeuser Paper Co., 898 F.Supp. 324, 327 (W.D.N.C. 1995) [Employer "is not required to reassign a disabled person to a vacant position unless the disabled employee is qualified for that position"]; see also Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 33 Fed. Appx. 49, 59 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2002) ["The ADA does not . . . require an employer to create a new position as an accommodation to a disabled employee."] Since these jobs fall outside of Plaintiff's qualifications and permanent medical restrictions, he has [*30]  not shown that they were reasonable accommodations.
In sum, Plaintiff has failed to establish his prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the ADA, because he has failed to present evidence sufficient create a genuine issue of fact that he could perform the essential functions of his job as existed at the time he was terminated, or that the Defendant failed to accommodate him with a reasonable accommodation. Cf. Howell v Holland, No. 13-295, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182306, 2015 WL 751590, at *19 (D.S.C. Feb. 23, 2015); Telfair v. Federal Express Corp., 934 F.Supp. 2d 1368, 1383-1384 (S.D.Fla. 2013); Irving, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60415, 2010 WL 2512370, at *5. Therefore, Plaintiff's ADA accommodation claim is without merit, and the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

II.

Termination
Although Plaintiff also alleges an ADA wrongful discharge claim in his Complaint, he did not separately discuss this claim in his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment. Even so, out of an abundance of caution, the undersigned has addressed this claim in the event it is a claim Plaintiff has intended to pursue. But see also Coker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25511, 2010 WL 1072643, at *2["[A] plaintiff can abandon claims by failing to address them in response to a summary judgment motion."]; Jones, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23813, 1999 WL 1133272 at *3 ["The failure of a party to address an issue raised in summary judgment may be considered a waiver or abandonment of the relevant cause of action."].
In order to establish [*31]  a prima facie case of wrongful discharge in violation of the ADA, Plaintiff must by a preponderance of the evidence show four criteria: first, he must be a qualified person with a disability; second, he must have been discharged; third, he must have been fulfilling his employer's legitimate expectations at the time of discharge; and fourth, the circumstances of his discharge must raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. Acosta v. Hilton Grand Vacations Company, LLC, No. 15-495, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49494, 2017 WL 1173583, at *10 (D.S.C. Mar. 30, 2017); Rohan v. Networks Presentations, LLC, 375 F.3d 266, 272 n. 9 (4th Cir. 2004); Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir. 2001); Taylor v. Ameristeel Corp., 155 Fed.Appx. 85, 89 (4th Cir. Nov. 18, 2005); Haneke v. Mid-Atlantic Capital Management, 131 Fed.Appx. 399, 400 (4th Cir. May 10, 2005); see also Anderson v. Roche Carolina, Inc., No. 10-2792, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152770, 2012 WL 368710, at *6 (D.S.C. Feb. 3, 2012).12 Here, Plaintiff has failed to submit evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact with respect to even the first of these four criteria; i.e., that he is a "qualified person with a disability" within the meaning of the ADA, thereby entitling the Defendant to dismissal of this claim.
The term "disability" is defined as, a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, b) a record of such impairment, or c) being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); see Acosta, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49494, 2017 WL 1173583, at *10; Pollard v. High's of Baltimore, Inc., 281 F.3d 462, 467 (4th Cir. 2002).13 A "major life activity" is defined as a basic activity that an average person can perform with little or no difficulty, such as walking, hearing, speaking, learning, breathing, standing, lifting, seeing [*32]  and working. Appendix to 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(a)(i); see Brunko v. Mercy Hosp., 260 F.3d 939, 941 (8th Cir. 2001); Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 727, n. 7 (5th Cir. 1995); Gupton v. Virginia, 14 F.3d 203, 205 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 810, 115 S. Ct. 59, 130 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1994) (Rehabilitation Act).14 Major life activities also include caring for oneself, eating, concentrating, thinking, and sleeping. See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). As for the "regarded as" component for disability,
[p]rior to Congress' passage of the ADA Amendment Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, § 2(b)(1)-(6), 122 Stat. 3553 (2008) ("ADAAA"), there were two ways in which a person could be regarded as being disabled: "(1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities."Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). However, with the passage of the ADAAA, which became effective January 1, 2009 and overruled Sutton,"[a]n individual meets the requirement of 'being regarded as having such an impairment' if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived . . . impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity." 42 U.S.C. §12102(3)(A).
Mohney v. Pennsylvania, 809 F.Supp.2d 384, 400 n. 14 (W.D.Pa. 2011).
Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff meets the requisite criteria as set forth above and therefore [*33]  has a "disability" for purposes of its motion for summary judgment. That is not, however, by itself a sufficient basis on which to allow this claim to proceed, as the question is not whether Plaintiff has a disability, but whether the evidence shows him to be a "qualified individual with a disability". Acosta, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49494, 2017 WL 1173583, at *10. A "qualified person with a disability " is someone who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question. See 42 U.S.C. A. § 12111(8); Tyndall v. National Education Centers, Inc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994). Since Plaintiff has failed to submit evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether he could perform his job's essential functions, either with or without a reasonable accommodation; see discussion, supra; he has not established a genuine issue of fact as to whether he is a "qualified person with a disability" for purposes of his discharge claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Therefore, as Plaintiff has failed to establish all the elements of his prima facie case, his discharge claim is subject to summary judgment.

III.

ADA Retaliation Claim
Finally, assuming Plaintiff has properly asserted an ADA retaliation claim, it falls under § 503(a) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a), which provides as follows:
No person shall discriminate [*34]  against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter.
Retaliation cases under the ADA are subject to the same requirements of proof as are applicable to Title VII disparate treatment claims. Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir. 1985); see also Williams v. Cerberonics, Inc., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir. 1989). Under this proof scheme, the employee is initially required to establish a prima facie case of retaliation by a preponderance of the evidence. This prima facie case consists of three elements: (1) the employee engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer took adverse employment action against the employee; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. Reynolds v. American Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 154 (4th Cir. 2012)[ADA claim]; Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health, Inc Co., 313 F.3d 205, 216 (4th Cir. 2005); Harmer v. Virginia Elec. and Power Co., 831 F.Supp. 1300, 1308 (E.D.Va. 1993). Once a prima facie case has been presented, the Defendant employer has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. If the employer can produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions, the employee must then demonstrate that the Defendant's proffered reason is pretextural. Harmer, 831 F.Supp. at 1308; see also Graves v. Bank of America, 54 F.Supp.3d 434, 443 (M.D.N.C. 2014).
Defendant initially argues that [*35]  Plaintiff's retaliation claim should be dismissed because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to this claim. Defendant points out that Plaintiff filed his Charge of Discrimination with the South Carolina Human Affairs Commission ("SCHAC") in December 2015, and his Complaint in December 2016, alleging failure to accommodate and that he had been "terminated . . . in retaliation for his medical disability." However, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was not terminated at that point in time, and that his employment with the Defendant did not in fact end until March 2017 (after 19 months of approved leave of absence). Accordingly, the Defendant argues that since Plaintiff had not been terminated when he filed his administrative charge, a claim of retaliation based on his termination is not properly before the Court because he failed to first exhaust his administrative remedies on this charge after his termination. See Smith v. First Union Nat'l. Bank, 202 F.3d 234, 247 (4th Cir.2000) ["Before filing suit under Title VII, a plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies by bringing a charge with the EEOC [or SCHAC]"].
Plaintiff failed to address Defendant's failure to exhaust argument. However, the undersigned notes sua sponte [*36]  that
[u]nder precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, if a party's filing of an EEOC complaint results in alleged retaliatory acts, then those acts relate back to the administrative charge, and no second EEOC charge is required. Nealon v. Stone, 958 F.2d 584, 590 (4th Cir. 1992). "The rationale behind this rule is that such a claim falls within the general rule that a Title VII lawsuit may extend to 'any kind of discrimination like or related to allegations contained in the charge and growing out of such allegations during the pendency of the case before the Commission,' and that it is impractical to expect victims of employment discrimination to file a new EEOC charge for retaliation if they have already been retaliated against for filing the first EEOC charge." Windsor v. Bd. of Educ. of Prince George's Cty., Civil Action No. TDC-14-2287, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125371, 2016 WL 4939294, at *7 (D. Md. Sept. 13, 2016) (citing Nealon, 958 F.2d at 590). If, however, the allegations of retaliation were not the result of the filing of an EEOC charge, then the court must analyze whether the "retaliation claim relates back to the charge that is properly before [the court]." Jones v. Calvert Grp., Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 304 (4th Cir. 2009); see also Brown v. Runyon, No. 96-2230, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 3237, 1998 WL 85414, at *3 (4th Cir. Feb. 27, 1998) ("Nealon's 'relation back' rule presupposes both that a retaliation count in a Title VII lawsuit be 'related to' and have [*37]  'grown out' of the EEO charge while the administrative charge remained pending. If either predicate condition is lacking, the rule cannot operate to overcome a plaintiff's failure to have exhausted administrative remedies.").
Harvey v. Saluda Smiles Family Dentistry, No. 8:14-CV-01966-JMC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179047, 2016 WL 7451205, at *5 (D.S.C. Dec. 28, 2016), on reconsideration in part, No. 8:14-CV-01966-JMC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111996, 2017 WL 3048582 (D.S.C. July 18, 2017). Here, it is certainly plausible that Plaintiff's retaliation termination claim related to and grew out of the claims asserted in his EEOC charge.15 However, it is also true that Plaintiff's EEOC charge in this case was no longer pending and Plaintiff had already filed his federal complaint by the time he was officially terminated. As such, it is unclear whether Plaintiff's termination claim is saved by Nealon and, as noted, Plaintiff failed to address Defendant's exhaustion argument.
In any event, Defendant also contends that even assuming that Plaintiff's retaliation claim is properly before the Court, he failed to establish his prima facie case. Plaintiff argues that he engaged in protected activity by conveying his restrictions and need for accommodation to the Defendant and by placing multiple calls to Defendant's internal grievance ("Total Access") hotline [*38]  regarding the matter.16 Plaintiff's Deposition, pp. 138-139. Plaintiff contends that he then suffered an adverse action when the Defendant requested that he "exit" his position and/or when Defendant failed to provide Plaintiff with an accommodation; see Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Summary Judgment, p. 10; and argues that the necessary causal connection is evidenced by his termination after he engaged in protected activity. However, Defendant argues that even assuming Plaintiff can demonstrate that requesting an accommodation is protected activity and that he suffered an adverse action by being terminated, Plaintiff has no evidence to establish a causal connection between these two events, which is necessary to establish his prima facie case.
As previously noted, while Plaintiff's termination did not occur until approximately nineteen (19) months later, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was removed from his position and sent home shortly after the July 2015 meeting in which the parties discussed whether or not Plaintiff's medical restrictions could be accommodated. As such, that portion of Plaintiff's claim was viable at the time he [*39]  filed his EEOC complaint, and Plaintiff did assert a retaliation claim in his administrative charge relating to that conduct. See Plaintiff's Deposition, Exhibit 7. However, even assuming that both this claim as well as Plaintiff's retaliation termination claim are properly before this Court and that the Defendant immediately removing Plaintiff from his position and placing him on leave establishes the necessary causal connection to establish Plaintiff's prima facie case; see generally Mickey v. Zeidler Tool & Die Co., 516 F.3d 516, 525 (6th Cir. 2008)[Temporal proximity is sufficient to establish causal connection where an adverse employment action occurs very close in time to when an employer learns of a protected activity]; Pantoja v. American NTN Bearing Mfg. Corp., 495 F.3d 840, 850 (7th Cir. 2007) [Finding that timing was "suspicious enough to suffice to support [a] prima facie case."]; Plaintiff's retaliation claim still fails due to his failure to establish a genuine issue of fact with respect to pretext.
The evidence clearly establishes that the Defendant had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's removal from his position and ultimate termination, as the evidence shows that Plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his position with or without a reasonable accommodation. See discussion, [*40]  supra. See EEOC v. Clay Printing Co., 955 F.2d 936, 941 (4th Cir. 1991) [The defendant's burden of establishing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason is only one of production, not of persuasion]. Therefore, to survive summary judgment on his retaliation claim, Plaintiff must have evidence of pretext in the Defendant's decision to remove him from his position and to ultimately terminate his employment. In order to show pretext, Plaintiff must show that "but for" the Defendant's intent to retaliate against him because he engaged in protected activity, he would not have been removed from his position or terminated. EEOC, 955 F.2d at 941; Melendez v. Board of Education for Montgomery County, 711 Fed.Appx. 685, 2017 WL 4512169 at *3 (4th Cir., 2017) [Retaliation claims are proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation.]; Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 933 F.2d 231, 234-235 (4th Cir. 1991). "Direct or indirect evidence of discriminatory motive may do, but 'the evidence as a whole... must be sufficient for a reasonable fact-finder to infer that the employer's decision was motivated by [retaliatory animus].'" LeBlanc v. Great American Insurance Co., 6 F.3d 836, 843 (1st Cir. 1993)(citing Goldman v. First Nat'l Bank, 985 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1993)(quoting Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1172, n. 3 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1218, 111 S. Ct. 2828, 115 L. Ed. 2d 997 (1991)); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 141-143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000).
Here, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence, or even argument, with respect to the question of pretext to show that the Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason was false, or that the real reason the Defendant removed him from his position and ultimately terminated his employment [*41]  was not because he could no longer perform his job, but was because it was retaliating against him for having requested an accommodation for his disability. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Summary Judgment, p. 10. See also House v. New Castle County, 824 F.Supp. 477, 485 (D.Md. 1993) [Plaintiff's conclusory allegations insufficient to maintain claim]. Therefore, Plaintiff having failed to establish a genuine issue of fact with respect to this essential element of his ADA retaliation claim, this claim should be dismissed. Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir. 1998)[Plaintiff must proffer evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact that his employer "[took] the adverse employment action[s] because [he] engaged in a protected activity."]; Cf. Rudolph v. Hechinger, 884 F.Supp. 184, 188 (D.Md. 1995) ["Title VII (does) not protect against unfair business decisions - only against decisions motivated by unlawful animus"], citing Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 555 F.2d 1251, 1257 (5th Cir. 1977); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) ["Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."]; Baber, 977 F.2d at 874-875 [Once the moving party submits evidence showing entitlement to summary judgment, to avoid summary judgment the party opposing the motion must respond [*42]  with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial].

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted, and that this case be dismissed.
