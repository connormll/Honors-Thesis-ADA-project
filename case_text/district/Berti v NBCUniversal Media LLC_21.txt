Final Ruling on Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment of Claims

I. Background
Carolynn Berti ("Plaintiff") sued NBCUniversal Media, LLC ("Defendant") and Jennifer Eng ("Eng") on August 29, 2019. The operative complaint in the action is the First Amended Complaint ("FAC"), which asserts seven claims for relief: 1) discrimination in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; 2) harassment in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; 3) retaliation in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; 4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k); 5) failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; [*2]  6) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process in violation of California Government Code §§ 12940, et seq.; and 7) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. See Docket No. 5-1; see also Notice of Removal, Docket No. 1, ¶ 1. Defendant now moves for summary judgment targeting Plaintiff's entire remaining case and partial summary judgment as to each of Plaintiff's remaining claims1 - individually, along with her request for punitive damages.

II. Analysis
A. Summary Judgment Standards
Summary judgment is proper when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Miranda v. City of Cornelius, 429 F.3d 858, 860 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005). To satisfy its burden at summary judgment, a moving party without the burden of persuasion "must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added); see also Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) ("When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out 'that there is an absence of evidence to support the [*3]  nonmoving party's case.'") (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986), and citing Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, 212 F.3d 528, 532 (9th Cir. 2000)); Fairbank, 212 F.3d at 532 (holding that the Celotex "showing" can be made by "pointing out through argument...the absence of evidence to support plaintiff's claim").
If the party moving for summary judgment meets its initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party may not rely on the mere allegations in the pleadings in order to preclude summary judgment[, but instead] must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.
T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
The opposing party must "cit[e] to particular parts of materials in the record" or show that the materials the moving party cited do not establish the absence of a genuine dispute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record."); Phillips & Stevenson, RUTTER GROUP PRAC. GUIDE, FEDERAL CIV. PRO. BEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2020) ("Phillips & Stevenson"), ¶¶ 14:101.10-101.12, 14:102. In addition, under this Court's Local Rules, where [*4]  the moving party on a motion for summary judgment has "claimed and adequately supported" material facts, those facts "are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are (a) included in the 'Statement of Genuine Disputes' [described in Local Rule 56-2] and (b) controverted by declaration or other written evidence filed in opposition to the motion." See C.D. Cal. L.R. 56-3; see also Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc., 575 F.3d 1040, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009) ("The 'party opposing summary judgment must direct [the court's] attention to specific, triable facts,' and the reviewing court is 'not required to comb through the record to find some reason to deny a motion for summary judgment.'") (quoting S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 2003) and Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2001)); Carmen, 237 F.3d at 1029 ("[W]hatever establishes a genuine issue of fact must both be in the district court file and set forth in the response.").
"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In addition, factual assertions made in legal memoranda, but not supported by the evidence submitted, are insufficient. See S.A. Empresa De Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense v. Walter Kidde & Co., 690 F.2d 1235, 1238 (9th Cir. 1980). Similarly, one's own allegations in the pleadings are generally not suitable to create a [*5]  genuine dispute. See Phillips & Stevenson, ¶¶ 14:185-187.
Generally-speaking, in judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the Court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence, and views all evidence and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 630-31 (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)); Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072, 1075 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc); Miranda, 429 F.3d at 860 n.1. Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See National Steel Corp v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 496, 502 (9th Cir. 1997); Thornhill Publ'g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir.1979); see also Phillips & Stevenson ¶ 14:171.
With all of these considerations in mind, the Court must then determine whether "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; see also Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995) ("The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient.").

C. Factual Background 2
1. Plaintiff's Job, Responsibilities and Assignments
Plaintiff worked as a Graphics Operator for Defendant's Post-Production Department from 2006 until her termination. See Defendant NBCUniversal Media, LLC's Reply to Plaintiff's Response to Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("DR"), Docket No. 46, ¶ 1; Plaintiff Carolynn Berti's Separate Statement of Undisputed [*8]  Material Facts in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("PSS"), Docket No. 37,3 ¶ 1. The Post-Production department is a department within Defendant's West Coast Studio Operations ("WCSO") business unit. See DR ¶ 2.
Plaintiff's direct supervisor at the time of her termination was Jason Segal ("Segal"), the Post-Production Manager of the Operations and Technologies Divisions. See id. ¶ 4. During his tenure with Defendant, Segal's duties include receiving, reading, following, and applying Defendant's corporate policies. See id. ¶ 81. He has never had authority from Defendant to create, develop, draft, approve, or revise any corporate policies that apply to Defendant's employees, or any other corporate policies; has never had substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine Defendant's corporate policies; has never had discretion to guide Defendant's corporate conduct or make decisions that would ultimately determine corporate policy; and has never sat on the Board of Directors or served as an officer for Defendant. See id. ¶¶ 78-80, 82.
Different divisions within Defendant were able [*9]  to use their allotted budgets on services from the Post-Production department. See id. ¶ 3. These different divisions often hired editors, assistant editors, or graphic artists who worked in the Post-Production department to perform postproduction services for their departments. See id.
Plaintiff did graphics work for a number of "clients" (and for the "domestic side") during her employment, including International Creative Production ("ICP"), G4, E! Entertainment, and Red Carpet Live. See PSS ¶¶ 2, 5. ICP was a department/division within one of Defendant's business units, and considered the same entity as Defendant. See DR ¶ 16; PSS ¶ 52. Plaintiff was assigned by the Post-Production department to perform work for ICP from at least 2012 until she began a leave of absence in April 2018. See DR ¶ 17. When asked at her deposition what percentage of her time was spent on work for ICP, Plaintiff could not say for sure, but ultimately appeared to indicate that it may have been as much as 95-98% of her time. See id. ¶ 18.4 In any event, she continued to do other work for Defendant outside of her work for ICP, because "things always come up." See PSS ¶ 3. The percentage of her work that she [*10]  did for ICP varied from week-to-week, and she did not consider it "rare" for her to get assignments from other clients. See id. ¶ 4.
In providing assignments to Plaintiff, ICP typically would provide Plaintiff a couple of hours to complete her assignments, but everything was urgent and ICP "usually needed [the assignments] right away." See DR ¶ 19. Some of Plaintiff's assignments from ICP took Plaintiff all day to complete. See id. ¶ 20.
The nature of Plaintiff's job entailed time-sensitive work with quick turnaround deadlines, most having same-day or next-day deadlines. See id. ¶ 12. As a Graphics Operator, Plaintiff worked on promos where she identified the dates and times of new series that would air for promotional purposes, as well as after-effects, movie files, background, flying in text to match on-air design, looking at graphics which did not require working on a computer at all, attending meetings (which did not require working on a computer), and research (which required minimal computer work).5 See PSS ¶ 6. Her job functions consisted of mainly lower-third work and some lower-level graphics work; Plaintiff was primarily responsible for inserting text or graphics into the [*11]  lower-third of the television screen. See DR ¶ 5. Since approximately the end of 2016, 100% of Plaintiff's work was done using the After Effects computer program. See id. ¶ 6.
The essential functions of the Graphics Operator position were all performed on the computer and required repetitive use of the computer mouse and typing to insert text. See id. ¶ 8.6 In any given hour, a Graphics Operator makes approximately hundreds of keystrokes on a keyboard for, on average, approximately 45 minutes of that hour. See id. ¶ 11.
Plaintiff's work, whether live or for international promos, was usually at her computer. See id. ¶ 9. When she was "doing actual work, not waiting but . . . doing actual[] work," Plaintiff estimated — again, see Footnote 4, supra, with a clear reflection of a lack of certainty — that she spent 50% of her time on the computer using the keyboard for typing and the other 50% using the mouse (though Plaintiff asserts that there is also evidence that graphics operators, in general, would — in an average hour — use the mouse for over 30 minutes and the keyboard for only about 15 minutes7 ). See id. ¶ 10; Docket No. 22-8, at 38:12-39:24.8
However, there is also evidence that, with respect to the amount of time she spent typing, it varied for every promo, but she spent more time trying to figure things out than actual typing. See PSS ¶ 7. She did not have to use the mouse all the time, in part because there were shortcuts. See id. Approximately 80 percent of her time was spent on a computer (not necessarily constantly typing or constantly clicking a mouse), while the remaining 20 percent consisted of a producer or editor sitting with Plaintiff to provide instructions and feedback. See id. She would not type for 8 hours a day, or ever for 30 minutes straight. See id. ¶ 8.
2. Plaintiff's Injury and Leave
In 2016, Plaintiff began suffering from bilateral elbow pain and pain in both hands as well, with her right side being worse. See DR ¶ 25; PSS ¶ 9. Plaintiff's 2016 elbow injury arose "over the course of time in her employment due to repetitive and continuous movement." See DR ¶ 13.
Plaintiff was first treated sometime in October 2016, by a nurse on the lot where she worked, before eventually going to see an outside physician at Cedars Sinai. See PSS ¶ 10. Plaintiff's primary physician with respect to the issue recommended [*13]  surgery and referred Plaintiff for a surgical evaluation. See id. ¶ 11. On August 24, 2017, Plaintiff's orthopedic hand surgeon noted "The patient is being seen today for a work-related injury to the elbow sustained while doing repetitive typing and computer work" and "The patient's physical duties consist of office work with repetitive use of the keyboard and computer." See DR ¶ 14.
Plaintiff informed Segal that she was going to have surgery, see PSS ¶ 13, and on April 23, 2018, Defendant approved Plaintiff's request for medical leave to undergo surgery on her right elbow. See DR ¶ 26. On April 24, 2018, Plaintiff underwent surgery on her right elbow. See PSS ¶ 12.
After her surgery, Plaintiff was placed on medical leave until February 1, 2019. See id. ¶ 14. Between April 2018 and February 2019, Plaintiff timely submitted her doctor's notes to Segal (who sent them on to Eng, a Human Resources Generalist in the Human Resources department), in addition to representatives of the Safety Department and the nurse's station on the lot. See id. ¶ 15. In addition, Plaintiff's doctor was also sending the medical status reports to Defendant. See id. ¶ 16.
On August 6, 2018, Plaintiff's doctor released [*14]  her to return to work with a restriction that prevented her from using her right (dominant) arm for any work tasks. See DR ¶ 27. Plaintiff could not perform her job with the August 6, 2018 restrictions and therefore remained on medical leave. See id. ¶ 28. On November 2, 2018, Plaintiff's doctor placed her on total temporary disabled ("TTD") status. See id. ¶ 29.
On February 1, 2019, Plaintiff's doctor cleared her to return to work with restrictions, including "repetitive hand activity max 30 min/hr," with no strong gripping on her right side, no lifting or carrying over 2 pounds on her right side, and no forceful pushing or pulling. See id. ¶ 32; PSS ¶ 17. Plaintiff sent this note to Segal. See PSS ¶ 17. Plaintiff testified that she was "absolutely" able to do her job with these restrictions. See id. ¶ 18.
On February 4, 2019, Human Resources Manager Jasmine Love ("Love") sought clarification of these restrictions. See DR ¶ 33. On February 12, 2019, Plaintiff's doctor provided a clarification through Defendant's third-party administrator: "The key word is 'repetitive.' So, if [Plaintiff] has been typing (example) for 30 minutes, she is to stop the repetitive motion of the typing and [*15]  do something else, like filing (example)." See id. ¶ 34.
After receipt of Plaintiff's February 1, 2019 restrictions, Love and Eng reached out to Segal to discuss whether Plaintiff could perform the Graphics Operator duties within her February 1, 2019 restrictions. See id. ¶ 35. Based on the information provided by Segal regarding Plaintiff's job duties, Defendant determined that it could not reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions because Plaintiff's job required repetitive hand motions for longer than 30 minutes within an hour and because the deadlines and time-sensitive nature of Plaintiff's work meant that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her position even with modifications. See id. ¶¶ 36-37. Plaintiff, however, provides evidence that Defendant gave no explanation for refusing to allow Plaintiff to return to work with these restrictions. See PSS ¶ 19. Eng, however, confirmed that her and Segal's conclusion was that they could not accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions solely because Plaintiff did computer work. See id. ¶ 20.
Plaintiff remained on medical leave from February 1, 2019-February 25, 2019. See DR ¶ 41. On February 25, 2019, Plaintiff's doctor [*16]  returned her to TTD status. See id. ¶ 42.
3. ICP's Absorption of Plaintiff's Work
In approximately 2016, ICP began hiring its own graphic operators with the intent of "insulating and building" its own post-production staff so that ICP no longer needed to pay for outside graphics assistance from Graphic Operators like Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 21; PSS ¶ 53. In 2016, ICP rented graphics work stations and equipment from the Post-Production department and hired two of its own highly-skilled graphics operators. See DR ¶ 22. Initially, ICP's hiring of its own graphics operators did not have much impact on Plaintiff's ICP work because the ICP graphics operators were hired to do broader design work and build complex animations, while Plaintiff was focused on building lower-thirds. See id. ¶ 23. Eventually, ICP's graphics operators incorporated Plaintiff's duties into their workload. See id. ¶ 24.
In approximately November 2018, Segal learned that ICP was already working on having its internal graphics team absorb the work Plaintiff was performing for ICP. See id. ¶ 30. In that same approximate timeframe, Segal had already noticed that some of the assignments for work Plaintiff typically performed [*17]  were already going to ICP's graphics team. See id. ¶ 31. Defendant asserts that in approximately February or March 2019, "it became apparent" to Segal that ICP was phasing out Plaintiff's graphics duties. See id. ¶ 38; see also PSS ¶ 53.
At some unspecified point in time (or times), Segal reached out to Bryan Quaccarini (Director of Live Events), Travis Hills (Studio Manager), Maria Soto (current Studio Manager), Erin Haggerty (Vice President of Defendant's affiliate), Matt Grabbs (Senior Vice President of Broadcast Operations), and Christina Durtman (Manager of Live Productions) to discuss alternative positions for Plaintiff in any capacity. See DR ¶ 39. Segal did not find any alternative positions for Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 40.
4. The Elimination of Plaintiff's Position; Plaintiff's Attempts to Return
When it became clear to Segal that there would be no work for Plaintiff when she returned from leave, he began the process to eliminate Plaintiff's position. See id. ¶ 43. The process of terminating an employee involved Eng building a case for the layoff in a "DECK report," a document that was not produced to Plaintiff.9 See PSS ¶¶ 22-23. Beginning in approximately February 2019 (after Plaintiff [*18]  was released to return to work with restrictions), Segal began working with Eng to help Eng gather information to build a business case justifying Segal's decision to eliminate Plaintiff's position in order to present it to Human Resources for evaluation. See DR ¶ 45; PSS ¶ 21. Eng began working on the business justification for Plaintiff's position's elimination no earlier than February 2019. See DR ¶ 62.
On March 11, 2019, Eng sent Plaintiff a letter to initiate a discussion regarding Plaintiff's disability status and the expected duration of her continued disability. See id. ¶ 46. Specifically, the letter stated — among other things — that "[y]ou have been on an approved . . . medical disability leave since 4/23/2018" and that Defendant's "policy provides that, typically, the maximum duration of a medical disability leave is twelve months . . . . [I]f an employee is unable to return to work with or without reasonable accommodation within those twelve months, or reasonably soon thereafter, his/her employment normally terminates." See PSS ¶ 24. Although Plaintiff asserts that there is evidence that Eng also asked Plaintiff to reach out, but then ignored Plaintiff's attempts to do [*19]  so for a week, see id. ¶ 25, on approximately March 18, 2019, Plaintiff contacted Eng to discuss the letter. See DR ¶ 47. During the March 18, 2019 call, and in a March 18, 2019 email, Eng confirmed that Defendant already had a February 1, 2019, note from her doctor on-file, informed Plaintiff that she could not return to work with her restrictions and instructed Plaintiff to provide Eng with an updated work status/notes following Plaintiff's upcoming March 20 and March 25 doctor appointments. See id. ¶ 48; PSS ¶¶ 26-28; see also Docket No. 35-3, Exh. 13, at pg. 331 of 360.
On March 26, 2019, Plaintiff emailed her updated doctor's note to Eng, but Eng responded that the note looked more like a diagnosis as opposed to a return-to-work and work restrictions, so would not return Plaintiff to her position based on it. See id. ¶¶ 29, 31. On March 27, 2019, Plaintiff's doctor wrote a note indicating that:
[t]he precise activities required [of Plaintiff's job] entailed prolonged sitting with her neck and back in a fixed position for prolonged periods of times, as well as continuous fine maneuvering of her hands and fingers for computer work, turning her neck, pushing and pulling, gripping and [*20]  grasping, reaching to all levels, lifting and carrying up to 5-10 pounds.
See DR ¶ 15. That day, Plaintiff's doctor released Plaintiff to return to work with restrictions, including — among other things - "[a]void pinching & grasping repetitively with both hands" and only typing for 30 minutes per hour. See id. ¶ 49; PSS ¶ 30. On March 28, 2019, Plaintiff provided the March 27, 2019 doctor's note to Eng. See DR ¶ 50; PSS ¶ 30.
Eng evaluated Plaintiff's March 27, 2019 restrictions and Plaintiff's job duties and determined that Plaintiff could not perform her job duties within her restrictions because her job duties required repetitive use of a mouse (grasping). See DR ¶ 51. On April 7, 2019, Eng advised Plaintiff that Defendant could not accommodate Plaintiff's March 27, 2019 new restrictions. See id. ¶ 52; PSS ¶ 30. That same day, Eng sent Plaintiff a link to Defendant's career website — a link that, according to Plaintiff's evidence, was "broken"10 - to search for alternative positions, and requested that Plaintiff provide her a list of positions in which she was both interested and qualified and able to perform with her March 27, 2019 restrictions. See DR ¶ 53; PSS ¶ 30.
On or about [*21]  April 8, 2019, Plaintiff tried to log-in to her NBC account as an employee to access the website Eng had sent, but was locked-out, with Eng confirming that Plaintiff could not access it because she was on leave of absence. See PSS ¶ 33. Plaintiff also confirmed that the outside link Eng offered did not include all postings, but necessarily excluded job postings that were restricted to "hire within." See id. ¶ 34; see also Footnote 10, supra.
On April 9, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Eng, stating: "I believe I can perform my job duties within this restrictions [sic] with my ergonomic setup so long as they remove one of the cabinet [sic] so that I can work with both of my keyboards without having to reach around things in an awkward position. The rest of the job duties I believe I can perform as we don't normally type more than 30 minutes an hour, don't lift/push/pull over 2 pounds, and if they move the cabinet, I won't have to do repetitive pinching a [sic] grasping as most of the work is paperless." See id. ¶ 37. When she did not hear back, Plaintiff sent a nearly-identical email to Eng on April 10, 2019, adding that her "job consists of other things than just typing." See id. ¶ 38. Eng admits [*22]  that Defendant did not consider Plaintiff's suggestion that she could be accommodated with a more ergonomic work station by removing a cabinet because Eng did not believe it was relevant to her typing restriction. See id. ¶ 47. Eng also admitted that she never had Plaintiff show her whether or how she could type or have Plaintiff show her if she could perform her job with restrictions. See id.
On April 16, 2019, having not heard back from Eng following her April 9 and April 10 emails, Plaintiff emailed Eng again to say that she had not heard back and to request an in-person meeting with Eng to explore other available positions with Defendant that could accommodate her restrictions. See DR ¶ 55; PSS ¶ 39. In response to Plaintiff's April 16, 2019 email, Eng indicated that she "hadn't had a chance to respond yet," did not respond to Plaintiff's request to return to her position, proposed scheduling an in-person meeting for April 25, 2019, and requested that Plaintiff send a list of positions in which she was interested and an updated résumé in advance of their meeting. See DR ¶ 56; PSS ¶ 40.
During one of her conversations with Eng, Plaintiff reiterated the issue with the job listings [*23]  link and Eng told her that she would send her a list so that Plaintiff could respond with a comprehensive list of positions she wanted, but Eng did not do so. See PSS ¶¶ 35, 41. Plaintiff also inquired "what about the job I have been doing for the last 12 years? I explained to you that I do not type more than 30 minutes an hour. I render .mov files, look at graphics, have meetings about graphic packages and do research on the best way to approach graphics for international use." See id. ¶ 41. Though Plaintiff still looked at the positions that were available to "external employees" (Plaintiff's phrase), she never provided Eng with any list of positions in which she was interested (with Plaintiff explaining that by the time she was going through it, Defendant had terminated her). See DR ¶ 54; PSS ¶ 36.
Eng did not consider any alternative for Plaintiff and Plaintiff asserts that she has evidence that Eng admitted she did not offer Plaintiff any other positions or look into any other positions that may have been able to accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions. See PSS ¶ 48. While Eng confirmed that there may have been non-computer-based roles available at the time, she admitted that the [*24]  only efforts Defendant made to accommodate Plaintiff were Segal inquiring within his own department (Broadcast Operations) only for open positions, and Eng asking Plaintiff to check the career site for potential jobs. See id. ¶ 49. Segal confirmed that he did not research into any potential non-computer work. See id. ¶ 50. Neither Eng nor Segal looked into other departments for potential openings for Plaintiff. See id. ¶ 48.
On April 22, 2019, Plaintiff's doctor, Guodong Li, M.D., cleared Plaintiff to return to work without restrictions beginning on April 23, 2019, while at the same time noting "[t]he patient is experiencing constant pain in the elbows" and that "[p]ain affects the patient's daily activities." See DR ¶ 65; PSS ¶ 42. On April 22, 2019, Plaintiff informed Eng that she was released to return to work without restrictions. See DR ¶ 66; PSS ¶ 42. That same day, Eng emailed Plaintiff stating:
I received your voicemail earlier today and just saw your doctor's note dated today releasing you to return to work full duty with no restrictions. Because we received your doctor's note towards end of day today, we are not yet prepared for you to return to work tomorrow, so I'll call [*25]  you tomorrow to further discuss. In the meantime, please do not report to work tomorrow.
See PSS ¶ 42. Plaintiff tried to follow-up with Eng, but had no success in reaching her for a week. See PSS ¶ 43.
On approximately April 22, 2019, after Plaintiff's restrictions were lifted, Human Resources informed Segal that they were supportive of his decision to move forward with Plaintiff's termination for the reasons stated by Segal. See DR ¶ 67. Neither Eng nor anyone else at Defendant looked for positions that Plaintiff could return to after her restrictions were lifted. See PSS ¶ 51.
Plaintiff did not appear for the April 25, 2019 meeting with Eng. See id. ¶ 57. Plaintiff also never sent Eng a list of positions in which she was interested or her résumé. See id. ¶ 58.
On April 26, 2019, Plaintiff sent a follow-up email and inquired whether she could return to work. See PSS ¶ 44. Eng responded that she and Segal would call Plaintiff on April 29, 2019, three days later.11 See id.
On April 29, 2019, Segal and Eng informed Plaintiff that Defendant had eliminated her position and that she was eligible for rehire of available positions in the future. See DR ¶ 68; PSS ¶ 45. Plaintiff asserts she has [*26]  evidence that those involved in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment were officers, directors, or managing agents (however, the Court discusses that purported evidence, infra, in connection with its examination of Plaintiff's pursuit of punitive damages). See PSS ¶ 46.
While Defendant asserts that: "[i]n 2019, there were four staff union Graphics Artists positions within the Post-Production Department" (see DR ¶ 60) and "[t]here were no staff union Graphics Artist positions available in 2019 (id. ¶ 61), those statements appear to be inconsistent or else their meaning is unintelligible to the untrained eye.12
By April 2019, ICP no longer used the services of any graphics operators controlled by the Post-Production Department because ICP's own staff of graphics operators performed all of ICP's graphics work. See id. ¶ 63. Plaintiff conceded that individuals in-house at ICP perform the tasks that she previously-performed while Defendant employed her. See id. ¶ 77. Because ICP is one of Defendant's departments/divisions, the work Plaintiff previously performed actually stayed with Defendant (but just in a different department/division), and was still being performed by Defendant. [*27]  See PSS ¶ 52.
Plaintiff and Laura Roque f/k/a "Laura Brown" ("Roque") were the only two non-union Graphics Operators in the Post-Production Department. See DR ¶ 69. In May 2019, Defendant eliminated Roque's position because, like ICP had, her client obtained its own graphics operators and absorbed Roque's work. See id. ¶ 70. In July 2020, Defendant eliminated the position of Editor held by Todd Russ, the only remaining individual who performed any type of graphics work in Plaintiff's former business unit. See id. ¶ 71.
In approximately November 2020, the functions of the ICP department were moved from Los Angeles to London. See id. ¶ 72. By approximately December 31, 2020, Defendant had eliminated the positions of all ICP staff. See id. ¶ 73.
Nobody at Defendant ever made negative comments about Plaintiff's disability, Plaintiff's medical leave, or Plaintiff's need for accommodations. See id. ¶ 74. Plaintiff testified that she did not have an opinion as to why she was terminated and had "no idea" whether she was terminated because she had work restrictions or had gone out on medical leave. See id. ¶ 76; Docket No. 22-8, at 164:25-165:8.
D. The Parties' Arguments/Plaintiff's Claims
The bulk [*28] 13 of Plaintiff's opposition to Defendant's motion is devoted to argument regarding her reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims. It is, therefore, to those two claims that this analysis first turns. Defendant's general arguments on these claims are that 1) it made efforts to look for alternative positions that would accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions and provided her an extended and continuous leave of absence and 2) that it made efforts to engage in the interactive process, but Plaintiff refused to participate. See Docket No. 22-1, at 17:7-13.
1. Reasonable Accommodation
California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") requires employers — on pain of a civil action for damages if noncompliant — to make reasonable accommodation for the known disabilities of employees to enable them to perform a position's essential functions, unless doing so would produce undue hardship to the employer's operations. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(1) (designating as an "unlawful employment practice" the "fail[ure of an employer] to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an . . . employee," excepting accommodations that [*29]  would "produce undue hardship"); A.M. v. Albertsons, LLC, 178 Cal.App.4th 455, 463, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449 (2009); Bagatti v. Dep't of Rehab., 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 357, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002); see also Chin, Cathcart, Callahan & Lowe, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION (The Rutter Group 2020) ("Chin & Cathcart"), ¶¶ 9:2250, 9:2345. This is an employer's affirmative duty where the employer is aware of the disability, as is the case here. See Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 60, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006); Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 950-51, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶¶ 9:2251-2253.
A finite leave of absence is one example of a possible reasonable accommodation under FEHA. See Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 263, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000); Sanchez v. Swissport, Inc., 213 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1338, 153 Cal. Rptr. 3d 367 (2013); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2266. But even a single failure to accommodate may be actionable. See A.M., 178 Cal.App.4th at 465; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2254 ("Despite a pattern of successful accommodation, a single failure to accommodate an employee's disability may be actionable in some cases."). Thus, the fact that Defendant did provide Plaintiff with leave does not necessarily resolve the reasonable accommodation claim in Defendant's favor (though, of course, a factfinder may ultimately determine that it does).
A prima facie case for a reasonable accommodation claim requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that she has a disability covered by FEHA, that she is a qualified individual (i.e., that she can perform the essential functions of her position), and that Defendant failed reasonably [*30]  to accommodate her disability. See Hernandez v. Rancho Santiago Cmty. Coll. Dist., 22 Cal.App.5th 1187, 1193-94, 232 Cal. Rptr. 3d 349 (2018); Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 256; see also Chin & Cathcart ¶¶ 9:2346-2346.3 (describing a split in the case law regarding whether the ability/inability to perform the job with reasonable accommodation is part of a plaintiff's prima facie case or instead is the subject of an affirmative defense). Although there is at least an argument that this inappropriately combines/mixes the separate reasonable accommodation and interactive process claims, the Ninth Circuit — citing a California decision — has also indicated that:
An "employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless it establishes through undisputed facts" that "reasonable accommodation was offered and refused," that "there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation," or that "the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith."
Dep't of Fair Employment & Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2011) ("Lucent Techs.") (quoting Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 263); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2127 ("On [*31]  'failure reasonably to accommodate' claims, California courts have followed the Ninth Circuit's lead in placing the burden on an employer seeking summary judgment to show no triable factual issue as to whether it engaged in the mandatory interactive process in good faith.") (citing Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 260).
In Defendant's briefing, the Court perceives at least some reference to several potential avenues to a defense-favorable outcome on a reasonable accommodation claim as such a claim is outlined above (though, in truth, Defendant's briefing leaves it somewhat opaque as to which required element(s) of a prima facie reasonable accommodation claim and/or which of the particular avenues recognized in Lucent Techs./Jensen are the path(s) of victory Defendant specifically seeks to traverse): 1) whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual/can perform the essential functions; 2) that there simply was no vacant position for which Plaintiff was qualified and capable of performing; and 3) that Defendant did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the process broke down because of Plaintiff.
For instance, Defendant emphasizes its view that the essential functions of Plaintiff's job "consisted almost entirely of [*32]  computer work and required repetitive hand activity for typing and use of a mouse (grasping)," Docket No. 22-1, at 18:10-12, and that it determined that it could not accommodate Plaintiff's restrictions due to these essential functions. In addition, it asserts that Segal diligently-searched for an alternate position for Plaintiff, but was unable to find one for which she was both qualified and able to perform the essential functions, while also noting that Plaintiff did not herself identify any position which she believed she was qualified and able to perform.
The simple answer with respect to this claim at the summary judgment stage is that — no matter who bears the burden on the continued ability/inability of Plaintiff to perform the Graphics Operator position (an issue of some dispute in the California courts, as referenced supra) - genuine issues of fact bearing upon multiple relevant issues appear to preclude a resolution now. For instance, there is contradictory evidence (or at least a lack of clarity in the evidence) regarding the precise requirements of the Graphics Operator position Plaintiff had previously performed in terms of the amount of time she spent on particular tasks, [*33]  including those that pertained to restrictions Defendant believed precluded Plaintiff from being able to perform the position following her injury.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff spent 50% of her time typing and 50% of her time manipulating a computer mouse. But another reading of the testimony cited in support of this assertion is that this 50/50 split applied only to when she was "doing actual work, not waiting but . . . doing actual[] work," a conclusion that is consistent with the evidence Plaintiff then emphasizes that she also spent more time in her position trying to figure things out than actual typing, that approximately 80 percent of her time was spent on a computer (not necessarily constantly typing or constantly clicking a mouse), while the remaining 20 percent consisted of a producer or editor sitting with Plaintiff to provide instructions and feedback, and that she never typed for 8 hours a day or for 30 minutes straight. See DR ¶ 10; PSS ¶¶ 7-8, 28; Docket No. 22-8, at 38:12-39:24. Moreover, the concern reflected by Plaintiff's doctors was for continuous fine maneuvering of her hands and repetitive typing. See DR ¶¶ 13-15, 32, 34, 49; PSS ¶¶ 17, 30. According to the [*34]  evidence Plaintiff emphasizes, at least, this could be avoided and her past work experience backed that up. This factual area of course relates both to the "essential functions" question and Plaintiff's "qualified individual" status (whether she was able to perform the essential functions). See Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2247.2 (indicating that among the evidence relevant to determine whether a particular function is essential is the amount of time spent on the job performing the function and the work experiences of past incumbents on the job).
In its Reply brief, Defendant minimizes Plaintiff's attempt to call into question what her job required, and her performance of it, by citing cases concluding that "genuine issues" cannot rest upon "uncorroborated and self-serving" testimony and that a plaintiff cannot contradict her earlier version of the facts in order to create a genuine issue. However, the "uncorroborated and self-serving" testimony in the case Defendant cites for that proposition involved a plaintiff's assertion that other employees of the opposite sex were punished less severely than the plaintiff for the same conduct, see Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1059 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2002), not testimony about a plaintiff's performance of her [*35]  own job. A procedural rule that would preclude a plaintiff from providing testimony about what sorts of tasks she performed, and the amount of time she performed those tasks, in her job just because that testimony was not "corroborated" by another — who would it be, a coworker looking over her shoulder? - or "self-serving" - she is, indeed, a plaintiff in a lawsuit — would be a strange one indeed.
In addition, the Court has reviewed the evidence to determine whether Plaintiff has impermissibly contradicted herself, and concludes that she has not. The questioning at Plaintiff's deposition was simply not precise enough for the Court to confidently be able to determine that Plaintiff later gave contradictory answers on this topic, or provided contradictory information, in connection with the exact same questions/subject matter.
Beyond that, Defendant argues that whether or not an employee can perform her position is not measured by that employee's subjective belief, but instead by an objective analysis. Defendant believes the evidence pertinent to that question demonstrates clearly that Plaintiff could not perform her job with the restrictions she had. Moreover, Plaintiff's repeated reliance [*36]  on a belief that removal of a cabinet in her workspace would be a reasonable accommodation allowing her to do her job "completely misinterprets" the restrictions placed upon Plaintiff by her own doctor, according to Defendant. See Docket No. 43, at 11:2-4. But, putting aside the cabinet-removal issue (the pertinence of which is, at best, unclear to the Court), Plaintiff's ability to perform her job is bound-up-with Defendant's understanding of what that job required Plaintiff to do, and how she typically did her work (including the amounts of time spent on particular tasks). If Defendant misunderstood what Plaintiff historically had to do in the position (as the arguments on this motion suggest that it might have done), the Court cannot so easily agree with Defendant that even an objective analysis conclusively works in its favor. See, e.g., Kirbyson v. Tesoro Refining & Mktg. Co., 795 F.Supp.2d 930, 943 (N.D. Cal. 2011).
Defendant also argues that it was not required to eliminate any of the essential functions of Plaintiff's position in order to accommodate her, and that it was only obligated to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation, not the best accommodation or any specific accommodation Plaintiff requested. While Plaintiff does not dispute the former [*37]  point, it also does not appear that she ever asked Defendant to eliminate any essential function. See Docket No. 38, at 19:8-12.
As to the latter point, while it is true, the case law also recognizes that provision of a finite period of leave or other single accommodation does not necessarily resolve the question of whether an employer has reasonably accommodated an employee, suggesting that what is "reasonable" in this regard often must come down to the opinion of the factfinder. See Atkins v. City of L.A., 8 Cal.App.5th 696, 728, 214 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2017) ("Whether reassigning the plaintiffs to another position was 'reasonable' is a question of fact for the jury."); Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal.App.4th 359, 374, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015); Prilliman, 53 Cal.App.4th at 954. As suggested by cases such as A.M., Plaintiff responds that providing one type of accommodation is not necessarily enough (although it can be), and takes Defendant to task because there is evidence that Segal was the only individual who actually tried to look for potential work for Plaintiff (another form of potential accommodation), and he looked only within his own department. See PSS ¶¶ 48-49. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant actually did have work she could have performed, "at least in the capacity as a daily hire." Docket No. 38, at 4:20-21.14 Moreover, Plaintiff argues that Defendant was [*38]  required to confirm that there were no vacant positions for which Plaintiff was qualified in Defendant's entire organization, not just Segal's department. See, e.g., Jensen, 85 Cal.App.4th at 263.
If Plaintiff could have performed the essential functions of the Graphics Operator position (an issue that is dependent both upon how the "essential functions" question would be resolved and upon how Plaintiff historically performed the job), there is at least an argument that keeping her on leave — even if leave is one form of reasonable accommodation — rather than allowing her to return to that position was not a reasonable accommodation.15 See Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2266.3 ("While a leave of absence may be a reasonable accommodation, '[w]hen an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence.'") (citing 2 CCR § 11068(c) and Wallace v. County of Stanislaus, 245 Cal.App.4th 109, 134, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016)); see also Gardner v. Fed. Express Corp., 114 F.Supp.3d 889, 899 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (noting that facts "raise[d] the possibility that that a reasonable accommodation could have been made for [the plaintiff] to return to work immediately"). But even if the conclusion is reached that Plaintiff could not have performed the essential functions of the Graphics Operator position, [*39]  even with reasonable accommodations, there is also an open question — one that is tied-up with Plaintiff's interactive process claim, discussed infra - of whether Defendant made a sufficient effort to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff via a job transfer to a different available position.
Because of issues tied more-directly to that interactive process claim, it is not even clear that the parties or the Court have a clear understanding of what alternative positions within Defendant's organization were even available from February to April of 2019. As noted previously, there is evidence supporting (though not requiring) a conclusion that Defendant — via Segal — looked only in a single department, and a factfinder might conclude that Defendant (via Eng) did not take sufficient steps to aid Plaintiff in her own attempt to learn about positions that might have been available. See PSS ¶¶ 25, 28, 30, 33, 37-38, 40-41, 43-44, 47-51; DR ¶¶ 53, 56. Plaintiff informed Eng that she was having difficulty with the link that Eng sent, and there is evidence that Eng told Plaintiff that Eng would provide her with a list, but never did. See PSS ¶¶ 33, 35, 41; see also Prilliman, 53 Cal.App.4th at ("[W]e [*40]  conclude that an employer who knows of the disability of an employee has an affirmative duty to make known to the employee other suitable job opportunities with the employer and to determine whether the employee is interested in, and qualified for, those positions, if the employer can do so without undue hardship or if the employer offers similar assistance or benefit to other disabled or nondisabled employees or has a policy of offering such assistance or benefit to any other employees."); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2269 ("Telling the disabled employee to check available job postings does not satisfy the employer's duty to reassign or transfer a disabled employee to a vacant position. The employer is in a better position to know what jobs are vacant or may become vacant to which the person with the disability can be assigned.") (citing 2 CCR § 11068(d)(1), Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal.App.4th 1376, 1389-90, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000), and Swanson v. Morongo Unified Sch. Dist., 232 Cal.App.4th 954, 970, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014)); id. ¶ 9:2346.4 (indicating that, at summary judgment, an employer bears a "greater burden" because "the employer must show the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of both the former job and any available vacant position to which he or she might be reassigned as a reasonable accommodation").16 If Defendant did not reasonably [*41]  or sufficiently explore or aid Plaintiff in her exploration of other positions, a factfinder could determine that Defendant did not comply with its reasonable accommodation obligation overall.
In short (and as supplemented by the interactive process discussion which follows), there is too much unknown in how a factfinder would resolve several key questions for this Court to conclude that there is simply no genuine issue here. The Court is not prepared to find that Defendant reasonably accommodated Plaintiff as a matter of law. The Court therefore denies Defendant's motion to the extent it is directed at Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim.
2. Interactive Process
Failure to engage in the interactive process is also an "unlawful employment practice" under Government Code Section 12940. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) (providing that it is an "unlawful employment practice" for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition"); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2347. "[T]he interactive [*42]  process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (quoting Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir. 2000)). Taking initial steps does not absolve an employer of liability if the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process. See id. at 984-87 (concluding that plaintiff raised triable issue of fact over responsibility for breakdown in interactive process where reasonable jury could find employer had "refus[ed] to provide information about available positions that might have assisted [the plaintiff] in preparing a list of her work-related medical restrictions"); see also Chin & Cathcart ¶ 9:2281.2.
As to this claim, Defendant first notes that an employer cannot be liable under an interactive process claim where the employer actually provides an employee a reasonable accommodation (which Defendant asserts it did by providing Plaintiff extended medical leave).17 However, the Court has concluded above that a factfinder may determine that Defendant did not reasonably accommodate Plaintiff and/or that even if the leave Defendant extended to Plaintiff was [*43]  an initial reasonable accommodation, the question of whether Defendant was still reasonably accommodating Plaintiff in the February-April 2019 timeframe may itself be open to a factfinder's determination. Indeed, Plaintiff argues that "[n]o one discussed her capabilities or what duties she could perform, and no one offered her accommodations or any alternative position." Docket No. 38, at 20:20-22. As discussed earlier, there is evidence in the record supporting these assertions.
Beyond that initial point, Defendant argues that it is clear it fulfilled its obligation to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process, whereas Plaintiff caused the process to break down. Defendant believes the evidence shows that it was diligent in attempting to communicate with Plaintiff about her restrictions and at all times acted in good faith to try to determine how to accommodate her, including by communicating with Plaintiff's physicians regarding clarification of her restrictions18 and working with Segal to evaluate whether Plaintiff could perform with her restrictions, and in terms of Segal's and Eng's efforts to find a position for Plaintiff. [*44]  Ultimately, in Defendant's view, Plaintiff ignored Eng's requests and did not attend a meeting Eng scheduled with her. Because, in Defendant's view, Plaintiff was not cooperating with Eng's efforts, in particular, to help her, Defendant takes the position that it was impossible for it to place her in any other position because "there were no graphics positions available at Universal City in the timeframes in which Plaintiff contends she could have worked" and because Plaintiff had only worked exclusively as a graphics operator for Defendant. Docket No. 22-1, at 20-21 n.7.
The Court believes this is a too-one-sided view of the evidence germane to the question of who was responsible for any breakdown in the interactive process (if there was indeed a breakdown). There is clearly evidence supporting the view that Plaintiff made efforts to explain to Defendant her capabilities (and how they were consistent with the Graphic Operator's position), explore other positions within Defendant's organization, and to communicate with Eng generally. As Plaintiff views the material before the Court, Defendant was "solely and exclusively responsible for the breakdown in communication" [*45]  in regard to her interactive process because it "chose unilaterally (1) to reject Plaintiff's suggestions without any explanation or medical justification, (2) not to provide Plaintiff with sufficient time to find alternative positions on Defendant's external job site, and (3) terminate Plaintiff[] without offering her any alternative positions." Docket No. 38, at 21:5-6, 21:12-15. This is not to say that Plaintiff will prevail in this version of events,19 but there is evidence that would allow a factfinder to determine that Defendant — primarily through Eng — was not sufficiently responsive or helpful to Plaintiff in her efforts (putting aside the question of whether it was up to Plaintiff to put forth the effort in these regards to begin with).
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant had already decided to terminate her before it made any efforts to engage in the interactive process, rendering that process a sham and not in good faith. Certainly this is not true with respect to Defendant putting forth any efforts. There is also evidence in the record that Defendant could have started the process of eliminating Plaintiff's position at least as early as November 2018, but — with no obvious [*46]  explanation for the delay — did not begin to do so until February or March of 2019, after Plaintiff had supplied her February 1, 2019 doctor's note. At the same time, however, the effort to eliminate Plaintiff's position certainly — and somewhat inexplicably, at least in terms of timing — ramped-up at the same time Defendant was supposed to be engaging in an interactive process with Plaintiff. Moreover, there is evidence that would support a view that Defendant engaged in no interactive process whatsoever after Plaintiff informed Defendant on April 22, 2019 that she could return to work without restrictions. In the end, therefore, there would appear to be an open question as to whether Defendant was engaging in the process in good faith. This too is a reason working against resolving this claim at the summary judgment stage.20
In the end, for the reasons expressed above, the Court believes there are facts that could support a finding favorable to either Defendant or Plaintiff on this claim, meaning that it is inappropriate for disposition at summary judgment. Principally, the Court believes that it is not without debate as to which party is responsible for any breakdown [*47]  in the interactive process, if there was one. In addition, there are facts that both parties can point to in support of an assertion that the other side was not participating in the process in good faith.
Defendant's motion is denied insofar as it seeks partial summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's interactive process claim.
3. Punitive Damages
Defendant also challenges Plaintiff's ability to recover punitive damages arguing, among other things, that Plaintiff has no evidence of an officer, director or managing agent playing the role required, for implementation of such a remedy, by California Civil Code § 3294(b). Plaintiff's theory for punitive damages is evidence she believes demonstrates Defendant "purposely create[d] a false narrative to justify [her] termination." Docket No. 38, at 22:22-23. She also asserts that Segal received "approval" from Defendant's legal counsel and Human Relations to move forward with Plaintiff's termination, pointing to several specific individuals and their job titles.
Putting aside the question of whether Plaintiff has sufficient evidence of the type of conduct required for an award of punitive damages for the time being (because it may not be necessary for the Court to address [*48]  it at all), in its Reply brief, Defendant argues that it is undisputed that Segal was the only decision-maker regarding Plaintiff's position's elimination, even though Legal and Human Resources were consulted on the decision and supported it. Segal, Defendant argues, is not an officer, director, or managing agent, and the only "evidence" Plaintiff has provided that any of the three specific individuals she identifies did fill such a role is the nature of their job titles. With at least this argument, the Court agrees.21
In connection with Plaintiff's pursuit of punitive damages, Defendant plainly argued that neither Segal nor anyone else involved constituted the "officer, director, or managing agent" required under California law. In other words, it "pointed out" - as the moving party — a gap in the evidence necessary for Plaintiff to recover punitive damages. In attempting to create a triable issue of fact on that point, Plaintiff directed attention to a single piece of evidence in support of her assertion that "Defendant admitted that those involved in the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment were officers, directors, or managing agents." PSS ¶ 46. That single piece of evidence [*49]  consists of five lines from Love's deposition in which Love indicates that one of the individuals who played some role in approving Segal's decision to eliminate Plaintiff's position was "the vice president of human resources for West Coast Studio Operations." See Docket No. 35-3, at pg. 199 of 360. Plaintiff supplies no evidence of what that job title entails, or the responsibilities or activities of that individual.22 See Powerhouse Motorsports Grp., Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., 221 Cal.App.4th 867, 886, 164 Cal. Rptr. 3d 811 (2013); Cruz v. HomeBase, 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435 (2000). Nor does she cite to any case law indicating that a person in such a role necessarily fits within the "officer, director, or managing agent" grouping. As a result, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff has complied with its obligation as the non-moving party on this issue. See T.W. Elec. Serv., 809 F.2d at 630; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Plaintiff has not demonstrated a genuine issue of fact whether any "officer, director, or managing agent" was involved in the conduct which, in her theory, supports a claim for punitive damages.
For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendant partial summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's ability to recover punitive damages.
4. The Remaining Issues
The Court is somewhat reluctant to proceed, at least at this time, beyond Plaintiff's reasonable [*50]  accommodation and interactive process claims and the issue of punitive damages for at least a couple of reasons. First, as noted in Footnote 13, supra, there is the question of whether the Court should consider Plaintiff's Notice of Errata and, if so, whether it should allow Defendant a further opportunity to respond to it. Second, however, is an issue of whether consideration of any of that will make a difference on this motion (at least for Plaintiff's discrimination, failure-to-prevent, and wrongful termination claims), because there appears to be case law supporting the conclusion that an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee is itself a form of disability discrimination that would support a claim under California Government Code § 12940(a). See Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal.App.4th at 969 (reversing summary adjudication of a Section 12940(a) claim because plaintiff had "raised a triable issue of fact that she was unlawfully discharged because of her disability because Neiman Marcus could have but did not provide her with a reasonable accommodation (reassignment to a vacant position) that would have allowed her to continue working with the company"); id. at 978 (finding triable issue on reasonable accommodation for same reason). If that is the case, and the [*51]  Court has already determined that it cannot summarily adjudicate Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim in Defendant's favor, then it is difficult to see how any further briefing on or consideration of Plaintiff's discrimination claim would lead to Defendant prevailing on that claim (and the others that are derivative of it) at this time.
Using a viable reasonable accommodation claim to prop-up a discrimination claim, however, does not appear to have been the subject of any briefing supplied by the parties thus far, apart from Defendant's single unsupported-by-citation sentence in its Reply that "Plaintiff cannot bootstrap her discrimination claim to her claims for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to accommodate." Docket No. 43, at 5:25-27.
If, however, the Court sticks with its inclination to leave Plaintiff's discrimination, failure-to-prevent and wrongful termination claims as survivors of this motion given the outcome on the reasonable accommodation claim, that would leave only Plaintiff's retaliation claim. As noted previously, Plaintiff gave very little attention to her retaliation claim, in either her original Opposition brief or in her Notice of Errata. [*52]  This might ordinarily be enough to say that she has conceded Defendant's arguments on that claim.23 But the Court has some hesitancy here, as well.
The reason for that hesitancy is the timing of Defendant's actions here. There is evidence that Defendant did not even begin the process of eliminating Plaintiff's position until after she had given her February 1, 2019 doctor's note releasing her for return to work with restrictions. See DR ¶¶ 38, 43, 45, 62; PSS ¶¶ 21, 53. There is also evidence to support a conclusion that Defendant had sufficient reason to do so at least as early as November 2018 yet, for whatever (unexplained) reason, held off on doing so. See DR ¶¶ 30-31. In addition, the evidence is clear that Defendant did not finalize the elimination of Plaintiff's position until later the same day that she provided Defendant with a doctor's note indicating that she could return to work without restrictions. See DR ¶ 67.
However, it is Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's taking of leave was the only protected activity supporting Plaintiff's retaliation claim. See Docket No. 22-1, at 15:19-24. This is at least somewhat consistent with Plaintiff's allegations in the FAC. See FAC ¶ [*53]  71 ("Plaintiff engaged in the protected activities of reporting her injuries and taking medical leave."). Moreover, Plaintiff does nothing to disabuse Defendant or the Court of this understanding in her Opposition brief (or her Notice of Errata) - indeed, as noted, her Opposition brief hardly even mentions her retaliation claim.
The troubling timing of the events discussed two paragraphs earlier do not work with a retaliation claim based on Plaintiff's report of her injuries and taking medical leave, which occurred in April 2018. This is both because of the significant problem it creates with respect to Plaintiff being able to demonstrate the causal connection element of her prima facie retaliation case, see Husman v. Toyota Motor Credit Corp., 12 Cal.App.5th 1168, 1193, 220 Cal. Rptr. 3d 42 (2017), and because it effectively eliminates her ability to show that Defendant's proffered legitimate reasons for the elimination of Plaintiff's position — which is plentiful — was in fact a pretext covering up a retaliatory motive (at least any motive connected to her reports of her injury and her taking leave), see Nejadian v. Cty. of L.A., 40 Cal.App.5th 703, 725-27, 253 Cal. Rptr. 3d 404 (2019) and Loggins v. Kaiser Permanent Int'l, 151 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1109, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007).
As a result, given the limitations imposed on Plaintiff's retaliation claim by her own pleadings and her failure to address that claim in any meaningful fashion in [*54]  her papers, the Court is inclined to rule in favor of Defendant on this motion not just with respect to the issue of Plaintiff's ability to recover punitive damages, but also in connection with Plaintiff's third claim for relief.
5. Supplemental Briefing
At the June 14, 2021 hearing on the motion, the Court allowed — and the parties did file — supplemental briefs on a number of issues raised at the hearing. See ECF Nos. 50, 53-59. The Court makes the following observations in regards to the supplemental briefing.
With respect to punitive damages, Plaintiff's newly proffered evidence fails to demonstrate that the people he has identified are "managing agents," as that concept is understood. Simply being able to agree with, or even providing necessary approval of, the elimination of an employee position does not amounts to "broad discretionary powers" or "substantial discretionary authority" in a corporate entity within the meaning of White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 577, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999), and the contention that certain positions are "inherently" managing agents is an argument based on nothing more than a job title which is insufficient to establish managing agent status. Holtzclaw, 795 F.Supp.2d at 1022 ("Titles alone are insufficient and call for speculation.").
With respect [*55]  to retaliation, the tentative noted that the "protected activity" Plaintiff had identified was "reporting her injuries and taking medical leave." Docket No. 50, at p. 33 of 33. She now attempts to say it is "taking medical leave for her surgery and by attempting to return with restrictions," Docket No. 55, at 3:21-23, but cites nothing in the First Amended Complaint supporting the "attempting to return with restrictions" theory of protected activity;" and she never made any such contention in her original Opposition. Plaintiff will not be allowed to change her theory in its entirety at the supplemental briefing stage when she paid virtually no attention to her retaliation claim in her original Opposition. As a result, the Court would still grant the motion with respect to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.
As to Defendant's supplemental argument regarding wrongful termination, again that is really a matter for the jury. Plaintiff isn't simply relying on temporal proximity - e.g., "I did [   ] and 4 days later, I was terminated." Here, not only was there a closeness in time between her attempts to return to work and her termination, but Defendant also seemingly DELAYED taking action that [*56]  it says it justifiably took until after Plaintiff attempted to return to work with restrictions and then somewhat-inexplicably seemingly-ignored her communication of her ability to return to work WITHOUT restrictions until it had time to finally approve the elimination of her position. That is significantly more than mere temporal-proximity. Along these same lines, the Court finds wanting Defendant's late attempt to assert that Segal's reasons for the delay in taking action from November to February are undisputed. Though Defendant has identified testimony in the record that supports those reasons, it still hasn't cited to any paragraphs in the DR where it presented those reasons as undisputed, giving Plaintiff an opportunity to properly dispute them. Factual assertions made in a brief are insufficient in this regard. Plaintiff correctly points out that Defendant's attempt to introduce entirely new evidence — through a June 21st declaration from Jason Segal — should not be allowed at this time for purposes of the summary judgment motion.
Next, even if Defendant did have a sufficient basis for the Court to "adjudicate for all purposes in the action that Plaintiff's termination was lawful," [*57]  waiting until supplemental briefing to make a Rule 56(g) request (or even to cite to that rule) is simply too late (as part of the summary judgment process). Even if it isn't too late, the Court's decision whether to "enter an order stating any material fact . . . that is not genuinely in dispute" is entirely within the Court's discretion.
Finally, Plaintiff supplies citations to the record to respond to evidentiary deficiencies the Court originally perceived, as described in Footnotes 14 and 15 of the Tentative Ruling. Defendant makes no effort to respond to those citations.

III. Conclusion
The Court grants Defendant's motion with respect to Plaintiff's ability to recover punitive damages and as to Plaintiff's claim for retaliation. The Court otherwise denies the remainder of Defendant's motion.
