Opinion


ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Pending before the Court is Defendant SCCA Store Holdings, Inc., dba Saks Fifth Avenue's ("Defendant" or "Saks") Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 23) and Motion for Sanctions (docket no. 49). Plaintiff Sima Shamir ("Plaintiff" or "Shamir") filed Oppositions and Defendant filed Replies. The Court heard oral argument on June 2, 2014. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS the Motion for Summary Judgment and DENIES the Motion for Sanctions.

I. BACKGROUND
This is a disability discrimination suit brought by Plaintiff Sima Shamir, who was employed by Defendant Saks as a beauty sales specialist beginning on February 22, 2010. Plaintiff went on a leave of absence from work for medical reasons on October 19, 2011. Saks terminated Plaintiff's employment [*2]  on October 17, 2012, after Plaintiff had been on a leave of absence for about one year.
On March 13, 2013, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit. Plaintiff contends that Saks' treatment of her prior to and during her leave of absence, and her termination, constituted disability discrimination in violation of California law. Plaintiff's Fist Amended Complaint ("FAC") asserts the following causes of action: (1) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (Cal. Gov't C. § 12900, et seq., "FEHA"); (2) failure to reasonably accommodate in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA; (4) retaliation in violation of FEHA; and (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, premised on the foregoing FEHA violations.
Saks now moves for summary judgment on all claims.

II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Summary judgment shall be granted where "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
A "genuine issue" of material fact [*3]  exists only when the nonmoving party makes a sufficient showing on the essential elements of its claims on which it bears the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). An issue of fact is genuine if it reasonably can be resolved in favor of either party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51. The nonmovant's evidence is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the nonmovant's favor. Id. at 255. But "mere disagreement or the bald assertion that a genuine issue of material fact exists" does not preclude summary judgment. Harper v. Wallingford, 877 F.2d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 1989).

III. UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS
The following material facts are largely undisputed; to the extent the parties purported to dispute any of these facts, the disputes were illusory.1
Plaintiff began her employment with Saks on or about February 22, 2010, as a beauty specialist at Saks' Beverly Hills store. Plaintiff was eligible for short term disability benefits that provided 26 weeks of absence running concurrently with Family Medical Leave Act and California Family Right Act leave. Saks also provides discretionary personal leaves of absence for up to 12 weeks. Facts 1-3.
On July 11, 2011, Plaintiff fell off her chair at work. Dr. Darvish, a Saks-selected doctor, examined Plaintiff and determined that she had sprained her left [*4]  wrist, shoulder, and ankle. Dr. Darvish advised that Plaintiff could return to work the next day with modified duties. Plaintiff did not return to work until seven days later, July 18, 2011, for one day, and then did not return to work again until August 2, 2011. Facts 5-7.
After her fall, Plaintiff asked her supervisor Diana Mitchell if she could "sit for a bit because of my leg," and Mitchell's response was a "flat no." Others had been told to "get up" when sitting and Plaintiff did not want to get in trouble so she did not sit down. Fact 59.
Although Plaintiff had follow-up appointments scheduled with Dr. Darvish after her initial x-rays, Plaintiff testified that she did not keep those appointments because "I didn't believe that I needed to. I thought that I was getting better and that it was okay, so I didn't need to see him." Fact 8.
Plaintiff continued to work regular hours between August 2, 2011 and October 17, 2011, and Saks received no doctor's notes about Plaintiff's condition during this time. Fact 13.
On October 17, 2011, Plaintiff went to the Providence Tarzana Medical Center Emergency Department. Plaintiff saw Dr. Meszaros, who excused Plaintiff from work for medical reasons [*5]  from October 19, 2011 through October 25, 2011. On October 26, 2011, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave until November 7, 2011. Facts 14-16; Exhs. 3, 4.
On November 3, 2011, Dr. Lilian Szydlo provided a note excusing Plaintiff from work from November 3, 2011 to December 11, 2011. Fact 17.
On November 30, 2011, Dr. Szydlo excused Plaintiff from work from December 12, 2011 to January 8, 2012, with a return to work date of January 9, 2012. Fact 19. On January 9, 2012, Plaintiff did not return to work. Fact 21. On January 12, 2012, Dr. Pfeffer extended Plaintiff's leave from January 8, 2012 through January 18, 2012. Fact 22.
On January 17, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave for sixty more days starting January 18, 2012. Fact 23.
On February 29, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave again, through April 29, 2012. Fact 24.
On March 7, 2012, Dr. Meszaros notified Saks that Plaintiff could return to work on April 16, 2012. Dr. Meszaros stated that Plaintiff needed work restrictions, including that she "should not stand for a prolonged period of time, no more than 6 hours a day. Please provide rest periods every 20-25 minutes. She should not lift heavy objects; no more than [*6]  15 pounds, until further notice." Fact 25.
On April 19, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave again, from April 15, 2012 to June 1, 2012, to return to work on June 4, 2012. Fact 30.
On May 24, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave to June 10, 2012, with a return to work date of June 11, 2012, with restrictions. Fact 32.
No one from Saks told Plaintiff that she could not come back to work with the restrictions outlined in Dr. Meszaros's May 24, 2012 note. Fact 33.
On June 7, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave through June 30, 2012, to return to work on July 2, 2012. Fact 34.
On July 2, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave from June 29, 2012 to August 5, 2012. Fact 35.
On August 1, 2012, Dr. Meszaros extended Plaintiff's leave through September 3, 2012. Fact 38.
Plaintiff did not return to work on September 4, 2012, as indicated by Dr. Meszaros, "because I couldn't," and did not provide a doctor's note to Saks explaining her absence. Fact 41.
On September 26, 2012, Marc Perez, Saks's Talent Development Coordinator, left Plaintiff a voicemail. What exactly Perez said is unknown because neither party described it directly or provided a transcript. Plaintiff [*7]  stated that Perez "asked me to call" back, but that she did not return the call because "my understanding was that he needed more information from a doctor. I didn't have anything to add to my doctor's notes," and "if I don't come back within a certain time . . . I will be fired." Facts 42-43.
On September 27, Dr. Pfeffer sent Saks a note stating that Plaintiff would be "unable to perform her usual job due to her need to be off her feet," and that her "work status" would be determined during an October 9, 2012 appointment with Pfeffer. Fact 44.
On October 1, 2012, Marc Perez left Plaintiff a voicemail and sent her a letter about her employment with Saks. Plaintiff did not call or email Perez or contact anyone at Saks in response to Perez's voicemail and letter. Facts 45-46.
Dr. Pfeffer provided a doctor's note on October 9, 2012 stating that Plaintiff would not be able to return to work and would need to be off work through December 10, 2012. Fact 48.
Saks terminated Plaintiff's employment on or about October 17, 2012. FAC 23-24.
Plaintiff filed her charge with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing on January 21, 2013 and immediately received a right to sue letter. Fact 4.

IV. DISCUSSION [*8] 

A. Legal Framework for Employment Discrimination Claims
The parties disagree about whether the Court should apply the three-step burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), or whether the Court should side-step the framework and merely determine "whether the plaintiff has successfully demonstrated that she was the victim of . . . discrimination on the part of the employer." Cheal v. El Camino Hospital, 223 Cal.App.4th 736, 739 fn. 1, 167 Cal. Rptr. 3d 485 (2014).
California courts analyzing employment discrimination claims under FEHA at the summary judgment stage have relied on federal precedent developed for analogous claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including the McDonnell Douglas framework. See Goodwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1219 (9th Cir. 1998) ("California law under the [FEHA] mirrors federal law under Title VII."); Guz v. Bechtel Nat., Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) ("Because of the similarity between state and federal discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes."). However, "'nothing compels the parties to invoke the McDonnell Douglas presumption.'" McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1122 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Costa v. Desert Palace, Inc., 299 F.3d 838, 854-55 (9th Cir. 2002) aff'd, 539 U.S. 90, 123 S. Ct. 2148, 156 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2003)). Rather, it appears that whether to invoke McDonnell Douglas is up to the plaintiff: "when responding to a summary judgment motion, the plaintiff is presented with a choice regarding how to establish his or her case. [He or she] may proceed by using the McDonnell [*9]  Douglas framework, or alternatively, may simply produce direct or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely than not motivated [the adverse employment decision]." McGinest, 360 F.3d at 1122.
Plaintiff evidently wishes to forego the McDonnell Douglas framework, so the Court will not rely upon it. As such, the Court will simply determine whether Defendant has shown the absence of a triable issue of fact as to Plaintiff's claim.
Plaintiff's claims arise out of her assertion that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability. To establish a prima facie case, Plaintiff "must show (1) [she] suffers from a disability, (2) [she] is otherwise qualified to do [her] job, (3) [she] suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) the employer harbored discriminatory intent." Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1246-47, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008).

B. Insofar As Plaintiff's Claims are Premised on Defendant's Alleged Failure to Accommodate her Shortly After her July 2011 Fall, Those Claims are Time-Barred.
Plaintiff's claims rest in part on Defendant's alleged failure to accommodate her shortly after she fell off a chair at work and injured her ankle in July 2011. Plaintiff asserts that she asked her supervisor Diane Mitchell if she could sit, [*10]  but Mitchell's response was a "flat no." The record does not indicate the exact date on which Mitchell denied Plaintiff's request, but it had to have happened between July 2011 (the time of Plaintiff's fall) and October 2011, when Plaintiff went on leave.
A plaintiff pursuing a FEHA claim must exhaust his or her administrative remedies before filing suit. Rojo v. Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 88, 276 Cal. Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373 (1990). FEHA requires an employee to file a charge with the Department of Fair Housing and Employment ("DFEH") within one year of the alleged discrimination. See Gov't C. § 12960. Here, Plaintiff filed her DFEH claim and immediately received right to sue letters on January 21, 2013. Thus, this action is timely only with respect to conduct occurring between January 21, 2012 and January 21, 2013. Because Mitchell's denial of Plaintiff's request to sit occurred before January 21, 2012, it is time-barred and not actionable.
Plaintiff argues that the continuing violation doctrine renders Mitchell's denial timely. However, as discussed below, none of the subsequent conduct as to which Plaintiff's complaint is timely can support any of her claims, so there are no "live" claims to which the 2011 conduct can be anchored. Thus, the continuing violation [*11]  doctrine cannot salvage Plaintiff's claims insofar as they are based on conduct occurring before the limitations period. Therefore, claims premised on Mitchell's denial of Plaintiff's request to sit are time-barred.

C. Plaintiff Is Not an "Otherwise Qualified" Individual.
A plaintiff asserting disability discrimination claim under FEHA must show that she is "otherwise qualified" for employment. A person is "otherwise qualified" only if he is capable of performing the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(1). FEHA allows an employer to discharge a physically disabled employee who, "because of his or her physical [] disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Gov't C. § 12940(a)(1). The term "essential duties" refers to the fundamental job duties of the position the individual holds or desires. Gov't C. § 12926(f).
Plaintiff worked at Defendant's store as a beauty specialist sales associate at the Clarins counter. It stands to reason — and Plaintiff does not argue otherwise — that physical presence at Defendant's store is an essential function of this job. Indeed, courts regularly hold that attendance is an essential job function such that [*12]  an employee's inability to be physically present at work, or excessive absenteeism, can render an employee not otherwise qualified under FEHA or the ADA. See, e.g., Pettus v. Cole, 49 Cal.App.4th 402, 463 fn. 44, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 46 (1996) (employee would no longer have been "qualified" to continue his employment if he could not regularly report to work); Kennedy v. Applause, Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19216, 1994 WL 740765 *2-3 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 1994) aff'd, 90 F.3d 1477 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing "[n]umerous federal courts [that] have held that disabled employees cannot establish that they can sufficiently perform the essential functions of a job without showing they can maintain a regular and reliable level of attendance at that job," and finding that an employee with chronic fatigue syndrome who could not regularly report to work was not a qualified individual with a disability).
The undisputed facts demonstrate that from October 2011 when Plaintiff first went out on leave until she was terminated approximately one year later, Plaintiff was simply unable to be physically present at Defendant's store: Plaintiff obtained a series of notes from her doctors stating she was unable to work because of pain in her feet and legs. Several of these notes projected a return-to-work date, but each such note was succeeded by another note extending Plaintiff's leave. As a result, Plaintiff's [*13]  leave of absence became indefinite. "An employer . . . is not required to provide an indefinite leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11068(c). The record reflects no accommodation that Defendant could have provided Plaintiff other than continually and indefinitely extending Plaintiff's leave of absence. The law does not view such an accommodation as "reasonable," so an employer is not obligated to provide it.
Plaintiff faults Defendant for not providing any accommodations other than leave. Pointing to several doctor's notes projecting that she would be able to return to work with particular accommodations, and to her own testimony that she wanted to work, Plaintiff states that Defendant should have engaged with her to identify accommodations that would allow her to resume working. Plaintiff asserts that, as a result, instead of providing accommodations that would allow her to return to work, Defendant forced her to take an extended leave of absence such that she exhausted her leave time, purposely rendering her vulnerable to termination.
This line of argument fails. None of the accommodations specified in the doctor's notes became relevant because each note was followed by another [*14]  note further extending Plaintiff's leave of absence. Because Plaintiff did not, in fact, return to work on any of those projected return-to-work dates (or on any other dates, in fact), Defendant had no opportunity to implement the accommodations Plaintiff's doctors recommended. As such, Defendant did not deny Plaintiff any accommodations. To the contrary, Defendant repeatedly granted Plaintiff the only accommodation she sought and that was consistent with her doctor's medical opinions — personal leave.
Furthermore, as noted, the objective medical evidence Plaintiff herself presented to Defendant was that she was unable to work. Plaintiff's current assertion that she would have been able to work given some other accommodation does not raise a triable issue of fact as to whether she was "otherwise qualified" because "to rule in favor of plaintiff on this point would be to hold that the employer should have returned plaintiff to work when the professional medical judgment was that [she] was physically incapacitated." Swonke v. Sprint, 327 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1133 (N.D. Cal. 2004). See also Ott v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13986, 1997 WL 231110 *6 (N.D. Cal. 1997) ("given the medical evidence presented, plaintiff's subjective opinion concerning his ability to work is facially insufficient to establish that he was qualified [*15]  to return to work"); see also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 110912(b)(2)(E) (in context of leave required by the California Family Rights Act, entitling employer to insist on doctor's release verifying that the employee is able to return to work following medical leave).
In short, Plaintiff was not "otherwise qualified" because she could not perform an essential function of her job — being personally present — with or without accommodations. Because Plaintiff cannot establish this prima facie element of her claims for disability discrimination, her first and second claims for relief fail.

D. Plaintiff's Claim for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process, for Retaliation, and for Wrongful Termination Also Fail.
Plaintiff also asserts a separate claim for failure to engage in the interactive process (third claim). The FEHA requires an employer to engage in an interactive process with a qualified person with a disability in order to determine potential reasonable accommodations for the person. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n) (it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity. . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in [*16]  response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition."). An employer may be held liable under FEHA for failing to engage in the interactive process. See, e.g., A.M. v. Albertsons, LLC, 178 Cal. App. 4th 455, 465, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 449 (2009) (employer who otherwise accommodated disabled employee can be held liable for failing to continue the interactive process).
As noted above, Defendant relied on Plaintiff's doctors' medical opinions, as reflected in the series of doctor's notes, that Plaintiff was unable to work for the entirety of her leave; because Plaintiff's doctors never cleared Plaintiff to return to work, Defendant never had occasion to discuss accommodations with Plaintiff. See Swonke, 327 F. Supp. 2d at 1137 (summary judgment for employer on claim for failure to engage in interactive process because "there was nothing the employer could do until it received notice that plaintiff would be released to work with or without restrictions. Given the series of medical providers' notes that plaintiff presented to the company. . . there were no accommodations that could have possibly been consistent with the medical opinion that he was totally disabled from any employment.").
At oral argument, Plaintiff's [*17]  counsel argued strenuously that Defendant should have contacted Plaintiff while she was on leave to offer her the opportunity to return to work with the accommodations indicated in various doctor's notes. Plaintiff conceded that Defendant did in fact contact her several times by telephone and letter during her leave and that she failed to respond, but faulted Defendant's attempts at communication as untimely and insufficient because Defendant did not expressly offer to provide accommodations. Plaintiff also referred to Court to Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) for the proposition that "'an employer cannot slavishly defer to a physician's opinion . . .'" Gelfo, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 50 fn 11.
This line of argument is not persuasive. In her papers, Plaintiff points to four doctor's notes that identify accommodations Plaintiff would need upon her return to work (Exhs. 4, 10, 14, 17) and one note highlighting Plaintiff's limitations (Exh. 21), and faults Defendant for not contacting her in response to any of these notes. See Pl.'s Response to Fact 41. As stated above, however, each of these notes was succeeded by another doctor's note providing the medical opinion that Plaintiff could not return to work, and asking for her leave to be extended. Defendant [*18]  extended Plaintiff's leave each time, until she exhausted it. At no time did the other accommodations Plaintiff's doctors identified as necessary upon her return to work become anything more than hypothetical because at no time did Defendant receive any medical opinion clearing Plaintiff to return to work. Stated slightly differently, Defendant was never obligated to engage in the interactive process with Plaintiff to identify the accommodations Plaintiff would need upon her return to work — even though specified in the doctor's notes — because Plaintiff's doctors never authorized her to return to work.
Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) does not change this analysis, as is it not on point. As Plaintiff stated, the Court opined that "'an employer cannot slavishly defer to a physician's opinion. . .'"; however, the remainder of this quote reads "'. . . without first pausing to assess the objective reasonableness of the physician's conclusions.'" Gelfo, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 50 fn. 11. There, the employer relied on the medical opinion of a doctor who never examined a job applicant to find that she could not perform the essential functions of the job for which she was applying. Not surprisingly, the Court found that the employer should not have relied on this [*19]  medical opinion because it was unfounded. No similar issue exists here: Plaintiff herself presented notes from her own doctors, after they examined her, stating she was disabled and could not work. Plaintiff has never claimed — either now or while she on leave — that the notes she herself provided from some three different doctors of her own choosing were faulty and that Defendant should have disregarded them.
That Defendant did in fact attempt to contact Plaintiff (despite not being obligated to), and that Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendant, further undermines Plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff's testimony reveals that she didn't respond to Defendant's attempts to contact her — even to Chris Perez's voicemail message expressly asking her to call back — because she assumed she could not provide additional information Defendant might have needed. The Court cannot conceive of any reason why Plaintiff's assumptions and resulting failure to reciprocate Defendant's attempts at communication should expose Defendant to liability for failing to engage in the interactive process. Plaintiff's complaint that neither Defendant's voicemail messages nor its letter expressly mentioned "accommodations" [*20]  does not lend her argument any greater force. The interactive process is described as "informal." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12941.6(e) (incorporating into FEHA the EEOC's interpretive guidance concerning reasonable accommodations under the ADA) and 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (stating "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the [employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the qualified individual with a disability.") (emphasis added). To interpret FEHA as requiring an employer to use the magic word "accommodations" would be inconsistent with the description of the interactive process as being informal. Here, Defendant contacted Plaintiff several times about her employment and asked her to respond; Plaintiff failed to respond. The proverbial ball was in Plaintiff's court, and Defendant prompted her more than once to return it, but she didn't. In light of the fact that Plaintiff's doctors never cleared her to return to work, there was no reason for Defendant to engage in the interactive process. However, to the extent some interaction was arguably required, Defendant's attempts to reach Plaintiff — even if they lacked the magic word upon Plaintiff now rests her claim — were sufficient [*21]  as a matter of law. Given these facts, Defendant cannot be liable for failing to engage in the interactive process.
Ultimately, Plaintiff has presented no evidence creating a triable issue of fact that Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process, so her claim that Defendant violated FEHA by failing to engage in the interactive process fails.
Plaintiff's claims for retaliation in violation of FEHA and for wrongful termination in violation of public policy (fourth and fifth claims) are both premised on her disability discrimination claims. Because the latter fail, so do the former.

E. Defendant's Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
Defendant seeks sanctions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c) against Plaintiff and her counsel on the ground that all of Plaintiff's claims are frivolous and were presented primarily for an improper purpose. The Court is granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, so clearly Plaintiff's claims have ultimately failed. Defendant's Motion for Sanctions restates many of its summary judgment arguments. However, the Court does not find it obvious that Plaintiff's claims were frivolous or presented primarily for an improper purpose such that sanctions under Rule 11 are warranted. The Motion [*22]  is therefore DENIED. In this Court's view, sanctions motions should be reserved for actions or litigation conduct that are facially frivolous or improper.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in its entirety. Defendant must file a proposed Judgment within ten (10) days of the issuance of this Order. Defendant's Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
