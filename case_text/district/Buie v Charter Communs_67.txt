Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE
This matter is before the Court on Defendant's motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 136.] Plaintiff alleges claims for retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). [Doc. 126.] Pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2)(g), D.S.C., all pretrial matters in employment discrimination cases are referred to a United States Magistrate Judge for consideration.
Plaintiff filed this action in the Greenville County Court of Common Pleas on October 4, 2017 [Doc. 1-1], and Defendant removed it to this Court on November 6, 2017 [Doc. 1]. With leave of this Court, Plaintiff filed her Amended Complaint on January 18, 2019. [Doc. 126.] On May 14, 2019, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. [Doc. 136.] Plaintiff filed a response in opposition [*2]  on May 28, 2019 [Doc. 137]; Defendant filed a reply on June 11, 2019 [Doc. 141]; and Plaintiff filed a sur-reply on June 28, 2019 [Doc. 144]. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is ripe for review.

BACKGROUND
Viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as is appropriate on consideration of Defendant's summary judgment motion, the undersigned gleans the following facts.
Plaintiff began working for Defendant as a Human Resources Generalist I in August 2007 and was promoted to a Human Resources Generalist II in April 2009. [Doc. 137-13.] A few months later, Plaintiff voluntarily resigned when her family relocated, but she returned to work for Defendant as a Human Resources Generalist II in May 2012. [Docs. 136-3 at 6:25-7:7; 137-13.] She was promoted to a Director of Human Resources I in December 2012 and to a Director of Human Resources II in February 2015, when she transferred to the Greenville Call Center. [Docs. 137-13; 137-20; 137-21.]
When Plaintiff transferred to the Call Center, she reported to Jeremy "Boomer" Stockton, who was Vice President of Inbound Sales at the Call Center, and Stockton reported to Donna Alda, who was Regional Vice President [*3]  of Inbound Sales and Retention.1 [Docs. 137-1 at 3:21-4:25, 5:25-6:2; 137-2 at 3:13-20; 137-14; 137-21.] In November 2015, Buie began reporting directly to Alda, and on January 11, 2016, she began reporting to Kelly Evans at the Call Center. [Docs. 137-14; 137-22 (e-mail dated Friday, January 8, 2016, stating that Plaintiff would report to Evans beginning the following Monday).]
After Buie began reporting to Evans, Evans changed the process for reviewing FMLA leave requests so that Evans was the final decision maker on those requests. [Doc. 137-2 at 6:8-12, 46:16-47:25.] Plaintiff and Evans had weekly meetings to discuss and review FMLA leave requests. [Id. at 29:7-15.] Plaintiff was concerned that Evans should not have access to the medical information submitted with FMLA leave requests. [Id. at 39:1-3.] Plaintiff also questioned Evans's ability to remain objective because Evans had commented that she did not believe mental illness or migraine headaches were serious medical conditions. [Id. at 38:16-39:10.]
On January 18, 2016, Plaintiff and Evans had a contentious discussion about ADA accommodations. [Id. at 44:17-22.] A number of Call Center employees had accommodations for extra bathroom [*4]  breaks, and after Plaintiff explained to Evans that accommodations were evaluated by determining if the accommodation could be made without it being a hardship on the business, Evans stated that she wanted all bathroom break accommodations to end. [Id. at 31:2-32:16.] Plaintiff was concerned about employees losing their accommodations without regard to why they had been accommodated in the first place. [Id. at 34:7-23.] Following her discussion with Evans, Plaintiff complained to Richard Farber, Regional Vice President of Human Resources,2 about how Evans was handling requests for ADA accommodations and FMLA leave. [Id. at 18:11-25, 19:14-21:9, 22:17-19, 42:4-13.] Farber then discussed Plaintiff's complaints with Evans. [Doc. 137-5 at 3:12-14, 7:13-23.]
On January 20, 2016, Plaintiff took FMLA leave because her doctor recommended that she take a leave of absence; she returned to work on February 1, 2016. [Doc. 137-2 at 26:17-23, 27:21-28:19, 29:16-30:23.] Farber worked with Plaintiff to approve her leave because she did not want Evans to see her medical information. [Id. at 27:17-28:19.]
On February 18, 2016, Evans conducted Plaintiff's performance review for the 2015 calendar year. [Doc. [*5]  137-27.] Evans gave Plaintiff an overall rating of 2.8, which is the lowest score on the scale for "achieved expected performance." [Id.] Plaintiff called Farber to express concern and surprise with her rating. [Doc. 137-5 at 20:11-21:8.] This performance review was the only document Plaintiff knew about involving Evans evaluating Plaintiff's performance.3 [Doc. 137-9 ¶ 30.]
On March 12, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to Jonathan Edens, an employee who had given a resignation notice, asking to meet with him before his departure. [Doc. 136-7 at 21.] Plaintiff met with Edens on March 14, 2016, to conduct an exit interview and to ask about his experience on a performance improvement plan ("PIP"). [Doc. 137-2 at 63:1-11.] Plaintiff was interested in learning about the PIP because of a complaint by a former employee that she did not get appropriate support on her PIP. [Id. at 63:12-64:3.] Edens was the only person still employed by Defendant who had been on a PIP, and Plaintiff wanted to find out what kind of support he received before he ended his employment. [Id. at 64:4-10.] Plaintiff indicated that "[i]t was an investigation by default of . . . Evans because she was the acting manager [*6]  who initiated the PIPs." [Id. at 64:24-65:1.]
Either the day Plaintiff met with Edens or the next day, Plaintiff was suspended pending an investigation into a complaint from Edens that Plaintiff's conversation with him had been very unprofessional and had made him uncomfortable. [Id. at 72:1-20; Doc. 137-4 at 15:13-19:25.] Farber instructed Janine Hanes, a Human Resources Manager who worked in St. Louis, to conduct the investigation. [Doc. 137-5 at 34:14-36:4.] She was to investigate a report that, following his meeting with Plaintiff, Edens reported to his manager that he had been uncomfortable.4 [Id.]
Hanes interviewed Evans, Lindsay, and Edens by telephone. [Doc. 137-6 at 5:18-6:4, 11:20-12:6, 12:16-19, 13:12-16.] After interviewing them, Hanes noticed "some common themes that were coming across," and after discussing the interviews with Farber, they "felt that it was worth looking into these things a little further." [Id. at 24:18-23; see also id. at 30:19-33:25 (explaining that the common themes related to Plaintiff's close relationships with and protecting Human Resources representatives).] Hanes then interviewed Vivian Reed, a training manager, and Joe Morrone, [*7]  a leader who was Evans's peer. [Id. at 14:14-15:9.] Late in the investigation, Hanes also talked to Plaintiff. [Id. at 28:10-29:24.]
Following the investigation, Evans collaborated with Alda and Farber and made the decision to terminate Plaintiff. [Doc. 137-4 at 41:21-43:20.] Plaintiff was terminated on March 25, 2016. [Docs. 137-2 at 25:12-16; 137-13.]

APPLICABLE LAW

Summary Judgment Standard
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states, as to a party who has moved for summary judgment:
The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect disposition of the case under applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257. When determining whether a genuine issue has been raised, the court must construe all inferences and ambiguities against the movant and in favor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962).
The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of demonstrating to the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact. [*8]  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the movant has made this threshold demonstration, the non-moving party, to survive the motion for summary judgment, may not rest on the allegations averred in his pleadings. Id. at 324. Rather, the non-moving party must demonstrate specific, material facts exist that give rise to a genuine issue. Id. Under this standard, the existence of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-movant's position is insufficient to withstand the summary judgment motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Likewise, conclusory allegations or denials, without more, are insufficient to preclude granting the summary judgment motion. Id. at 248. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. Further, Rule 56 provides in pertinent part:
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory [*9]  answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Accordingly, when Rule 56(c) has shifted the burden of proof to the non-movant, he must produce existence of a factual dispute on every element essential to his action that he bears the burden of adducing at a trial on the merits.

DISCUSSION
Plaintiff asserts a retaliation claim under the ADA based on her complaints about Evans's handling other employees' accommodations and a retaliation claim under the FMLA based on Evans's handling other employee's leave requests and based on Plaintiff's own FMLA leave. Each of these claims can be established either by direct evidence or through the burden-shifting framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800-06, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Yashenko v. Harrah's N.C. Casino Co., 446 F.3d 541, 550-51 (4th Cir. 2006) ("FMLA claims arising under the retaliation theory are analogous to those derived under Title VII and so are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas."); Ennis v. Nat'l Ass'n of Bus. & Educ. Radio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir. 1995) ("[W]e hold that the McDonnell Douglas scheme of proof does apply to appropriate claims under the ADA."). Plaintiff's briefing in this case addresses only the burden-shifting framework. [Docs. 137; 144.]
Under this framework, [*10]  an employee must first prove a prima facie case of retaliation. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the employer articulates a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason, the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the articulated reason was actually a pretext for retaliation. Id. at 804.

Prima Facie Case
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation with respect to any of her claims. [Doc. 136-1 at 22-27, 28-30, 33-34.] The Court disagrees.
The ADA's anti-retaliation provision provides, in relevant part, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Similarly, the FMLA makes it "unlawful for any employer to . . . discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). To establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must prove (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse action; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse [*11]  action. A Soc'y Without a Name v. Commonwealth of Va., 655 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2011). To establish a retaliation claim under the FMLA, a plaintiff "must show 'that [s]he engaged in protected activity, that the employer took adverse action against h[er], and that the adverse action was causally connected to the plaintiff's protected activity.'" Sharif v. United Airlines, Inc., 841 F.3d 199, 203 (4th Cir. 2016).

Protected Activity
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff cannot prove that she engaged in protected activity because she "did not subjectively believe the conduct in question violated the ADA and, in any event, such a belief would not have been objectively reasonable."5 [Doc. 136-1 at 22-23.] The Court disagrees.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded "that the threshold for oppositional conduct is not onerous. Instead, '[w]hen an employee communicates to her employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . . a form of employment discrimination, that communication virtually always constitutes the employee's opposition to the activity.'" DeMasters v. Carilion Clinic, 796 F.3d 409, 417 (4th Cir. 2015) (alterations in original) (quoting Crawford v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U.S. 271, 276, 129 S. Ct. 846, 172 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2009)).6 Indeed, "[e]mployees engage in protected oppositional activity when . . . they 'complain to their superiors about suspected violations of Title VII.'" Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 786 F.3d 264, 281 (4th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (emphasis added) (quoting Bryant v. Aiken Reg'l Med. Ctrs. Inc., 333 F.3d 536, 543-44 (4th Cir. 2003)); see [*12]  also Ferrell v. Harris Ventures, Inc., 812 F. Supp. 2d 741, 746 (E.D. Va. 2011) ("'[O]pposition activity is protected when it responds to an employment practice that the employee reasonably believes is unlawful,' even if the employer turns out to be innocent of any wrong-doing. 'Employees are thus guaranteed the right to complain to their superiors about suspected violations of Title VII.'" (internal citation omitted)). Thus, "the anti-retaliation provision protects employees even when they complain of actions that are not actually unlawful . . . if, at the time of their complaint, they 'have an objectively reasonable belief in light of all the circumstances that a . . . violation has happened or is in progress.'" Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d 317, 327 (4th Cir. 2018) (internal citation omitted).
Here, Plaintiff has filed a declaration7 in which she avers,
I complained to Rich Farber about Evans's actions under the ADA and FMLA because that was a proper process within the HR function for pursuing concerns about legal concerns. I was concerned that Evans's actions violated these laws because they violated our policy. Charter explained to us that the policy was drafted to reflect the law, and my prior training indicated that her actions were not proper. I complained because of these concerns.
[Doc. 137-9 [*13]  ¶ 24.] With respect to her ADA retaliation claim, Plaintiff testified that she and Evans had a contentious discussion about ending all bathroom-break accommodations and that Plaintiff complained to Farber about Evans's instruction to end bathroom-break accommodations without first looking at the individual reasons for the accommodations. [Doc. 137-2 at 18:11-25, 19:14-21:9, 22:17-19, 33:23-34:23, 42:4-13, 44:17-22.] Plaintiff also testified that she and Evans discussed the issue because "it was part of [Plaintiff's] job to make sure there was compliance with laws" and that "it[ was] not a good idea to - - with one fell swoop - - take away everybody's accommodations without looking at each individual person." [Id. at 33:24-34:23.]
Given Plaintiff's [*14]  declaration and testimony, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff reasonably suspected Evans's decision to end all bathroom-break accommodations without reviewing the individual employees' disabilities and needs violated the ADA. The ADA requires that employers "engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation . . . when an employee communicates to his employer his disability and his desire for an accommodation for that disability." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 346-47 (4th Cir. 2013); see also Rorrer v. City of Stow, 743 F.3d 1025, 1045 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that "a failure to engage in the interactive process" can be "an independent violation of the ADA"). Construing the facts in Plaintiff's favor, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's complaint was that Evans's actions failed to satisfy the ADA's interactive process requirement, which compels employers to "identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Thus, Defendant's argument that extra breaks were unnecessary because the employees were always allowed to take bathroom breaks [Docs. 136-1 at 24-25; 141 at 5-6] is of no moment. Perhaps after engaging in the interactive process, [*15]  Defendant would have determined that bathroom breaks were unnecessary for some or all of the employees who had previously been accommodated, but Plaintiff's complaint was that Evans did not look at the individual circumstances of each accommodated employee to determine his precise limitations and whether those limitations would be accommodated by regular bathroom breaks. Nowhere does Defendant assert that Evans did in fact look at the individual accommodated employees to confirm that regular bathroom breaks would be sufficient to address their conditions. Thus, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff reasonably suspected Evans's actions violated the ADA.8 See Easter v. Asurion Ins. Servs., Inc., 96 F. Supp. 3d 789, 798-801 (M.D. Tenn. 2015) (denying summary judgment where a plaintiff requested additional bathroom breaks to accommodate her irritable bowel syndrome and the employer failed to engage in an interactive process to attempt to reasonably accommodate her condition).

Causation
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff cannot prove causation because "temporal proximity alone is insufficient to establish the essential element of causation." [Doc. 136-1 at 26-27, 30, 33.] However, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that, at the prima facie stage, [*16]  "temporal proximity between the protected activity and the employer's adverse action alone will suffice" to establish causation. Burgess v. Bowen, 466 F. App'x 272, 283 (4th Cir. 2012); see also Strothers, 895 F.3d at 335-36 ("An employee may establish prima facie causation simply by showing that (1) the employer either understood or should have understood the employee to be engaged in protected activity and (2) the employer took adverse action against the employee soon after becoming aware of such activity.").
Here, Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in January 2016, as discussed, by complaining about how Evans was handling ADA accommodations and FMLA leave requests and also by taking her own FMLA leave, and Plaintiff was terminated in March 2016. Accordingly, a reasonable factfinder could find a causal connection between Plaintiff's protected activity and her termination. See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) ("The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that temporal proximity must be 'very close.'"); Carter v. Ball, 33 F.3d 450, 460 (4th Cir. 1994) ("This court found a causal connection between a plaintiff's protected activity and her discharge where the employer, with [*17]  knowledge of a pending discrimination complaint, fired plaintiff approximately four months after the complaint was filed.").

Legitimate, Nonretaliatory Reason
Because Plaintiff has forecasted evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find that she has established a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to Defendant to articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Defendant has articulated that Plaintiff was terminated because of multiple performance issues, poor communication skills, and an improper interview with Edens. [Doc. 136-1 at 27, 30.] Evans testified that Plaintiff was terminated because of behavioral issues; Code of Conduct issues, including her handling of the Edens interview; professionalism issues; and attendance issues. [Doc. 137-4 at 43:23-48:23.] Farber testified that Evans recommended to Alda that Plaintiff be terminated and that Alda took the recommendation to her boss; then, Farber was engaged to determine if he supported the decision. [Doc. 137-5 at 16:22-17:11.] Farber further testified that he supported the recommendation to terminate Plaintiff because he "believed, as a result of reviewing all that had transpired [*18]  with the numerous discussions and coachings and. . . the performance appraisal result, . . . that it was an appropriate recommendation based on the circumstances." [Id. at 17:19-18:4.] Accordingly, Defendant has met its burden of production by articulating a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for Plaintiff's termination. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (noting that the employer's burden is one of production, not persuasion, and "can involve no credibility assessment").

Pretext
Because Defendant has met its burden to articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for Plaintiff's termination, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to show that the articulated reason was actually a pretext for retaliation. Generally, to prove an employer's articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination or retaliation, a plaintiff "must prove 'both that the reason was false, and that [retaliation] was the real reason' for the challenged conduct." Jiminez v. Mary Wash. Coll., 57 F.3d 369, 378 (4th Cir. 1995) (quoting St Mary's Honor Ctr., 509 U.S. at 515). However, "a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully [retaliated]." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). Ultimately, to survive summary judgment, a plaintiff [*19]  must demonstrate "a genuine dispute of material fact on the question of pretext sufficient to make [the employer's] proferred justification a triable issue." Guessous v. Fairview Prop. Invs., LLC, 828 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir. 2016).
Here, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant's proffered reasons for terminating Plaintiff are a pretext for retaliation. It is undisputed that Plaintiff and Evans had an adversarial relationship. [Docs. 137-2 at 55:19-25; 137-5 at 14:4-20.] What remains disputed, however, is what caused the adversarial relationship and whether Evans's recommendation to terminate Plaintiff was in violation of the FMLA and/or ADA.
On the record before the Court, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff was terminated because she took FMLA leave and/or because she opposed how Evans handled ADA accommodation and/or FMLA leave requests. Plaintiff testified that Evans did not believe certain conditions—mental illness and migraine headaches—were serious medical conditions. [Doc. 137-2 at 38:16-25.] She also testified that Farber had directed Plaintiff to decrease the percentage of FMLA cases within the Call Center from 11 or 12 percent down to six percent and that, when Plaintiff [*20]  shared that with Evans, Evans told her she could help. [Id. at 47:20-25.] Plaintiff and Rebecca Recker9 averred that Evans bragged about firing employees who were on FMLA leave at her previous job. [Docs. 137-9 ¶ 5; 137-11 ¶ 5.] Recker also averred that Evans complained about the ADA and was resistant to advice on the FMLA and ADA. [Doc. 137-11 ¶¶ 7, 9.]
Additionally, many of the specific performance issues Defendant references occurred between March and December 2015. [E.g., Doc. 136-1 at 4 ("Within a few months of transferring to the Call Center, multiple members of management and other employees complained that [Plaintiff] was creating an uncomfortable environment by refusing to support her business partners or learn the [C]all [C]enter business, being combative, having a very aggressive communication style, and openly demonstrating favoritism"), 4-5 (relaying an incident between Plaintiff and Morrone on March 31, 2015), 5 (relaying an issue with a termination meeting on December 16, 2015), 6 (relaying an incident that occurred on December 31, 2015), 9 (relaying payroll mistakes that occurred in November and December 2015).] However, when Plaintiff received her performance review [*21]  in February 2016, "she called [Farber] expressing both concern and surprise . . . at the rating she got." [Doc. 137-5 at 20:11-17.] Plaintiff's surprise about her rating suggests that Plaintiff had not been made aware of these issues before then even though Defendant's Management Practices Manual provides that "the investigation of a performance or conduct concern . . . be completed in a timely manner and . . . that any corrective action be timely issued."10 [Doc. 137-29 at 1]; see Nichols v. Ashland Hosp. Corp., 251 F.3d 496, 502-03 (4th Cir. 2001) ("The jury could have concluded that the last-minute documentation of [the employee's] job performance supports the inference that [the employer's Chief Executive Officer] contrived [the employee's] alleged performance deficiencies, after learning of her request for sick leave, in order to create the appearance of a non-discriminatory reason for [the employee's] termination."). Additionally, the Management Practices Manual provides for progressive levels of corrective action and states that termination "is the last step and is used when earlier steps [(verbal warning, written warning, and final warning)] have not produced the needed results or when the conduct is sufficiently serious to warrant immediate [*22]  termination." [Doc. 137-29 at 1-3.] Examples of the types of behavior considered to be serious enough to warrant immediate termination or acceleration of the corrective action process include violation of the Drug Free Workplace Policy, unauthorized use of Defendant's property or vehicles, violation of the Workplace Violence Policy, theft, and serious safety violations. [Id. at 2.] At her deposition, when she was asked why Plaintiff was terminated, Evans offered only vague responses such as "mistakes," "professionalism," and "aggressive communication." [Doc. 137-4 at 43:23-46:24.] When Evans was then asked, "What conduct did [Plaintiff] engage in that formed a basis of your decision to terminate her employment?" Evans responded, "I don't have an answer for you." [Id. at 43:23-47:6.] Thus, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's behavior was not serious enough to warrant immediate termination with no prior corrective action and that Defendant's proferred reasons—multiple performance issues, poor communication skills, and an improper interview with Edens—were not its real reasons for terminating Plaintiff. Further, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant's actual reason [*23]  was to retaliate against her for taking FMLA leave and/or opposing how Evans handled ADA accommodation and/or FMLA leave requests.11 Thus, the undersigned concludes that disputed issues of material fact exit with respect to whether Defendant's proffered reasons are a pretext for retaliation.

RECOMMENDATION
