Memorandum Order
This is an employment discrimination action brought by Plaintiff, Christine M. Logsdon, a former employee of Defendants who worked at the University of Pittsburgh Physicians (UPP) call center. Plaintiff, who worked as a casual, "floater" employee with Defendants from February of 2013, to June of 2014, and who allegedly suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, claims that Defendants discriminated against her, under the ADA (as amended) and the PHRA, failed to make reasonable accommodations of her disability, failed to engage in the interactive process, and wrongfully terminated her for alleged violation of the attendance policy, citing excessive absences, when the real reason for her termination [*2]  was her disability.
Pending before this Court are Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment (doc. 28 and doc. 31) and Plaintiff's Responses in Opposition thereto (doc. 33 and doc. 34). In Plaintiff's responses, she has stated that she does not plan to go forward with Counts III, VI, VII, VIII and IX of her Complaint. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment as to those claims. However, as to the remaining Counts I, II, IV and V, genuine issues of material facts preclude a grant of summary judgment, and therefore, the Court will deny summary judgment at to those claims.1
Summary judgment is only proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact in the case and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(2); Horn v. Thoratec Corp., 376 F.3d 163, 165 (3d Cir. 2004). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the role of the Court is "not to weigh the evidence or to determine the truth of the matter, but only to determine whether the evidence of record is such that a reasonable jury [fact finder] could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Am. Eagle Outfitters v. Lyle & Scott Ltd., 584 F.3d 575, 581 (3d Cir. 2009). If so, summary judgment will not be granted.
The district court must view all of the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, who is entitled to "every [*3]  reasonable inference that can be drawn from the record," and if "there is a disagreement about the facts or the proper inferences to be drawn from them, a trial is required to resolve the conflicting versions of the parties." Reedy v. Evanson, 615 F.3d 197, 209 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Merkle v. Upper Dublin Sch. Dist., 211 F.3d 782, 788 (3d Cir. 2000) and Peterson v. Lehigh Valley Dist. Council, 676 F.2d 81, 84 (3d Cir. 1982)). A party cannot, however, defeat a motion for summary judgment by pointing to fragmentary inferences that could be massaged to support his or her position. The non-moving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court does not make credibility determinations, and summary judgment is "inappropriate when a case will turn on credibility determinations." El v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Authority, 479 F.3d 232 (3d Cir. 2007), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.
In order for a plaintiff to establish a case of disparate treatment under the ADA, the Third Circuit has applied the burden shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas. See Lawrence v. Westminster Bank New Jersey, 98 F.3d 61, 68 (3d Cir.1996) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 & n. 13, (1973)). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case of discrimination. Upon establishing a prima facie case, "the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the employee's termination. Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d. Cir.1994) (citation and quotation marks [*4]  omitted). The employer is able to satisfy this burden by "introducing evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the unfavorable employment decision." Id. (citations omitted).
If the defendant is able to meet the burden of providing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the negative employment action, the plaintiff is then afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that the reason which the employer has asserted is actually a pretext for discrimination. Lawrence, 98 F.3d at 65. In order to do this, the plaintiff must (1) discredit the proffered reasons for termination, directly or circumstantially, or (2) adduce evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the termination. Id. at 66.
Under the ADA, employers are obligated to "mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations" of a "qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To establish a failure to accommodate case under the ADA (as amended) (and the PHRA), a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she had a disability; (2) the employer had notice of this disability; (3) she can perform the essential functions of her position with [*5]  a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. Johnson v. McGraw-Hill Companies, 451 F. Supp. 2d 681, 701 (W.D. Pa. 2006). For purposes of summary judgment only, Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff is "an individual with a disability." Doc. 32 at 7-8. Instead, Defendants argue that it was not obligated to accommodate Plaintiff because: (i) Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual with a disability"; (ii) her proposed accommodation was "unreasonable"; and (iii) Plaintiff failed to provide medical support for her request.
Judging the operative facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the non-moving party,2 the Court finds that numerous material factual issues preclude summary judgment in this matter. This Court is not free to weigh the dueling versions of the facts, which is the essence of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. There are genuine disputes of material facts as to whether Logsdon is a qualified3 individual with a disability, whether she can perform the essential functions of the job, whether her proposed accommodation of "intermittent accommodated time" ("occasional, infrequent disability-related absences not count for purposes of discipline under the attendance policy") was reasonable, [*6]  whether Defendants failed to engage in the interactive process, and whether or not Plaintiff, in fact, failed to provide medical support for her requests, which further supports Plaintiff's arguments regarding pretext. The jury trial of this matter is currently set for December 3, 2018. (doc. 16).
For these reasons, Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment (doc. 28 and 31) are GRANTED as to Counts III, VI, VII, VIII and IX of Plaintiff's Complaint; and are DENIED as to Counts I, II, IV and V. Finally, this Court hereby Orders the parties to complete a second ADR session (mediation) before neutral, Carole Katz, on October 11, 2018, with the costs of the mediation to be split equally by the parties. The parties shall file an amended stipulation of ADR process by September 21, 2018.
SO ORDERED this 18th day of September, 2018.
