ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 31]

I. INTRODUCTION
This lawsuit arises out of Plaintiff Gustavo Garcia's employment as a part-time meal services employee with Defendant Wal-Mart Associates, Inc. ("Walmart"). (Dkt. 1 [Complaint, hereinafter "Compl."].) Plaintiff claims that he was discriminated and retaliated against and ultimately terminated because of his disability. Walmart, in contrast, contends that Plaintiff was terminated not because of any disability, but because he repeatedly failed to abide by food safety protocols. Before the Court is Walmart's motion for summary judgment on eight of Plaintiff's nine claims. (Dkt. 31-1 [hereinafter "Mot."]). For [*2]  the following reasons, Walmart's motion is GRANTED.

II. BACKGROUND
Walmart hired Plaintiff to work as a part-time Home Meal Processor ("HMP") in 2016. (Dkt. 39 [Plaintiff's Response to Walmart's Statement of Undisputed Facts, hereinafter "UF"] ¶ 1.) An HMP provides home meal replacement products to Walmart members by (1) preparing, handling, packaging, labeling, and storing food, (2) operating, repairing, and sanitizing food-related equipment, (3) ensuring merchandise is properly packaged, labeled, and stored, and (4) maintaining and cleaning the food-preparation areas. (Id. ¶ 2.) HMPs are required to "[f]ollow[] Company policies and procedures" when completing these tasks. (Id. ¶ 3.)
Walmart has a policy called "Coaching for Improvement," which essentially delineates the number of warnings that an employee may receive before being terminated. (See id. ¶ 5.) Under the policy, when an employee's performance falls below expectations, Walmart issues one of three levels of "coaching" depending on the severity of the infraction. (Id.) A level 1 coaching is the least severe while level 3 is the most. Because an employee "may receive only one of each level of coaching in any 12-month period," [*3]  if multiple coachings of the same level are issued within one year, each subsequent coaching must be elevated to a higher level than the previous one. (Id.) If an employee who has already received a level 3 coaching within the last year commits an infraction that warrants any level of coaching, he is "subject to termination." (Id. ¶ 6.)
On July 1, 2016, Plaintiff failed to take a meal break and consequently received a level 1 coaching. (Id. ¶ 7.) A week later, on July 8, Plaintiff reported a workplace back injury. (Id. ¶ 33.) Following his injury, Plaintiff's doctors informed Walmart that he had been diagnosed with a lumbar strain, and recommended several restrictions including "limited overhead work, limited stooping and bending, [and] limited kneeling or squatting." (Id. ¶ 34.) Accordingly, Walmart placed Plaintiff on light duty. (Id. ¶ 35.) Two months later, on August 29, 2016, Plaintiff requested a continuous medical leave of absence, (id. ¶ 36), and Walmart approved the request through September 16, 2016, (id. ¶ 37). On September 14, Plaintiff's doctors informed Walmart that Plaintiff could return to work with updated restrictions. (Id. ¶ 38.) Walmart therefore offered Plaintiff [*4]  a light-duty work assignment and provided a written Temporary Alternative Duty agreement that he signed on September 19, 2016. (Id. ¶ 39.) On November 23, 2016, Walmart was informed that Plaintiff had been released to work with no restrictions. (Id. ¶ 40.)
In February 2017, Plaintiff received a level 2 coaching for failing to conduct a temperature check on rotisserie chickens. (Id. ¶ 8.) Although this violation would ordinarily result in only a level 1 coaching, it was elevated to level 2 because Plaintiff had already received a level one coaching about seven months earlier. (Dkt. 33 [Declaration of Laura Hernandez, hereinafter "Hernandez Decl."] ¶ 24.)
Six months later, on August 2, 2017, Walmart issued Plaintiff a Level 3 coaching for leaving salads uncovered. (UF ¶ 9.) Plaintiff was issued a level 3 coaching because he had already received a level 2 coaching within the previous year. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 25.) The next day, on August 3, 2017, after suffering a back injury at work, Plaintiff left the store before the end of his shift and drove home, leaving the food that he was preparing at the time uncovered and unattended. (UF ¶¶ 10-11.) He did not tell his supervisor, Laura Hernandez, [*5]  or anyone else that he was going home for the day or that he had left food uncovered and unattended at his workstation. (Id. ¶ 12-13; Dkt. 32-3 [Plaintiff Deposition, hereinafter "Plaintiff Dep."] at 110-11, 114.) Hernandez decided that a coaching was warranted for this conduct. (Id. ¶ 16.) Because a review of Plaintiff's file showed that he had already received a Level 3 coaching within the previous 12 months, (id. ¶ 17), Hernandez determined that Plaintiff's termination was required under Walmart's coaching policy, (id. ¶ 18). Walmart notified Plaintiff of the decision to terminate his employment on August 4, 2017. (Id. ¶ 20.)
On July 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed this case, asserting the following claims for violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"): (1) discrimination, (2) retaliation, (3) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, and (5) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process. Plaintiff also brings claims for (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, (7) failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records, (8) declaratory judgment, and (9) punitive [*6]  damages. Walmart moved for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's claims except for failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records. (See Dkt. 31 [Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment, hereinafter "Notice"].)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment on "each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A factual issue is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law and is determined by looking to the substantive law. Id. "Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. at 249. The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325.
As in this case, when the nonmovant will have the [*7]  burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim or defense, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970), or (2) showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. If the movant meets this burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit, or as otherwise provided under Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. The court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all justifiable inferences in its favor. Id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).
The court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But conclusory and speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise triable issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. Thornhill Pub. Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).

IV. DISCUSSION
Walmart moves for summary judgment on eight of Plaintiff's nine claims. The Court analyzes each claim in turn and concludes that summary judgment is appropriate.

A. Discrimination and Retaliation
Plaintiff brings claims for disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of FEHA. In evaluating these claims, courts apply the three-step burden-shifting [*8]  analysis outlined by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-805, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case. If "the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a presumption of discrimination arises." Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). Then, "once an employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory [or nondiscriminatory] reason for the adverse employment action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355. "If the employer sustains this burden, the presumption of discrimination [or retaliation] disappears." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356 (2000). Finally, the plaintiff has "the opportunity to attack the employer's proffered reasons as pretexts for discrimination [or retaliation], or to offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356; Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042. "The ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue[s] of actual discrimination [and retaliation] remains with the plaintiff." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356; Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042. Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims fail because Walmart provides a legitimate reason for firing Plaintiff and Plaintiff cannot show that this reason was pretextual.1
Walmart provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment. "[L]egitimate reasons in this context are reasons that are facially unrelated to prohibited bias [*9] , and which, if true would thus preclude a finding of [unlawful conduct]." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358. An employer's legitimate reason "need not necessarily have been wise or correct." Id. Walmart asserts that Plaintiff was terminated based on its "Coaching for Improvement" policy. (See UF ¶ 5.) Under that policy, an employee may receive only one Level 3 coaching in a 12-month period. If an employee who has already received a level 3 coaching within the last year commits an infraction that warrants any level of coaching, he is "subject to termination." (Id. ¶ 6.)
On August 2, 2017, Walmart issued Plaintiff a level 3 coaching for leaving salads uncovered. (Id. ¶ 9.) The next day, on August 3, 2017, after suffering a back injury at work, Plaintiff left the store before the end of his shift and left the food that he was preparing uncovered and unattended without telling anyone. (Id. ¶¶ 10-13; Dkt. 32-3 [Plaintiff Deposition, hereinafter "Plaintiff Dep."] at 110-11, 114.) Hernandez decided that a coaching was warranted for Plaintiff's failure to notify anyone that he was leaving early without covering the food at his workstation. (Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 26-28; Dkt. 32-2 [Laura Hernandez Deposition, hereinafter "Hernandez [*10]  Dep."] at 83, 92-93; UF ¶¶ 12-14.) Because Plaintiff had already received a level 3 coaching within the previous 12 months, (UF ¶¶ 16, 17), Hernandez determined that Plaintiff's termination was required under Walmart's coaching policy, (id. ¶ 18). Accordingly, Walmart has satisfied its burden of establishing a "legitimate, nonretaliatory [or nondiscriminatory] reason for" terminating Plaintiff's employment. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th 317, 356, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089; Yanowitz, 36 Cal. 4th at 1042.
Because Walmart has established a legitimate reason for terminating Plaintiff, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to create a genuine dispute that Walmart's proffered reason was pretext for discrimination. Plaintiff fails to meet this burden. To avoid summary judgment, a plaintiff "must produce substantial responsive evidence" to permit a rational inference that the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual. Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1735, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994); Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 361. "[S]peculation cannot be regarded as substantial responsive evidence." Martin, 29 Cal. App. 4th at 1735.
Plaintiff contends that the timing of his termination, which occurred one day after he suffered a back injury, indicates pretext. But temporal proximity does not amount to more than a "scintilla of evidence" when "the employer raised questions about the employee's performance before he disclosed [*11]  his symptoms, and the subsequent termination was based on those performance issues." Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008). Here, Plaintiff's termination was based on his accumulation of formal coachings—three of which occurred prior to the injury that Plaintiff suffered the day before his firing. See id. ("[T]emporal proximity is a factor [when] an employee has worked for the same employer for several years, has a good or excellent performance record, and then, after engaging in some type of protected activity—disclosing a disability—is suddenly accused of serious performance problems . . . and terminated."). Any temporal proximity thus amounts only to a "scintilla of evidence" that Walmart's proffered reason for Plaintiff's firing was pretextual and is insufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact. See id.
More importantly, Plaintiff's supervisor, Laura Hernandez, has testified that she did not know that Plaintiff had injured himself the day before she fired him, (Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 26-28; Hernandez Dep. at 83, 92-93), and Plaintiff has presented nothing more than speculation that this was not the case, (see UF ¶ 15). Although Plaintiff argues that Hernandez failed to investigate whether Plaintiff left work [*12]  early due to injury and that her failure suggests pretext, Hernandez asked two members of her management staff whether Plaintiff had informed them that he was leaving and both stated that Plaintiff did not. (Hernandez Dep. at 83.) Furthermore, because an employer's reason for termination "need not necessarily have been wise or correct," Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358, whether Walmart conducted a satisfactory investigation "is of little relevance to this Court's analysis," Costello v. Abbott Labs., 2010 WL 11507583, at *10 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2010).
Plaintiff also argues that Walmart's proffered reason was pretextual because Hernandez previously failed to respond to Plaintiff's complaints about the store's assistant manager, Traci Dillard. In three complaints, which were sent to Hernandez's email in March and April 2017, Plaintiff complained of his reduced hours and stated that Dillard was "targeting [him] due to his disability." (Dkts. 41-6-41-7.) Hernandez did not respond directly to Plaintiff's complaints, but Dillard was transferred to another store in April 2017—the same month as Plaintiff's last complaint. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 9.) Hernandez's failure to respond to Plaintiff's complaints, which were made three to five months before Plaintiff's termination, does not constitute "substantial [*13]  responsive evidence" of pretext. Martin, 29 Cal. App. 4th at 1735; see Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (finding that temporal proximity did not constitute "sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case" under Title VII where the alleged retaliatory action was taken "20 months later"). This is especially true when the assistant manager accused in Plaintiff's complaints was transferred less than a month later.
Based on both the strength of Walmart's legitimate reason for firing Plaintiff pursuant to its "coaching" policy and the lack of evidence of pretext presented by Plaintiff, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to create a genuine dispute as to whether Walmart's proffered reason was pretextual. Plaintiff's FEHA claims for discrimination and retaliation therefore fail as a matter of law.

B. Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation
Because the Court grants summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims for discrimination and retaliation, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his claim for failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. See, e.g., Brent v. Boeing Co., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159276, 2019 WL 4450424, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2019) (granting summary judgment on failure-to-prevent claim because plaintiff failed to show discrimination or harassment); 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 11023(a)(2) (explaining that since "[t]here is [*14]  no stand-alone, private cause of action" for failure to prevent discrimination, to succeed on such a claim "the private claimant must also plead and prevail on the underlying claim of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation"). Summary judgment is granted on this claim as well.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate fails as a matter of law because Plaintiff cannot show that Walmart failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship." Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009) (emphasis added) (quoting Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)). "The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "Generally, the employee bears the burden of giving the employer notice of the disability." Raine v. City of Burbank, 135 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1222, 37 Cal. Rptr. 3d 899 (2006).
Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that Walmart failed to accommodate a known disability. To the contrary, [*15]  Walmart approved each of Plaintiff's requests for accommodation of known disabilities. In July 2016, Plaintiff reported a workplace back injury. (UF ¶ 33.) In accordance with the recommendations of Plaintiff's doctors, Walmart placed him on light duty to "limit[] overhead work, [] stooping and bending, [and] kneeling or squatting." (Id. ¶¶ 34-35.) In August 2016, Walmart approved Plaintiff's request for a medical leave of absence through September 16, 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 36-37.) On September 14, 2016, Plaintiff's doctors informed Walmart that Plaintiff could return to work with updated restrictions. (Id. ¶ 38.) Walmart complied with these restrictions by offering Plaintiff a light-duty work assignment and providing a written Temporary Alternative Duty agreement that he signed on September 19, 2016. (Id. ¶ 39.)
Similarly, when Plaintiff injured his back the day before he was fired, there is no evidence that Walmart failed to accommodate him. After Plaintiff's injury occurred, Plaintiff told his team leader, Charlotte Curtis, that he injured his back and was going to take his break to get some medication, which she allowed. (Plaintiff Dep. at 101-02.) Plaintiff then informed an assistant manager, [*16]  Josh Gezahagn, of his injury and his desire to seek medical attention. (Id. at 107-08.) Gezahagn instructed Plaintiff to wait while he prepared the necessary paperwork. (Id. at 109.) After thirty minutes passed, however, Plaintiff drove himself to the clinic without the necessary paperwork and was consequently denied treatment. (Id. at 109, 111.) At Gezahagn's insistence, Plaintiff returned to the store where he was again instructed to wait while Gezahagn filled out the requisite paperwork. (Id. at 111-14; see Dkt. 38 [Plaintiff's Opposition, hereinafter "Opp."] at 6.) But after waiting for approximately twenty minutes to an hour, Plaintiff left work and went home without telling anyone. (Plaintiff Dep. at 114.) Once he was at home, Plaintiff did not contact any of his coworkers or supervisors. (Id. at 115.) The next morning, Plaintiff returned to work, started his shift at the normal time, and went about his daily routine. (Id. at 116.) Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Walmart attempted to prevent him from seeking medical treatment on the day of his injury. Instead, Plaintiff did not receive medical treatment because he refused to wait for his supervisor to fill out the necessary paperwork. When he returned to work the following morning, he was [*17]  able to perform his responsibilities without accommodation.
Plaintiff argues that Walmart failed to accommodate him because Walmart fired him a day after he left work to seek treatment for an injury. But this argument is unavailing because Plaintiff's termination does not demonstrate that Walmart failed to accommodate him. At the time of Plaintiff's termination, he no longer required any accommodation as he was performing his "daily routine" without issue. (Id. at 116.) Moreover, Walmart did not fire Plaintiff because he left work to seek medical treatment. Indeed, there is no evidence that the supervisor who fired Plaintiff even knew that he had injured himself or sought medical treatment the day before she fired him. (UF ¶ 15.) Rather, Walmart fired Plaintiff because he failed to tell anyone that he was leaving the store before the end of his shift and that he had left food uncovered and unattended at his work station. (Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 26-28; Hernandez Dep. at 83; UF ¶¶ 12-14.)

D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process similarly fails. FEHA requires an employer "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with [*18]  the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations . . . in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known . . . disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, . . . the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee . . . to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 ("The employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious."). "Reasonable accommodation thus envisions an exchange between employer and employee where each seeks and shares information to achieve the best match between the employee's capabilities and available positions." Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1385, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000).
Plaintiff's interactive-process claim fails because he did not identify any limitations or suggest a reasonable accommodation to Walmart. On the day of Plaintiff's injury, he asked one supervisor if he could take his break and she consented. He then informed another that he wished to seek medical attention, and that supervisor informed him that he would [*19]  have to wait while he prepared the necessary paperwork. Rather than waiting, however, Plaintiff drove himself to the clinic and eventually left work without telling anyone. The next day, he returned to work and went about his daily routine. Plaintiff never identified any limitations due to his injury or suggested reasonable accommodations. His claim fails accordingly. See King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) ("[T]he employee can't expect the employer to read his mind and know he secretly wanted a particular accommodation and sue the employer for not providing it.).

E. Wrongful Termination
Plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy shares the same factual and legal basis as Plaintiff's causes of action for discrimination and harassment. (See Compl. ¶ 85 [alleging wrongful termination based on unlawful discrimination under FEHA].) Plaintiff has failed to show that Walmart discriminated or retaliated against him. Because Plaintiff offers no other basis for his claim for wrongful termination, it too fails. See Markowitz v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86245, 2016 WL 3598728, at *7 (C.D. Cal. July 1, 2016), aff'd, 711 F. App'x 430 (9th Cir. 2018) (granting summary judgment on the plaintiff's wrongful termination claim because the court had granted summary judgment on FEHA claims); Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) ("[B]ecause [the plaintiff's] FEHA claim [*20]  fails, his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails.").

F. Declaratory Relief and Punitive Damages
Plaintiff's claims for declaratory relief and punitive damages are premised on his claims for discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate, and failure to participate in the interactive process. Because these claims fail, so do Plaintiff's claims for declaratory relief and punitive damages.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Walmart's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's claims for (1) discrimination, (2) retaliation, (3) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (5) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process, (6) wrongful termination in violation of public policy, (7) declaratory judgment, and (8) punitive damages.2
