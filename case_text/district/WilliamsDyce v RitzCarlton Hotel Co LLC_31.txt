Opinion



UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Before the Court are both Plaintiff and Defendant's motions for summary judgment. (Docs. 37; 38.) Plaintiff seeks summary judgment only on count one, and Defendant seeks judgment on both counts one and two. (Id.) For the below reasons, the Court RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion, (Doc. 37) be DENIED; and that Defendant's motion, (Doc. 38), be DENIED IN PART on count one, and GRANTED IN PART on count two.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff initiated this action on May 12, 2021, and she later filed an amended complaint on August 8, 2022. (Docs. 1; 30.) Plaintiff's amended complaint contains two counts, in which she alleges that Defendant, her employer, violated the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., by interfering with the exercise of her FMLA rights (count one); and [*2]  violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),1 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., by failing to accommodate her disability (count two). (Doc. 30 at 5-8.)
The discovery period ended on March 8, 2022. (Doc. 18.) The case was then stayed so that the parties could participate in mediation, which they did on June 2, 2022, but they were unsuccessful. (Docs. 22; 26.) The parties, however, continued to negotiate, and they settled two claims that were alleged in the original complaint—a Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) claim and a breach of contract claim. (Docs. 1; 31 at 2.) By consent, Plaintiff then filed the amended complaint, which alleges only the two counts referenced above. (Docs. 30; 31 at 2-3.) The Court granted the parties' joint request for an extension of time to file dispositive motions, (Docs. 31; 32), and Plaintiff and Defendant timely filed the pending motions for summary judgment on September 12, 2022. (Docs. 37; 38.) Having now been fully briefed, the motions are ripe for review. (Docs. 43; 45; 47; 48.)

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Summary judgment shall be granted when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Material facts are the facts that "might affect the outcome of the [*3]  suit under the governing law," and accordingly, "the substantive law will identify which facts are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (explaining that "[a]n issue of fact is 'material' if it is a legal element of the claim under the applicable substantive law which might affect the outcome of the case"). "A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Peppers v. Cobb Cnty., Georgia, 835 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations omitted).
The movant carries the initial burden of "informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact," or the "absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the movant fails to meet this initial burden, then the motion must be denied, and the Court need not consider any showing that the non-movant has made. Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir. 1993) (citing Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991)). But if the movant meets the initial burden, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to show that there is indeed a genuine issue of material fact, which precludes summary judgment. [*4]  Clark, 929 F.2d at 608. The non-movant must "go beyond the pleadings" and present competent evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, admissions, and the like, designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" in support of the non-movant's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. In other words, when the movant has carried its initial burden under Rule 56(c), the non-movant "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (citations omitted). If the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-movant, then there is no "genuine issue for trial." Id.
The Court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant only if there is a "genuine" dispute as to those facts. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380; United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop., 941 F.2d 1428, 1437 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc). To the extent that material facts are genuinely in dispute, the Court must resolve the disputes in the non-movant's favor. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380; Vaughan v. Cox, 343 F.3d 1323, 1326 n.1 (11th Cir. 2003). If the record does not blatantly contradict the non-movant's version of events, the Court must determine whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [*5]  non-movant is entitled to a verdict. Scott, 550 U.S. at 380 (when opposing parties tell two different stories, and one is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, then the Court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.
"A district court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence" on a motion for summary judgment. See Hetherington v. Wal-Mart, Inc., 511 F. App'x 909, 911 (11th Cir. 2013) (evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion) (citing Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Fla. Mowing & Landscape Serv., Inc., 556 F.3d 1232, 1243 (11th Cir.2009)). In determining if evidence is admissible, the Court applies the same rules and standards that would apply to admissibility at trial. Munoz v. Int'l All. of Theatrical Stage Emp. & Moving Picture Mach. Operators of U. S. & Canada, 563 F.2d 205, 207 (5th Cir. 1977).2 Generally, inadmissible hearsay cannot be considered on a motion for summary judgment. Macuba v. Deboer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir. 1999). In Celotex, the Supreme Court held that the nonmoving party is not required to "produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment," which the Eleventh Circuit has interpreted "as simply allowing otherwise admissible evidence to be submitted in inadmissible form at the summary judgment stage, though at trial it must be submitted in admissible form." McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1573, 1584 (11th Cir. 1996) (emphasis in original) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). For example, a hearsay statement might be admissible [*6]  because it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule, it does not constitute hearsay at all (because it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted), or it is used solely for impeachment and not as substantive evidence. Macuba, 193 F.3d at 1323-24. "The most obvious way that hearsay testimony can be reduced to admissible form is to have the hearsay declarant testify directly to the matter at trial." Jones v. UPS Ground Freight, 683 F.3d 1283, 1294 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing Pritchard v. S. Co. Servs., 92 F.3d 1130, 1135 (11th Cir. 1996) (an affidavit "can be reduced to admissible form at trial" by having the affiant testify as a witness)). But the possibility that unknown witnesses will emerge to provide testimony, when the record contains no such indication, is insufficient to establish that the hearsay statement could be reduced to admissible trial evidence. Jones, 683 F.3d at 1294.
Affidavits and deposition testimony, as required by Rule 56, "must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(4); Macuba, 193 F.3d at 1323 (the rule for affidavits applies to testimony given on deposition); see also Joassin v. Murphy, 661 F. App'x 558, 559 (11th Cir. 2016) (declarations based on personal knowledge are admissible summary judgment evidence); Pritchard, 92 F.3d at 1135. For documents "[t]o be admissible in support of or in opposition to [*7]  a motion for summary judgment, a document must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of Rule 56 and the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence." Barrow v. United States, No. 1:18-CV-5858-CAP, 2021 WL 9720798, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 25, 2021) (alteration omitted) (citing Saunders v. Emory Healthcare, Inc., 360 F. App'x 110, 113 (11th Cir. 2010)). Unsworn statements, on the other hand, do not meet the requirements of Rule 56, and the Court will not consider them. Dudley v. City of Monroeville, Ala., 446 F. App'x 204, 207 (11th Cir. 2011); see also Carr v. Tatangelo, 338 F.3d 1259, 1273 n.26 (11th Cir. 2003) (because the preliminary report submitted was without attestation, it had no probative value and properly was not considered by the district judge in ruling on the summary judgment motions)(citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158 n. 17, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970)).

III. STATEMENT OF FACTS
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from Defendant's statement of undisputed material facts, (DSMF, Doc. 38-2); Plaintiff's response to Defendants' statement of undisputed material facts, (PRDF, Doc. 46); Plaintiff's statement of additional material facts, (PAMF, Doc. 45-1); Defendant' response to Plaintiff's statement of additional material facts, (DRPA, Doc. 48-1); Plaintiff's statement of undisputed material facts, (PSMF, Doc. 37-1); and Defendant's response to Plaintiff's statement of undisputed material facts, (DRPF, Doc. 44). As indicated, and as needed, the Court [*8]  may draw some facts directly from the record. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) ("The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record").
The Court deems admitted and accepts as true those facts submitted by either party that: (1) are supported by citations to admissible record evidence; (2) are not disputed and refuted by the other party with citations to admissible record evidence; and (3) do not make credibility determinations or state legal conclusions. See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGA;3 see also E.E.O.C. v. Atlanta Gastroenterology Assocs., LLC, No. CIV. A. 1:05-CV-2504-TWT, 2007 WL 602212, at *3 n.2 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2007). The Court has nevertheless viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant, as required on a motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
The Court has excluded any assertions of fact [*9]  by either party that are immaterial, presented as arguments or legal conclusions, are unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record, or are asserted only in a party's brief and not in the statement(s) of facts.4 See LR 56.1(B)(1), NDGa; see also LR 56.1(B)(2)(b) (non-movant's statement of additional facts must also comply with LR 56.1(B)(1)). But the Court includes certain facts that are not necessarily material if they are helpful to present the context of the parties' arguments. The Court will not rule on each objection or dispute presented by the parties, and will discuss those objections and disputes only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.

A. Plaintiff's Migraine Headaches
Plaintiff testified that her "disability" is "chronic migraine" headaches, and that she has had chronic migraines since she was 15 years old. (Doc. 34 at 288:16-24; DSMF ¶21; PRDF ¶21; PAMF ¶1; DRPA ¶1; PSMF ¶1; DRPF ¶1.) According to Plaintiff, she has both typical migraines and "hemiplegic" migraines, which affect only one side of the body, and she also has syncope.5 (Doc. 34 at 289:2-3, 8-11; PAMF ¶2; DRPA ¶2; PAMF ¶6; DRPA ¶6; PSMF ¶2; DRPF ¶2.) Plaintiff testified that her "normal" migraines cause [*10]  "physical pain, literally throbbing [in] my head, buzzing in my ears, dizziness, vomiting, [and] nausea" and "blurred vision." (DSMF ¶22; PRDF ¶22; PAMF ¶3; DRPA ¶3; PSMF ¶3; DRPF ¶3.) When she has a "hemiplegic" migraine, Plaintiff testified that "my vision gets so blurry, I can't see anything . . . I lose control of my right arm . . . [and] my right side of my face goes slack." (PAMF ¶4; DRPA ¶4; PSMF ¶4; DRPF ¶4.) Plaintiff also testified that she is unable to hold objects in her right hand, and she has difficulty typing. (PAMF ¶5; DRPA ¶5; PSMF ¶5; DRPF ¶5.) As for her symptoms of "extreme fatigue" and "daytime drowsiness," Plaintiff testified that, even though one of the medications that made these symptoms worse (Topamax) was changed on September 4, 2019, she still experienced both fatigue and drowsiness as part of her ongoing symptoms. (Doc. 34 at 237:22-238:15, 240:25-242:8; Doc. 34-32; PAMF ¶8; DRPA ¶8; PSMF ¶8; DRPF ¶8.)
During the time that Plaintiff worked for Defendant (June 26, 2018—October 11, 2019), she was never hospitalized for migraines. (Doc. 34 at 290:9-12; DSMF ¶23; PRDF ¶23.) During 2018 and 2019, [*11]  Plaintiff received treatment for migraine headaches from Dr. David Kunz and Nurse Practitioner Jeanette Dormio at Perisseia Primary Care in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and from Dr. Rosiland K. Harrington at Decatur Health and Wellness in Tucker, Georgia. (PAMF ¶45; DRPA ¶45; PSMF ¶45; DRPF ¶45.) Plaintiff saw either Dr. Kunz, Nurse Practitioner Dormio, or Dr. Harrington at least twice per calendar year in 2018 and 2019 for treatment related to migraine headaches. (PAMF ¶46; DRPA ¶46; PSMF ¶46; DRPF ¶46.)
Due to certain medications becoming easier to access, and the development of new medications that did not previously exist, Plaintiff testified that her migraines are "considerably better" than they were 10 years ago, and "way better" than they were five years ago. (Doc. 34 at 290:12-292:13; DSMF ¶24; PRDF ¶24.) According to Plaintiff, the medications and injections she has taken to treat her migraines include: regular and prescription-strength Naproxen; Topamax; Zofran; Sumatriptan; and Emgality. (PAMF ¶7; DRPA ¶7; PSMF ¶7; DRPF ¶7.)

B. The Hotel—Operations and Policies
Defendant, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, LLC, (the "Hotel"), owns and operates a luxury hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, with [*12]  about 400 employees and 444 rooms (the Hotel). (DSMF ¶¶1-2; PRDF ¶¶1-2.) Erwin Schinnerl is the General Manager of the Hotel, and he has held that position since July 2017. (PAMF ¶44; DRPA ¶44; PSMF ¶44; DRPF ¶44.) The Hotel's employee handbook includes policies on reasonable accommodation, FMLA, attendance, and progressive discipline. (DSMF ¶4; PRDF ¶4.)

(i) Disability Policy
The employee handbook states that the Hotel "strives to provide reasonable accommodation to applicants or employees with disabilities upon request and to promote a constructive working environment for all employees." (DSMF ¶5; PRDF ¶5.) It is the Hotel's policy to provide equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, in connection with recruiting, hiring, placement, compensation, access to the Hotel's facilities, training, accommodation, promotion, termination, and all other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. (DSMF ¶6; PRDF ¶6.) The Hotel's policy further strives to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants or employees with disabilities upon request. (DSMF ¶6; PRDF ¶6.) The Hotel is committed to ensuring that no employees are retaliated against for [*13]  reporting or opposing discrimination on the basis of disability. (DSMF ¶6; PRDF ¶6.)

(ii) FMLA Policy
The Hotel provides all eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected leave in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). (DSMF ¶7; PRDF ¶7.) The employee handbook contains a stand-alone document titled "Employee Rights and Responsibilities Under the Family and Medical Leave Act," which sets forth the eligibility for FMLA leave and the procedure that Hotel employees must follow when requesting FMLA leave. (DSMF ¶7; PRDF ¶7.)
The "Eligibility Requirements" section of the FMLA policy provides:
Employees are eligible if they have worked for [the Hotel] for at least 12 months, have 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months, and if at least 50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.
(DSMF ¶9; PRDF ¶9.)
The "Employee Responsibilities" section of the FMLA policy provides in relevant part:
Employees must provide 30 days' advance written notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must comply with an employer's normal call-in [*14]  procedures. Employees must provide sufficient information for the employer to determine if leave may qualify for FMLA protection and anticipated timing and duration of leave.
(DSMF ¶10; PRDF ¶10.)

(iii) Attendance Policy
The Hotel's attendance policy provides that "[t]he success and smooth operation of [the Hotel] depends on each employee being at work on time as scheduled." (Doc. 34-21 at 1; DSMF ¶¶13, 18; PRDF ¶¶13, 18.) The policy creates a rotating system where certain attendance violations (i.e., tardiness) do not lead to formal discipline until they reach a specific number and the resulting discipline is not considered part of the progressive discipline process after a 12-month period. (DSMF ¶14; PRDF ¶14.) The policy defines tardiness as follows: "[a]n employee is tardy whenever he/she arrives seven (7) minutes after scheduled reporting time, as established by the Hotel or Department's local policy (unless the employee is tardy due to a reason protected by the FMLA, ADA or other similar state law)." (Doc. 34-21 at 1; DSMF ¶15; PRDF ¶15.) The policy contains the following penalties for tardiness infractions:
• An employee who is tardy three times in any four-month period will receive [*15]  a verbal warning;
• An employee who is tardy six times in any four-month period will receive a written warning;
• An employee who is tardy seven or more times within a twelve-month period will receive a second written warning; and
• An employee who is tardy eight or more times within a twelve-month period will receive a third written warning.
(DSMF ¶16; PRDF ¶16.) When an employee receives a third written warning in a twelve-month period based on tardiness, he/she is suspended pending an investigation, which may result in termination. (DSMF ¶17; PRDF ¶17.)

(iv) Progressive Discipline Policy
The Hotel's progressive discipline policy is intended to assist and encourage employees to correct their conduct and improve their performance. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.) The policy generally provides that discipline will be applied in a progressive sequence from verbal warning to termination. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.) An hourly employee would be subject to termination if he or she receives two written warnings within a twelve-month period, and a third incident occurs that is a violation of policies or rules or indicative of inappropriate behavior or poor judgment. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.) An employee who receives [*16]  a third written warning in twelve months or who engages in serious misconduct will be placed on suspension to provide the Hotel with the opportunity to investigate the facts surrounding the suspension. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.) Under the Hotel policy, a suspension is not a disciplinary action. (DSMF ¶20; PRDF ¶20.)

C. Plaintiff's Receipt/Awareness of Hotel Policies
Plaintiff was hired on June 26, 2018. (DSMF ¶¶3, 26; PRDF ¶¶3, 26; PAMF ¶12; DRPA ¶12; PSMF ¶12; DRPF ¶12.) Like all Hotel employees, she received a copy of the Hotel's employee handbook; and, like all Hotel employees, she was expected to adhere to the Hotel's quality expectations and standards while following all Hotel policies and procedures. (DSMF ¶¶4, 28; PRDF ¶¶4, 28.) Plaintiff was made aware of the attendance policy, and she signed acknowledgments on June 27, 2018, and again on February 22, 2019, indicating that she received the attendance policies, reviewed and understood them, and agreed to abide by them. (DSMF ¶19; PRDF ¶19.) Plaintiff also received the stand-alone "Employee Rights and Responsibilities Under the Family and Medical Leave Act," document, and she executed a form on June 27, 2018, acknowledging her receipt [*17]  of that document. (DSMF ¶8; PRDF ¶8.)
Plaintiff posted the FMLA policy, which included the "Employee Responsibilities" section, on a bulletin board at the Hotel, and Plaintiff's supervisor also asked Plaintiff to post a laminated FMLA notice in Plaintiff's work area. (DSMF ¶11; PRDF ¶11.) Plaintiff viewed the FMLA poster "at least a couple times a week." (DSMF ¶11; PRDF ¶11.)

D. Plaintiff's Employment with the Hotel
Plaintiff worked as a Guest Experience Expert at the Hotel from her hire date of June 26, 2018, through October 11, 2019, when her employment was terminated. (DSMF ¶¶3, 26-27, 33; PRDF ¶¶3, 26-27, 33; PAMF ¶12; DRPA ¶12; PSMF ¶12; DRPF ¶12.) Plaintiff was responsible for "front office" and "front desk agent" duties, which included: processing guest check-ins by confirming reservations, verifying guest identity, assigning rooms, and issuing the appropriate room key in accordance with property policies and procedures; protecting the privacy and security of guests and co-workers; and demonstrating good organization and time management skills. (DSMF ¶28; PRDF ¶28.) About 60 percent of Plaintiff's working time was spent on "concierge/guest relations" functions, and 40 percent was [*18]  spent working the front desk. (DSMF ¶28; PRDF ¶28.) Plaintiff's supervisors were Monette Delos Reyes, Front Office Manager, (PAMF ¶¶13-14; DRPF ¶¶13-14; PSMF ¶¶13-14; DRPF ¶¶13-14; Docs. 34-26; 34-31); Bayan Sabermanesh, Director of Rooms, (PAMF ¶18; DRPF ¶18; PSMF ¶18; DRPF ¶18); Bruce Kiefner, Front Desk Supervisor, (PAMF ¶20; DRPF ¶20; PSMF ¶20; DRPF ¶20); and Chris Caudle, Front Office Supervisor, (PAMF ¶21; DRPF ¶21; PSMF ¶21; DRPF ¶21).
Guest Experience Experts work one of four shifts: morning shift (7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.); evening shift (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.); overnight shift (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.); and, at times, a mid-shift (10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). (DSMF ¶29; PRDF ¶29). Plaintiff testified that her schedule "changed from day to day, week to week, month to month. It was never the same every day." (Doc. 34 at 133:22-24; PAMF ¶48; DRPA ¶48.) At the beginning of each shift, Guest Experience Experts go through a "pre-shift lineup" or "huddle" for about 10 to 15 minutes, during which the Hotel conveys to the Guest Experience Experts the "standard of the day," the Hotel occupancy, the VIP guests, the in-house groups, the guest engagement score, and any concerns. (DSMF ¶¶30-31; [*19]  PRDF ¶¶30-31.) This information "is needed for the [Guest Experience Expert] to perform at the highest level." (DSMF ¶32; PRDF ¶32.) If a Guest Experience Expert is late to his or her shift, missing the pre-shift lineup, then the supervisor on duty has to "find a time to give that information as soon as possible" to the tardy Guest Experience Expert. (DSMF ¶32; PRDF ¶32) (alteration omitted).
After working at the Hotel for two months, on August 21, 2018, Plaintiff issued a room key to a guest without verifying a picture ID or confirming the name of the guest, which resulted in Plaintiff giving a key to someone who was not authorized for that room, and that person entered an occupied room of another guest. (DSMF ¶34; PRDF ¶34.) Other incidents of Plaintiff's lack of attention to detail and miscommunication that caused negative guest experiences resulted in Plaintiff receiving a written warning on December 13, 2018, for her deficient work performance. (DSMF ¶35; PRDF ¶35.) Those incidents included: (1) an event on November 15, 2018, when Plaintiff made keys for a guest without completing the check-in process, which resulted in the housekeeping staff failing to clean the room because it [*20]  appeared as vacant in the Hotel's operating system; and (2) an event on November 30, 2018, when Plaintiff received a package for a guest but had it delivered to the wrong room, which resulted in the guest never receiving the package. (DSMF ¶35; PRDF ¶35.) Plaintiff received another written warning on February 27, 2019, for violation of established work rules. (DSMF ¶36; PRDF ¶36.) First, Plaintiff failed to "secure her bank" at the end of her shift, leaving $500 unlocked in a front desk cash drawer, in violation of the Hotel's cash handling policy. (DSMF ¶36; PRDF ¶36.) Second, on the same day, Plaintiff emailed a guest with a screenshot of the Hotel's reservation system, which contained confidential Hotel information, in violation of the Hotel's information protection agreement. (DSMF ¶36; PRDF ¶36.)
Plaintiff received her first and only performance review on June 1, 2019, from Delos Reyes. (DSMF ¶37; PRDF ¶37; PAMF ¶¶13-14; DRPA ¶¶13-14; PSMF ¶¶13-14; DRPF ¶¶13-14; Doc. 34-26.) Delos Reyes rated Plaintiff as either a "strong performer" or a "solid performer" in each performance area assessed, and she rated Plaintiff as a "solid performer" for her overall performance score. (Doc. 34-26 [*21]  at 1-7; PAMF ¶58; DRPA ¶58.) Delos Reyes wrote that Plaintiff "is a tremendous asset," but also that Plaintiff "is often late to work which needs to be improved," and in response to the comments, Plaintiff wrote that she "would agree with the above statements," and that she would "commit to better time management and efficiency."6 (Doc. 34-26 at 6; DSMF ¶37; PRDF ¶37; PAMF ¶15; DRPA ¶15; PSMF ¶15; DRPF ¶15.)
In July 2019, Plaintiff was tardy to work on eight straight work days, as follows:
• July 4, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 8:08 a.m.;
• July 6, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:19 a.m.;
• July 7, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:17 a.m.;
• July 11, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:18 a.m.;
• July 13, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:14 a.m.;
• July 14, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:09 a.m.;
• July 15, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but [*22]  she did not arrive until 3:12 p.m.; and
• July 20, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 7:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 7:21 a.m.
(DSMF ¶¶38-39; PRDF ¶¶38-39.) At the end of July 2019, Plaintiff's supervisor put Plaintiff on notice that she would be written up for her deficient attendance in July. (DSMF ¶40; PRDF ¶40.)
In August 2019, Plaintiff was tardy to work on the following seven days:
• August 3, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:14 a.m.;
• August 9, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:16 p.m.;
• August 23, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:23 p.m.;
• August 24, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:07 p.m.;
• August 25, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:29 a.m.;
• August 29, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:24 p.m.; and
• August 30, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:17 p.m.
(DSMF ¶50; PRDF ¶50.) Plaintiff [*23]  received a verbal warning for violation of the attendance policy on August 19, 2019, and she was reminded that further violations of the attendance policy would result in written warnings, suspension, and ultimately termination. (DSMF ¶¶41-42; PRDF ¶¶41-42; PAMF ¶¶22-23; DRPA ¶¶22-23; PSMF ¶¶22-23; DRPF ¶¶22-23; Doc. 34-27.) The disciplinary action form informed Plaintiff that "[t]he success and smooth operation of our hotel depends to a great extent on your being at work on time each day that you are scheduled. Arriving tardy places an extra burden on your fellow [colleagues] and creates a breakdown in our overall operation." (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42; Doc. 34-27.) It also informed Plaintiff of the Hotel's appeal process for all verbal or written disciplinary actions. (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42; Doc. 34-27.) Plaintiff signed the form without writing any comment. (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42.) But during the conversation with her supervisor, Delos Reyes, on August 19, 2019, Plaintiff disclosed that she was having issues with her medication, and explained that she was late because "when [she] would get up in the morning it was rough."7 (DSMF ¶43; PRDF ¶43.) Plaintiff requested that she be given a "set schedule," [*24]  meaning consistent begin and end times, to correct her chronic tardiness, and Plaintiff testified that, when asked by Delos Reyes what time Plaintiff would prefer, Plaintiff responded that she would prefer "afternoons versus the mornings," though she did not specifically request that it be 3:00-11:00 p.m. (Doc. 34 at 225:13-230:23, 250:8-25; DSMF ¶¶43, 58; PRDF ¶¶43, 58; PAMF ¶¶51-54; DRPA ¶51-54.) Plaintiff's supervisor agreed to modify Plaintiff's schedule, and stopped scheduling Plaintiff for 7:00 a.m. morning shifts, though Plaintiff continued to be scheduled for shifts with varying start times. (Doc. 34 at 225:13-230:23; DSMF ¶¶43-48, 50, 52; PRDF ¶43-48, 50, 52, 65; PAMF ¶¶51-54; DRPA ¶¶51-54.) Though Plaintiff did not request it, the Hotel excused the seven tardy days Plaintiff had in August 2019, including the afternoon shifts to which she was tardy, as an additional accommodation. (Doc. 38-3 at ¶11; DSMF ¶51; PRDF ¶51.)
In September 2019, Plaintiff was tardy to work 10 times, as follows:
• September 3, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:21 p.m.;
• September 4, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she [*25]  did not arrive until 3:10 p.m.;
• September 6, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 11:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 11:23 a.m.;
• September 9, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:21 a.m.;
• September 10, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 11:26 a.m.;
• September 14, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 3:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 3:23 p.m.;
• September 15, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 12:00 p.m., but she did not arrive until 12:15 p.m.;
• September 16, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:09 a.m.;
• September 20, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:15 a.m.; and
• September 21, 2019—Plaintiff was scheduled to begin work at 10:00 a.m., but she did not arrive until 10:12 a.m.
(DSMF ¶52; PRDF ¶52.)8
Plaintiff's tardiness was in violation of the Hotel's policies and procedures, and she received a third written warning, which triggered a suspension with a termination recommendation. (DSMF ¶53; PRDF ¶53.) Plaintiff was suspended on Friday, [*26]  October 4, 2019, pending the Hotel's investigation. (DSMF ¶53; PRDF ¶53; PAMF ¶26; DRPF ¶26; PSMF ¶26; DRPF ¶26.) The disciplinary action form stated:
Ayana, you have been trained and have signed the hotel's Attendance Policy. In the past 12 months, you have received two Written Warnings. In accordance with the employee handbook, as a non-management employee, if you have two active written warnings and a third incident warranting a written warning occurs during a 12-month period, it may result in separation of employment. The attendance infractions [in September 2019] may constitute a written warning and will be investigated.
Description of Corrective Action: Ayana, you are being suspended pending investigation. Please plan on meeting with Monette delos Reyes, Front Office Manager, on Tuesday, October 8, 2019 at 11:30 am in Bayan's office to be informed of the results of your suspension. If you have any information that you would like to share during the suspension, please forward to Monette delos Reyes or Human Resources so that it can be included in the overall review/investigation.
(Doc. 34-31 at 1; DSMF ¶53; PRDF ¶53; PAMF ¶¶26-28; DRPA ¶¶26-28; PSMF ¶¶26-28; DRPF ¶¶26-28.)
On October [*27]  8, 2019, the date that Plaintiff met with Delos Reyes,9 Nurse Practitioner Dormio faxed the following note to the HR Department of the Hotel:
Ayana Williams Dyce is a patient in our practice. Due to complications related to a medication she was trialed on, she had extreme fatigue and daytime drowsiness. Due to these symptoms, this medication has been changed as of 9/4/19 to prevent these complications in the future. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at: 770-682-2024.
(Doc. 34-32; DSMF ¶54; PRDF ¶54; PAMF ¶¶30-32; DRPA ¶¶30-32; PSMF ¶¶30-32; DRPF ¶¶30-32.) The next day, October 9, 2019, Plaintiff sent Delos Reyes an email that included information about Topamax and other medications, but the email did not mention that the medications were for Plaintiff's migraine headaches. (Doc. 34-34 at 1-2; PAMF ¶35; DRPA ¶35; PSMF ¶35; DRPF ¶35.) In light of the October 8th note from Dormio, the Hotel excused Plaintiff's tardiness on September 3-4, 2019. (DSMF ¶55; PRDF ¶55; PAMF ¶38; DRPA ¶38; PSMF ¶38; DRPF ¶38.) The October 8th note was the only document from a healthcare provider that Plaintiff submitted to the Hotel regarding any health condition, and that note [*28]  did not indicate that Plaintiff suffers from migraines. (DSMF ¶56; PRDF ¶56.) Plaintiff never provided the Hotel with any note from a healthcare provider, or other documentation, about her migraine condition.10 (DSMF ¶¶25, 49; PRDF ¶¶25, 49.) Plaintiff also never requested "FMLA leave" from the Hotel. (DSMF ¶12; PRDF ¶12.)
After investigating, the Hotel determined that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Hotel's attendance policy, and Plaintiff's employment was terminated on October 11, 2019, for violation of Hotel policy. (DSMF ¶¶62-64; PRDF ¶¶62-64; PAMF ¶36; DRPA ¶36; PSMF ¶36; DRPF ¶36.) The disciplinary action form stated:
Ayana, you have been tardy 10 times in recent weeks, as listed below. You provided a doctor note that indicates that a medication you took prior to September 4, 2019 may have caused extreme fatigue and daytime drowsiness. You indicated that due to the medication, you were unable to arrive to work on time. The doctor note indicates that your medication was changed after 9/4/19 to prevent those symptoms in the future. After 9/4/19, you were tardy 8 times as listed.
. . .
Ayana, you have been trained and have signed the hotel's Attendance Policy. In the past 12 months, [*29]  you have received two Written Warnings. In accordance with the employee handbook, as a non-management employee, if you have two active written warnings and a third incident warranting a written warning occurs during a 12-month period, it may result in separation of employment. The attendance infractions above constitute a written warning. Your employment is separated under the progressive discipline policy effective 10/11/2019.
(Doc. 34-33 at 1; PAMF ¶¶37, 39; DRPA ¶¶37, 39; PSMF ¶¶37, 39; DRPF ¶¶37, 39.)
Plaintiff worked for Defendant for more than 12 months, and she worked more than 1,250 hours in the twelve months preceding July 2019. (PAMF ¶42; DRPA ¶42; PSMF ¶42; DRPF ¶42.) Defendant employed more than 50 employees within 75 miles of its Atlanta hotel in the calendar years 2018 and 2019. (PAMF ¶43; DRPA ¶43; PSMF ¶43; DRPF ¶43.) Plaintiff testified that she knows of at least one other Hotel employee, Dellie, who has "a condition," and has a set consistent schedule—i.e., her shifts begin and end at the same time day to day and week to week—though Plaintiff acknowledged that, unlike new employees, Dellie has worked at the Hotel for at least 10 years and had that "grandfathered in." [*30]  (Doc. 34 at 227:5-12; PAMF ¶57; DRPA ¶57.) At Plaintiff's current job, she has a set consistent schedule, which according to Plaintiff, has made it easier to manage her migraines. (PAMF ¶¶55-56; DRPA ¶¶55-56.)

IV. DISCUSSION

A. FMLA Interference (Count One)
In count one of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that her migraine headaches qualified as a serious health condition under the FMLA, and that Defendant interfered with the exercise of her FMLA rights by: (1) failing to provide the notice it was required to provide of her FMLA eligibility and other rights after it became aware of Plaintiff's serious health condition and her related need for intermittent FMLA leave; and (2) disciplining Plaintiff, and later terminating her employment, based on her absences from work that were caused by her serious health condition. (Doc. 30 at 5-6.)
The FMLA applies to private-sector employers with 50 or more employees, and it grants eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for the employee's own serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the position, or for the employee to care for a close family member with a serious health [*31]  condition. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1204 (11th Cir. 2001); Kaylor v. Fannin Reg'l Hosp., Inc., 946 F. Supp. 988, 995 (N.D. Ga. 1996); 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a). To be "eligible," the employee must have been employed for at least 12 months, and also worked at least 1,250 hours during the prior 12-month period. Kaylor, 946 F. Supp. at 996; 29 U.S.C. § 2611(2). The FMLA also provides for "intermittent" leave or a "reduced schedule" leave when the leave is medically necessary for a serious health condition. See Holmes v. Fulton Cnty. Sch. Dist., No. 1:06-CV-2556-CC-AJB, 2007 WL 9650147, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 24, 2007). Intermittent leave is leave that may be taken "in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason." Diamond v. Hospice of Fla. Keys, Inc., 677 F. App'x 586, 592 (11th Cir. 2017); 29 U.S.C. § 2612(b); 29 C.F.R. § 825.202(a) ("Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason"). Reduced schedule leave reduces an employee's usual number of working hours per workday or workweek. Holmes, 2007 WL 9650147 at *10; 29 C.F.R. § 825.202(a) ("A reduced leave schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time"). Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken when "medically necessary" for either: "(1) planned and/or unanticipated medical treatment of a related serious health condition; or (2) recovery from treatment for a serious health condition." Holmes, 2007 WL 9650147 at *10 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(c)). Intermittent or reduced schedule [*32]  leave may also be taken "for absences where the employee 'is incapacitated or unable to perform the essential functions of the position because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.'" Holmes, 2007 WL 9650147 at *10 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.203(c)(2)).
An FMLA interference claim has two elements: (1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit. White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1191 (11th Cir. 2015). The first element subsumes several sub-elements, including that: (1) the defendant is a covered entity; (2) the plaintiff is eligible for FMLA benefits; (3) the plaintiff sought leave for a qualifying reason; and (4) the plaintiff provided notice meeting certain criteria. See Moore v. GPS Hosp. Partners IV, LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 1293, 1297 (S.D. Ala. 2019) (citing Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Civil) 4.16 (2013)). The second element—denial of a benefit to which the employee was entitled—includes an employer's failure to provide notice to the employee that the employer is required to provide. Ramji v. Hosp. Housekeeping Sys., LLC, 992 F.3d 1233, 1243 (11th Cir. 2021). That is, "[w]hen an employer acquires knowledge that an employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, that triggers the employer's obligation to evaluate whether the employee's requested absence in fact qualifies for FMLA protection." Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1243. And absent extenuating circumstances, "the employer must [*33]  notify the employee of the employee's eligibility to take FMLA leave within five business days." Munoz v. Selig Enterprises, Inc., 981 F.3d 1265, 1274 (11th Cir. 2020) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(b)(1)); see also Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1243. "An employer's failure to notify an employee about her right to take FMLA leave may constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the exercise of her FMLA rights." Munoz, 981 F.3d at 1274 (internal quotations and alteration omitted); see also Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1243.
But a technical violation alone is not enough. Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1241. To prevail on an FMLA interference claim, Plaintiff must "demonstrate some harm from the alleged interference, and that harm must be remediable by either damages or equitable relief." Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1241 (internal quotations omitted); Munoz, 981 F.3d at 1274-75; Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1284 (11th Cir. 1999) ("Even if the defendants have committed certain technical infractions under the FMLA, plaintiff may not recover in the absence of damages"). Damages include wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation that the employee did not receive due to the FMLA violation, and equitable relief includes employment, reinstatement, and promotion. Ramji, 992 at 1245. When bringing an interference claim, the employer's motives are irrelevant. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207-08; White, 789 F.3d at 1191 n.2 (an employer may be liable for FMLA interference despite good intentions as its "motives are irrelevant").
In sum, to prevail on an FMLA interference claim, [*34]  Plaintiff must show that:
(1) Plaintiff was entitled to a benefit, which means that:
• Defendant was a covered entity;
• Plaintiff was eligible for FMLA benefits;
• Plaintiff sought leave for a qualifying reason; and
• Plaintiff provided proper notice; and
(2) Defendant denied the benefit, which includes that Defendant failed to provide required notice to Plaintiff of her eligibility and other rights under the FMLA.
If Plaintiff shows these elements, she must then show that she suffered harm, and that the harm is remediable by damages or equitable relief. An employer is not liable for interfering with FMLA leave, however, if the employer shows that the employee who was dismissed would have been dismissed regardless of any request for leave, meaning that the dismissal was "wholly unrelated" to the FMLA leave. Davis v. Yellowpages.com LLC, No. 1:17-CV-397-ELR-JKL, 2019 WL 13292976, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Jan. 25, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:17-CV-00397-ELR, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250452, 2019 WL 13292974 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 28, 2019) (recommending that summary judgment be granted on claim that defendant interfered with plaintiff's future intermittent FMLA leave by terminating her employment, in part because defendant showed that plaintiff's dismissal was "wholly unrelated" to her FMLA leave; defendant had to reduce her team by one employee, and plaintiff was chosen in the Rate [*35]  and Rank process); see also Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010) (holding that an employee can be dismissed, preventing her from exercising her right to commence FMLA leave, without violating the FMLA, if the employee would have been dismissed regardless of any request for FMLA leave). Although a causal nexus is not an element of an interference claim, the employer can raise this lack of causation as an affirmative defense to liability. Spakes v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff's Off., 631 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011). Thus, the Court must also determine whether the FMLA leave (or future FMLA leave) was the proximate cause of the employee's discharge. Davis, 2019 WL 13292976, at *16 (citing Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2010)).
Here, the first two prongs under element one are undisputed—i.e., Defendant was a covered entity, and Plaintiff was eligible for FMLA benefits because she was employed for at least 12 months, and also worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding July 2019. (PAMF ¶¶42-43; DRPA ¶¶42-43; PSMF ¶¶42-43; DRPF ¶¶42-43.) Prongs three and four under element one, and element two are disputed. (Docs. 37 at 9-21; 38-1 at 12-21; 43 at 2-13; 45 at 21-25; 47 at 2-15; 48 at 5-8.) The Court will address each in turn.

(i) Element One

(a) Qualifying Reason
An employee is entitled to FMLA leave for "a serious health condition that makes [her] [*36]  unable to perform the functions of [her] position . . . ." Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1242 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D))(alterations in original). "A 'serious health condition' means 'an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves . . . continuing treatment by a health care provider." Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. §2611(11)(B)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.113(a). Under the FMLA regulations, migraine headaches can qualify as a "serious health condition." Wooddy v. Delta Air Lines, No. 17-23808-CIV, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4135, 2019 WL 659359, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 8, 2019) (citing Graham v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, Inc., 521 F. App'x 419, 422 (6th Cir. 2013)); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.113(d) (listing examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave, and including on that list "headaches other than migraine") (emphasis added). To qualify as continuing treatment for a chronic serious health condition, treatment "(1) [r]equires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a year) for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider; (2) [c]ontinues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and (3) [m]ay cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)." See 29 C.F.R. § 815.115(c). Under the regulations, "incapacity means inability to work, attend school or perform other [*37]  regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment therefore, or recovery therefrom." See 29 C.F.R. § 825.113(b).
Plaintiff argues that her migraine headaches qualify as a "serious health condition" under the FMLA because it is undisputed that: (1) she visited a health care provider for treatment of her migraines at least twice per year; (2) she has been dealing with chronic migraines since she was 15 years old; and (3) the migraines "incapacitate" her because the migraines, and the medication she takes to treat the migraines, cause pain, loss of consciousness, extreme fatigue, daytime drowsiness, inability to use her right arm and difficulty typing. (Docs. 37 at 12-14; 45 at 23-24.) Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, two of those three facts are disputed. It is undisputed that Plaintiff visited a healthcare provider for treatment twice per year. (PAMF ¶¶45-46; DRPA ¶¶45-46; PSMF ¶¶45-46; DRPF ¶¶45-46.) But although Defendant admits that Plaintiff testified that she has suffered with migraines since she was 15 years old, it otherwise disputes this fact because it is not supported by any medical records or documentation. (PSMF ¶1; DRPF ¶1.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff failed [*38]  to establish that her migraines caused "incapacity," or that her tardiness was "medically necessary," primarily, again, because she provided only her own testimony and "self-serving" declaration to support that fact, and it is not supported by any medical evidence, so she, therefore, cannot establish that she had a serious health condition, or that FMLA leave was medically necessary. (Docs. 38-1 at 12-16; 43 at 4-10.)
Whether or not Plaintiff's migraine headaches in this case qualify as a serious health condition, and whether or not her tardiness was "medically necessary" due to her migraine headaches, are disputed issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment on this claim for both parties. Plaintiff testified that her "normal" migraines cause "physical pain, literally throbbing [in] my head, buzzing in my ears, dizziness, vomiting, [and] nausea" and "blurred vision." (DSMF ¶22; PRDF ¶22; PAMF ¶3; DRPA ¶3; PSMF ¶3; DRPF ¶3.) Plaintiff also testified that during a "hemiplegic" migraine, her "vision gets so blurry, I can't see anything . . . I lose control of my right arm . . . [and] my right side of my face goes slack," she is unable to hold objects in her right hand, and she [*39]  has difficulty typing. (PAMF ¶¶4-5; DRPA ¶¶4-5; PSMF ¶¶4-5; DRPF ¶¶4-5.) Plaintiff further averred that her tardiness in July and September 2019 was because she was experiencing the symptoms of her migraines, and/or the side-effects of her migraine medication. (Doc. 37-2 ¶¶6-8.) Viewing the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on Defendant's motion for summary judgment, the Court finds that a reasonable jury, if they find Plaintiff's testimony credible, could conclude that Plaintiff has suffered from migraine headaches since she was 15, that her migraine headaches caused episodic incapacity, and that her tardiness in July and September of 2019, was due to the episodic incapacity caused by her migraine headaches. See 29 C.F.R. § 815.115(c). But Defendant is correct that Plaintiff cites to no medical evidence supporting those facts; only her testimony and declaration support her claims. Viewing the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Defendant, as required on Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff's testimony is not credible, and could conclude that the lack of supportive [*40]  medical evidence is fatal to her claim.11
It is not the Court's role on summary judgment to weigh conflicting evidence or make credibility determinations, and the Court must avoid doing so. Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 742 (11th Cir. 1996); Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., 9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir. 1993) (the court's function, when deciding a motion for summary judgment, is not to decide issues of material fact; it is to determine whether such issues exist to be tried). "Instead, the evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Hairston, 9 F. 3d at 919 (internal quotations and alteration omitted); see also Mize, 93 F.3d at 742 ("the non-movant's evidence is to be accepted for purposes of summary judgment").

(b) Employee's Notice
Whether or not Plaintiff provided sufficient notice of her need for FMLA-qualifying leave is also a disputed issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment on this claim for both parties. Though having a qualifying reason for FMLA leave is necessary, the qualifying reason alone is not sufficient for an employee to earn FMLA leave. White, 789 F.3d at 1195. The employee "must also give her employer notice of her need for leave, and she can state an interference claim only if she gave proper notice." Id. (internal citations omitted). Under the federal regulations, [*41]  what a notice must say and when notice must be given depends on whether the need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. Id.
First, for timing, if the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee must give at least 30 days advance notice, unless giving 30 days' notice is impracticable, in which case the employee must give only "such notice as is practicable." White, 789 F.3d at 1195 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 2612(e)(2) and 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(a)). But if the need for leave is unforeseeable, the 30-day requirement does not apply, and instead, the employee must provide notice to the employer "as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a)).
Second, for content, an employee is not required to explicitly mention the FMLA when giving notice, "[b]ut the FMLA and its regulations do require that the notice convey certain information." White, 789 F.3d at 1196. If the need for leave is foreseeable, an employee must give notice that is "sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave," and must provide the "anticipated timing and duration of the leave." Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(c) (alteration in original)). But if the need for leave is unforeseeable, "an employee need only 'provide sufficient information for [her] employer [*42]  to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request.'" Id. (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(b) (alteration in original)).
The federal regulations for both foreseeable and unforeseeable leave also allow an employer to establish notice and procedure requirements, absent unusual circumstances. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(c) ("When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances."); 29 C.F.R. § 825.302(d) (when leave is foreseeable, "[a]n employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances.").
Neither the FMLA, nor its implementing regulations, defines the terms "foreseeable" and "unforeseeable," but generally, "an employee's need for leave is foreseeable if it is based on planned medical treatment." White, 789 F.3d at 1196. Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff's need for leave was unforeseeable, given that it was not for "planned medical treatment." Id.; see also Munoz, 981 F.3d at 1276-77 (recognizing that employees with health conditions that cause sudden, acute flareups can demonstrate an unforeseeable need for FMLA leave). Thus, Plaintiff [*43]  was required to: (1) provide notice of her need for leave "as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case"; (2) "'provide sufficient information for [her] employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request'"; and (3) absent a showing of unusual circumstances, "comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave." White, 789 F.3d at 1195-96; 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(c).
Plaintiff argues that she satisfied her duty to notify Defendant of her unforeseeable need for leave because: (1) she "promptly" used the Hotel's normal call-in procedures, and "immediately" alerted her supervisor every time a migraine, or the medication side-effects, prevented her from getting to work on time; (2) during her performance review in June 2019, she informed her two direct supervisors, Delos Reyes and Sabermanesh, that her tardiness was because of her migraines and the medication side-effects; (3) she informed Delos Reyes two other times—at the meetings on August 19, 2019, and October 8, 2019—that her tardiness was caused by her migraines and the medication side-effects; (4) in advance of the October 8, 2019, meeting, she "was directed to submit [*44]  a note from her doctor and other information regarding her condition and the side-effects of her medications"; and (5) the Disciplinary Action Form terminating her employment "specifically described [Plaintiff's] medical condition symptoms, and the side-effects of her medication." (Docs. 37 at 17-19; 45 at 22-24; see also Doc. 37-2 ¶¶6-8; PAMF ¶47; PSMF ¶47.) Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion that these facts are "undisputed record evidence," all of these facts are disputed. (Docs. 37 at 19; 38-1 at 14-17; 43 at 10-13.)
First, Defendant admits that Plaintiff called in, but disputes that she alerted her supervisor, did so "immediately," or followed the Hotel's call-in procedure. (DRPA ¶47; DRPF ¶47; Doc. 34 at 183:3-184:13.)
Second, Defendant disputes that Plaintiff ever told Sabermanesh or Delos Reyes that her tardiness was because of her migraine headaches, though Defendant agrees that Plaintiff now says she did. (PAMF ¶¶16-17, 19, 24-25, 33-34; DRPA ¶¶16-17, 19, 24-25, 33-34; PSMF ¶¶16-17, 19, 24-25, 33-34; DRPF ¶¶16-17, 19, 24-25, 33-34.) Defendant points to the written review by Delos Reyes, which does not mention anything about Plaintiff's migraines, to the fact that Sabermanesh [*45]  was not present at Plaintiff's performance review in June 2019, and also to Sabermanesh's testimony that he was not aware that Plaintiff had any medical issues, he specifically did not know that Plaintiff had migraine headaches, and he never discussed migraines or any other medical issues with Plaintiff. (DRPF ¶¶15, 17, 19; DRPA ¶¶15, 17, 19; Docs. 34-26; 36 at 18:15-19:12.) Defendant also points to Plaintiff's own testimony that: (1) when she met with Delos Reyes on August 19, 2019, she told Delos Reyes only that she had been tardy because she "wasn't feeling well," (PSMF ¶¶24-25; DRPF ¶¶24-25; PAMF ¶¶24-25; DRPA ¶¶24-25; Doc. 34 at 223:15-20); and (2) she "can't remember" the meeting on October 8, 2019, (PSMF ¶¶33-34; DRPF ¶¶33-34; PAMF ¶¶33-34; DRPA ¶¶33-34; Doc. 34 at 245:3-13).
Third, the form that Plaintiff asserts directed her "to submit a note from her doctor and other information regarding her condition and the side-effects of her medications," (Doc. 37 at 18), states only "If you have any information that you would like to share during the suspension, please forward to Monette Delos Reyes or Human Resources so that it can be included in the overall review/investigation." (Doc. [*46]  34-31 at 1; PSMF ¶28; DRPF ¶28.) And the note dated October 8, 2019, that Plaintiff provided from her healthcare provider did not mention migraines, nor did any of the emails that Plaintiff sent to Delos Reyes the following day mention migraines. (Docs. 34-32; 34-34 at 1-2; DSMF ¶54; PRDF ¶54; PAMF ¶¶30-32, 35; DRPA ¶¶30-32, 35; PSMF ¶¶30-32, 35; DRPF ¶¶30-32, 35.)
Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the Disciplinary Action Form terminating her employment "specifically described [Plaintiff's] medical condition symptoms, and the side-effects of her medication," (Doc. 37 at 18-19), but a plain review of the form shows that it does not "specifically describe" Plaintiff's medical condition or symptoms; indeed, like the doctor's note and emails, it does not reference migraines, or any of Plaintiff's symptoms of migraines, at all. (Doc. 34-34 at 1; PSMF ¶37; DRPF ¶37.) And to the extent that it references side-effects of medication, it states only that Plaintiff's doctor's note indicated that "a medication" that Plaintiff took prior to September 4, 2019, may have caused extreme fatigue and daytime drowsiness, but that the medication was changed after September 4th to prevent those symptoms in [*47]  the future. (Id.) The form further states, however, that after September 4th, Plaintiff was tardy eight times. (Id.)
Viewing the evidence before the Court in the light most favorable to the non-movant, as required, summary judgment is not appropriate for either party given the inconsistent and conflicting testimony about whether Plaintiff communicated any notice at all that she suffered from migraine headaches and needed leave for that reason, let alone whether she provided sufficient notice. See Mize, 98 F.3d at 742 ("It is not the court's role to weigh conflicting evidence or to make credibility determinations"); see also Fuller v. AT&T, No. 12-1001, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1832, 2014 WL 66019, *6 (W.D. Penn. Jan. 8, 2014) ("In a dispute over an employee's adequacy of notice, the issue is generally a question of fact") (citing Lichtenstein v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 691 F.3d 294, 304 (3d Cir. 2021)); Ruark v. Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc., No. 4:13-cv-00283-KGB, 2014 WL 1809606, *5 (E.D. Ark. May 2, 2014) ("the adequacy of an employee's notice requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances and is typically a jury question") (citing Murphy v. FedEx Nat'l LTL, Inc., 618 F.3d 893, 903 (8th Cir. 2010)).

(ii) Element Two
Plaintiff argues that Defendant denied her two types of FMLA notice that it was required to provide: "eligibility notice," and "rights and responsibilities notice." (Docs. 37 at 14-19; 45 at 21-25); see Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1243 (an employer's "[f]ailure to follow the notice requirements . . . may constitute an interference with, restraint, [*48]  or denial of the exercise of an employee's FMLA rights") (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.300(e)). Defendant argues that it had no obligation to provide this notice because Plaintiff's notice, which is required first, was deficient given that Plaintiff never requested FMLA leave, or communicated any information that was sufficient to make Defendant aware that Plaintiff needed FMLA-qualifying leave. (Docs. 38 at 13-17; 43 at 10-13.)
As explained above, in addition to a genuine factual dispute regarding prong three under element one (qualifying reason), there is a genuine factual dispute regarding prong four—whether or not Plaintiff provided any notice, let alone sufficient notice, of her need for FMLA-qualifying leave. See Supra, Section IV(A)(i)(b). Thus, the Court need not, and indeed cannot, address element two. Defendant's obligation to provide notice of Plaintiff's FMLA eligibility and other rights is not triggered unless Plaintiff first gives sufficient notice of the need for leave, Ramji, 992 F.3d at 1243; White, 789 F.3d at 1195; and deciding the issue about Plaintiff's notice, as discussed, requires the fact-finder to make credibility determinations and weigh inconsistent and conflicting evidence, which is not the Court's role on summary judgment.12 See [*49]  Mize, 98 F.3d at 742.
Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion, (Doc. 37), which seeks judgment only on count one be DENIED. The Court further RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion, (Doc. 38), be DENIED as to count one.

B. ADA Failure to Accommodate (Count Two)
In count two of the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the ADA in two ways. (Doc. 30 at 6-7.) First, she alleges that Defendant discriminated by terminating her employment because she was disabled. (Id.) Second, she alleges that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her disability by failing to permit her to occasionally arrive late to work, or alternatively, by failing to engage in the interactive process to offer other accommodations that would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of her job and continue in her position. (Id.) In her response to Defendant's motion, however, she states that her ADA claim is "for a failure to accommodate," and that her termination is "more a matter of damages than discrimination in and of itself." (Doc. 45 at 8 n.5.) Because Plaintiff does not rely on, and indeed, disavows that her ADA claim is based on discriminatory discharge, the Court finds that ground [*50]  is abandoned and will address only Defendant's alleged failure to accommodate. See Resol. Tr. Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) ("grounds alleged in the complaint but not relied upon in summary judgment are deemed abandoned"); Perez v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., No. 1:12-CV-3161-MHS, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183026, 2013 WL 6970898, at *11 n. 13 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 19, 2013) (finding that, although plaintiff alleged in the complaint that defendant retaliated against him after he filed his EEOC charge, plaintiff did not address this ground in defending his retaliation claim on summary judgment, and it, therefore, was abandoned).
To establish a prima facie case for a failure to accommodate, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she has a disability; (2) she was a "qualified individual," at the relevant time; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). For the third prong, "an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis in original); Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. There is no additional burden to prove disparate treatment. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262. Thus, Plaintiff need not show that Defendant treated non-disabled co-workers differently, nor is there any subsequent burden for Defendant to show a legitimate non-discriminatory [*51]  reason for terminating Plaintiff, or for Plaintiff to show that the reasons were pretextual. Id. In other words, unlike other discrimination cases, Defendant is not insulated from liability under the ADA by treating its non-disabled employees exactly the same as its disabled employees. Id. "[T]he very purpose of reasonable accommodation laws is to require employers to treat disabled individuals differently in some circumstances—namely, when different treatment would allow a disabled individual to perform the essential functions of his position by accommodating his disability without posing an undue hardship on the employer." Id. ("Allowing uniformly-applied, disability-neutral policies to trump the ADA requirement of reasonable accommodations would utterly eviscerate that ADA requirement")(citing US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 397-98 (2002)).
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case because she cannot satisfy any of the three required prongs. (Docs. 38-1 at 21-30; 48 at 2-5.) Plaintiff argues that she satisfies all three. (Doc. 45 at 8-21.) The Court will address each prong in turn.

(i) Disability—Prong One
A plaintiff can establish an ADA-qualifying disability in one of three ways, by showing: [*52]  (1) "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities"; (2) "a record of such an impairment"; or (3) that he or she is "regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); Mazzeo v. Color Resols. Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2014). Major life activities under the ADA include the following: "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A).
The Act requires a broad construction of the definition of disability, and thus, "the question of whether an individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis." Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268; 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A) (definition of disability to "be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals"). Similarly, "the phrase 'substantially limits' is to be construed broadly in terms of extensive coverage and is not meant to be a demanding standard." Id. at 1269 (some internal quotations omitted) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i)). "An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D). And the determination of whether or not an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity [*53]  "shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures," such as medication. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(E)(i); see also Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1269.
Following this broad construction standard, and viewing the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on Defendant's summary judgment motion, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff has an ADA-qualifying disability. Plaintiff testified that her "normal" migraines cause "physical pain, literally throbbing [in] my head, buzzing in my ears, dizziness, vomiting, [and] nausea" and "blurred vision." (DSMF ¶22; PRDF ¶22; PAMF ¶3; DRPA ¶3; PSMF ¶3; DRPF ¶3.) Plaintiff also testified that during a "hemiplegic" migraine, her "vision gets so blurry, I can't see anything . . . I lose control of my right arm . . . [and] my right side of my face goes slack," she is unable to hold objects in her right hand, and she has difficulty typing. (PAMF ¶¶4-5; DRPA ¶¶4-5; PSMF ¶¶4-5; DRPF ¶¶4-5.) Based on this testimony, a reasonable jury could find that, when Plaintiff's migraine headaches are "active," major life activities, including performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, reading, concentrating, and thinking [*54]  are substantially limited. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(1), 12102(2)(A), 12102(4)(D); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(C) ("An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities in order to be considered a disability"). While the record before the Court may lack medical evidence that supports Plaintiff's testimony, it is not the Court's role on summary judgment to make credibility determinations or weigh evidence. See Mize, 98 F.3d at 742. Because a reasonable jury could credit Plaintiff's testimony, a reasonable jury could find that her chronic migraine headaches, when active and unmitigated, substantially limit one or more major life activities. Plaintiff thus survives summary judgment on this prong.

(ii) Qualified Individual—Prong Two
A "qualified individual" can perform the essential functions of the employment position in question, with or without reasonable accommodation. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255; see also Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406 (1979) (a qualified person "is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap"). "An employer must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with known disabilities unless such accommodations would result in undue hardship to the employer." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000). An accommodation—a modification or adjustment to the work environment—is "reasonable" [*55]  and necessary under the ADA, only if it enables the employee to perform the position's essential functions. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. If the individual cannot perform an essential function of the job, even with an accommodation, then by definition, she is not a "qualified individual," and is not covered under the ADA. Id. The ADA does not require an employer to eliminate an essential function of a job, nor "to reallocate job duties in order to change the essential functions of a job," but it may require that an employer restructure a particular job by altering or eliminating one or more of its "marginal functions." Id. (emphasis in original); Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.
Essential functions "are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257 (citing Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365). Whether or not a function is essential is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining multiple factors. Id. at 1258. The employer's judgment about which functions of a job are essential is entitled to substantial weight, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, that description is evidence of the essential functions of the job. Id. at 1257; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. When considering the employer's [*56]  judgment about essential functions, testimony from the plaintiff's supervisor, as well as the company's "official position" are considered. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257. Other factors to consider include: (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (2) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (3) the terms of any collective bargaining agreement; (4) the work experience of past incumbents in the job; (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs; (6) if the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (7) if there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; and (8) if the function is highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position was hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. Id. at 1259.
Here, the undisputed evidence establishes that punctuality was an essential function of Plaintiff's position. First, the evidence establishes that Defendant placed a high priority on punctuality, as was expressly provided in its employee handbook, which stated that "[t]he success and smooth operation of [the Hotel] depends on each employee being at work [*57]  on time as scheduled." (Docs. 34-21 at 1; DSMF ¶¶13-18; PRDF ¶¶13-18.) The handbook also contained a detailed attendance policy, which defined tardiness as arriving seven minutes or later after the scheduled report time and set out the progressive penalties for continued tardiness, though the policy stated that tardiness for a protected reason was excused. (Id.)
Second, the undisputed evidence establishes that it was Defendant's standard procedure that at the beginning of each shift, Guest Experience Experts, which was Plaintiff's position, went through a "pre-shift lineup" or "huddle" for about 10 to 15 minutes, during which the Hotel conveys to the Guest Experience Experts the "standard of the day," the Hotel occupancy, the VIP guests, the in-house groups, the guest engagement score, and any concerns. (DSMF ¶¶30-31; PRDF ¶¶30-31.) This information was "needed for the [Guest Experience Expert] to perform at the highest level," and if a Guest Experience Expert was late to his or her shift, missing the pre-shift lineup, then the supervisor on duty had to "find a time to give that information as soon as possible" to the tardy Guest Experience Expert. (DSMF ¶32; PRDF ¶32) (alteration omitted). [*58] 
Third, the undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiff was aware of the importance Defendant placed on punctuality. Plaintiff received a copy of the employee handbook upon hire, and she signed acknowledgments on June 27, 2018, and again on February 22, 2019, indicating that she received the attendance policies, reviewed and understood them, and agreed to abide by them. (DSMF ¶¶4, 19, 28; PRDF ¶¶4, 19, 28.) At Plaintiff's performance review on June 1, 2019, Delos Reyes, Plaintiff's supervisor, wrote that Plaintiff "is often late to work which needs to be improved," and in response, Plaintiff wrote that she agreed and would "commit to better time management and efficiency." (Doc. 34-26 at 6; DSMF ¶37; PRDF ¶37; PAMF ¶¶13-15; DRPA ¶¶13-15; PSMF ¶¶13-15; DRPF ¶¶13-15.) Plaintiff received a verbal warning for violation of the attendance policy on August 19, 2019 based on multiple incidents of tardiness in July, and she was reminded then that further violations of the attendance policy would result in written warnings, suspension, and ultimately termination. (DSMF ¶¶38-42; PRDF ¶¶38-42; PAMF ¶¶22-23; DRPA ¶¶22-23; PSMF ¶¶22-23; DRPF ¶¶22-23; Doc. 34-27.) The disciplinary action form for [*59]  the warning informed Plaintiff that "[t]he success and smooth operation of our hotel depends to a great extent on your being at work on time each day that you are scheduled. Arriving tardy places an extra burden on your fellow [colleagues] and creates a breakdown in our overall operation." (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42; Doc. 34-27). Plaintiff signed that disciplinary action form without writing any comment. (DSMF ¶42; PRDF ¶42.) On October 4, 2019, Plaintiff received a third written warning for violation of the attendance policy,13 based on multiple incidents of tardiness in September, which triggered her suspension. (DSMF ¶53; PRDF ¶53; PAMF ¶26-28; DRPF ¶26-28; PSMF ¶26-28; DRPF ¶26-28.)
Fourth, the nature of Plaintiff's job provides further support that punctuality was an essential function. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was responsible for "front office" and "front desk agent" duties, which included processing guest check-ins, verifying guest identity, assigning rooms, and issuing room keys, as well as "concierge/guest relations" functions. (DSMF ¶28; PRDF ¶28.) These are not duties that can be postponed or performed off-site. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1366 (holding that punctuality is an essential function of appellant's [*60]  job as a store coordinator because "unlike other jobs that can be performed without regard to a specific schedule" the store coordinator tasks "by their very nature must be performed daily at a specific time"); see also Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994) (regular and predictable attendance is an essential function of many jobs, and district court correctly held that plaintiff failed to prove he was a qualified individual because he failed to satisfy the "presence" requirement of a housekeeping aide).
Plaintiff unquestionably failed to perform the essential function of punctuality; and she was, therefore, not a qualified individual without an accommodation that would enable her to perform the essential function of punctuality. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1366. "The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. When a plaintiff cannot demonstrate a "reasonable accommodation," the employer's delay or failure in investigating a reasonable accommodation is unimportant, and further, an employer has no duty to show undue hardship until [*61]  the plaintiff first shows that a reasonable accommodation exists. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367. Importantly, "reasonable accommodation" does not mean that an employer is required "to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Id. "This is so because the word 'reasonable' would be rendered superfluous in the ADA if employers were required in every instance to provide employees 'the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997). "[U]nder the ADA, a qualified individual with a disability is 'not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.'" Id. at 1286.
Plaintiff asserts in her response that she requested two reasonable accommodations that Defendant failed to provide. (Doc. 45 at 16-21.) First, at the August 19, 2019, meeting with Delos Reyes, she requested that her work schedule be adjusted so that her shift times were consistent "day to day and week to week," but Plaintiff's schedule remained "inconsistent." (Doc. 45 at 17-19.) "[T]he second reasonable accommodation Defendant was required but failed to provide," according to Plaintiff, was allowing Plaintiff to take intermittent FMLA leave, which "would have allowed her to arrive [*62]  late to work as needed." (Doc. 45 at 20.) Plaintiff's second accommodation argument fails because it is undisputed that Plaintiff never requested "FMLA leave." (DSMF ¶12; PRDF ¶12). As part of her FMLA interference claim, discussed above, Plaintiff argues that she sufficiently put Defendant on "notice" that she needed FMLA-qualifying leave, but notice under the FMLA is a different standard, and Plaintiff admits that she "never specifically requested 'FMLA leave,'" which is fatal to her accommodation claim. (PRDF ¶12.) "An employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal to the prima facie case; the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Warren v. Volusia Cnty., Fla., 188 F. App'x 859, 863 (11th Cir. 2006); see also Connelly v. WellStar Health Sys., Inc., 758 F. App'x 825, 831 (11th Cir. 2019) (affirming grant of summary judgment on failure to accommodate claim because plaintiff never alleged that she requested any disability-specific accommodation that triggered defendant's duty to accommodate her).
As for Plaintiff's request for a modified schedule, the undisputed evidence establishes that during the August 19, 2019, meeting when Plaintiff received the verbal warning about her tardiness, Plaintiff disclosed to her supervisor, Delos [*63]  Reyes, that she was having issues with her medication, and explained that she was late because "when [she] would get up in the morning it was rough." (DSMF ¶43; PRDF ¶43.) Plaintiff requested that she be given a "set schedule," meaning consistent begin and end times day to day and week to week, to correct her chronic tardiness, and Plaintiff testified that, when asked by Delos Reyes what time Plaintiff would prefer if they could do so, Plaintiff responded that she would prefer "afternoons versus the mornings," though she did not specifically request that it be a set schedule of 3:00-11:00 p.m. (Doc. 34 at 225:13-230:23, 250:8-25; DSMF ¶¶43, 57-58; PRDF ¶¶43, 57-58; PAMF ¶¶51-54; DRPA ¶51-54.) Plaintiff's supervisor agreed to modify Plaintiff's schedule, and stopped scheduling Plaintiff for 7:00 a.m. morning shifts, though Plaintiff continued to be scheduled for shifts with varying start times. (Doc. 34 at 225:13-230:23; DSMF ¶¶43-48, 50, 52; PRDF ¶43-48, 50, 52, 65; PAMF ¶¶51-54; DRPA ¶¶51-54.)
Plaintiff argues that her accommodation request was for a "consistent schedule," not just a "later" schedule, and Defendant "did not fulfill her request for a consistent schedule." (Doc. 45 at [*64]  17-18) (emphasis in originals). As discussed, "to trigger an employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation, the employee must (1) make a specific demand for an accommodation and (2) demonstrate that such accommodation is reasonable." Owens v. Governor's Off. of Student Achievement, 52 F.4th 1327, 1334 (11th Cir. 2022);14 see also Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. Then, "[o]nly after the employee provides this information must the employer 'initiate an informal, interactive process' with the employee to discuss the employee's specific limitations, explore potential accommodations, and select the most appropriate accommodation for both the employer and the employee." Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)). By requesting a schedule modification, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff made a specific demand for an accommodation, satisfying the first prong, but the evidence does not establish that she met her burden to satisfy the second prong—demonstrating that her requested accommodation of a consistent set schedule was reasonable. Id.
Demonstrating that a requested accommodation is reasonable requires an employee to do at least two things; thus, the second prong of the analysis to determine if an employer's duty has been triggered also has two sub-prongs. Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334-35. The employee must: (1) identify the disability [*65]  for which she seeks an accommodation, putting her employer on notice of the disability; and (2) provide enough information to allow the employer to understand how the accommodation would address or overcome her physical or mental limitations—in other words, the employee "must link her disability to her requested accommodation by explaining how the requested accommodation could alleviate the workplace challenges posed by her specific disability." Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334-35; see also Palmer v. McDonald, 824 F. App'x 967, 979-980 (11th Cir. 2020) (an employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless the employee makes a specific demand or request, but also, that request must be "sufficiently direct and specific," and it must "[a]t the least . . . explain how the accommodation requested is linked to some disability").
Generally, to identify a disability—the first sub-prong—the employee must provide at least some information about how the physical or mental condition limits her functioning. Owens, 52 F.4th at 1335. The type and extent of information an employee must provide for the second sub-prong depends on the particulars of each case. Id. Sometimes the link between the disability and the requested accommodation may be obvious, such as when an employee confined to a [*66]  wheelchair cannot reach a workspace accessible only by climbing a steep staircase. Id. That employee "would hardly need a doctor's report to show that she needed help." Id. But in other cases, the link between an employee's limitations and the requested accommodation will be unclear without additional information. Id. at 1336. And because this information is "typically possessed only by the individual or her physician," it is reasonable that, before requiring the employer to initiate the interactive process, the employee must inform her employer how the accommodation she seeks will address her limitations. Id. An employee is not required to provide detailed or private information, but vague and conclusory statements about incapacity are insufficient. Id.
Here, as discussed above, there is inconsistent and conflicting testimony about whether Plaintiff told her supervisors anything at all about her migraine condition, or that it was the reason for her continual tardiness. See Supra, Section IV(A)(i)(b). Plaintiff testified that during her performance review in June 2019, she informed her two direct supervisors, Delos Reyes and Sabermanesh, that her tardiness was because of her migraines and the [*67]  medication side-effects, and that she also informed Delos Reyes two other times—at the meetings on August 19, 2019, and October 8, 2019—that her tardiness was caused by her migraines and the medication side-effects. Id. But Defendant disputes that Plaintiff ever told Sabermanesh or Delos Reyes that her tardiness was because of her migraine headaches, pointing to the written review by Delos Reyes, which does not mention anything about Plaintiff's migraines; the fact that Sabermanesh was not present at Plaintiff's performance review in June 2019; and also to Sabermanesh's testimony that he was not aware that Plaintiff had any medical issues, he specifically did not know that Plaintiff had migraine headaches, and he never discussed migraines or any other medical issues with Plaintiff. Id. Defendant also points to Plaintiff's own testimony that: (1) when she met with Delos Reyes on August 19, 2019, she told Delos Reyes only that she had been tardy because she "wasn't feeling well"; and (2) she "can't remember" the meeting on October 8, 2019. Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, however, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude, if it finds Plaintiff's [*68]  testimony credible, that Plaintiff "identified" the disability for which she sought an accommodation, and put Defendant on notice of the disability, thus satisfying the first sub-prong. Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334-35.
But unlike the wheelchair example, the link between Plaintiff's episodic migraine headaches and her requested accommodation of a consistent set schedule is not obvious, and she, therefore, needed to provide "additional information" to explain "how the requested accommodation could alleviate the workplace challenges posed by her specific disability." Owens, 52 F.4th at 1335-36. Plaintiff has not cited to any evidence, nor does there appear to be any, to show that she provided Defendant any information outside of her self-stated incapacity that linked her disability and limitations to the requested accommodation; thus, she cannot satisfy the second sub-prong. Id. at 1334-36. It is undisputed that Plaintiff never provided Defendant with any note from a healthcare provider, or any other documentation, about her migraine headache condition or the limitations caused by the migraines. (DSMF ¶¶25, 49; PRDF ¶¶25, 49). The only medical document provided to Defendant was the October 8, 2019, note from Nurse Practitioner Dormio, which was provided after [*69]  Plaintiff's suspension, and in any event, it did not indicate that Plaintiff suffers from migraines, nor that she had work limitations that would require a consistent set schedule. (Doc. 34-32; DSMF ¶¶25, 49, 54, 56; PRDF ¶¶25, 49, 54, 56; PAMF ¶¶30-32; DRPA ¶¶30-32; PSMF ¶¶30-32; DRPF ¶¶30-32.)
Because there is no evidence linking Plaintiff's alleged request for a consistent schedule to her disability of episodic migraine headaches, she cannot show that her request was reasonable; nor does the evidence show, in any event, that the requested accommodation would have enabled her to perform the essential function of punctuality. Plaintiff is, therefore, not a "qualified individual" under the ADA. Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334-35; Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. Also, because the accommodation request was not reasonable, Defendant's duty to show undue hardship was not triggered.15 Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.

(iii) Subjected to Unlawful Discrimination—Prong Three
Even assuming that Plaintiff was qualified and had sufficiently triggered Defendant's accommodation duty, which the evidence does not support and the Court does not find, the undisputed evidence also shows that Defendant did not discriminate against Plaintiff by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability. When an [*70]  employee triggers an employer's accommodation duties, the employer, at that point, must engage in the "informal, interactive process" to identify an accommodation that is "mutually agreeable to the parties." Owens, 52 F.4th at 1334-35; 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(o)(3). The undisputed evidence here establishes that Defendant engaged in this interactive process, and it provided reasonable accommodations. Id. When Plaintiff requested a schedule modification, Plaintiff's supervisor agreed to modify Plaintiff's schedule, and stopped scheduling Plaintiff for 7:00 a.m. morning shifts, though Plaintiff continued to be scheduled for shifts with varying start times. (Doc. 34 at 225:13-230:23; DSMF ¶¶43-48, 50, 52; PRDF ¶43-48, 50, 52, 65; PAMF ¶¶51-54; DRPA ¶¶51-54.) Defendant, therefore, provided a reasonable accommodation in response to Plaintiff's request that was based on "mornings" being "rough" for her, by no longer scheduling Plaintiff for 7:00 a.m. shifts. (Id.) And though Plaintiff did not request it, Defendant also excused the seven tardy days Plaintiff had in August 2019, including the afternoon shifts to which she was tardy, as an additional accommodation to Plaintiff. (Doc. 38-3 at ¶11; DSMF ¶¶50-51; PRDF ¶¶50-51.)
Plaintiff does not dispute [*71]  that after Defendant eliminated her 7:00 a.m. shifts, and excused her August tardy days, Plaintiff did not request any further modification to her schedule. (Docs. 38-1 at 28-29; 45 at 18-19.) Plaintiff states that, because Defendant suspended Plaintiff on October 4, 2019, and terminated her employment "shortly thereafter" on October 11, 2019, "[i]t certainly could be [Plaintiff] simply did not have time to complain about Defendant's failure to offer the accommodation she requested," but that regardless, there is no requirement for an employee to notify the employer of "its ongoing failure" to provide the requested accommodation. (Doc. 45 at 18-19.) First, Plaintiff appears to misunderstand that Defendant is "not required to accommodate [Plaintiff] in any manner that [she] desires—or even provide [her] preferred accommodation." Owens, 52 F.4th at 1335 (emphasis in original) (citing D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2020)). And as discussed, Plaintiff did not provide any medical documentation that supported her request for a consistent set schedule, or linked that accommodation to "alleviat[ing] the workplace challenges posed by her specific disability" of episodic migraine headaches. Id. at 1335-36; (Doc. 34-32; DSMF ¶¶25, 49, 54, 56; PRDF ¶¶25, 49, 54, 56; [*72]  PAMF ¶¶30-32; DRPA ¶¶30-32; PSMF ¶¶30-32; DRPF ¶¶30-32.) Second, as to Plaintiff's timing argument, there was over a full month between August 19, 2019, the date Plaintiff's supervisor agreed to eliminate 7:00 a.m. shifts, and Plaintiff's suspension on October 4, 2019. During September, Plaintiff was tardy for 10 shifts; yet, after her tardiness continued during September, Plaintiff did not request any further modification or initiate any further communication with her supervisors. (DSMF ¶52; PRDF ¶52; Doc. 45 at 18-19.) Plaintiff's failure to request any further modification dooms her claim for two reasons. First, as discussed, an employee's failure to request a reasonable accommodation is fatal, as the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation is made. Warren, 188 F. App'x at 863; Connelly, 758 F. App'x 831. Second, to the extent the parties were at that point engaged in the interactive process, Plaintiff's failure to request any further modification or initiate any further communication caused the breakdown of the process. Without any further request or communication from Plaintiff, it was certainly reasonable for Defendant to believe that the accommodations it provided [*73]  were adequate. "Under the ADA, an employer will not be liable for failure to accommodate if the employee is responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process." D'Onofrio, 964 F.3d at 1022; Palmer, 824 F. App'x at 980. "Liability simply cannot arise under the ADA when an employer does not obstruct an informal interactive process; makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possesses; and the employee's actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. The undisputed evidence establishes that Defendant provided accommodations for Plaintiff—though not the exact accommodation she desired—based on the information it possessed about Plaintiff having "rough" mornings; and Plaintiff's failure to request any additional modification, provide medical documentation showing a need for additional modification, or initiate any further communication at all, is the reason the interactive process went no further. D'Onofrio, 964 F.3d at 1022; Palmer, 824 F. App'x at 980.
There is no evidence establishing that Plaintiff's accommodation request was reasonable, nor that she was subjected to unlawful discrimination; thus, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case under the ADA for a failure to accommodate, and judgment as a matter [*74]  of law is appropriate. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256-63. Accordingly, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion, (Doc. 38), be GRANTED as to count two.

V. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, the Court RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's motion, (Doc. 37), be DENIED; and that Defendant's motion, (Doc. 38), be DENIED IN PART on count one, and GRANTED IN PART on count two.
As all matters referred to the undersigned have been ruled upon, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED this 3rd day of July, 2023.
