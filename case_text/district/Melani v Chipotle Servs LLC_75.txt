Opinion


FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION
ACOSTA, Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff Justin Melani ("Melani") filed this action against his former employer Defendant Chipotle Services, LLC ("Chipotle"). Melani claims he was discriminated against based on his alleged disability, irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS"). Melani brings five claims: (1) disability discrimination pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes ("O.R.S.") § 659A.112; (2) failure to accommodate/engage in the interactive process; (3) retaliation for invoking disability-based rights under O.R.S. § 659A.109; (4) Oregon Family Leave Act ("OFLA") interference, denial, and retaliation pursuant to O.R.S. § 659A.183; and (5) common law wrongful discharge. Currently before the court is Chipotle's Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons that follow, [*2]  the court recommends that Chipotle's motion be GRANTED.

Background1
Chipotle is a national chain of "fast casual" restaurants specializing in Mexican fare. (Decl. Ester Smiley ¶ 3, ECF No. 67.) Chipotle hired Melani in October 2008 as a crew member at the Washington Square restaurant, and he later transferred to the Clackamas Town Center restaurant. Melani became the General Manager of the Clackamas Town Center restaurant on February 20, 2012. (Decl. Dara Keller ("Keller Decl.") Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3 at 9, ECF No. 72-1 at 111.) A General Manager is the highest-ranking manager at each restaurant, and is responsible for all operational and personnel decisions at that location, including hiring, firing, scheduling, sales, budgets, cost controls, payroll, and training. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 215, ECF No. 71-5 at 2; Smiley Decl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 67.) Melani was promoted to "Restaurateur" on June 26, 2012. (Keller Decl. Ex. 3 at 7, ECF No. 72-1 at 109.) Chipotle recognizes certain General Managers as "Restaurateurs" when they have demonstrated outstanding leadership, and "create a culture within their restaurant of high standards and constant improvement" and "work with each [*3]  member of their team helping them excel." (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 217, ECF No. 71-5 at 4; Smiley Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 67.) Restaurateurs serve as mentors to other managers, including those in other restaurants. (Smiley Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 67.) Melani was promoted to Restaurateur 2 ("R2"), meaning he was the General Manager in charge of two restaurants — Gresham and Clackamas — on September 9, 2013. (Keller Decl. Ex. 3 at 5, ECF No. 72-1 at 107.) At the time of his promotion to R2, Melani reported to Area Manager Carla Williams. (Id.)
In its Restaurant Management Handbook, Chipotle has specific policies for "Reporting Illness," "Not Working While Ill," and "Returning to Work After Illness or Suspected Illness." (Keller Decl. Ex. 15 at 14-15, ECF No. 72-2 at 64-65.) Under the Reporting Illness policy, employees and managers must immediately report symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and any diagnoses of infectious or communicable diseases to a supervisor. (Id. at 14.) Managers are responsible for reporting the illness to the Executive Director of Safety, Security and Risk ("SSR"). (Id.) Under the Not Working While Ill policy, ill employees or managers must be excluded from working or [*4]  eating at a Chipotle for period of five days if experiencing vomiting and one or more of the following symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, fever, or stomach cramps. (Id.) Further, employees or managers who have a confirmed illness identified in the policies must be cleared to work by providing a note from the health department or a physician. (Id. at 15.) Beginning in March 2016, Chipotle reduced the number of exclusion days from five to three. Melani was aware of and understood Chipotle's Reporting Illness and Not Working While Ill policies and procedures. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, attaching deposition of Justin Melani, ("Melani Dep.") 90:5-91:16; ECF No. 72-1 at 14-15.)
Chipotle's Restaurant Management Handbook also describes the process by which to request leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FLMLA) for a serious health condition, the birth of a child, or to care for someone with a serious health condition or disability. (Keller Decl. Ex. 15 at 27, ECF No. 72-2 at 77.) To request covered leave, the employee is to contact the Employee Service Center, and complete a Chipotle Leave Request. (Id. at 28.) If the leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide 30 days advance notice; if leave is not [*5]  foreseeable, the employee must provide notice "as soon as practicable and generally comply with Chipotle's normal call-in procedure." (Id.) Melani was aware of and understood Chipotle's FMLA policies and procedures. (Melani Dep. 90:5-91:16; ECF No. 72-1 at 14-15.)
On February 1, 2016, Melani was demoted to Restaurateur for failing to maintain the Clackamas restaurant. (Melani Dep. 201:21-202:13, ECF No. 72-1 at 26-27.) Melani was told to focus on turning around the Clackamas store. (Id.) On February 2, 2016, Williams forwarded a customer complaint about slow service and unfriendly staff at the Clackamas restaurant to Melani. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 241, ECF No. 71-5 at 28.)
On February 2, 2016, Melani reported to his then-supervisor Williams that he was ill, with a 102-degree fever. (Id. at at 231-240, ECF No. 71-5 at 18-27.) Williams was informed that Melani would need a note from his physician in order to return to work. (Id. at 231, ECF No. 71-5 at 18.) Melani saw his physician, Gary S. Kim, M.D., on February 3, 2016. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 18 at 46, ECF No. 71-6 at 46.) Melani reported to Dr. Kim that he was experiencing fever or chills and diarrhea over the previous couple of days, [*6]  which had resolved over the preceding 24 hours. (Id.) Melani also reported to Dr. Kim that he had a one-year history of chronic alternating diarrhea and constipation, bloating, with crampy abdominal pain that improves with bowel movements. (Id.) Melani also informed Dr. Kim that he needed a note to return to work. (Id.) Dr. Kim assessed viral enteritis that had resolved. (Id. at 48.) Dr. Kim further indicated that Melani's described abdominal discomfort was "suspicious for irritable bowel syndrome given [its] chronicity." (Id. at 48.) Dr. Kim noted that Melani had a poor diet, and suggested dietary changes. (Id.) At that visit, Dr. Kim provided Melani with a note providing: "Justin Melani was seen in my clinic on 2/3/2016. He may return to work on 2/4/2016." (Id. at 56.)
On February 3, 2016, Williams informed SSR representative Patti Mann that Melani had provided a doctor's note and would be returning to the Clackamas restaurant on February 4, 2016. (Decl. Justin Melani Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. ("P1. Decl.") Ex. 4 at 3, ECF No. 53-4.) On February 4, 2016, Melani also sent an email to Mann attaching the February 3, 2016 note from Dr. Kim releasing him to work. (Id.) In his email, Melani also informed Mann that he had [*7]  returned to work, but again fell ill and vomited two times, and that his supervisor sent him home. (Id.) Melani informed Mann that "I have a medical condition that flares up periodically and can come on unexpectedly. It is not contagious or food born[e]. What do I need to do in order to be able to return to work?" (Id.) On February 5, 2016, Mann responded that he needed a note from his doctor stating that he has "a medical condition that sometimes cause[s] vomiting but you are fine to work handling food in a restaurant." (Id. at 2.) Melani responded that he would contact his doctor and "set something up so I have a document to give you so you have it all on file." (Id.) In a return email on February 5, 2016, Mann stated that "I don't think that you need to go in again — just talk to them and have them email or fax you the note that you can send to us." (Id.) Melani reported to Williams that he contacted Dr. Kim's office to clarify with a diagnosis, and provide a more comprehensive note. (Decl. Dara Keller Supp. Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J. ("Keller Reply Decl.") Ex. 7, attaching Deposition of Gary S. Kim. ("Kim Dep.") 18:6-8, ECF No. 68-1 at 24.)
On February 5, 2016, Williams sent Melani an email [*8]  indicating that she realized Melani was not feeling well, but that he was not adequately communicating with his team, failed to attend a mandatory meeting, failed to communicate that he needed coverage, and failed to respond to Williams's messages. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 220, ECF No. 71-5 at 7.)
On February 8, 2016, Melani emailed Mann a note from Dr. Kim dated February 5, 2016, that stated in relevant part: "Justin Melani was seen in my clinic on 2/3/2016. He does have the medical condition of irritable bowel syndrome, which is not contagious." (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 4 at 1, ECF No. 53-4.)
Melani again fell ill with vomiting on February 10, 2016, which he attributes to an IBS flare-up. (Melani Dep. 213:17-214:3, ECF No. 72-1 at 32-33.) Melani informed Williams that he was at the Clackamas restaurant all day on February 9, 2016, and on February 10, 2016, because he was vomiting, he would be going to the doctor for bloodwork that day. (Keller Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 72-1 at 152.) Melani did not have an appointment with Dr. Kim on February 10, 2016. His next appointment with Dr. Kim occurred on February 15, 2016. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 18 at 61, ECF No. 71-6 at 61.) Melani informed Dr. [*9]  Kim about his potential IBS symptoms, including vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, bloating, and frequent bowel movements. (Id.) Dr. Kim ordered lab work, and noted that Melani's abdominal discomfort was highly suspicious for IBS. (Id. at 62.) In a noted dated February 15, 2016, Dr. Kim indicated that Melani could return to work on February 15, 2016. (Id. at 81.) The results of the February 15, 2016 lab work were essentially normal, except for his white blood count, which was slightly elevated. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 20, Kim Dep. 16:1-25, ECF No. 71-8 at 6.)
In March 2016, Melani began reporting to a new Area Manager, Stephen Short. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 179:15-17, ECF No. 72-1 at 23; Keller Decl. Ex. 2, attaching Deposition of Joseph Higel ("Higel Dep.") 29:25-30:11, ECF No. 72-1 at 73-74.) On March 1, 2016, Short received an email from Clackamas restaurant Service Manager Chelsea Charlton that morning and evening audits were not being completed and safety notes were not being shared. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 251, ECF No. 71-5 at 38.) Short forwarded the email to Melani. (Id. at 249-50.) On March 6, 2016, the Clackamas restaurant received "74-C" on a Food Safety Audit, which was forwarded to Team [*10]  Director Joe Higel. (Id. at 256-59.) Higel responded to Short: "Please explain to [Melani] that audits like this get people hurt and people fired." (Id. at 256.) On March 8, 2016, the Clackamas store received an improved score on an audit. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 13, ECF No. 53-13.) On March 25, 2016, Short had Melani develop a Plan of Action to make further improvements at the Clackamas restaurant. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 5, ECF No. 53-5.) The items in the Plan of Action were to be completed within three weeks. (Id.) One of the items Melani identified was completing one-on-one meetings with each crew member focusing "on the vision and their role in it[.]" (Id.)
On March 28, 2016, Restaurant Support Officer Mike Duffy sent an email to Higel inquiring about Melani's performance because of disappointing scores on cash handling audits. (Keller Decl. Ex. 2 at 37-38, ECF No. 71-2 at 100-101.) Higel responded to Duffy that Short had been brought in to motivate Melani, but was unsure whether Melani was ready to "commit to the hard-work and responsibility it will take," and Higel said he expected to make a decision by the end of April whether to retain Melani. (Id.) On March 31, 2016, the Clackamas restaurant was evaluated and [*11]  determined to no longer be at Restauranteur level, receiving a score of 81. (Keller Decl. Ex. 11, attaching Deposition of Stephen Short ("Short Dep.") 21:13-20 & at 25-30, ECF No. 72-2 at 13, 24-29.) Deficiencies included poor cleanliness, loss of experienced staff, food temperatures taken incorrectly, a dirty cheese grater, and poor cash handling. (Id. at 25-29.)
On April 13, 2016, Melani informed Short, and his subordinate Rebecca Keever, that he had a two-month follow-up appointment with his doctor that day at 4 p.m. for his IBS. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 7 at 2, Ex. 8 at 2, ECF Nos. 53-7, 53-8.) Melani did not, however, see Dr. Kim on April 13, 2016.
On April 15, 2016, Short and Melani met to review the Plan of Action. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 53-6.) Short encouraged Melani to make improvements and noted that Melani was "making some headway within the first couple of weeks." (Decl. Eric D. Wilson Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. ("Wilson Decl.") Ex. 5, attaching Short Dep. 48:14-21, ECF No. 54-5.) At the end of the meeting, Short and Melani identified seven new goals. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 53-6.) On April 16, 2016, Melani sent a text message to Keever stating that his meeting with Short about the Plan of [*12]  Action went well, that they met every goal for the previous thirty days, that new goals were identified, and that Melani would go over those new goals with Keever on Monday. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 8 at 2, ECF No. 53-8.)
Melani was next scheduled to work on April 18, 2016. Melani woke that morning with vomiting and a fever. (Id. at 3.) Melani informed Short via text message that he had a fever and was vomiting and could not work. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 7 at 3, ECF No. 53-7.) Short informed Melani that he would need to handle things from home while he was excluded, including dealing with a missed food delivery. (Id.) Melani did not get clarification from Short on when he could return to work, so he elected to follow the three-day exclusion policy. (Id. at 4.)
Melani was ready to return to work on the morning of April 21, 2016, but he reported to Short that he vomited outside the restaurant. (Id. at 4.) Melani reported to SSR that he had vomited outside the restaurant on April 21, 2016; the SSR representative confirmed that Melani would need to be excluded for three days. (Melani Decl. Ex. 9 at 3, ECF No. 53-9.) That day, Melani sent Keever a text message indicating that he was going to be out for another three days, that [*13]  he tried to make a doctor's appointment but none were available that day, and that he made an appointment for noon on April 22, 2016. (Melani Decl. Ex. 8 at 4, ECF No. 53-8.)
On April 23, 2016, Melani received a text message from Short indicating that Short had not been able to reach Melani for two days. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 7 at 4, ECF No. 53-7.) Melani responded that he had not heard from Short. (Id.) Short inquired when Melani would be returning, to which Melani responded "Monday" based on SSR's three day exclusion rule. (Id.) Short responded that Melani would not need a doctor's note to return, and inquired whether Melani was going to return Short's phone call, as Melani had not answered four telephone calls from Short. (Id. at 5.) Short was frustrated that he was having difficulty communicating with Melani. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 5, Short Dep. 96:19-102:4, ECF No. 54-5 at 18-22.)
Later that day, Short sent a text message to Higel indicating that he was planning to suspend Melani the following day. (Keller Decl. Ex. 2 at 30-31, ECF No. 72-1 at 93-94.) Higel responded with "Why? What changed?" (Id. at 30.) Short informed Higel that "[n]othing changed" and that it was clear Melani was not working on the Plan [*14]  of Action: he was not communicating with the team, he was not completing the one-on-one meetings, and the Clackamas restaurant had just received a failing Food Audit score of 63. (Id. at 31.) At a meeting on April 23, 2016, Short suspended Melani from employment with Chipotle in a meeting which Herbert Dan Lester, a Chipotle Area Manager, also attended. (Id. at 28-29.) Short informed Melani to cease all contact with the Clackamas restaurant and directed Melani to obtain a doctor's note that permitted him to return to work.
On April 25, 2016, Melani met with Dr. Kim, who provided a note to Melani stating that he has a "diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and is currently being treated." (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 3, ECF No. 53-3.) Dr. Kim's treatment notes indicate that the primary reason for Melani's appointment was to follow up on IBS, and that Melani was requesting medication and another note for his employer. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 18 at 89-90, ECF No. 71-6 at 89-90.) Dr. Kim noted that Melani reported no change in symptoms and that he had not explored dietary changes. (Id. at 89.) Dr. Kim prescribed Pamelor and counseled Melani to explore dietary changes, as such changes "may make significant difference." (Id. at 90.) On April [*15]  25 or April 26, 2016, Melani provided Short with Dr. Kim's April 25, 2016 note. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 5, Short Dep. 147:2-16, ECF No. 54-5; Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 10, ECF No. 53-10.) On April 26, 2016, Short forwarded Dr. Kim's note to Lillianne Santos in SSR, stating that Melani's IBS appears to be a long-term condition and that Melani needed help determining what he needs to do to return to work. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 10.)
At approximately 12:27 p.m. on April 26, 2016, Melani requested "his FMLA paperwork" via email from Lillianne Santos. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 11, ECF No. 53-11.) Short terminated Melani at approximately 12:30 p.m. that same day, with Williams and Lester present.

Preliminary Procedural Matter
In its Reply, Chipotle requests that the court strike Melani's Declaration, arguing that it is inconsistent with his prior deposition testimony and is uncorroborated by independent evidence. (Pl.'s Decl., ECF No. 53; Defs.' Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 57.) Melani responds that Chipotle's request to "strike" Melani's Declaration is improper because it was not filed as a separate motion, and thus fails to adhere to local rules. (Pl.'s Opp'n Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 3, ECF No. 63.) Melani also insists [*16]  that his Declaration is not inconsistent, and that Chipotle's request to strike should be denied.
Contrary to Melani's contention, filing a separate motion to strike would not be the proper procedure to challenge the Declaration. Motions to strike generally are used to challenge information contained in pleadings. See Elllis v. Vial Fotheringham LLP, Case No. 3:16-cv-01945-AC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *1 (D. Or. Feb. 1, 2019) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)). Materials outside the pleadings — including a declaration or portions of a declaration — cannot be challenged using a motion to strike. Id.; see Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coal. v. D.C., 286 F.R.D. 117, 125 (D.D.C. 2012), vacated on other grounds, 846 F.3d 391, 427 U.S. App. D.C. 296 (D.C. Cir. 2017) ("motions, affidavits, briefs, and other documents outside of the pleadings are not subject to Rule 12(f)").
Rather, the proper vehicle for striking material outside of the pleadings is an evidentiary objection. See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Kempthorne, 539 F. Supp. 2d 1155, 1161 (E.D. Cal. 2008). A trial court may regard a motion to strike non-pleadings "as an invitation by the movant to consider whether [the proffered material] may properly be relied upon." Id. (citing U.S. v. Crisp, 190 F.R.D. 546, 551 (E.D. Cal. 1999) ("[A] motion to strike has sometimes been used to call courts' attention to questions about the admissibility of proffered material in [ruling on motions]")). Although Chipotle did not file a specific evidentiary objection, the court interprets Chipotle's [*17]  request to strike as an invitation to rule on the admissibility of Melani's Declaration, and accepts the opportunity to do so.
Chipotle contends that Melani sat for a seven-hour deposition, and that his Declaration is inconsistent with his earlier, sworn testimony. According to Chipotle, Melani cannot create an issue of fact by submitting uncorroborated and self-serving statements. Specifically, Chipotle highlights that during his deposition, Melani indicated that he had missed approximately five to ten days of work for all illness, including IBS, yet in his Declaration, Melani claims that his IBS has caused him to miss multiple days of work. (Compare Keller Reply Decl. Ex. 26 at 3, Melani Dep. 74:20-75:2, ECF No. 68-1 at 31, with Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 53 at 3.) Chipotle asks the court to the strike Melani's entire declaration.
The Supreme Court has recognized the "virtual unanimity" of circuit courts that "a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement (by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction [*18]  or attempting to resolve the disparity." Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). The Ninth Circuit follows this rule, reasoning that: "'If a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact.'" Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., 952 F.2d 262, 266 (9th Cir. 1991) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Foster v. Arcata Assocs., 772 F.2d 1453, 1462 (9th Cir. 1985)); see also Noga v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 583 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1252 (D. Or. 2008). However, the "rule is in tension with the principle that a court's role in deciding a summary judgment motion is not to make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence" and "'should be applied with caution.'" Van Asdale v. Int'l Game Tech., 577 F.3d 989, 998 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Sch. Dist. No. 1J v. ACandS, Inc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1264 (9th Cir. 1993)).
This rule does not extend to cases in which a contradictory affidavit is introduced to explain portions of earlier deposition testimony. Rather, the rule is concerned with "'sham' testimony that flatly contradicts earlier testimony in an attempt to 'create' an issue of fact and avoid summary judgment." Kennedy, 952 F.2d at 267. "[T]he non-moving party is not precluded from elaborating upon, explaining or clarifying prior testimony elicited by opposing counsel on deposition; minor inconsistencies that result from an honest discrepancy, a mistake, [*19]  or newly discovered evidence afford no basis for excluding an opposition affidavit." Messick v. Horizon Indus., Inc., 62 F.3d 1227, 1231 (9th Cir. 1995). Therefore, the district court must determine whether the contradictory testimony was given in an honest effort to clarify, or was an intentional alteration, designed to create a genuine issue of material fact. Melendez v. Morrow Cnty. Sch. Dist., Case No. 07-875-AC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108299, 2009 WL 4015426, at *14-15 (D. Or. Nov. 19, 2009) (finding declaration statements did not directly contradict prior testimony and, therefore, were admissible to create a genuine issue of material fact).
Paragraph 6 of Melani's Declaration states in relevant part:
6. I continue to struggle with IBS. My IBS has impacted my work for my current employer, Triplett Wellman. Specifically, I have missed multiple days of work at Triplett Wellman due to my IBS.
(Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 53.) Chipotle argues that Melani's contention that he has missed multiple days of work is inconsistent with his prior deposition testimony regarding how many days of work he has missed at his current employer due to his IBS. In his deposition, Melani testified as follows:
Q. Have you called out sick more than five times?
A. Yes.
Q. More than 10?
A. No.
Q. And why have you called out sick?
A. Some was IBS related, and some was just illness.
. . . .
Q. So how — of the — between [*20]  five and 10 times were IBS related?
A. I don't recall.
(Keller Reply Decl. Ex. 26, Melani Dep. 74:20-75:10, ECF No. 68-1 at 31.) Chipotle asserts that the two statements are contradictory, and unsupported by corroborating evidence. Therefore, Chipotle contends that this cannot create a genuine issue of material fact for trial.
Melani responds that the statements in his Declaration are not inconsistent with his deposition testimony. Melani argues that his averments in his Declaration are supported by his medical records, his own deposition testimony, and excerpts from the deposition testimony of Dr. Kim.
The court finds that Melani's statement in his Declaration that he has missed "multiple days of work" is not directly contradicted by his deposition testimony that he missed work between five and ten times, some of which were IBS related. See Melendez, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108299, 2009 WL 4015426, at *14-15 (denying motion to exclude evidence in declaration because it did not flatly contradict deposition testimony). The court finds that the discrepancy between calling out sick between five and ten times and calling out multiple times is relatively minor and does not materially alter the meaning of his deposition testimony. Thus, the court declines to [*21]  strike Paragraph 6 of Melani's Declaration under the sham declaration rule.
Although Chipotle argues that the court should strike the entire Declaration, aside from Paragraph 6, Chipotle does not specifically identify other alleged contradictions between Melani's Declaration and his deposition testimony. The court finds that striking the entire Declaration is unwarranted.

Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party demonstrates no issue of material fact exists, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and identify facts which show a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324. A party cannot defeat a summary judgment motion by relying on the allegations set forth in the complaint, unsupported conjecture, or conclusory statements. Hernandez v. Spacelabs Med., Inc., 343 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2003). Summary judgment thus should be entered against "a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden [*22]  of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.
To determine whether summary judgment is proper, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Curley v. City of N. Las Vegas, 772 F.3d 629, 631 (9th Cir. 2014); Hernandez, 343 F.3d at 1112. All reasonable doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue of fact should be resolved against the moving party. Hector v. Wiens, 533 F.2d 429, 432 (9th Cir. 1976).
However, deference to the nonmoving party has limits The nonmoving party must set forth "specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (emphasis added). The "mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position [is] insufficient." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Therefore, where "the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Discussion
Chipotle moves for summary judgment on Melani's disability discrimination and retaliation claims because Melani cannot show that he is disabled or an individual entitled to protected leave as that term is defined in the relevant statutes. Chipotle also contends that Melani has presented no evidence that his alleged IBS played a role in his termination or that his termination was pretextual. Chipotle argues that Melani has not demonstrated a genuine issue [*23]  of material fact on OFLA retaliation, interference, or denial, and is entitled to summary judgment on that claim, as well as Melani's wrongful discharge claim. Chipotle argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that he was terminated due to his failing performance.
Melani responds that his IBS satisfies the definition of a "disability" because that term is broadly interpreted, his physician has diagnosed IBS, and has opined that Melani continues to suffer chronic gastrointestinal issues. Additionally, Melani contends that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Chipotle's reasons for his termination are pretextual and therefore, summary judgment must be denied.
I. Disability Discrimination — Count 1— Disparate Treatment2

A. Standards
Melani alleges disability discrimination under Oregon law, which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee on the basis of disability. Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.112. The statute makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to hire or promote, to bar or discharge from employment, or to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of [*24]  employment on the basis of an otherwise qualified person's disability. Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.112. "The standard for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under Oregon law is identical to that used in federal law." Snead v. Metro Prol & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir. 2001); Shepard v. City of Portland, 829 F. Supp. 2d 940, 963 (D. Or. 2011); Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.139 (providing that Oregon disability statutes "shall be construed to the extent possible in a manner that is consistent with any similar provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")).
On summary judgment, disability discrimination claims under Oregon law are analyzed under the familiar burden-shifting framework outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Mayo v. PCC Structurals, Inc., 795 F.3d 941, 943 (9th Cir. 2015). Under that framework, an employee challenging an adverse employment action has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. Mayo, 795 F.3d at 944. The burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id.; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the employer does so, then the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the defendant's purportedly neutral reason is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.
The Ninth Circuit has recently clarified that discrimination claims under the ADA must be evaluated under a "but for" causation standard, meaning "the adverse [*25]  employment action would not have occurred but for the disability." Murray v. Mayo Clinic, 934 F.3d 1101, 2019 WL 3926945, at *4 (9th Cir. Aug. 20, 2019) (holding that disability discrimination claim under Title I of the ADA must be examined under a but-for causation standard); Natofsky v. City of New York, 921 F.3d 337, 349-50 (2d Cir. 2019) (granting summary judgment to City because Natofsky failed to demonstrate that his hearing disability was the but for cause of his demotion); Gentry v. E.W. Partners Club Mgmt. Co., 816 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir. 2016) (holding that ADA requires a "but for" causation standard). Summary judgment is appropriate where no reasonable jury could find that the defendant's actions were motivated by discrimination. See T.B. ex rel Brenneise v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 806 F.3d 451, 473 (9th Cir. 2015) (granting summary judgment where no reasonable jury could find district would have provided a nurse for disabled student but for desire to retaliate); accord McIntyre v. Corning Inc., 15-CV-6277 CJS-MWP, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82955, 2019 WL 2140625, at *11 (W.D.N.Y. May 16, 2019) (discussing that to establish ADA claim, employee must show that "but for" Corning's alleged discriminatory motive, the adverse actions would not have occurred, citing Natofsky, 921 F.3d at 341).
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Melani must show that: (1) he is disabled or perceived as such; (2) he is qualified; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. Nunnies v. HIE Holdings, Inc., 908 F.3d 428, 433 (9th Cir. 2018); Mayo, 795 F.3d at 944; Snead, 237 F.3d at 1087. Under the ADA, the Wind "disability" is defined as "a physical or mental impairment [*26]  that substantially limits one or more major life activities[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). Enumerated "major life activities" include the operation of major bodily functions, such as "digestive, genitourinary, bowel, [and] bladder" systems. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(ii). "Whether an activity is a 'major life activity' is not determined by reference to whether it is of central importance to daily life." Id. § 1630.2(i)(2). An impairment is a disability if it "substantially limits" the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity "as compared to most people in the general population." Id. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii). And, whether an impairment is a disability that substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment, and is to be broadly interpreted. Id. § 1630.2(j); Weaving v. City of Hillsboro, 763 F.3d 1106, 1111 (9th Cir. 2014) (discussing 2008 amendments to ADA); Hicks v. Les Schwab Tire Centers of Portland, Inc., 2:17-cv-00118-SB, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147235 , 2018 WL 4113335, at *8 (D. Or. Aug. 29, 2018). However, not every impairment will constitute a disability. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii).

B. Analysis - Actual Disability Claim
Chipotle argues that Melani's IBS does not qualify as a disability as that term is defined under Oregon law, or the federal parallel ADA. Chipotle sets forth two separate arguments: (1) Melani's IBS is not a disability because his symptoms are not consistent with an IBS diagnosis and [*27]  is largely based on his own self-reported symptoms; and (2) his IBS does not substantially limit any major life activity.
Melani responds that his IBS substantially limits his ability to "eat, digest, have normal bowel movements, and work." (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 11, ECF No. 58; Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 53.) Melani asserts that he continues to struggle with IBS, and that the state and federal disability statutes must be interpreted broadly, and in favor of the greatest extent of protection possible. Melani contends that Dr. Kim has diagnosed IBS and that he experiences debilitating symptoms seven to 15 times a day for 15 to 45 minutes each time he experiences an IBS flare-up.
1. IBS diagnosis is not dispositive of disability
Chipotle argues that Melani inconsistently has reported his symptoms to Chipotle and his physician and that his repeated vomiting is not consistent with an IBS diagnosis. For example, on February 3, 2016, Melani reported to Dr. Kim that he was experiencing fever, chills, and diarrhea, and Dr. Kim diagnosed viral enteritis, an "acute illness." (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 20, Kim Dep. 13:4-18, ECF No. 71-8 at 4.) On February 10, 2016, Melani again reported to Chipotle that [*28]  he experienced vomiting and fever, that Melani attributes to his IBS. (Keller Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 72-1.) However, Melani did not seek medical care on February 10, 2016.
At Melani's next appointment with Dr Kim on February 15, 2016, Melani did not mention that he was experiencing vomiting, but instead described abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, and cramping. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 20, Kim Dep. 18:23-19:16, ECF No. 71-8 at 7-8; Id. Ex. 18 at 61, ECF No. 71-6 at 61.) Melani was excluded from Chipotle from April 18 through 25 because he reported vomiting and fever. Yet, when Melani met with Dr Kim on April 25, 2016, he inconsistently reported that he was experiencing frequent bowel movements, with alternating diarrhea and constipation, and again failed to mention vomiting. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 20, Kim Dep. at 22:18-23:9, ECF No. 71-8 at 11-12.)
Chipotle contends that Melani's IBS diagnosis is based solely upon Melani's inconsistent self-reported symptoms, and thus should not serve as a basis for his disability diagnosis. According to Chipotle, Dr. Kim diagnosed Melani with IBS based on Melani's self-reports and one battery of fairly routine laboratory tests. (Id. at Kim [*29]  Dep. at 15:24-16:19, 23:6-9, 27:19-22.) Chipotle's gastroenterologist, R. William Bennetts, M.D., reviewed Melani's medical records and observed that IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. (Keller Decl. Ex. 9 at 2, ECF No. 72-2.) Dr. Bennetts opined that symptoms such as chills, fever, and elevated white blood cell count typically suggest an infectious illness, and typically are not indicative of IBS. (Id.) Dr. Bennetts stated that based on his review of Melani's medical records, Melani does not qualify for an IBS diagnosis. (Id.)
Contrary to Chipotle's contention, the court is not convinced that Melani's inconsistent reporting of his symptoms to his physician and to Chipotle (i.e., vomiting v. diarrhea) is conclusive of whether Melani's medical condition has been properly diagnosed as IBS. Regardless of Melani's constellation of symptoms, his treating physician has diagnosed IBS.
2. Melani's IBS substantially limits his major life activity of working
Instead, the more relevant question is whether Melani's medical condition of IBS substantially limits one or more of his major life activities. Weaving, 763 F.3d at 1112 (holding that plaintiff's ADHD did not substantially limit his ability to interact with others and [*30]  thus he was not disabled). "An impairment is a disability . . . if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii); Hicks, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147235, 2018 WL 4113335, at *8. The term "substantially limits" is to be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i); Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.139(2). To make this determination, the court must consider the nature and severity of the impairment; the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment. Parks v. Port of Oakland, Case No. 16-cv-04061-HSG, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102945, 2017 WL 2840704, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 3, 2017) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)). This is an individualized inquiry. Weaving, 763 F.3d at 1111; Hicks, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147235, 2018 WL 4113335, at *8; see Stillman v. Column5 Consulting, L.L.C., No. 3:14-cv-8207-HRH, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53194, 2016 WL 1573312, at *7 (D. Ariz. Apr. 19, 2016) (holding that plaintiff's three bouts of depression and one panic attack resulting in nine-day absence did not substantially limit a major life activity).
Chipotle contends that numerous other courts have determined that IBS does not substantially limit a major life activity. See, e.g., Branch v. City of New Orleans, 78 F.3d 582, at 4 (5th Cir. 1996) (unpublished table opinion) (holding that ulcerative colitis that flared-up once a year for a few days that caused a one-time hospitalization, but did not otherwise interfere [*31]  with daily routine, was not substantially limiting); Atencio v. Joint Jerome Sch. Dist. No. 261, 837 F. Supp. 2d 1158, 1164-66 (D. Idaho 2011) (holding ADAAA did not apply retroactively and that colitis was not substantially limiting and therefore not a disability). According to Chipotle, Melani has not identified any objective evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that he is substantially limited by his IBS.
Melani responds that the bulk of the cases identified by Chipotle pre-date the 2008 ADA Amendments Act (the "ADAAA") that were introduced specifically to broaden the scope of coverage. See Barrilleaux v. Mendocino Cty., 61 F. Supp. 3d 906, 916 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (discussing the ADAAA, favoring an expansive definitions of impairments and substantial limitations); Hicks, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147235, 2018 WL 4113335, at *8, n.8 (finding broken foot that had not healed in four years was disabling because it substantially limited ability to walk; discussing ADAAA, and that an impairment lasting less than six months may be considered substantially limiting based on individualized inquiry); Werner v. Sturgeon Elec. Co., Inc., Case No. 3:16-cv-01334-MO, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127929, 2017 WL 3473179, at *5 (D. Or. Aug. 11, 2017) (finding temporary hand injury could be considered a disability after ADAAA enacted).
According to Melani, he began experiencing IBS in 2014, and that it causes him severe, episodic bouts of explosive diarrhea between seven and 15 times per day, requiring him to spend [*32]  between 15 and 45 minutes in the bathroom each time. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 215:6-20, ECF No. 54-1 at 2.) Melani contends that these episodes strike between one and five times per month, that he is unable to work when he is experiencing a flare-up, and that he misses work at least once a month when he is experiencing a flare up. (Id. Melani Dep. 220:9-222:7.) Melani further states that his IBS could be a lifelong issue. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 53.) Melani argues that his IBS substantially limits his ability to digest food and work and that he has presented sufficient evidence to meet his prima facie burden.
Aside from his own testimony, Melani relies on the testimony of his father, Roy Melani. Mr. Melani testified in his deposition that Melani complained about "having issues" in the two years preceding Melani's termination from Chipotle, but could not recall a specific time frame. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 3, Roy Melani Dep. 42:13-43:3, 43:12-17, ECF No. 54-3.) Mr. Melani testified that he encouraged Melani to seek medical treatment. (Id. at 43:18-23.) Mr. Melani also testified that he has observed that Melani spends long periods of time in the bathroom when visiting at his house, [*33]  and recalled it happening "once or twice during a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, but . . . it's not all the time, but it definitely happened." (Id. at 44:22-24, 47:19-23, 48:20-24.)
The court finds the timing of Melani's IBS allegations questionable. Melani testified in his deposition that he began experiencing IBS symptoms at some point in 2014, but he also said he did not seek treatment until February 3, 2016, immediately following his demotion. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 216:11-23, ECF No. 72-1 at 35.) The undisputed objective evidence shows that Melani was treated by Dr Kim on three occasions over the course of three months for symptoms of IBS. And, Dr. Kim testified that Melani did not ask for any work restrictions or indicate that he needed accommodations while working for Chipotle. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 20, Kim Dep. 26:15-17, ECF No. 71-8 at 13.) Melani stated in his deposition that his IBS symptoms have remained unchanged since his termination, and that he still has episodes that are debilitating. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 218:20-219:2, ECF No. 72-1 at 36-37.) Yet, Melani testified that he has missed only five to ten days of work for all illnesses with his [*34]  current employer, and admits that has not seen Dr. Kim or any physician for his IBS in nearly two years following his termination. (Keller Reply Decl. Ex. 26, Melani Dep. 74:20-75:2, ECF No. 68-1 at 30-33.) Moreover, Melani testified that he consistently is working forty hours a week, and that he has not requested any accommodations for his IBS from his new employer. (Id. at 63:7-14, 75:18-20, 76:9-10.)
The court finds that for purposes of a prima facie case, Melani has mustered enough evidence from which it could be concluded that his IBS substantially limits his ability to work. While the evidence is scant, drawing all inferences in Melani's favor, a reasonable jury could conclude that his ability to work is substantially limited by his IBS compared to most people in the general population. Melani has testified that when his IBS is flaring up, he needs to use the restroom between seven and fifteen times a day for as long as forty-five minutes. Melani also testified that when his IBS is flaring up, he is unable to get anything done. The need to use the restroom for as much as ten hours in a work day during an IBS flare up would hinder Melani in any job. Therefore, viewing this evidence [*35]  in Melani's favor, he has adequately set forth evidence that his ability to work is severely restricted by his IBS for purposes of establishing that he has a "disability" as the term is defined in the statutes.
3. causation inferred
To state a prima facie case under the ADA, Melani must also show that Chipotle terminated him because of his disability. Causation can be inferred from the proximity of time between the protected action and the allegedly unlawful discharge. Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Products. Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 507 (9th Cir.2000). To support an inference of discriminatory motive, the termination must have occurred "fairly soon" after the employee's protected activity. Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air. Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting Paluck v. Gooding Rubber Co., 221 F.3d 1003, 1009-10 (7th Cir.2000)). For instance, in Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir.1987), the Ninth Circuit held a three-month lapse between protected activity and adverse employment action was "sufficiently probative of a causal link" to establish a prima facie case.
Here, Melani's evidence triggers an inference of causation. Melani highlights that he informed Short that he has IBS on April 13, 2016, and was suspended on April 23, 2016, as evidence of causation. (Pl.'s Dec. Ex. 7 at 2.) Additionally, on April 25, 2016, Melani provided Short a note from Dr. Kim indicating that he was being treated for IBS and he was terminated the following [*36]  day. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 31 & Ex. 10.) The short lapse of time between the events and Melani's suspension and termination falls well within the time period found to support an inference of a causal link. Therefore, Melani has stated a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. See Davis v. Team Elec. Co., 520 F.3d 1080, 1094 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding temporal proximity between injury and termination supported inference of causation); Werner, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127929, 2017 WL 3473179, at *6 (finding that management had received doctor's note prior to his termination that employee not use his left hand due until further treatment obtained supported inference of causation).
However, as discussed in greater detail below, Melani has failed to establish that Chipotle's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating him are pretextual, and for that reason, summary judgment should be granted.

C. Regarded As Disabled Claim
The Ninth Circuit has recently clarified the correct standard for "regarded as" claims after Congress enacted the ADAAA in 2008. Nunies, 908 F.3d at 434. The Nunies court observed that under pre-ADAAA, an employee was required to provide evidence that the employer subjectively believed that the employee was substantially limited in a major life activity. Id. However, the definition for regarded as claims [*37]  was changed under the ADAAA, and the relevant provision now provides:
An individual meets the requirement of "being regarded as having such an impairment" if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.
42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(A) (emphasis added). "The ADA excludes individuals from regarded-as coverage if the impairment is both transitory (i.e., expected to last six months or less) and minor (which the statute does not define)." Nunies, 908 F.3d at 434 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12102(3)(B)).
Chipotle argues that Melani cannot create a genuine issue of fact that it regarded Melani as disabled. Chipotle highlights that Melani has not identified any objective evidence showing that his IBS is anything more than "transitory and minor," to which the regarded-as disability definition does not apply. Furthermore, Chipotle argues that for the same reasons Melani cannot establish that his termination was pretextual, he cannot establish that his termination was "because of Chipotle's knowledge of his IBS. See Nunies, 908 F.3d at 434.
Melani responds that Chipotle had knowledge of his IBS and [*38]  was aware that it may be a long-term issue, and fired him based on his IBS. The court disagrees with Melani.
As discussed in greater detail below, contrary to Melani's contention, the overwhelming evidence demonstrates that Melani's performance issues pre-dated any knowledge of his IBS. See Nunies, 908 F.3d at 434-35 (holding evidence showing that all was going well for Nunies's transfer until he disclosed shoulder injury, precluded summary judgment on "regarded as" disability claim). The undisputed evidence shows that Melani was demoted before he obtained an IBS diagnosis. And, there were numerous performance issues with the Clackamas restaurant independent of Melani's alleged disability or absences, none of which Melani refutes with evidence. Melani must show something more than an employer's simple knowledge or understanding that employee has a medical condition in order to establish a "regarded as" claim of disability discrimination. Accordingly, the court finds that Melani has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on his "regarded-as" disabled claim, and recommends that summary judgment be granted on this claim.

D. Chipotle 's Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reasons for Terminating Melani
To [*39]  establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Melani must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the statute, that he can perform the essential functions of the job, and was terminated because of his disability. Nunies, 908 F.3d at 433; Snead, 237 F.3d at 1087. Having determined that Melani has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to Chipotle "to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for its allegedly adverse actions. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; Snead, 237 F.3d at 1093.
The court finds that Chipotle has presented evidence of Melani's declining performance and reasons for terminating Melani. Melani's personnel file indicates that he was terminated for "Unacceptable Work Performance." (Mann Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 70-1.) Chipotle's Team Director, Joe Higel, testified in his deposition that Melani's termination resulted from the poor quality of work in the Clackamas restaurant. (Rigel Dep. 84:23-85:5.) Higel stated that Melani was not performing excellent work, did not have a desire to do so, and was failing to uphold the responsibilities of a general manager. (Higel Dep. 80:19-25, 81:13-15.) Higel further testified that the Clackamas restaurant crew felt that Melani "was not committed to their success, providing them with tools to do [*40]  their jobs to their utmost ability; communicating with them in regards to what they needed to do be the best they could at their jobs. . . . Numerous employees wanted to quit and leave due to the lack of leadership[.]" (Higel Dep. 81:20-82:9.)
Short testified in his deposition that failed audits, incomplete one-on-one interviews, serving food at the incorrect temperatures, lack of follow through, and the Clackamas restaurant's failing metrics in nearly every category all contributed to Chipotle's termination decision. (Short Dep. 151:7-152:18.) Indeed, numerous documents, including documents dated prior to Melani disclosing his IBS diagnosis, provide support for Short and Higel's concerns about declining performance.
The court finds that Chipotle has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Melani — his failing performance. See Phillips v. PacifiCorp., 304 F. App'x 527, 530 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting employee's poor performance was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharge); McDonald v. Care Center (Linda Vista), Inc., Case No. 1:13-cv-01882-CL, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108925, 2014 WL 3892969, at *6 (D. Or. Aug. 7, 2014) (finding performance problems including medial errors and violations of protocol were legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for termination).

E. Pretext and Causation
If the employer [*41]  proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the articulated reason is pretextual, "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Chuang v. Univ. of California Davis, 225 F.3d 1115, 1123 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)); Curley, 772 F.3d at 632; Arnold v. Pfizer, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1139 (D. Or. 2013). Circumstantial evidence of pretext must be specific and substantial. Arnold, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 1139; Villiarimo, 281 F.3d at 1062.
Melani argues that the court should infer pretext based on Chipotle's varying reasons terminating him, and that therefore, the true reason must be discrimination. Melani argues that Short and Higel's reasons for terminating him are "not believable." Melani argues that in an email dated April 25, 2016, Higel offered different reasons for his termination, including that Melani was making excuses for missing work, did not return texts or phone calls, he did not go to the doctor, he did not inform his crew about his IBS, he wore golf attire to his suspension meeting on April 23, 2016, and that Melani admitted that he was doing nothing to return to work. According to Melani, the reasons in Higel's email relate not to his performance but to his behaviors [*42]  while on "forced medical leave."
Melani similarly argues that Short's performance-based rationale for his termination are "not believable." Melani contends that Short praised his performance after becoming his manager, told Melani he was happy with his performance at their April 15, 2016 meeting, and said he had informed Higel that Melani was performing well under the Plan of Action. Melani further contends that Short's reasons are pretextual because an hour and ten minutes after Melani informed Short that he would be out due to his IBS, Short suspended him. According to Melani, the close temporal proximity between his need for leave and his suspension provides ample evidence of pretext.
Melani also argues that Short terminated him not for performance reasons, but because Short questioned whether Melani suffers from IBS, and called into question whether he suffers from a disabiling medical condition. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 9 at 4, ECF No. 54-9 at 4.) Melani highlights that Short sent a text to Higel suggesting that Melani was being "fake," and Short later testified at his deposition that he doubted whether Melani was being truthful about being ill. (Id. Ex. 5, Short Dep. 95:17-20; 139:5-24.) [*43] 
The court concludes that Melani has failed to establish that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Chipotle's alleged reasons for his termination were false, or that the true reason for his termination was discriminatory. See Butler v. City of Eugene, Or., 707 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1106-07 (D. Or. 2010). As described below, in light of the evidence as a whole, the factual discrepancies identified by Melani are neither specific nor substantial evidence of pretext.
Contrary to Melani's contentions, the record corroborates some of Short's suspicions. Short testified that he learned that Melani was not truthful with him or with Keever about going to the doctor. To be sure, Melani reported to Short and Keever that he had a follow-up appointment regarding his IBS on April 13, 2016; in fact, Melani did not have an appointment that day, and did not see Dr. Kim until April 25, 2016. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 8 at 2, ECF No. 53-8 at 2.) And, Short expressed concern about Melani's truthfulness when he arrived at the suspension meeting on April 23, 2016 wearing golf attire. In his deposition, Short testified that Melani was wearing a Titleist-branded visor and shirt, and that Melani admitted to playing golf. (Wilson Decl. Ex. 5, Short Dep. 69:11-71:7, ECF No. 54-5 at 12-14.) [*44]  Melani now contends that he did not "skip work to play golf" and that he was at home ill with IBS and was excluded from work based on Chipotle's policies. (Pl.'s Decl. ¶ 39, ECF No. 53.)
Melani's disagreement with Short and Higel' s assessment of his performance is not evidence of discriminatory animus to defeat summary judgment and ignores the bulk of the probative evidence presented to the court. Melani has failed to come forward with any evidence establishing that he consistently had been performing his job satisfactorily. In December 2015, his then supervisor Williams noted that Melani was leaving his shifts early, leaving his restaurant short-handed, and failed a facilities audit. (Keller Decl. Ex. 13 at 1-3, ECF No. 72-2 at 42-44.) On February 1, 2016, Melani was demoted, and told to focus on turning around the Clackamas restaurant. The next day, the Clackamas restaurant received a customer complaint about slow, unfriendly service. (Sealed Keller Deck Ex. 17 at 241, ECF No. 71-5 at 28.) Williams complained to Melani that he was not adequately communicating with her and his team and missed a mandatory meeting. (Sealed Keller Deck Ex. 17 at 200, ECF No. 71-5 at 7.) Sales at the [*45]  Clackamas restaurant were lower than projections. (Id. at 250.)
In March 2016, Short began supervising Melani in an effort to motivate him. Soon thereafter, Short received complaints from a Clackamas restaurant shift manager - one of Melani's subordinates - about procedures not being followed and audits not being completed. (Sealed Keller Deck Ex. 17 at 251, ECF No. 51-5 at 38.). Short and Melani were working on a Plan of Action to make improvements to the Clackamas restaurant. On March 6, Melani's restaurant received a "74-C" on a Food Safety Audit. (Id. at 256-59.) Higel informed Short to instruct Melani that such low Food Safety Scores were grounds for termination. (Id. at 256.) On March 8, 2016, the Clackamas restaurant received an improved score, but the improvement was short lived, as the restaurant was downgraded from a Restauranteur level to a regular restaurant with a score of 81 on March 31, 2016. (Keller Deck Ex. 11 at 25-30, ECF No. 72-2 at 24-29.) In late March, the Clackamas restaurant was struggling with cash handling audits. (Keller Deck Ex. 2 at 36-38, ECF No. 72-1.) On April 21, 2016, Keever informed Melani that a crew member quit. (Pl.'s Deck Ex. 8 at 4, ECF No. 53.) And, by mid-April, the Clackamas [*46]  restaurant received a Food Audit score of 63, a score lower than what Higel previously stated could result in termination. (Keller Deck Ex. 2 at 31, ECF No. 72-1 at 94.) Melani presents no evidence to refute the accuracy of any of the audits, staff turnover, or the store's falling metrics. Additionally, Melani presents no comparator evidence in an effort to establish that similarly situated employees without disabilities were retained.
Moreover, Melani's subjective belief that Short was pleased with his performance, and that Melani's suspension for performance reasons came as a "surprise" to Higel, are directly contradicted by Higel's deposition testimony and are undermined by record as a whole. Higel, when asked in his deposition whether he was surprised that Short planned to suspend Melani, responded: "It was not surprising. We'd been struggling with [Melani's] performance for awhile. And he was improving, but we were cautiously wondering if that was consistent." (Wilson Decl. Ex. 4, Higel Dep. 94:12-18, ECF No, 54-4.) Melani correctly notes that he initially had some success under Short's supervision, the record wholly supports Chipotle's consistent explanation that Melani's initial [*47]  success was brief. To be sure, Short's contemporaneous text to Higel on April 23, 2016 - the day he suspended Melani - identifies numerous performance-based reasons for suspending Melani, including that Short had visited the Clackamas restaurant, and that it was clear that Melani was not working on the Plan of Action, was not communicating with his team, had not completed the one-on-one meetings with team members, and had a Food Audit score of 63. (Keller Deck Ex. 2 at 31, ECF No, 72-1 at 94.)
Chipotle's performance-based reasons for terminating Melani are echoed throughout the record. For example, Dan Lester, who was present when Melani was suspended on April 23, 2016, testified that "[i]t was essentially performance based for [Melani]. And at that time, [Melani] admitted that there - he was not performing at a high level[.]" (Keller Deck Ex. 14, Lester Dep. 15:15-22, ECF No. 72-2 at 48.) Lester recalled that "the store's not running well. His numbers aren't in line. From a leadership perspective, [Melani] was kind of off the rails. He wasn't performing his duty in the store, and there - you could look at the numbers of the store and see that things were in decline." (Id. at 22:12-25.) [*48] 
Furthermore, Melani' s assertion that Higel's rationale for terminating him varied widely and is unworthy of credence misses the mark. Melani argues that Higel's April 25, 2016 email to Exective Team Director Pedro Huichapa creates a genuine issue of material fact on pretext. (Keller Decl. Ex. 2 at 34-35, ECF No. 72-1 at 97-98.) The court disagrees. In the April 25 email, Higel informs Huichapa that he was forwarding an email chain concerning Melani. (Id. at 34.) Higel stated that Melani had been moved to work under Short's supervision because he was not making improvements under Williams. (Id, at 34.) Higel noted that six weeks earlier Short and Melani came up with a plan to take corrective action, and that Melani initially appeared motivated to make improvements. (Id. at 35.) Higel indicated that improvements were short-lived:
he decided to visit restaurants on his own leaving his restaurant short-handed. His not working his shifts and finding excuses to leave his team was an existing problem from when he worked with [Williams], In the weeks since [Short] has seen improvement with his team, most if not all is due to the work [Short is] putting in with the team.
Last week [Melani] came to work and vomited outside. [*49]  He did not call SSR until asked to by [Short]. The restaurant was placed on protocol and [Melani] was sent home. He only returned on[e] text to his team during this time and no phone calls despite his team['s] efforts to contact him. He did not go to the doctor. He states he has IBD that causes daily vomiting and diarrhea. Asked how long this has been a problem he stated he has had if for along time. No one [on] his team is aware of his illness or symptoms. Meeting with Stephen Short Saturday to prepare for his return he arrived apparently healthy and in golf attire. He admitted to not doing anything to try to return to work or get diagnosis of his illness.
Due to his lack of regard for Chipotle health policies and the circumstance of his team, [Short] told him he could not return to work until he has a doctor's note allowing him to do so.
[Short] is set to meet with [Melani] Monday at 4:30pm pst. In communicating with myself, Lillianne Santos, and Steve Short we have come to the unfortunate agreement that [Melani] will need to be terminated if he does not produce a doctor's note that allows him to work. Even with a note I am doubt[ful] [Melani will be successful in his role as GM.
(Id. at 35 [*50] .) Huichapa responded that "Even if he is able to provide a doctor's note, I think we have enough evidence of his performance to let him go." (Id. at 35.)
Melani attempts to characterizes Higel's email as "shifting reasons" for his termination and that the true reason must be discriminatory. The court disagrees. Higel's email plainly describes it as a conversation Higel had previously with Mike Duffy, and also lists performance issues, some dating back several years. (Id. at 36.) When Higel was asked about the purpose of the email in his deposition, Higel responded that it was to "inform Pedro of a change that we were making in leadership at the Clackamas restaurant that involved [Melani]." (Wilson Decl. Ex. 4, Higel Dep. 100:17-20, ECF No. 54-4.) Similarly, when asked why Melani was terminated, Higel testified that Melani had been "running one of the worst stores in Oregon based on turnover, based on satisfaction of this guests, based on crew issues that were coming to light through conversations with the management team." (Keller Decl. Ex. 2, Higel Dep. 19:21-20:3, ECF No. 72-1 at 69-70.) Higel expressed concerns about Melani's failing performance in March of 2016, weeks before Melani disclosed to Short [*51]  and Keever that he had IBS. (Keller Decl. Ex. 2 at 36.) Indeed, Higel expressed his concerns about Melani to upper management in March 2016, and expected to make a decision about whether "we can retain him by the end of April." (Keller Decl. Ex. 2 at 37.)
Melani questions the veracity of some of Higel's statements in the April 25 email, such as whether he was finding excuses not to work or was not communicating with his team. (Pl.' s Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. at 25, ECF No. 52.) Contrary to Melani's contention, the record supports many of Higel's statements. For example, on February 5, 2016, Williams emailed Melani to express her concerns about Melani failing to effectively communicate with his team and with her. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 220, ECF No. 71-5.) Additionally, on March 8, 2016, Higel indicated that he was displeased that Melani was visiting other restaurants. (Sealed Keller Decl. Ex. 17 at 253, ECF No. 71-5 at 40; Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 240:8-23, ECF No. 72-1 at 43.) Melani argues that contrary to Higel's statement that he never saw a doctor and no one on his team was aware of his illness, he sent emails to Mann in SSR in February 2016 about his IBS diagnosis, notified [*52]  Keever and Short about his IBS in mid-April 2016, and hand-delivered Short a note from Dr. Kim dated April 25, 2016.
Thus, to the extent there are discrepancies between the statements in Higel's April 25 email concerning whether Melani was returning phone calls and emails in a timely manner, was attending doctor's appointments when he claimed he was, or was wearing golf attire at the time he was suspended, and Chipotle' s stated performance-based reasons for his termination, such discrepancies are minor and fail to create a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of pretext or causation. Snead, 237 F.3d at 1094 (holding that some inconsistencies in the employer's reasons for the employee's lay off did not defeat summary judgment); Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir.2003) (circumstantial evidence of pretext must be specific and substantial). Not one of the discrepancies identified by Melani rebuts Chipotle's primary reason for Melani's termination - his failing performance. As detailed at length above, Melani offers no evidence refuting the failed audits, high staff turnover, and other declining Clackamas restaurant metrics. Accordingly, Melani has failed to present evidence that Chipotle's performance-based reason for his termination was false [*53]  and that he would not have been terminated but for his disability.3Murray, 934 F.3d 1101, 2019 WL 3926945, at *4.
II. Failure to Accommodate/Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process-Claim Two
In Melani's second claim for relief, he argues that Chipotle failed to engage in the interactive process and failed to accommodate his IBS. Chipotle argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it is undisputed that Melani did not request a reasonable accommodation, he did not provide adequate notice, and Chipotle was unaware of his need for an accommodation.

A. Standards
Under the ADA, employers are required to engage in the interactive process with employees in order to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations. Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1115 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc), vacated on other grounds sub nom., US Airways, Inc. v Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 406, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002); Hoang v. Wells Fargo Bank., N.A., 724 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1101 (D. Or. 2010). Typically, the interactive process is triggered by a "request for accommodation by a disabled employee or by the employer's recognition of the need for such accommodation." Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1112. In the Ninth Circuit, an exception to this general rule applies only when the employer: "(1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason [*54]  to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation." Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding employer is "under no affirmative obligation to provide an accommodation" where there is no evidence that accommodation was requested); Wessels v. Moore Excavation, Inc., Case No. 3:14-cv-01329-HZ, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52639, 2016 WL 1589894, at *17-18 (D. Or. Apr. 18, 2016) (recognizing the general rule that employees generate the requests for accommodation); Kinyon v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., No. Civ 03-3047-CO, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21054, 2004 WL 2303595, at *10 (D. Or. Oct. 12, 2004) (granting summary judgment on failure to accommodate claim where employee presented no evidence that she was experiencing difficulty with her knees or that knees prevented her from requesting accommodation); Gay v. Blount, Inc., Case No. CV-10-773-ST, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68664 , 2011 WL 2420368, at *6 n.7 (D. Or. Apr. 28, 2011) (same).

B. Analysis
Melani admits that he failed to request any accommodations whatsoever when discussing his IBS with Chipotle. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep 294:19-21, ECF No. 72-1 at 56.) Consequently, to survive Chipotle's motion for summary judgment, Melani must fit under the exception to the general rule. Melani maintains that based on his communications, Chipotle was aware that his IBS "might qualify as a disability and needed an 'adjustment' in the form of a leave of absence or periodic days off." [*55]  (Id.) Melani's arguments fail for multiple reasons.
Chipotle's knowledge of Melani's IBS condition is not, without more, enough to inform Chipotle of his alleged disability or the desire for an accommodation. Wessels, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52639, 2016 WL 1589894, at *17-18 (holding that " [employee] 's failure to notify [employer] of any actual limitations in performing his job is fatal to his claim."). Though the standard is low for determining whether an employer has been put on notice that an employee is seeking a reasonable accommodation for the employee's limitations, an employee must inform "the employer of a need for an adjustment due to amedical condition," Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1112. In general, "it is the responsibility of the individual to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." 29 CF.R. § 1630.9.
Melani argues that Higel and Short were aware that he was struggling with gastrointestinal issues, and that he had been diagnosed with IBS. Melani argues that he had provided the SSR department with Dr. Kim's note in February 2016. (Pl.'s Resp. at 30, ECF No. 52.) Melani contends this information was sufficient to trigger the interactive process, that a leave of absence is not an undue hardship, and that summary judgment should be denied. The court disagrees.
The information [*56]  Melani provide to SSR in February 2016 simply informed Chipotle that he had a diagnosis of IBS and that he was clear to return to work. Dr. Kim's February 5, 2016 note does not mention any limitations or working restrictions whatsoever, and fails to provide any indication that additional time off may be needed in the future. Additionally, Melani did not inform either Higel or Short in April 2016 that his illnesses were related to his IBS. To be sure, when Melani informed Short that he was ill, he noted only that he had "puked" and was "sick as hell." Based on this information, Melani did not adequately communicate to anyone that he had restrictions on his ability to work attributable to his IBS. Wessels, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52639, 2016 WL 1589894, at *16.
Finally, Melani fails to present any evidence that Chipotle knew or had reason to know that Melani's IBS was preventing him from requesting a reasonable accommodation. See Brown, 246 F.3d at 1188. The evidence before the court does not show that Melani's IBS was so severe that he could not be expected to ask for help if he needed it. See Wells v. Mutual of Enumclaw, 244 F. App'x 790, 792 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding employee informing employer that he had been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's did not trigger interactive process where there was no evidence that dementia was causing [*57]  lack of insight into his condition); Martinez v. Univ. Med Ctr., No. 2:13-CV-00003-APG-VCF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9028, 2015 WL 315708, at *7 (D. Nev. Jan. 26, 2015) (finding no genuine issue of material fact on failure to accommodate claim where employee did not request accommodation and presented no evidence that his disability prevented him from requesting one); Wade v. Solis, No. C-08-00001-EDL, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37581, 2009 WL 1186638, at *16 (N.D. Cal. May 4, 2009) (granting summary judgment on reasonable accommodation claim where employee presented no evidence that he requested accommodation or that employer recognized need for request that employee was unable to make because of disability).
The record establishes that Melani did not request an accommodation. The record also establishes that Chipotle did not know, or have reason to know, that Melani experienced workplace problems because of a disability and that Chipotle did not know, or have reason to know, that Melani's disability prevented him from requesting a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, the court recommends that Chipotle's motion for summary judgment on Melani's reasonable accommodation claim be granted.
III. Retaliation O.R.S. § 659A.109
In Melani's Third Claim for relief, he alleges that he was terminated for invoking disability-based rights, violating O.R.S. § 659A.109. Melani argues that he engaged [*58]  in protected activity and that Chipotle retaliated against him by refusing to permit him to return to work, suspending him, and ultimately terminating his employment.
Under O.R.S. § 659A.109, "[i]t is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to hire or tenure or any term or condition of employment because the individual has applied for benefits or invoked or used the procedures provided for in ORS 659A. 103 to 659A.145." Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.109. "'To prevail on a claim for retaliation under [the Oregon Rehabilitation Act], a plaintiff must establish (1) that he or she invoked one or more rights [under the Act], and (2) that he or she suffered an adverse employment action motivated in substantial part by the plaintiff's invocation of such rights.'" Arnold, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 1140 (quoting Nelson v. Unified Grocers, Inc., Case No. 3:10-cv-00531-PK, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151483, 2011 WL 7029671, at *14 (D. Or. July 18, 2011), adopted 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4430, 2012 WL 113742 (Jan. 12, 2012)). Although Melani brings his retaliation claim solely under Oregon law, cases under the ADA may be helpful to the court's analysis. Under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish: "(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Alvarado v. Cajun Operating Co., 588 F.3d 1261, 1269 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing elements of disability retaliation claim under ADA)); Davis v. Tri-County Metro. Transp. Dist. of Oregon, 45 F. Supp. 3d 1222, 1255 (D. Or. 2014); Hicks, 2018 WL 4113335, at 11. The "standard [*59]  for the 'causal link' is but-for causation." Brenneise, 806 F.3d at 473. Unlike a discrimination claim, a retaliation claim does not depend on a plaintiff proving that he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Davis, 45 F. Supp. 3d at 1255; Herbert v. Altimeter, Inc., 230 Ore. App. 715, 218 P.3d 542, 549 (Or. Ct. App. 2009). Melani's retaliation claim is subject to the familiar McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Arnold, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 1140; Hicks, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147235, 2018 WL 4113335, at * 11. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. Then, in order to prevail, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer's alleged reason for the adverse employment decision is a pretext for another motive which is discriminatory. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-05.
Chipotle moves for summary judgment on this claim, contending that Melani has failed to identify the specific protected activity in which Melani engaged that serves as the basis for this retaliation claim, and that he cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See Marrazzo v. Leavitt, 719 F. Supp. 2d 1297, 1306-07 (D. Or. 2010) (stating that "it is clear that 'being disabled'" is not protected activity that can form the basis of a retaliation claim). Melani responds that the court should find that he has engaged in protected activity because Short was aware that Melani suffered from IBS and [*60]  was required to miss work for multiple days due to his gastrointestinal issues. Melani insists that he was not required to specifically ask for an accommodation in order for the court to find that he was engaged in protected activity.
The court is not convinced that on these facts that Melani's repeated illness and communication with Chipotle sufficiently establishes that he engaged in protected activity. Nevertheless, assuming arguendo that Melani has established a prima facie case of retaliation, Melani's retaliation claim fails because he cannot establish a causal link between his IBS-induced absences and his termination. As discussed at length above, Melani has failed to set forth specific and substantial evidence that Chipotle's performance-based reasons for his termination were pretextual or false, and that but for his alleged IBS-related absences, he would not have been terminated. Brenneise, 806 F.3d at 473 (providing but-for causation is the standard in ADA retaliation claims); see Marrazzo, 719 F. Supp. 2d at 1307 (discussing that if prima facie case of retaliation established, then under McDonnell Douglas, employee must establish employer's reason for adverse employment action is pretextual); Brown, 336 F.3d at 1188. Because no reasonably jury could conclude [*61]  that Melani's termination would not have occurred in the absence of his IBS-induced illnesses, Chipotle's motion for summary judgment on Claim Three should be granted.
IV. OFLA Interference, Denial and Retaliation Under O.R.S. 659A.183
In Melani's Fourth Claim for Relief, he alleges that Chipotle interfered with his right to protected leave under OFLA by not advising him of his right to leave, and by actively dissuading him from taking OFLA leave for his absences. (SAC ¶ 77.) And, Melani contends that Chipotle retaliated against him by terminating his employment for taking protected leave. (SAC ¶ 78.)

A. Interference under FMLA/OFLA
Under the FMLA, employees have two interrelated rights: "first, the employee has a right to use a certain amount of leave for protected reasons, and second, the employee has a right to return to his or her job or an equivalent job after using protected leave." Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, 259 F.3d 1112, 1122 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 2612(a), 2614(a)); Seehawer v. McMinnville Water & Light, Case No. 3:16-cv-01682-AC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221702 , 2018 WL 7822063, at *11 (D. Or. Dec. 10, 2018). "The Ninth Circuit recognizes three types of claims under FMLA: (1) interference claims, when an employer interferes with an employee's exercise of rights under the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); (2) retaliation claims, when an employer discriminates against an [*62]  employee for instituting or participating in proceedings or inquiries under FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2615(b); and (3) discrimination claims, when an employer discriminates against an employee for opposing any practice prohibited by the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2)." Benz v. West Linn Paper Co., 803 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1249 (D. Or. 2011). An employer may interfere with an employee's rights under FMLA by "'refusing to authorize FMLA leave' and 'discouraging an employee from using such leave.'" Xin Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F.3d 1125, 1134 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 825.220).
Under Oregon's Family Leave Act, an eligible employee is entitled to take a leave of absence for a qualifying event, such as to seek treatment for a serious health condition, or to take care of a family member with a serious health condition. See Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 659A.150 — 659A.186. Under OFLA, an employer may not deny family leave to an eligible employee, or retaliate or discriminate against an employee that has inquired about leave, requested leave, or invoked the provisions of OFLA. Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.183. OFLA is construed to the extent possible consistent with any similar provisions of FMLA. Benz, 803 F. Supp. 2d at 1250; Allred v. Boise Cascade Wood Prods., LLC, Civ. No. 1:17-cv-01534-CL, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144405, 2018 WL 4040238, at *4 (D. Or. July 18, 2018), adopted 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144530, 2018 WL 4039691 (Aug. 22, 2018). Oregon courts look to federal law when interpreting OFLA. Benz, 803 F. Supp. 2d at 1250.
To sustain a claim for denial or interference with FMLA, a plaintiff must show: (1) he was an eligible employee; (2) the employer [*63]  was covered by FMLA; ( 3) he was entitled to take FMLA leave; (4) he gave sufficient notice of his intent to take leave; and (5) the employer denied his FMLA benefits to which he was entitled. Sanders v. City of Newport, 657 F.3d 772, 778 (9th Cir 2011); Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *8. A plaintiff can prove a FMLA interference claim by using either direct or circumstantial evidence. Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1125; Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *8.
Chipotle contends that summary judgment should be granted on this claim for several reasons. First, Chipotle argues that Melani has not established that he suffers a serious health condition and was entitled to protected leave. Second, Chipotle insists that Melani provided no notice of his intention to take protected leave. And third, Chipotle did not deny him leave because Melani did not request FMLA paperwork until after his suspension had occurred and the decision to terminate him had been made.
Melani insists that multiple issues of material fact prevent summary judgment, including that he has a serious health condition, he was entitled to protected leave, Chipotle was aware of his condition, and he provided sufficient notice to Chipotle of his need for protected leave. According to Melani, if there was a doubt as to whether Melani's leave qualified for FMLA, Chipotle was obligated to [*64]  make a further inquiry. The court disagrees.
Melani has failed to create a genuine issue of fact that he was entitled to protected leave. Under the FMLA, a "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition" requiring either inpatient hospital care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11); see 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.113(a), 825.114, 825.115. It is undisputed that at no point, did Melani require inpatient hospital care. See Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *10-11 (discussing overnight hospitalization to satisfy serious medical condition).
In his briefing, Melani makes little effort to establish that his IBS qualifies as a serious health condition requiring continuing care. See 29 C.F.R. § 825.115 (describing requirements). As detailed at length above, it is undisputed that Melani sought treatment for his IBS only three times (February 3, 2016; February 15, 2016; and April 25, 2016) over the course of three months. Therefore, the court finds that Melani has not established a genuine issue of material fact that he suffers a serious health condition and was entitled to protected leave.
Moreover, even assuming arguendo that Melani's IBS could qualify as a serious health condition under the regulations, he fails to establish [*65]  a genuine issue of material fact that he gave sufficient notice. To give proper notice, an employee must, "provide sufficient information for an employer to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request." 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(b). When the need for leave is unforeseeable, an employee must provide notice "as soon as practicable." 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a). Whether the content of the notice provided by an employee is sufficient depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the particular case. 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a). An employee is not required to explicitly invoke FMLA's protections, but need only state that leave is needed for a qualifying reason. Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1130; Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *12; OAR 839-009-0250(1) ("The employee is not required to specify that the request is for OFLA leave"). Thus, an employer is responsible, "having been notified of the reason for an employee's absence, for being aware that the absence may qualify for FMLA protection," and for inquiring further to determine if FMLA leave is appropriate. Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1131.
Chipotle argues that Melani did not give any notice of his intention to take protected leave until he requested FMLA paperwork from Lillianne Santos in SSR on April 26, 2016, after he had been suspended and his termination decision had been made. Chipotle contends that [*66]  Melani cannot establish a genuine issue of material fact that he provided sufficient notice and is entitled to summary judgment. In contrast, Melani argues that Short knew he suffered from IBS, knew he was struggling with "severe gastrointestinal issues," and knew that he could not work due to his gastrointestinal issues before he was suspended, and therefore Short should have known to inquire further when Melani repeatedly called in sick in April 2016. According to Melani, this evidence is sufficient notice to invoke leave, and if Chipotle was unsure, it should have undertaken further inquiry to ascertain whether FMLA applied. Chipotle is correct.
Here, it is undisputed that Melani did not specifically request FMLA paperwork until April 26, 2016, the same day he was terminated. Melani does not argue, nor does the evidence support, that Short knew Melani had requested FMLA paperwork at the time he was terminated. Thus, Melani's April 26, 2016 email to Santos to request FMLA paperwork did not provide sufficient notice to Chipotle that Melani intended to take FMLA leave at any earlier time. The court also examined whether the various text messages and emails from Melani to Short and SSR [*67]  provided sufficient information for Chipotle to reasonably determine whether FMLA leave may apply to Melani's earlier absences. Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *12. The court concludes they did not.
Melani informed Patti Mann in SSR about his IBS condition via email on February 5, 2016. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 4 at 1-4, ECF No. 53-4.) That email exchange reveals that Melani had been diagnosed with IBS, that it flares up periodically and comes on unexpectedly, it was not contagious, and that he had been cleared to return to work the following day. (Id.) The email exchange with Mann shows that Melani was attempting to return to work sooner than the three-day exclusion rule ("What do I need to do in order to be able to return to work?"), and would not reasonably inform Chipotle that FMLA leave may apply. (Id. at 3.)
Likewise, Melani's text message to Short on April 13, 2016 would not provide sufficient notice to Short that FMLA leave might apply. (Pl.'s Decl. Ex. 7 at 2, ECF No. 53-7.) Melani's April 13 text message simply informs Short that he has a follow-up doctor's appointment for his IBS. (Id.) Melani's other text message to Short on April 18, 2016, simply informs Short that he woke up "sick as hell" and that he "puked and [was] running [*68]  a small fever." (Id. at 3.) Nowhere in the April 18 text does Melani link his illness to his IBS. Moreover, Melani's inquiry in the ensuing text exchange with Short about whether he needs to comply with the three-day exclusion rule, suggests that Melani wanted to return to work sooner, and provides no notice that FMLA leave may apply. (Id. at 4.) Finally, Melani's April 21, 2016 text message to Short provides that he "had to run outside twice to puke" and similarly fails to mention his IBS, and the remainder of the text inquires whether he could remain on the job to meet with staff and not handle food. (Id. at 4.)
Having carefully examined the emails and text messages exchanged between Melani, SSR, and Short, the court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Melani provided sufficient notice of his need for FMLA or OFLA leave. Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *13 (finding text message that employee was in the hospital and would not make it to work did not provide sufficient notice of need for FMLA leave). Accordingly, Chipotle's motion for summary judgment on Melani's OFLA interference claim should be granted.

B. Retaliation under FMLA/OFLA
Employers are prohibited from "discriminating or retaliating against [*69]  an employee . . . for having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c). When a plaintiff alleges an employer retaliated against him for exerting rights under FMLA, the Ninth Circuit has specified that such a claim is properly analyzed as an interference claim. Schultz v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat. Ass'n, 970 F. Supp. 2d 1039, 1052 (D. Or. 2013) (citing Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124 ("By their plain meaning, the anti-retaliation or anti-discrimination provisions do not cover visiting negative consequences on an employee simply because he has used FMLA leave. Such action, is instead, covered under § 2615(a)(1), the provisions governing "Interference with the Exercise of Rights.")). The appropriate legal framework, therefore, "is not the burden-shifting approach of traditional anti-discrimination law, but rather the much simpler standard derived from the applicable statute and regulation." Zsenyuk v. City of Carson, 99 F. App'x 794, 796 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1124-25); Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *14; Allred, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144405, 2018 WL 4040238, at *5; Florea v. Nw. Country Place, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-02290-SB, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88437, 2015 WL 4111865, at *7 (D. Or. July 7, 2015).
Retaliation may be construed in this context as an employer's use of "[an employee's] taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions." 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c). Thus, to sustain an interference claim involving FMLA or OFLA retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he took or requested protected leave; (2) the employer subjected him to an adverse employment [*70]  action; and (3) the requesting or taking of protected leave was a "negative factor" in the adverse employment decision. Schultz, 970 F. Supp. at 1053 (citing Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1125; 29 C.F.R.§ 825.220(c)). The Ninth Circuit has made clear that an "adverse employment action" includes the decision to terminate an employee. See Bachelder, 259 F.3d at 1122. No cause of action exists, however, if termination is the result of the employee's own performance problems. Liston Nevada ex rel. Dep't of Bus. & Indus., 311 F. App'x 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Price v. Multnomah Cty., 132 F. Supp. 2d 1290, 1297 (D. Or. 2001)).
Chipotle argues that Melani cannot prevail on his FMLA retaliation claim because Melani has provided no evidence that his absences were a "significant factor" in the decision to terminate his employment. Chipotle maintains it suspended Melani for three days because of performance reasons prior to receiving his FLMA paperwork request, and that the decision to terminate him occurred before that request. Melani asserts that the close proximity in time between when he was out on "forced medical leave" and his termination is enough to suggest that his leave request on April 26, 2016, was a significant factor in his dismissal. Melani also argues that Short was upset that Melani was missing work due to his IBS and informed him that he needed a doctor's note to return, which fact implies that Short believed Melani was fabricating [*71]  his disability. According to Melani, these facts combine to create material fact issues for trial on his OFLA retaliation claim.
Melani's retaliation claim fails for two reasons. First, Melani has failed to demonstrate that Short was aware that Melani requested FMLA paperwork just minutes before he terminated Melani Melani offers no evidence to support this assertion. Indeed, Melani admitted in his deposition that he requested FMLA leave only from Santos, and had no knowledge whether Santos discussed his request with Short. (Keller Decl. Ex. 1, Melani Dep. 279:3-12, ECF No. 72-1 at 53.) Rather, Melani argues that the close temporal proximity between his FMLA request and his termination as evidence of causation. "Suspicious timing may be circumstantial evidence of a causal link between exercise of FMLA rights and an adverse employment action, but "'[w]hen a moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.'" Law v. Kinross Gold USA., Inc., 651 F. App'x 645, 648 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal citation omitted, quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)). Furthermore, "[e]ssential to the causal link is evidence that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in protected activity." [*72]  Noga, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 1262 (citations and internal quotations omitted). Melani has not produced any evidence of this essential causal link.
Second, as discussed at length above, Melani has failed to present any evidence, aside from his self-serving declaration, to rebut the overwhelming evidence of his failing performance. As Chipotle argues, Melani's termination was set in motion three days earlier, when Chipotle suspended him for a failing food audit score, failing to communicate with his team, and flagging performance. Thus, regardless of whether Short was angry or believed that Melani suffered from a disability, Melani has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact to causally link his FMLA paperwork request to Santos on April 26, and his termination by Short minutes later for perfomance reasons. Therefore, the court recommends that Chipotle's motion for summary judgment be granted on Melani's OFLA interference, denial, and retaliation claim.
V. Wrongful Discharge - Fifth Claim for Relief
Melani's wrongful discharge claim is premised on retaliation for invoking his right to leave under OFLA. Because no reasonable jury could find that Melani provided sufficient notice of his intent to take OFLA or [*73]  that Melani's request for OFLA leave was a significant factor in his termination, Melani's wrongful discharge claim premised on the same conduct similarly fails. Accordingly, Chipotle's motion for summary judgment should be granted on Melani's Fifth Claim for relief. See Ellis, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66544, 2019 WL 1553676, at *16 (granting employer summary judgment on wrongful discharge claim where employee where no material factual issue existed on FMLA interference or retaliation claim).
VI. Punitive Damages
In his Second Amended Complaint, Melani seeks punitive damages on his state law claims. (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 51, ECF No. 58.) Chipotle seeks summary judgment on Melani's claim for punitive damages. (Def.'s Supp. Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 62.) Melani asserts that Chipotle acted with malice and reckless disregard of his rights by failing to accommodate his IBS and terminating his employment based on his disability. Melani argues that Chipotle targeted him for termination because of his IBS, as evidenced by Short's decision to terminate him after learning Melani would be required to miss additional work because of his IBS. For the reasons stated above, the court has determined that Melani has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact [*74]  on any claim in his Second Amended Complaint. Accordingly, the court recommends that summary judgment be granted on Melani's claim for punitive damages.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the court recommends that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 39) be GRANTED.
