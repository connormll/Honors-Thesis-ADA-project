FINDINGS  [*2] AND RECOMMENDATION
STEWART, Magistrate Judge:

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff, Juan Picouto ("Picouto"), a Cuban refugee, alleges claims against his former employer, defendant Western Star Truck Plant Portland LLC, f.k.a. Freightliner of Portland, LLC ("Freightliner"), for subjecting him to: (1) a hostile work environment and other retaliation for his opposition to race discrimination in violation of 42 USC § 2000e-3 ("First Claim") and the corresponding Oregon statute, ORS 659A.030(1)(f) ("Second Claim"); (2) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 USC §§ 12101-12117 ("Third Claim") and the corresponding Oregon statutes, ORS 659A.103-.142 ("Fourth Claim"); (3) retaliation for using protected medical leave in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 USC §§ 2601-2654 ("Fifth Claim") and the Oregon Family Leave Act ("OFLA"), ORS 659A.150 to ORS 659A.186 ("Sixth Claim"); (7) wrongful termination ("Seventh Claim"); and (8) discrimination because he invoked the workers' compensation laws in violation of ORS 659A.040 to 659A.052 ("Eighth Claim").
Freightliner has moved for summary judgment in its favor on all claims (docket #41). That  [*3] motion should be denied as to those portions of: (1) the First and Second Claims alleging a hostile work environment; and (2) the Third and Fourth Claims alleging disability discrimination premised upon a failure to engage in the interactive process or otherwise accommodate Picouto's actual or perceived disability with regard to the May 2008 recall. In all other respects, Freightliner's motion should be granted.

LEGAL STANDARDS
FRCP 56(c) authorizes summary judgment if "no genuine issue" exists regarding any material fact and "the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The moving party must show an absence of an issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party does so, the nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings" and designate specific facts showing a "genuine issue for trial." Id at 324, citing FRCP 56(e). The court must "not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter, but only [determine] whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Balint v. Carson City, Nev., 180 F3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir 1999) (citation omitted). A "'scintilla of evidence,' or evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly  [*4] probative,'" does not present a genuine issue of material fact. United Steelworkers of Am. v. Phelps Dodge Corp., 865 F2d 1539, 1542 (9th Cir), cert denied, 493 U.S. 809, 110 S. Ct. 51, 107 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1989) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).
The substantive law governing a claim or defense determines whether a fact is material. T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F2d 626, 630 (9th Cir 1987). The court must view the inferences drawn from the facts "in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." Id (citation omitted). In employment discrimination cases "very little evidence" is required to survive summary judgment "because the ultimate question is one that can only be resolved through a searching inquiry — one that is most appropriately conducted by the factfinder, upon a full record. " Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., 80 F3d 1406, 1410 (9th Cir) (internal quotations, citation omitted), cert denied, 519 U.S. 927, 117 S. Ct. 295, 136 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1996).

FACTS

I. Freighliner's Portland Truck Manufacturing Plant

A. Scope of Operations
Freightliner is a manufacturer of heavy, class 8 vehicles that builds various models marketed under the Western Star brand, as well as some Freightliner military vehicles. Freightliner operates  [*5] a truck manufacturing facility, the Portland Truck Manufacturing Plant ("PTMP"), on Swan Island in Portland, Oregon. The current build rate at the PTMP, where Freightliner employs approximately 650 production workers, is 15 vehicles per day. Prior to March 31, 2007, Freightliner manufactured an additional brand of truck at the PTMP and employed roughly 1,800 production workers with a build rate of up to 74 vehicles per day. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 3. There is only one production assembler job description, and it applies to all shop floor production workers. Id, ¶ 4; Sheleretis Depo., pp. 87-88. The jobs at the PTMP are labor intensive and physically demanding, and Freightliner has between 50 to 75 open workers' compensation claims at any given time. LaRochelle Depo., p. 16.
Production workers at the PTMP are represented by four unions, including Teamsters Local 305, Paintmakers Local 104, Service Employee International Union Local 49, and the International Association of Machinists ("IAM") Local 1005. The production assemblers are represented by IAM Local 1005. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 10.

B. Offline Department
Manufacturing of the truck cab and chassis occurs on assembly lines. Once off the assembly  [*6] line, if quality issues are spotted, the truck is routed to "Offline," a department in which production workers correct errors prior to delivery to the customer. Id, ¶ 5. In 2006 and 2007, Freightliner operated three lines in Offline called "Chains" — Chain 1, Chain 2 and Chain 3. The Chains were identical in terms of job responsibilities and were located side-by-side approximately 25 to 30 feet apart from one another inside the plant. Id, ¶ 6. At the beginning of each Chain is an area referred to as the "Pit," an area below the shop floor where employees work under the truck primarily tightening nuts on a U-bolt as part of the wheel alignment process and checking certain fluid levels as the truck passes overhead. 1 Id, ¶ 6, Ex. B. Working in the Pit is one of the least desirable and dangerous jobs at the PTMP. It requires the employee to hold a torque gun weighing approximately 30 pounds overhead and apply pressure while performing work on the bottoms of the trucks. Carattini Decl., ¶ 9. If the torque gun is not seated properly when it is activated, it is difficult to control and has a tendency to rotate on its own. Id.
The teams of employees on each Offline Chain vary in number based on the volume of trucks being manufactured. At full production, a Chain on a given shift is staffed by a team of approximately nine to 15 employees led by a union foreman called a "Team Leader." LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 8; Liday Depo., pp. 14-15. The Team Leader is a bargaining unit employee, not management, who does not have the authority to hire, fire or discipline any of the other employees. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 9; Picouto Depo., pp. 52-53, 173-74.

II. Picouto's Employment With Freightliner

A. Initial Employment and Periodic Layoffs
Plaintiff is a 54 year old Hispanic male who was born and raised in Guantanamo, Cuba. Picouto Decl., ¶¶ 1-2. He did not begin to learn to speak English until 1979 when he arrived  [*8] in Miami as a refugee and continues to have some difficulty communicating in English. Id, ¶¶ 2-3. Picouto moved to Oregon in 1994 and applied for a job with Freightliner as a production worker. Id, ¶ 4. In February 1995, at age 39, Picouto began working for Freightliner at the PTMP. Id, ¶ 5.
From 1998 through August 2006, except during layoffs or during cross-training, Picouto worked in Offline in a "cry" position. Id, ¶ 10. In the "cry" position, Picouto was responsible for fixing problems with trucks that had gone through the assembly line, but needed more work before leaving the plant. A checklist of the problems is given to Offline employees. The employees are to solve or fix the problems and sign off on the checklist. In doing this work, the employees do different types of work and varied tasks rather than repetitive work. Id.

B. Workers' Compensation Claims and Periods of Layoffs
Picouto suffered three on-the-job injuries at Freightliner for which he filed workers' compensation claims. Freightliner does not handle or administer its workers' compensation claims internally. Supp. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 6. Instead, Freightliner uses an independent third-party administrator to administer  [*9] the claims. Id. Thus, Freightliner's Human Resources ("HR") Department did not handle Picouto's workers' compensation claims. Id.
On August 16, 1995, Picouto injured his right upper extremity and elbow. Picouto Decl., ¶ 6. He filed a workers' compensation claim concerning that injury. Id. Freightliner goes through cyclical periods of production slowdown which necessitate rounds of layoffs. About nine months after his first on-the-job injury, Picouto was laid off. He remained on layoff between May 3, 1996, and July 21, 1997. Id, ¶ 7.
Six months later, on February 9, 1998, Picouto suffered a second on-the-job injury, this time to his right shoulder. Id, ¶ 8. He filed a workers' compensation claim related to that injury, went off work, and had surgery to his right shoulder. Id. Upon his return to work at Freightliner on August 17, 1998, Freightliner hired an ADA consultant to assist in determining what jobs Picouto could perform, ultimately placing him in the "cry" position in the Offline Department. Id, ¶ 9.
Picouto was laid off for partial months in July, August, September, and October 2000, and January-March 2001. Id, ¶¶ 13-14. On March 28, 2001, Picouto suffered a third on-the-job injury,  [*10] this time tearing a ligament in his left knee. Id, ¶ 15. He filed a workers' compensation claim related to that injury. Id. Shortly thereafter, on March 30, 2001, Picouto was again laid off due to a reduction in truck orders. Id, ¶¶ 16-17; Supp. Sheleretis Decl., Ex. H. A few months later, some time in the summer of 2002, Picouto was released to full duty for regular work. Picouto Decl., ¶ 18; Rasmussen Decl., Ex. B.
Nearly two years later, on August 30, 2004, Picouto was again recalled to work at Freightliner. Picouto Decl., ¶ 24. According to Freightliner's occupational nurse, Rosemary Rasmussen, R.N. ("Rasmussen"), members of the nursing staff inquire whether an employee recalled to work has any current medical restrictions that preclude him from performing the functions of his job. Picouto reported no medical restrictions upon his recall in August 2004. Rasmussen Decl., ¶ 3. Picouto's then-supervisor, Herbert Franklin ("Franklin"), assigned Picouto to work in the Pit, 2 but removed him when he had trouble holding the heavy air wrenches and his right elbow began to swell. Id. At that time, Picouto worked on Offline Chain 1 for Team Leader Thad Liday ("Liday"). Liday Depo., pp. 12,  [*11] 16, 31.

C. Cross-Training
As early as 2002, Freightliner implemented a cross-training program in the PTMP. Supp. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 2. No later than 2004, Freightliner implemented the more formal DaimlerChrysler Production System ("DCPS"), a "continuous improvement" system which entails more formalized cross-training practices. Id, ¶ 3. One aspect of the DCPS is that employees must be cross-trained to perform at least three jobs, including their regular production job and the two production jobs which are before and after their regular job. 3 Id, ¶ 13; Rouse Depo., pp. 28-29. Department supervisors make cross-training assignments. Picouto Depo., pp. 314-15.
"Cry" positions in Offline require the employee to "do any work that's required" to solve manufacturing problems discovered in quality assurance. Rouse Depo., p. 30. Other jobs in Offline involve "skill type work," of diagnosing and fixing specific problems with nearly-completed trucks. Id, p. 31. Examples include positions in upholstery repair, electrical, and "airing." Id; Picouto Depo., p. 313.
Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") between Freightliner and the IAM, "Area Transfer Requests" to permanent vacancies are honored on a seniority basis "providing the employee requesting a [transfer] has the ability to perform the job in a normal and average manner." 2004-2007 CBA, p. 4 (Art. III, § 7(a)). 4 Temporary assignments out of an employee's regular work area are filled starting with the least senior employee qualified to perform the work. 2004-2007 CBA, p. 7 (Art. III, § 7(g)).

D. Monken Becomes the Chain 2 Team Leader
Some time in 2004, Liday requested that Picouto be transferred off Chain 1. Liday Depo., pp. 24-26. Dan Spulberg, who was then the temporary Team Leader of Chain 2, agreed that Picouto could be transferred onto Chain 2. Id, pp. 26-27. George Monken ("Monken") was also acting as a temporary Team Leader of Chain 2 at that time. Id, p. 27.
In early 2005, Monken became the Team Leader of Chain 2. Id, ¶ 28. Monken "would yell and scream at Mr. Picouto and other employees" and routinely "made perverted jokes and sexually suggestive movements at work in front of everyone." Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 11-12. Monken would "dry hump the bottom of male workers" and "grab his crotch and tell male  [*14] workers to suck his dick." McCauley Decl., ¶ 9. Monken used profanity and "aggressive body language" toward other members of Chain 2, "but at times . . . would focus on Mr. Picouto and would ride him for no apparent reason." Id; Picouto Decl., ¶ 66.
Monken subjected Picouto to a daily barrage of unwanted and offensive sexually-based conduct and national origin and race-based taunts. Monken told Picouto to watch him perform vulgar and sexually-suggestive pantomimes, grabbing his crotch and telling Picouto "if you know what's good for you, you will do the job," pretending to masturbate and saying "hey Juan, look here," hanging a tube out of his pants and making sucking noises at Picouto, holding onto Picouto's shoulders and "humping" him from behind, 5 and accusing Picouto of giving blow jobs to the supervisor, saying that Picouto was "sucking the supervisor's cock." Picouto Decl., ¶¶ 29, 44-45, 52, 60, 66; Picouto Depo., p. 91.
In addition, Monken called Hispanic employees "racially biased names and ma[d]e racially biased references," asking them if they were "going to Taco Bell again?" McCauley Decl., ¶ 23. Monken called Picouto "Little Cuban" and threatened that "when Castro dies" Picouto would be sent "back to Cuba." Picouto Decl., ¶ 72; Picouto Depo., p. 54. He also ridiculed Picouto's skin condition by calling him "scar face." Picouto Decl., ¶ 46, Ex. 13, p. 1.

E. Picouto's Complaints About Monken's Conduct
Picouto repeatedly complained about Monken's conduct beginning as early as March 2005, when he complained to the Offline Production Supervisor, Keenan Kahl ("Kahl"), that Monken treated him differently because of his race and being from Cuba. 6 He told Kahl that Monken was touching his crotch, making his hands look like a penis,  [*16] touching and humping his buttocks. Kahl told Picouto that he needed to "get along" with Monken. Id. Following that complaint, someone began signing Picouto's name to jobs he had not worked on. Picouto Decl., ¶ 29.
On June 24, 2005, Picouto received a verbal warning from Franklin about the quality of his work. Id, ¶ 31. Picouto told Franklin that Monken was harassing him and signing his name to jobs he had not worked on. Monken then told Picouto he did not want Picouto working on Chain 2. Id, ¶ 32. Franklin told Monken that Picouto was staying on Chain 2,  [*17] but Picouto did not hear Franklin tell him to stop harassing Picouto. Id.
Wayne LaRochelle ("LaRochelle") became the HR Manager at the PTMP in July 2005. Picouto went to him several times to report harassment by Monken. 7 Id, ¶ 33.

F. 2006 Job Reassignment and Continuing Complaints About Monken
On February 10, 2006, Picouto was temporarily reassigned to a different department, Pool 3, to work on the Chassis Line as a tire installer operating a torque machine. That work caused pain in Picouto's right shoulder and knee. He talked to his supervisor, Robert Looney ("Looney"), and Freightliner's occupational health medical assistant, Karla Steffenson ("Steffenson"), explaining that he had previously injured his right shoulder and left knee on the job and had received a permanent disability award for each. They had him speak to the Plant Supervisor, David Speakman ("Speakman"), who sent him home saying he should not be doing his job if he was having medical problems. Id, ¶ 35. Even though Picouto never refused to operate the tire torque machine, Freightliner  [*18] issued a written warning that his employment was in jeopardy based on Freightliner's contention that he had refused to do so. Id, ¶ 37, Ex. 6.
Some time prior to July 2004, Freightliner instituted an Attendance Control Program ("ACP") which "considers any absence or tardy/short time on a scheduled workday as an infraction regardless of the reason, unless specifically excused under [the ACP]." 2007-2010 CBA, p. 40. The ACP includes sending employees who are absent from work Reporting Requirements Letters ("RRLs") which remind them of their duties under the ACP. Freightliner lists employees who are absent without medical leave documentation as "suspended" in its leave-tracking system. However, if an employee later provides verification of the medical need for the absence, "documented medical leaves are excused under the no fault policy." LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 33; see also 2004-2007 CBA, Letter of Understanding re: ACP of July 6, 2004 (Bouman-Steagall Decl., Ex. K, p. 16); 2007-2010 CBA, pp. 40-42.
Picouto's next scheduled work day after his reassignment to Pool 3 was February 13, 2006. Picouto took medical leave for shoulder pain on February 13-15, 2006. Picouto Decl., ¶ 36, Ex. 5. He apparently  [*19] did not submit a "Request for 190" leave form until his return to work on February 16, 2006. Id, Ex. 5, p. 4. By that time, Freightliner had listed him as suspended on its leave tracking system. Id, Ex. 5, p. 5. After the leave form was submitted along with the appropriate medical documentation, the suspension was removed. Id, Ex. 5, pp. 4-5.
On March 2, 2006, Picouto complained to his union representative, Frank Rouse ("Rouse"), that Monken was abusing him. At a subsequent meeting with Looney and the union's business representative, Joe Kear ("Kear"), Looney told Picouto that Freightliner did not have any documents on file indicating that he had current medical restrictions. 8 Id, ¶ 39. He again told Looney he had received permanent partial disability for his right arm and shoulder and for his left knee. Looney sent Picouto back to work in Offline. Id.
After Picouto returned to Offline, Monken frequently approached him and subjected him to pantomimes of masturbation and fellatio, telling him "hey Juan, look here." Id, ¶ 44. Picouto told Monken he did not like the way he talked to him and did not want to joke with him. Id. Monken would approach Picouto from behind, put his hips behind Picouto and "hump" him. Id, ¶ 45. Picouto told Monken to stop, but Monken continued. Id. From March 20 to 24, 2006, Picouto was on medical leave, 9 returning to work on March 27, 2006. Id, ¶¶ 40, 42. On April 12, 2006, Picouto received a letter signed by Looney accusing him establishing of a "pattern" of excessive medical leaves by taking eight medical leaves and notifying him that he was in violation of the ACP ("See the note in Excused Absence: frequent absences (3 or more) for medical leaves could result in disciplinary measures."). Id, Ex. 8. 10
Picouto reported Monken's behavior to Kahl.  [*21] Id, ¶¶ 47-48. In July 2006, Picouto again reported Monken's frequent statements to him that he "was sucking the supervisor's cock in his office" and that "when Castro dies, we are going to send you back to Cuba." Id, ¶¶ 50-51. However, Kahl said and did nothing about Picouto's reports. Id, ¶¶ 47-51.
In June 2006, Tim Kelsey ("Kelsey") became the Swing Shift Offline Supervisor and Picouto's direct supervisor. Kelsey Decl., ¶ 4. Picouto also complained to Kelsey who, like Kahl, did not say or do anything. Picouto Decl., ¶ 52.

G. The Car-Moving Incident
On July 19, 2006, Picouto and other workers parked their vehicles in the turnaround area in front of the PTMP because the employee parking lot was full. During the ensuing work shift, Monken announced that the City was ticketing cars and employees needed to go out and move their cars or they would be towed. About five employees, including Picouto, went out and moved their cars. Picouto later received a disciplinary letter for moving his car before break time. Id. Although at least four other people moved their cars and returned late from lunch as a result of doing so, Picouto was the only employee to receive a disciplinary letter. 11 Id,  [*22] ¶ 53.

H. Assignment to the Pit
Some time after becoming his direct supervisor in June 2006, Kelsey assigned Picouto to cross train in the Pit. 12 Amended Kelsey Decl., ¶ 5. On August 2, 2006, Monken refused to issue Picouto the paperwork required to get a special tool he needed to perform his job. Picouto Decl., ¶ 55. When Picouto responded by asking for help from Chain 3's  [*23] Team Leader, Ted Quiznel, Monken was upset and told Picouto that he was going to have to go work in the Pit. Picouto told Monken that he did not think he could work in the Pit because he would have to use a step stool, would have trouble lifting the air tool because his right shoulder is swollen all the time, and had already been cross trained. Id, ¶ 52. Monken yelled at Picouto, causing Picouto to report Monken's threats and hostility to Kahl (Offline Production Supervisor). Id, ¶¶ 57-58. Shortly thereafter, a meeting took place between Picouto, Kahl, Kelsey, Benjamin Carothers ("Carothers") (union shop steward), and Monken. 13 Id, ¶ 60.
Following that meeting, Picouto went to see Rasmussen (Freightliner's occupational nurse), who told him to talk to LaRochelle or to Nancy Sheleretis ("Sheleretis"), who worked as Freightliner's Labor Relations Specialist. Id, ¶ 61. Picouto was off work August 3-15, 2006, when he was admitted to the hospital for acute stress reaction. Id, ¶ 62.
When Picouto returned to work on August 16, 2006, Monken falsely reported to Kelsey and the Offline Manager, Geoffrey Jansen ("Jansen"),  [*25] that Picouto had skipped the shift meeting and did not want to work in the Pit. Kelsey threatened to send Picouto home. When Jansen later asked Picouto why he did not want to work in the Pit, Picouto replied that Monken made obscene gestures at him and was trying to send him into the Pit to punish him for reporting the way Monken was treating him. He also told Jansen about his previous injury to his right shoulder and elbow, and Jansen responded that he would go to the nurse's station and ask for a copy of the doctor's accommodation. Id, ¶ 63.
After Jansen confirmed from Rasmussen that Picouto had no medical restrictions on file, he sent an email to Kelsey and Kahl instructing them to: (1) "Let [Picouto] know what he is cross training on, why he is cross training and for how long;" (2) if Picouto refused to cross train as instructed, either (a) "send him to the nurse's station if [Rasmussen] is still here" or (b) "send him home and tell him to call the nurses station the next day;" and (3) "Do not argue with [Picouto]. I have already clearly explained to him what will happen if he refuses to work. Just make sure you have a shop steward present." Amended Jansen Decl., ¶¶ 6-9, 12, Ex.  [*26] 1, p. 2.
Shortly thereafter, Kelsey instructed Picouto to go work in the Pit. Id; Picouto Decl, ¶ 63. Picouto reiterated that he had previous injuries to his right shoulder and elbow. Kelsey responded by yelling that if Picouto did not work in the Pit, he would fire him, and then told him to go to the nurse's station. Steffenson told Picouto to go see his doctor and get his medical condition updated and said that Kelsey had said that he was sending Picouto home because he was stressed out. Picouto Decl., ¶ 63.
When he left work on August 16, 2006, Picouto found a note attached to his car that said "Fuck You, go back to Cuba." Id and Ex. 13, p. 4. Picouto gave the note to Sheleritis the following day, August 17. Sheleretis showed the note to LaRochelle and then called a meeting that same day with Picouto and Rouse (union shop steward). Id, ¶¶ 65-66. During that meeting, Picouto described the problems he was having with Monken. Id, ¶ 66. Sheleretis said she would investigate, which she did. Id, ¶ 66; Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 4.
Picouto was out on medical leave August 18-31, 2006. 14 Picouto Decl., ¶ 69. During that time, Picouto sent Freightliner a letter describing Monken's behavior, noting  [*27] his previous complaints to his supervisor, and attaching a copy of the note to that letter. Id, Ex. 13. When he returned to work on September 1, 2006, LaRochelle held a meeting with Picouto, Rouse (union shop steward), Kear (union business representative), and Picouto's then-supervisor, Geoff Jansen (Offline Manager). At the conclusion of that meeting, LaRochelle informed Picouto that he was transferring him from Chain 2 to Chain 3 while he conducted an investigation. Picouto Decl, ¶ 71.
Sheleretis was on vacation in late August and early September 2006. During her absence, Freightliner's corporate office contacted LaRochelle and notified him of a letter Picouto sent regarding Monken. Sheleretis Depo., pp. 37-39. Shortly thereafter, Freightliner's HR Department and the union initiated a joint investigation of Picouto's complaints. Sheleretis and a union shop steward jointly interviewed five of Picouto's coworkers. Sheleretis  [*28] Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B. The investigation was "inconclusive," revealing employees who corroborated Monken's use of profanity, but not Picouto's other concerns or allegations. Id, ¶ 6; Sheleretis Depo., pp. 54-55, 57. Sheleretis asked the union steward to ask Monken to "keep it down a bit" and tone down his "loud language and swearing." Sheleretis Depo., pp. 57, 59. The union steward and Kear both spoke to Monken "at length about the complaints from offline employees about his demeanor, and the nature of his remarks to coworkers," making it "very clear . . . that he had to be professional, couldn't use any foul language, couldn't do anything but show respect to his coworkers." Kear Depo., pp. 42-43.
On September 11, 2006, Monken told Sheleretis he was upset with the union and feeling intimidated by it. Sheleretis Depo., pp. 54-55, 57, 59-60. He had apparently been told he "needed to straighten up, and watch what he was saying to people" and felt that his job was in jeopardy. Id, p. 55. Within a few days, Liday (Picouto's former Team Leader on Chain 1) "heard through the grapevine" that Kear was siding with Picouto and not giving Monken a "fair shake." Liday Depo., p. 21. On the evening of  [*29] September 14, Liday sent an email to Kear, Kelsey, and Sheleretis describing his difficulties with Picouto when he worked on Chain 1, stating that Monken was a hard worker whom he respected, and opining that "everyone should be given a fair shake in life." Picouto Decl., Ex. 14. A few hours later, Liday sent an email to Kelsey, describing an incident earlier in the shift in which he alleged that Picouto left his work area on Chain 2 without the permission of his supervisor, and when challenged by Liday, told him to shut up and that he was not in charge of him. Id, Ex. 27. Picouto contends that the conversation never happened and that Liday was sent to Chain 3 by Kelsey to harass him. Id, ¶ 77.

I. Continuing Harassment on Chain 3
Chains 2 and 3 are approximately 25 to 30 feet apart from one another inside the PTMP. After Picouto's transfer to Chain 3, his job assignment in "fairing" 15 was only a few meters away from his previous job on Chain 2. The fairing work required Picouto to bend over and get under the truck to tie U-bolts onto the truck and caused his knees to hurt. Id, ¶ 73. Monken continued to approach Picouto, laughing at him and taunting him that he (Monken) was "going to  [*30] see you in the pit" or was "going to send you to Cuba." Id, ¶¶ 73-74, 76, 78-79.
On September 25, 2006, Picouto told Kelsey that Monken was continuing to approach him on Chain 3 and mock him. Id, ¶ 80. Kelsey told Picouto he supported Monken and was taking Picouto off of fairing and sending him into the Pit. Id. Picouto told Kelsey that he was too short, had trouble lifting his right arm above his head and holding a torque wrench. However, he never refused to work in the Pit. Instead, Kelsey and Rasmussen sent Picouto home to go see a doctor. Id, ¶ 81, Ex. 15.
Picouto's doctor took him off work on medical leave from September 26 until October 5, 2006. Id, ¶¶ 81-82. By letter dated September 26, 2006, Picouto notified Freightliner that Monken was continuing to harass him even though Picouto had been transferred to Chain 3, including telling him he was "going to see [Picouto] in the pit" despite the fact that is not his regular job, and he would have trouble working in the Pit due to his short stature and previous injury to his right arm. Id, ¶ 83, Ex. 15.
A few days later, on September 28, 2006, Picouto gave  [*31] Rasmussen a letter from his doctor stating that Picouto should "return to a position where he does not have to climb up and down a ladder or stool" and was suffering on the job harassment by another employee which had resulted in "worsening of his chronic but otherwise stable depression." Id, ¶¶ 84-85, Ex. 16. Picouto asked Rasmussen when he could return to work and Rasmussen responded that she would check with HR and let him know. Id, ¶ 85. However, no one from Freightliner ever asked Picouto what he needed to do in order to return to work. Id.
Rasmussen sought the input of LaRochelle, Sheleretis, and Steffenson. She told them it appeared that Picouto was then performing a job with many of the same essential functions as the job in the Pit and was "physically able to do the job in the pit." Id, Ex. 17, p. 1. She suggested that Freightliner could:
get a couple of formal [job analyses] to document the essential functions of jobs he will do and compare those to the essential functions of the job he is refusing to do [working in the Pit] or take him out of the cross training schedule or terminate him for refusing to do the job he was assigned or transfer him to an area where he can cross  [*32] train and rotate or . . . ?
Id, Ex. 17, pp. 1-2.
Rasmussen planned to refer Picouto to LaRochelle unless she heard otherwise. Id, Ex. 17, p. 2.
On October 5, 2006, Picouto reported to Rouse that Monken was continuing to harass him. Rouse advised Picouto to talk to LaRochelle, which Picouto did. However, LaRochelle did not do anything. Id, ¶ 86.
From November 28 until December 3, 2006, Picouto was on medical leave for lower back strain. Id, ¶ 89, Ex. 19. On December 1, 2006, Freightliner issued a Violation of Reporting Requirements letter to Picouto, claiming that he failed to request a medical leave of absence for leave taken November 28 through December 1, 2006. Id, ¶ 91, Ex. 20. The letter noted that absences in excess of three days required contact with the nurse to request medical leave and medical documentation to support each day of absence, as well as contact with the nurse during each week of medical leave. Id.
When Picouto returned to work in December 2006, he had a new Offline supervisor, Bart Spencer ("Spencer"). 16 Shortly thereafter, on January 26, 2007, Freightliner notified its employees of an impending layoff that would take place on March 30, 2007, and would include all  [*33] members of IAM Local 1005 hired on or after January 31, 1994. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., Ex. G.
On unknown dates between December 2006 and March 11, 2007 Picouto thrice complained to Spencer that Monken was continuing to harass him. Picouto Decl., ¶ 93. From February 16 until March 5, 2007, Picouto was off work with sinusitis and pneumonia. Id, Ex. 28. A week after returning to work, on March 12, 2007, Picouto again reported Monken's harassment to Spencer. Id, ¶ 93. The same day, Spencer issued a written verbal warning to Picouto for missing too much work. Id, Ex. 21.
On March 13, 2007, Kelsey (Swing Shift Offline Supervisor) escorted Picouto to the nurse's station. Picouto's back was hurting from the bending over and standing required by his job in fairing. Steffenson iced Picouto's back for 20 minutes and gave him ibuprofen. Id, ¶ 94. Picouto was off work March 14-19, 2007 with "acute stress reaction" and again March 26-29, 2007, due to stress. Id, ¶¶ 95-96, Exs. 23-24.

IV. Final Layoff, Call Back, and Refusal to Reinstate

A. March 2007 Layoff
On March 30, 2007, in accordance with the January 26,  [*34] 2007 layoff notice (Supp. Sheleretis Decl., Ex. G), Freightliner laid off approximately 800 employees, including Picouto. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 22; Kear Depo., pp. 99-100, 105. Ten days later, on April 9, 2007, Picouto filed an administrative complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries ("BOLI"). Picouto Decl., ¶ 98.
Following the March 2007 layoff, Picouto began studying diesel mechanics at a local community college. Id, ¶ 99. Although he has attempted to return to work at Freightliner when workers were recalled, his efforts were rebuffed. 17 Id.

B. May 2008 Recall
In May 2008, Freightliner recalled 15 employees back to work, including Picouto. Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. D. All of the recall jobs  [*35] had start dates between May 12 and June 2, 2008, and all were in the "Prepaint" or "Final" Chassis units. Id, Ex. D. On May 8, 2008, Picouto met with Steffenson to discuss his return to work. Picouto Depo., pp. 364-66. Picouto completed a "Recalled From Layoff" form in which he responded "?" to the question "Do we need to consider any reasonable accommodation for you to return to your assigned area? If yes; list restrictions or disability." Supp. McCool Decl., Ex. B. Picouto answered the question that way because he did not know the difference between accommodation and restriction. Supp. Picouto Decl., ¶ 8; Picouto Depo., p. 366.
During their May 8, 2008 meeting, Picouto and Steffenson apparently discussed his need to document his restrictions with regard to his knee, elbow, and shoulder, and to provide a diagnosis and treatment plan. Supp. McCool Decl., Ex. B, p. 1. Some time the following week, Rasmussen spoke with Picouto and apparently agreed to extend his recall date to May 19, 2008. Picouto Decl., Ex. 25. She also told Picouto that he needed to provide documentation of his restrictions and that, if he could not do so by the May 19, 2008 extended recall date, then he needed to  [*36] contact her and she would set up a fitness for duty examination. Id. On May 16, 2008, Picouto's doctor notified Freightliner that she would see Picouto the last week of May 2008. Id.
On May 19, 2008, Picouto called Rasmussen to schedule follow up with her regarding his fitness for duty, but Rasmussen declined to schedule any follow up based upon her conclusion that the doctor's May 16, 2008 letter indicated that Picouto would have restrictions and "placement could not be determined until restrictions received and there was not time to do [a fitness for duty examination] for Monday [return to work]." Id, ¶ 101, Ex. 25.
On or about May 28, 2008, Picouto provided Freightliner with a letter from his doctor which noted his previous knee injury and right elbow and shoulder surgeries. Id, Ex. 26. The letter specified that Picouto could: (1) stand for a full 8-12 hour day; (2) had no limitations on walking; (3) had no limitation in range of motion in his right shoulder or arm and no pain there; and (4) may lift up to 20 pounds repetitively and 50 pounds occasionally as long as the lifting was not overhead, but that he: (a) is unable to kneel on his left knee; and (b) should avoid bending repetitively,  [*37] crouching, crawling, climbing up ladders more than one or two steps at a time. Id. The letter concluded by noting the emotional toll that Picouto was suffering due to harassment and that he required reassurance that he would not be harassed:
Just as significant was his emotional difficulties due to harassment by a fellow employee which led to extensive time lost from work and significant worsening of depression. He should be given reassurance that he will not be in an environment that will allow for any kind of harassment. His depression and emotional status are currently stable.
Id.
Freightliner reviewed the letter and determined — without asking for any further input from Picouto or his medical providers — that the identified restrictions precluded him from performing any of the 15 jobs available as a result of the recall. Sheleretis Decl., ¶¶ 10-11; Rasmussen Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. C.
In June 2008, Rasmussen spoke with Picouto several times, each time telling him that Freightliner did not have an available job that was within his medical restrictions. Rasmussen Decl., ¶ 8. Picouto filed this case on July 7, 2008.
Pursuant to Picouto's request in October 2008, Freightliner arranged for him to  [*38] undergo a physical capacity evaluation on December 15, 2008. LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 27. That evaluation found Picouto did not have the strength to perform tasks requiring pushing pulling, lifting, or carrying weights greater than 35 pounds. Id, Ex. F, p. 3. It also noted that he had a limited range of motion in his knee, and therefore recommended that he only occasionally perform activities requiring weight-bearing knee flexion. Id. It also found Picouto limited in squatting, crawling, and kneeling activities secondary to his left knee weakness and pain. Id. Five weeks later, on January 20, 2009, Freightliner laid off 170 employees, including the 15 employees who were originally recalled to work in May 2008. Id, ¶ 28. Since the May 2008 recall, no one from Freightliner has met with Picouto to discuss his physical condition or how he could be accommodated. Picouto Decl., ¶ 104.

FINDINGS
Picouto alleges that, following his recall to work in August 2004, he was subjected to a variety of harassing, discriminatory, and retaliatory conduct which is traceable to his gender, race, national origin, disability, taking of medical leave, or invocation of the workers' compensation system. Picouto was  [*39] laid off in March 2007, along with 800 other employees at the PTMP. As discussed in more detail below, no evidence supports the conclusion that Picouto's layoff in March 2007 was anything other than a cyclical, seniority-based layoff due to a downturn in truck orders. However, Picouto contends that he was subjected to harassment, discrimination, and retaliation prior to that layoff and that Freightliner again discriminated against him again by refusing to recall him to work in May 2008. Whatever the merits of those contentions, it is undisputed that, had he been recalled in May 2008, Picouto would have again been laid off in January 2009.
An exhaustive review of the record reveals that Freightliner is entitled to summary judgment against Picouto's Seventh Claim for wrongful termination and Eighth Claim for workers' compensation discrimination. Because those two claims raise more limited issues than the remaining six claims, the court discusses them first. The First through Sixth Claims turn on Picouto's contentions that the adverse actions he suffered were the result of discrimination or retaliation on the basis of either: (1) his race, national origin, or gender; (2) his disability;  [*40] or (3) his taking of medical leave protected under federal and state law. He also alleges that he was subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of his race, national origin, or gender. This court concludes that the only claims that survive summary judgment are the First and Second Claims alleging a hostile work environment; and (2) the Third and Fourth Claims alleging disability discrimination premised upon a failure to engage in the interactive process or otherwise accommodate Picouto's actual or perceived disability with regard to the May 2008 recall. Accordingly, defendant's motion should be denied against those claims and granted in all other respects.

I. Wrongful Termination (Seventh Claim)
The Seventh Claim for wrongful termination alleges that Freightliner terminated Picouto in retaliation for complaining about harassment and resisting discrimination and retaliation. First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 68-69. Generally, an employer may fire an at-will employee at any time and for any reason, unless doing so violates a contractual, statutory or constitutional requirement. Patton v. J.C. Penney Co., 301 Or 117, 120, 719 P2d 854, 856 (1986).
Oregon law recognizes two narrow exceptions  [*41] to this rule: when an employee is discharged (1) for exercising a job-related right of important interest; or (2) for complying with a public duty. Draper v. Astoria Sch. Dist. No. 1C, 995 F. Supp. 1122, 1127 (D Or 1998) (citations omitted). Resisting unlawful harassment and discrimination is an employment-related right that may serve as the basis for a wrongful discharge claim.
To succeed on a wrongful discharge claim, Picouto must show that he engaged in protected activity and that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the decision to terminate him. Holien v. Sears Roebuck and Co., 298 Or 76, 90 n5, 689 P2d 1292, 1299 n5 (1984). In other words, Picouto must establish a causal connection between the exercise of his employment-related right (resistance to unlawful harassment and discrimination or invocation of the workers' compensation system) and the adverse employment action. Pascoe v. Mentor Graphics Corp., 199 FSupp2d 1034, 1053 (D Or 2001).
This claim suffers from two fatal flaws. First, it is preempted by the adequate statutory remedies now available to him under ORS 659A.030. See Battan v. Allwest Underground, Inc., Civil No. 08-707-BR, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68735, 2008 WL 4191467 (D Or Sept. 5, 2008);  [*42] Melendez v. Morrow County Sch. Dist., Civil No. 07-875-AC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108299, 2009 WL 4015426 (D Or Nov. 19, 2009) (following Battan).
Second, even if Picouto could overcome that hurdle, no evidence establishes any causal connection between Picouto's resistance to or complaints of unlawful discrimination or retaliation and the March 2007 layoff. On January 26, 2007, Freightliner notified its employees of an impending layoff that would take place on March 30, 2007, and include all members of IAM Local 1005 hired on or after January 31, 1994. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., Ex. G. In accordance with that notice, Picouto and approximately 800 employees were laid off two months later. Whether characterized as a layoff or a termination, 18 nothing in the record supports the conclusion that the March 30, 2007 action was in any way related to complaints by Picouto about alleged discrimination and harassment against him by Monken or any other Freightliner employee or supervisor, or his invocation of the workers' compensation system for his three on-the-job injuries. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that the layoff was due to a cyclical plant slowdown. Employees were chosen for layoff based on seniority in accordance  [*43] with the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement. Because nothing in the record supports the inference that the March 30, 2007 action by Freightliner was anything other than a legitimate plant-wide layoff, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against Picouto's Seventh Claim for wrongful termination.

II. Workers' Compensation Discrimination (Eighth Claim)
To establish a prima facie case of workers' compensation discrimination pursuant to ORS 659A.040, Picouto must adduce evidence that he: (1) invoked the workers' compensation system; (2) was discriminated against in the tenure, terms, or conditions of employment; and (3) was  [*44] discriminated against because he invoked the workers' compensation system. Williams v. Freightliner, LLC, 196 Ore. App. 83, 90, 100 P3d 1117, 1121 (2004). In order to satisfy the causation element of this claim, Picouto must show that "his protected activity was a 'factor that made a difference' in defendant's decision to modify or terminate his employment." Kotelnikov v. Portland Habilitation Center, 545 FSupp2d 1137, 1139-40 (D Or 2008), quoting Dickison v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48077, 2007 WL 1959287 *3 (D Or July 2, 2007). The difficulty here is the temporal disconnect between Picouto's invocation of the workers' compensation system and the alleged discrimination.
Picouto filed three workers' compensation claims: the first in 1995 relating to an injury on August 16, 1995, to his right upper extremity and elbow (Picouto Decl., ¶ 6); a second in 1998 relating to a February 9, 1998 injury to his right shoulder (id, ¶ 8); and a third in 2001 relating to a March 28, 2001 injury to his left knee (id, ¶ 15). While out due to the 2001 injury, Picouto was laid off due to a reduction in truck orders at the PTMP. Id, ¶ 17. In mid-August 2002, while Picouto was still on layoff status, he was released  [*45] for regular work. Id, ¶ 18. Two days later, on August 19, 2002, Freightliner issued a notice of closure of Picouto's workers' compensation claim, rating him as having a 10% permanent partial disability to his left knee. Id.
Over two years later, on August 30, 2004, Freightliner recalled Picouto to work. Id, ¶ 24. The mistreatment he allegedly endured between early 2005 and mid-2008 forms the basis of his discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims in this case. Nearly four years passed between 2001 when Picouto last filed a workers' compensation claim and the alleged adverse actions which form the basis of his various claims. Picouto maintains that on February 10, 2006, he notified both his then-supervisor (Looney) and Freightliner management that he had suffered prior on-the-job injuries to his right shoulder and left knee and had received permanent disability awards for each injury. Id, ¶ 35. Based on that and subsequent communications regarding his prior workers' compensation claims, Picouto contends that he may maintain a claim for workers' compensation discrimination.
By filing workers' compensation claims in 1995, 1998, and 2001, Picouto "invoked or utilized the procedures  [*46] provided for in ORS chapter 656" for purposes of ORS 659A.040(1). However the same cannot be said of Picouto's notice — nearly five years later — to Freightliner of those earlier claims. Invoking or utilizing "procedures" provided in Oregon's workers' compensation laws necessarily means something more than disclosing that the procedures were previously invoked in earlier claims. While Picouto can establish that he notified his supervisors of his earlier claims, he has established no link between his pre-2002 invocations of the workers' compensation procedures and the alleged discrimination that forms the basis of his claims here. Picouto's pre-2002 claims are simply too far removed in time to have made any legally significant difference in the alleged discriminatory acts between 2005 and 2008. In sum, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the Eighth Claim for workers' compensation discrimination.

III. First Through Sixth Claims

A. Applicable Time Limitations
Picouto alleges six additional claims that Freightliner discriminated or retaliated against him for a variety of reasons. Four of these claims are brought under federal and state employment laws, including Title  [*47] VII, the ADA, and ORS Chapter 659A. The First Claim alleges discrimination under Title VII premised both on disparate treatment and a hostile work environment on the basis of race, national origin, and gender, as well as retaliation for his opposition to race discrimination. The Second Claim alleges retaliation for opposing race discrimination under ORS Chapter 659A. The Third and Fourth Claims allege disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and state law. In short, those claims turn on Picouto's assertion that he is in a protected class or took protected activity and suffered adverse employment actions as a consequence.
The Fifth and Sixth Claims, brought under the FMLA and OFLA, similarly allege that Freightliner took adverse employment actions against Picouto which interfered with his right to take medical leave protected under federal and state law. In that sense, the Fifth and Sixth Claims parallel the specifications of Picouto's discrimination claims because they rely on allegations that he engaged in protected conduct by applying for and taking medical leave and suffered adverse employment actions as a consequence.
These claims span the time period after Monken became  [*48] Picouto's supervisor in early 2005 through Freightliner's May 2008 refusal to reinstate him. Picouto relates a hodge-podge of events that took place over the nearly three years between his August 30, 2004 recall from layoff and his March 30, 2007 layoff, all which he apparently asserts constitute adverse employment actions causally tied to unlawful discrimination or interference with protected medical leave. Picouto relies heavily on the temporal proximity between various events. However, several of the alleged adverse employment actions are time-barred. In order to better frame Picouto's remaining claims, this court first discusses the applicable time limitations.
Ten days after he was laid off, on April 9, 2007, Picouto filed a charge of discrimination with the BOLI. Just over a year later, on July 7, 2008, Picouto filed his case in this court. When a charge of discrimination is initially filed with a state agency such as BOLI, both Title VII and the ADA impose a 300-day time limit. Draper v. Coeur Rochester, Inc., 147 F3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir 1998) (applying 300-day limitation to Title VII claim); Douglas v. California Dept. of Youth Authority, 271 F.3d 812, 823 n.12 (9th Cir 2001)  [*49] (applying 300-day limitation to ADA claim); 42 USC § 2000e-5(a), (e)(1). Oregon law is slightly more generous and imposes a one-year statute of limitations on all of Picouto's discrimination claims. ORS 659A.875, 659A.885 (incorporating one-year limitation for claims brought under ORS 659A.030 (race, sex, and national origin) 659A.103 to 659A.145 (disability), and 659A.150 to 659A.186 (OFLA)). Only Picouto's FMLA claim which provides a longer statute of limitations of two years. 19 29 USC § 2617(c). While some of the conduct alleged to have taken place outside these time periods may provide relevant background information, they will not suffice to independently support Picouto's claims.

B. FMLA and OFLA Claims (Fifth and Sixth Claims)
As noted above, the Fifth and Sixth Claims allege FMLA and OFLA violations that to some extent parallel the types of violations alleged in his discrimination and retaliation claims. Because these claims address a narrower range of allegedly improper conduct, they are addressed first.
At the outset, it is worth noting that Freightliner contends that it never denied Picouto any protected medical leave, and Picouto has submitted no evidence to counter that assertion. Although he does point to his suspension on August 16-17, 2006, Picouto has failed to submit evidence that he should have been granted leave on that date or that he was denied leave or listed as suspended on any other date when he was out on documented medical leave. Instead, Picouto's FMLA and OFLA claims assert that Freightliner took a variety of other adverse actions against him in retaliation for using medical leave, and that, as a result, Freightliner is strictly liable for FMLA and OFLA violations.
As discussed below,  [*51] the bulk of Picouto's FMLA and OFLA claims fail either because the alleged adverse actions reflect nothing more than permissible employer tracking of leave and monitoring of reporting requirements or because Picouto has failed to show any prejudice flowing from the alleged adverse actions. Accordingly, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the Fifth and Sixth Claims.

1. Prima Facie case of Interference
The Fifth and Sixth Claims allege that Freightliner retaliated and discriminated against Picouto by taking adverse actions against him, including issuing warnings to him for missing work and refusing to reinstate him to employment after his release to work. The Ninth Circuit recognizes three types of claims under the FMLA 20: (1) interference claims, when an employer interferes with an employee's exercise of rights under the FMLA, 29 USC § 2615(a)(1); (2) retaliation claims, when an employer discriminates against an employee for instituting or participating in proceedings or inquiries under FMLA, 29 USC § 2615(b); and (3) discrimination claims, when an employer discriminates against an employee for opposing any practice prohibited by the FMLA, 29 USC § 2615(a)(2). Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc., 259 F3d 1112, 1124 (9th Cir 2001).  [*52] Although styled as "retaliation" claims, Picouto's Fifth and Sixth Claims are more properly analyzed as claims for "interference" with his FMLA rights because they rely on allegations of chilling Picouto's statutory right to take FMLA leave and denying his right to be reinstated at the end of FMLA leave (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 57-58, 64-65). See Liu v. Amway Corp., 347 F3d 1125, 1135 (9th Cir 2003); Bachelder, 259 F3d at 1124.
It is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under" the FMLA. 29 USC § 2615(a)(1). To establish an interference claim under the FMLA, Picouto must show that: (1) he exercised his rights under the FMLA; 21 (2) Freightliner subsequently engaged in conduct that tended to chill the exercise of his FMLA rights; and (3) Freightliner's conduct was motivated by the exercise of his FMLA rights. Bachelder, 259 F3d at 1124-26. In addition, Picouto must show that the interference caused prejudice: "the FMLA's remedial scheme . . . requires an employee to prove  [*53] prejudice as a result of an employer's noncompliance." Downey v. Strain, 510 F3d 534, 540 (5th Cir 2007), citing Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002); see also Stewart v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., Civil No. 04-428-HU, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42371, 2005 WL 545359, at *11 (D Or March 7, 2005) (same). Picouto may make a showing of prejudice by establishing that the FMLA violation "rendered him unable to exercise [his FMLA rights] in a meaningful way, thereby causing injury." Conoshenti v. Public Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F3d 135, 143 (3rd Cir 2004).

2. Disciplinary Letters
Picouto identifies several letters as adverse actions taken in response to his use of protected leave. However, several of those letters are outside of the FMLA's statute of limitations. 22 The remaining three  [*54] letters reflect nothing more than routine and permissible follow-up regarding the use of leave and compliance with Freightliner's reporting requirements. These include an April 12, 2006 Medical Leave "Pattern" letter from Looney (Production Supervisor) (Picouto Decl., ¶ 43, Ex. 8; Picouto Depo., pp. 299-302), a December 1, 2006 letter from LaRochelle (HR Manager), alleging a violation of the reporting requirements for leave taken from November 28 to December 1, 2006 (Picouto Decl., ¶ 91, Ex. 20), and a March 12, 2007 written Verbal Warning from for missing too much work (Picouto Decl., ¶ 93, Ex. 21).
The "Pattern" letter is automatically issued when an employee takes three non-industrial medical leaves within a six month period. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 9; see also Picouto Depo., pp. 299-300. Picouto took leave three times in the two months prior to issuance of the April 12, 2006 "Pattern" letter. 23 "Pattern" letters are not intended to cover absences protected by the FMLA or the OFLA, and if the leave is later determined to be covered, the letters are voided. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 9. The April 12, 2006 letter is the only "Pattern" letter Picouto received. Id. That letter references eight medical leave days and presumably was issued in connection with the leave taken for a toothache (three days: February 22-24) and for unknown reasons (five days: March 20-24). Nothing in the record indicates that the letter related to protected leave under the FMLA or OFLA. Picouto fails to identify any prejudice to him that flowed from the issuance of this  [*56] letter and testified that the such letters are issued to "every employee" when the "employee takes too many absence[s] for some reason." Picouto Depo., p. 300. Thus, the April 12, 2006 "Pattern" letter does not support Picouto's FMLA or OFLA interference claims.
The December 1, 2006 letter similarly provides no traction for Picouto's FMLA or OFLA claims. As explained by the parties at oral argument and by Spencer (Picouto's supervisor), these types of letters are automatically generated by Freightliner's leave-tracking program and are routinely issued to employees who are absent without requesting a medical leave of absence. See Spencer Depo., pp. 41-42. The letters notify employees of the dates missed and remind them of the reporting requirements for absences. Picouto Decl., Ex. 20. Picouto notes that this letter came immediately after he took medical leave and relates to a period for which he had completed a form for a medical leave of absence. Id, Ex. 19, p. 3.  [*57] However, even assuming that Picouto in fact followed the reporting requirements, he does not allege any adverse consequences from the letter which approved his medical leave. Consequently, Picouto has failed to establish any prejudice flowing from this letter sufficient to support his interference claims.
Similarly, the March 12, 2007 letter is a type of letter automatically generated when an employee has more than two unexcused absences in a 90-day period. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 10. Picouto was on leave from February 16 until March 5, 2007, with pneumonia and sinusitis, but apparently did not provide the supporting documentation until February 27 or 28, 2007. Picouto Decl., ¶ 92, Ex. 28, pp. 3-4. Picouto refused to sign the letter and notes that it was issued the same day that he made his fourth complaint to Spencer about Monken's harassing conduct. However, Picouto has submitted nothing to counter Freightliner's contention that the letter was automatically generated or to indicate any negative consequences as a result. Again, the most that can be gleaned from the record with respect to this letter is that it is routine followup by Freightliner's HR Department on undocumented leave.
Thus,  [*58] none of the letters falling within the FMLA's statute of limitations constitute adverse actions.

3. Other Disciplinary Actions
Picouto also alleges that his August 16, 2006 assignment to work in the Pit, his August 17, 2006 suspension (effective at punch-out on August 16), and his September 1, 2006 reassignment from Chain 2 to Chain 3 were taken against him for his use of medical leave and are sufficient — due primarily to their proximity in time to his taking of medical leave — to withstand Freightliner's motion against his FMLA and OFLA claims. For the reasons below, these contentions lack merit.

a. Assignment to the Pit
The record reveals that the ignition point between Picouto, Monken, and his Freightliner supervisors was his assignment to work in the Pit in August 2006. Picouto contends that Monken assigned him to work in the Pit on August 2, 2006, in order to punish him for asking another Team Leader for assistance. He describes in detail the events leading up to his assignment to work in the Pit, the meetings that followed, his time off work for most of August 2006, and his eventual return to work on September 1, 2006, and transfer to work on Chain 3 that same day following a meeting  [*59] with Freightliner management. Picouto Decl., ¶¶ 55-71. Picouto contends that he had previously undergone cross-training in the Pit, that Monken never mentioned cross-training when he assigned him to work in the Pit, and that there was no policy about cross-training in the Offline area until he complained about Monken's threat to put him in the Pit. Picouto Decl., ¶ 57; McCauley Decl., ¶ 22. From this evidence, Picouto contends that it may be inferred that cross-training was not really the motivation for assigning him to work in the Pit. Picouto Decl., ¶ 57.
Assuming that Freightliner considered Picouto's use of leave as a negative factor in assigning him to work in the Pit, Picouto's FMLA and OFLA claims premised upon that assignment nevertheless fail. Quite simply, the record indisputably reveals that Picouto never actually worked in the Pit at any time between Monken's August 2, 2006 demand that he do so and his layoff some seven months later. Id, ¶ 24; Picouto Depo., p. 246. After conducting a meeting to attempt to resolve the August 2, 2006 conflict, Picouto's supervisors simply asked Picouto and Monken to finish their shifts. The next two times Picouto objected to working in the  [*60] Pit (August 16 and September 25, 2006), his supervisors escorted him to the nurse's station to determine whether he had medical restrictions on file that precluded him from doing so. Finding no such restrictions, they sent Picouto home to go to the doctor and acquire updated medical information to support his purported medical restrictions. Picouto Decl., ¶¶ 57-61; Rasmussen Decl., ¶ 4; Kelsey Decl., ¶¶ 7-9. In short, although Picouto was ordered to work in the Pit several times in August and September 2006, he never worked in the Pit on those dates or any date thereafter.
Similarly, the attempted assignment fails to establish prejudice by establishing a subsequent inability by Picouto to exercise his FMLA rights in a meaningful way. Picouto took two weeks of leave (August 18-31, 2006) only two days after the August 16, 2006 assignment to work in the Pit, then took more than seven weeks (52 days) of additional leave over the ensuing seven months leading up to the layoff. Freightliner continued to monitor Picouto's use of leave, updating its leave tracking records as it received notes from his medical providers. See Bouman-Steagall Decl., Ex. K, pp. 20-34. There is simply no evidence  [*61] from which it can be inferred that Picouto suffered a chilling of his right to take medical leave. As a result, Picouto is precluded from relying on the August 16, 2006 effort to require him to work in the Pit as an action that will support an FMLA or OFLA claim.

b. August 17, 2006 Suspension
Next, Picouto contends that he was suspended from work on August 17, 2006, just one day after returning from two weeks of medical leave. Picouto Decl., ¶ 68. The email reflecting that action indicates that Freightliner suspended Picouto at his punch-out time on August 16, 2006. Id, Ex. 12. Picouto was unaware of this purported suspension until discovery in this lawsuit. Id, ¶ 68. He contends that he was falsely accused of not attending a shift meeting and refusing to work in the Pit, then sent home by Kelsey who thought he was "stressed out." Id, ¶ 63. In contrast, Freightliner contends that Picouto was sent home to go to the doctor and obtain medical documentation to support the restrictions that allegedly precluded him from working in the Pit. Whatever the merits of these contentions, nothing in the record indicates that the suspension had any chilling effect on Picouto's use of protected medical  [*62] leave. Indeed, it is difficult to see how an action about which Picouto was unaware could have had any affect on him at all. As just discussed, Picouto was out on leave about 25% of the remaining work weeks through the March 30, 2007 layoff. Picouto has offered nothing to contradict Freightliner's assertion that it never denied any of his requests for protected leave (LaRochelle Decl., ¶ 30). Therefore, he has failed to meet his burden of offering evidence of prejudice.

c. September 1, 2006 Transfer to Chain 3
Picouto identifies two interplant transfers as adverse employment actions. Freightliner transferred Picouto from Chain 2 to Chain 3 on September 1, 2006, and then transferred him to Finish Cab on or about March 15, 2007. The first of those transfers followed on the heels of Picouto's use of two weeks of medical leave August 8-31, 2006. However, the record reveals that the September 1, 2006 transfer to Chain 3 was in direct response to Picouto's complaints about Monken and request for such a transfer. Freightliner assigned Picouto to a different Team Leader for the express purpose of putting some distance between him and Monken while Freightliner investigated his complaints. Picouto  [*63] Decl., ¶ 71; LaRochelle Depo., pp. 75-76. Picouto agreed to the transfer to Chain 3 which did not result in any different job responsibilities. Instead it simply involved Picouto working on an adjacent Offline chain under a different Team Leader but the same supervisor. LaRochelle Depo., pp. 75-76; Kelsey Depo., pp. 83-84. Under these circumstances, the inference of causation created by the coincidental timing of Picouto's taking of medical leave and his transfer upon his return to work is broken. Moreover, given that the only change (other than being further away from Monken) was physically shifting his location 30 feet, and given the lack of evidence that Freightliner ever denied Picouto protected leave, Picouto has failed to establish any prejudice resulting from the transfer to Chain 3. Accordingly, that transfer is an insufficient basis on which Picouto may pursue his FMLA or OFLA claims.

d. March 30, 2007 Layoff
Picouto also contends that Freightliner interfered with his FMLA rights by laying him off on March 30, 2007. That layoff occurred immediately after Picouto took medical leave from March 14-19 and 26-29, 2007. However, Freightliner notified its employees of the layoff two  [*64] months previously on January 26, 2007. Supp. Sheleretis Decl., Ex. G. Because Freightliner would not have known at that time that Picouto would take leave in February or March 2007, the timing between Picouto's use of medical leave and his layoff is more attenuated than Picouto indicates. Moreover, Picouto has submitted nothing to indicate that the March 30, 2007 layoff was anything other than a cyclical, seniority-based layoff due to a reduction in truck orders, much less that it was specifically directed at Picouto for his use of medical leave. While the layoff certainly was prejudicial to Picouto, there is simply no evidence or any permissible inference that can be drawn from the available evidence that the layoff was related to Picouto's use of medical leave.

e. Refusal to Recall
Finally, Picouto contends that Freightliner failed to recall him to work in May 2008. By that time, over a year had passed since Picouto's use of medical leave because he was on layoff status. Picouto offers nothing other than his own speculation to support a causal connection between his use of medical leave prior to his layoff and Freightliner's refusal to return him to work in 2008. Because he notified  [*65] Freightliner of his medical restrictions in May 2008 and because Freightliner was aware that those restrictions had caused him to previously use a substantial amount of medical leave, he concludes that its refusal to recall him was based on retaliation for his prior use of medical leave.
On or about May 28, 2008, Picouto's doctor sent Freightliner a letter documenting his current medical condition, outlining the physical activities which Picouto should avoid, and advising Freightliner that Picouto "should be given reassurance that he will not be in an environment that will allow for any kind of harassment." Picouto Decl., Ex. 26. In short, the letter outlines the physical activities and work conditions Picouto needed to avoid. Again, while the refusal to recall him certainly was prejudicial, there is simply no evidence or any permissible inference that can be drawn from the available evidence that the refusal to recall Picouto was related to his prior use of medical leave over a year earlier, as opposed to his current medical condition.
For the above reasons, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the Fifth and Sixth Claims alleging an FMLA and an OFLA violation.

C. Disability  [*66] Discrimination (Third and Fourth Claims)
The Third and Fourth Claims allege that Freightliner violated both the ADA and Oregon disability discrimination statutes by refusing to accommodate his disability, terminating him, and retaliating against him due to his disability. Freightliner raises four arguments against these claims: (1) Picouto cannot establish that he has an actual "disability" for purposes of the ADA or Oregon disability discrimination statutes; (2) Freightliner's HR Department and supervisory employees did not "regard" Picouto as disabled; (3) Picouto's layoff in March 2007 is not causally connected to his alleged disability; and (4) Freightliner did not fail to engage in an interactive process or otherwise accommodate Picouto with regard to working in the Pit or reinstating him to work in May 2008. As discussed below, Freightliner should be denied summary judgment against these claims, except as to the March 2007 layoff and a failure to engage in the interactive process and/or accommodate Picouto with regard to working in the Pit.

1. Legal Standard
The ADA "outlaws adverse employment decisions motivated, even in part, by animus based on a plaintiff's disability or request  [*67] for an accommodation." Head v. Glacier Nw. Inc., 413 F3d 1053, 1065 (9th Cir 2005). In order to prevail on his ADA claim a plaintiff must show that he is precluded from engaging in an entire class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes: "[O]ne must be precluded from more than one type of job, a specialized job, or a particular job of choice. If jobs utilizing an individual's skills (but perhaps not his or her unique talents) are available, one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs. Similarly, if a host of different types of jobs are available, one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs." Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 493, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999).
The standard for establishing a prima facie case under the Oregon disability statutes is the same as under the analogous ADA provision. See Wheeler v. Marathon Printing, Inc., 157 Or App 290, 301 n6, 974 P2d 207, 213 n6 (1998) (noting that the Oregon statutory scheme regarding workplace discrimination against disabled persons "contain[s] language significantly similar to the ADA"); Henderson v. Jantzen, Inc., 79 Or App 654, 656-657, 719 P2d 1322 (1986); see also ORS 659A.139 (ORS 659A.112 to 659A.139 "shall be  [*68] construed to the extent possible in a manner that is consistent with any similar provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended."). Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, this court will interpret ORS 659A.112-659A.139 consistently with the ADA.

2. Actual "Disability"
First, Freightliner argues that Picouto cannot prevail on the Third or Fourth Claims because he cannot establish that he suffered from a "disability" which triggers protection under the ADA or ORS 659A.103-.142. In response to Freightliner's motion, Picouto submitted the Declaration of Mary D'Autremont (docket #80), a certified rehabilitation counselor. D'Autremont visited the PTMP on July 2, 2009, and reviewed Picouto's medical and workers' compensation records and December 15, 2008 Physical Capacities Evaluation. Based on that review, D'Autremont opined that: (1) the job in the Pit, without modifications, would not be suitable for Picouto; (2) Picouto "has a disability in that he has a physical condition that is permanent and substantially interferes with . . . the major life activity of working" which "would affect his ability in a broad range of jobs and classes of jobs and classes of occupations  [*69] [making him] substantially impaired in holding production jobs with a wide variety of employers," as well as in "a wide variety of job classifications." D'Autremont Decl., ¶¶ 13-16. D'Autremont also opined that Freightliner could accommodate Picouto in several ways, including assigning him to the Finish Cab area or installing or modifying work equipment and tools. Id, ¶¶ 20-21.
Freightliner objected to D'Autremont's testimony on a number of grounds. However, as set forth in a separate Order addressing Freightliner's motion to strike that testimony, this court rejects those objections and will consider D'Autremont's testimony. That testimony is sufficient for Picouto to avoid summary judgment as to whether he suffered from a "disability" protected by federal and state disability discrimination laws. Accordingly, this is not a basis on which Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the Third and Fourth Claims.

3. Perceived or "Regarded As" Disabled
Picouto also alleges that he was "regarded as" disabled. Freightliner cites snippets of testimony by Freightliner employees that "to the best of [their] knowledge, he doesn't have a disability," (LaRochelle Depo., p. 62) and that  [*70] they "did not know and do not believe that Mr. Picouto is disabled." LaRochelle Decl, ¶ 41; Sheleretis Decl., ¶ 12; Rasmussen Decl., ¶ 9; Amended Kelsey Decl., ¶ 17. Based on that testimony, Freightliner contends that it is entitled to summary judgment against any "regarded as" disabled claim.
Freightliner's argument conflates the available evidence and the conclusions drawn by its own employees with the necessity for a factual determination by a jury on the issue of whether Freightliner "regarded" Picouto as disabled. There is evidence that Freightliner's HR Department was aware that Picouto had "a lot of restrictions." LaRochelle Depo., p. 62; see also Rasmussen Depo., pp. 53 (Picouto had "some limitations in his physical functioning"), 110-11 (did not believe Picouto's restrictions were temporary). In addition, Freightliner ordered job analyses of several of the positions they were considering having Picouto perform. Rasmussen Depo., pp. 33-36, 42-45, 47-48. Finally, by late September 2006, Picouto's doctor notified Freightliner that the combination of Picouto's "chronic but otherwise stable depression" and "harassment by another employee" had caused time lost from work and needed  [*71] to be "more seriously addressed." Picouto Decl., Ex. 16. The critical issue is how Freightliner's supervisory and HR Department employees perceived and reacted to Picouto's known limitations. If a factfinder believes their assertions that they did not regard Picouto as disabled or that they took no adverse actions against Picouto as a result of those limitations, then Freightliner will prevail on the "regarded as" disabled claims. However, given the available evidence of Picouto's limitations and Freightliner's knowledge thereof, that issue cannot be resolved on summary judgment.

4. March 2007 Layoff
Next, Freightliner argues that Picouto's layoff in March 2007 is not causally connected to his alleged disability and cannot form the basis of a disability discrimination claim. As discussed above, Freightliner notified its employees of the impending layoff on January 26, 2007. No evidence or any permissible inference can be drawn from the available evidence to support the conclusion that Freightliner included Picouto in the March 30, 2007 layoff due to an actual or perceived disability. Instead, all the evidence indicates that the March 30, 2007 layoff was a cyclical, seniority-based layoff  [*72] due to a reduction in truck orders. Accordingly, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the Third and Fourth Claims insofar as they are premised on an allegation that the March 30, 3007 layoff was related to Picouto's actual or perceived disability.

5. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process or Accommodate
Lastly, Freightliner seeks summary judgment against the Third and Fourth Claims due to insufficient evidence that it failed to engage in an interactive process and/or accommodate Picouto. The parties focus these arguments on two time periods, namely: (1) the fall of 2006 when Monken ordered Picouto to work in the Pit and Picouto provided Dr. Hungerford's September 28, 2006 letter (Picouto Decl., Ex. 16) to Freightliner; and (2) the spring of 2008 when Picouto contends he should have been recalled to work and provided Dr. Hungerford's May 28, 2008 letter (Picouto Decl., Ex. 26) to Freightliner.
Once an employee informs an employer of the need for an accommodation due to a medical condition, the employer is required to engage "in an interactive process with the employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F3d 1080 (9th Cir 2000)  [*73] (footnote omitted). That process requires: "(1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." Id (citation omitted). If the employer is responsible for the breakdown in the interactive process, it faces liability under the ADA. Id, citing Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F3d 1130, 1137 (7th Cir 1996).
As discussed in detail above, Picouto cannot rely on Freightliner's act of assigning him to work in the Pit as an adverse employment action for purposes of his medical leave claims because he never actually worked in the Pit any time between Monken's August 2, 2006 demand that he do so and his March 30, 2007 layoff. For the same reason, Picouto cannot rely on his assignment to work in the Pit as an adverse employment action supporting a disability discrimination claim.
Nor can he establish a failure to engage in an interactive process or accommodate his restrictions with respect to the assignment(s) to work in the Pit. Picouto acknowledges that he was asked to provide updated medical information on August  [*74] 16, 2006, following Kelsey's instruction that he work in the Pit. He was then off work for the remainder of August. About four weeks after returning to work, he was again told to work in the Pit and went off work on medical leave. A couple of days later, he provided Freightliner with his doctor's September 28, 2006 letter, which explained why the new job assignment to work in the Pit was "a set up for re-injury." Picouto Decl., Ex. 16. It is undisputed that Freightliner never assigned Picouto to work in the Pit following receipt of his doctor's September 28, 2006 letter. By ceasing to demand that Picouto work in the Pit, Freightliner fulfilled any duty it had to engage in an interactive process and/or accommodate Picouto that was triggered by Picouto's objection to working in the Pit and the September 28, 2006 doctor's letter. 24
This leaves Picouto's contention  [*75] that Freightliner failed to engage in an interactive process and provide a reasonable accommodation when he sought reinstatement in May 2008. Freightliner raises two arguments with regard to this issue. First, Freightliner again contends that Picouto was not disabled and notes that Dr. Hungerford's May 28, 2008 letter does not indicate that he was disabled. Again, Picouto has presented sufficient evidence of a disability to avoid summary judgment on this basis. Although Dr. Hungerford's letter does not explicitly use the term "disabled," it references a series of impairments causing limitations in Picouto's ability to perform certain work-related tasks. Freightliner's supervisory and HR Department employees now disavow any belief that Picouto is or was disabled, but Rasmussen's carefully worded letter of June 12, 2008, sent one month before Picouto filed this lawsuit, is couched in the language of the statutes concerning disability discrimination: "Job openings . . . will be evaluated as they become available to determine if the job falls within your restrictions or could be modified to accommodate your restrictions." Bouman-Stegall Decl., Ex. K, p. 42.
Against this backdrop, Freightliner  [*76] contends it met its obligation to engage in an interactive process by unilaterally deciding that there was "no job position open that would accommodate [Picouto's] restrictions." Id. Freightliner never performed an ADA analysis of the jobs that were available in 2008, did not ask Picouto whether he could perform any of the open jobs, did not ask him or his doctor whether the jobs could be modified so that he could perform them, and did not investigate the availability of any equipment which might allow Picouto to perform the open jobs. Rasmussen Depo., pp. 104-04, 107, 109. "The interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees. The shared goal is to identify an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively. Both sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process." Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir 2000) (footnote and citations omitted), vacated on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002). A factfinder could easily conclude that Freightliner failed to engage in the interactive process when  [*77] it unilaterally decided that no accommodation was possible to allow Picouto to perform any of the jobs open at the PTMP in May 2008. Moreover, at least some evidence in the record indicates that a reasonable accommodation might have allowed Picouto to return to work. D'Autremont Decl., ¶¶ 20-25. Accordingly, Freightliner's request for summary judgment against the Third and Fourth Claims on the basis that it did not fail to engage in the interactive process or accommodate Picouto at that time should be denied.

D. Race, National Origin, and Gender Discrimination (First and Second Claims)

1. Legal Standards
The First and Second Claims allege race, national origin, and gender discrimination under Title VII and ORS Chapter 659A. These claims are based on either the retaliation provision of Title VII (42 USC § 2000e-3, First Claim) or Oregon law (ORS 659A.030(1)(f), Second Claim). First Amended Complaint, pp. 8-9. The Second Claim alleges that the unlawful retaliation was based on Picouto's opposition to race discrimination, while the First Claim alleges that Freightliner retaliated against Picouto for "making  [*78] internal and external complaints of harassment, hostile work environment, and discrimination" as well as because of his "race-based complaints." Id, ¶¶ 36, 41. Fairly read, these claims allege that Picouto was subjected to discriminatory treatment and a hostile work environment based on his race, national origin, or gender, complained to Freightliner, and as a consequence suffered additional adverse employment actions.
A plaintiff must generally meet the same standards to prove a claim under ORS Chapter 659A as he must meet in order to prove a claim under Title VII. See Ahmed v. Mid-Columbia Med. Center, 673 FSupp2d 1194, 1206-07 (D Or 2009) (discrimination); Whitley v. City of Portland, 654 FSupp2d 1194, 1222-23 (D Or 2009) (retaliation); Delima v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 616 FSupp2d 1055, 1089-90 (D Or 2008) (hostile work environment). Based on those standards, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against the First and Second Claims, except to the extent those claims allege a hostile work environment.

2. Time Bar
In cases alleging claims based both on discrete acts of discriminatory treatment or retaliation and on an allegedly hostile work environment, this court must be careful  [*79] not to "blur to the point of oblivion the dichotomy between discrete acts and a hostile environment." Porter v. California Dept. of Corrections, 419 F3d 885, 892 (9th Cir 2005). The distinction is critical in determining whether any particular adverse action is time barred:
As the Supreme Court emphasized, "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." . . . Consequently, we refuse to mix recent discrete acts like tinder with the planks of ancient sexual advances and then, regardless of whatever it was that set the spark in the furnace, call the fire that ignites therefrom a hostile environment. If the flames of an allegedly hostile environment are to rise to the level of an actionable claim, they must do so based on the fuel of timely non-discrete acts.
Id at 893 (citations and footnote omitted).
As discussed above, Picouto alleges a multitude of adverse actions, some of which are discrete acts which occurred more than a year prior to the filing of his charge of discrimination with BOLI on April 9, 2007. Those "discrete acts still may be considered for purposes of placing non-discrete acts in the proper  [*80] context," and, therefore, provide important factual information in support of Picouto's hostile work environment claim. Id at 893 n4, citing Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002); see also Garcez v. Freightliner Corp., 188 Or App 397, 404, 72 P3d 78, 83 (2003) (citing Morgan). However, they are otherwise time-barred for purposes of the First and Second Claims.

3. Adverse Actions
As with his FMLA and OFLA claims, Picouto broadly asserts that a multitude of adverse actions were taken against him based on a discriminatory motive against him due his race, national origin, or gender, or on retaliation against him for objecting to unlawful discrimination. As previously discussed, many of Picouto's contentions about specific adverse actions do not pass muster for purposes of his FMLA and OFLA claims. For the same reasons, those actions are not independently sufficient to support Picouto's discrimination or retaliation claims. In short, Picouto is precluded from relying on those actions due to his failure to present any evidence that: (1) the leave-related letters (dated April 12, 2006, December 1, 2006, and March 12, 2007) were anything other than routine, automatically-generated  [*81] efforts to enforce Freightliner's legitimate leave policies; (2) he ever actually worked in the Pit after 2004; (3) listing him as "suspended" on August 17, 2006 was not in accordance with Freightliner's leave policies; (4) his September 1, 2006 transfer to Chain 3 was anything other than a legitimate effort to put distance between Picouto and Monken so Freightliner could investigate Picouto's complaints of harassment; and (5) the March 30, 2007 layoff was anything other than a legitimate, plant-wide, seniority-based layoff due to a downturn in truck orders. 25
Picouto identifies two additional discrete adverse actions to support a discrimination or retaliation claim: (1) issuance of a disciplinary letter to him for moving his car on July 19, 2006; and (2) denials of training opportunities in electrical and airing. With regard to the disciplinary letter, Picouto contends that he was the only employee who received such a letter when he left work to move his car during work hours. Picouto contends that other employees returned late from lunch after  [*82] moving their cars and were not disciplined, while Freightliner asserts that it disciplined "all known employees." Kelsey Depo., pp. 38-40.
Picouto seems to contend that the disciplinary letter originated with discrimination by Monken who announced that employees needed to move their cars or they would be ticketed or towed. However, Picouto has failed to counter the undisputed evidence that: (1) Monken made this announcement to all employees, not just to him; and (2) Kelsey intervened only after Hurt alerted him that Picouto left the plant without permission and was in a verbal confrontation with a city official. After Picouto filed a grievance regarding the letter, it was removed from his personnel file. Bouman-Stegall Decl., Ex. K, p. 46. Consequently, no copy of the disciplinary letter is in the record, and Picouto has identified no adverse consequences resulting from the temporary placement of that letter in his personnel file. Viewed in this context, this court concludes that the disciplinary letter is an insufficient predicate on which to premise a claim for discrimination or retaliation.
The alleged denials of training opportunities fare no better. Picouto testified that he requested  [*83] transfers to electrical and airing training, but Freightliner gave those training opportunities to less senior Native Americans. Picouto Depo., pp. 311-14. Freightliner acknowledges that two other employees were assigned to electrical and airing training. However, these training opportunities are assigned at the discretion of management, are not part of the DCPS cross-training rotation, and are not governed by the seniority provisions of the CBA. LaRochelle Decl., ¶¶ 15-16. The two training assignments about which Picouto apparently complains were given to other employees based on their previous experience, demonstrated interest in the position, a natural aptitude for the skill set involved, and Freightliner's conclusion that it needed to select individuals who could, to some degree, "hit the ground running" and begin to produce during the training as quickly as possible due to the high volume of truck production in Offline at the time. Id, ¶ 38. Picouto offers nothing in response to that evidence, other than a general observation by a coworker that "Freightliner management in general treated racial minority workers differently than they treated Caucasians" and that "Caucasians would  [*84] be trained for new jobs and procedures that are more complicated and minorities will be given less complex assignments." Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 19-20. These general observations are insufficient to counter the legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons offered by Freightliner for the training assignments. As such, these discrete acts are also insufficient to independently support either the First or Second Claims.
Because each discrete adverse act alleged by Picouto is either time-barred or insufficient to independently support a claim for discrimination or retaliation, Freightliner should be granted summary judgment against those portions of the First and Second Claims.

4. Hostile Work Environment (First and Second Claims)
The final allegation of the First and Second Claims is that Picouto was subjected to a hostile work environment due to his race, national origin and/or gender while working in the PTMP. 26 This assertion is primarily based on the ongoing harassment directed at him by Monken, but also draws on actions by Liday (Team Leader on Chain 1), as well as on conduct by Freightliner supervisors Franklin, Kelsey, Looney, Kahl, and Spencer ignoring his complaints about Monken, supporting  [*85] Monken that Picouto needed to undergo cross training in the Pit, and subjecting him to various disciplinary actions. For the reasons that follow, the hostile work environment claim survives summary judgment.

a. Legal Standards
Under Title VII and its Oregon statutory counterpart, "an employee has a 'right to work in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.'" Woods v. Graphic Comms., 925 F2d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir 1991), quoting Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986). To state a prima  [*86] facie case for his hostile work environment claim, Picouto must raise a triable issue of fact as to whether: (1) he was subjected to verbal or physical conduct based on his race, national origin, or gender; (2) the conduct was unwelcome (or subjectively offensive); and (3) the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment (or objectively offensive). Surrell v. Ca. Water Serv. Co., 518 F.3d 1097, 1108 (9th Cir 2008), citing Manatt v. Bank of Am., N.A., 339 F3d 792, 798 (9th Cir 2003). Same sex harassment is cognizable under Title VII. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78-79, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998) ("Because of the many facets of human motivation, it would be unwise to presume as a matter of law that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against other members of their group." (citation and internal quotation omitted)); Rene v. MGM Grand Hotel, Inc., 305 F3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir 2002), cert denied, 538 U.S. 922, 123 S. Ct. 1573, 155 L. Ed. 2d 313 (2003).
However, these statutes do not provide a "general civility code" and "simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount  [*87] to discriminatory changes in the 'terms and conditions of employment.'" Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998) (quotations, internal citations omitted). Even "the 'mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee' is not, by itself, actionable under Title VII." Ellison v. Brady, 924 F2d 872, 876 (9th Cir 1991), quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67. On the other hand, "the harassment need not cause diagnosed psychological injury." McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir 2004), cert denied, 552 U.S. 1180, 128 S. Ct. 1226, 170 L. Ed. 2d 61 (2008) (citation omitted). Rather, "[i]t is enough 'if such hostile conduct pollutes the victim's workplace, making it more difficult for her to do her job, to take pride in her work, and to desire to stay on in her position.'" Id, quoting Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., 25 F3d 1459, 1463 (9th Cir 1994), cert denied, 513 U.S. 1082, 115 S. Ct. 733, 130 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1995). Factors to be considered in this analysis are whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance, as well as the frequency, severity, and level of interference with work performance caused by the conduct. Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787-88,  [*88] citing Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). "[T]he required showing of severity or seriousness of the harassing conduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct." Ellison, 924 F2d at 878 (citation omitted).

b. Analysis
Picouto's hostile work environment claim is based almost entirely on the treatment he received from Monken, the Team Leader of Chain 2. Freightliner seeks summary judgment against this claim because the harassing conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive and because it took immediate and appropriate remedial action to correct the alleged harassment. Neither argument withstands scrutiny.
A careful review of the record reveals that the race, national origin, and gender-based harassment to which Monken subjected Picouto are inextricably intertwined. Monken directed multiple verbal taunts at Picouto referencing Cuba or a Castro, as well as crude sexually-based accusations and taunts. On two occasions prior to his September 1, 2006 transfer to Chain 3, Monken physically touched Picouto, once touching his neck and telling him he smelled good, and once grabbing him by the shoulders and "pretending to have sex" with him. Picouto  [*89] Depo., p. 91. Monken continued this behavior, physically making contact with Picouto a few more times over the next six months prior to his transfer to finish cab in March 2007. Id. Picouto contends that he began enduring daily harassment by Monken shortly after he became the Team Leader of Chain 2 in early 2005, and that the harassment continued even after Picouto was transferred to Chain 3.
Taken in the light most favorable to Picouto, these facts are sufficient to support a hostile work environment claim. According to Picouto, Monken's conduct ran the gamut from behaviors that were not particularly severe and contained no overt connection to any protected classification (such as denying Picouto the use of a tool he needed) to behaviors that were physically threatening and humiliating and which clearly were directed at Picouto because of his race, national origin, or gender (such as "humping" Picouto while grabbing his shoulders and threatening to "send" Picouto "back to Cuba"). The conduct continued unabated for over two years and took place on a daily basis despite Picouto's multiple complaints to supervisors. Much of the behavior was verbal taunting, but a portion involved offensive  [*90] physical contact that clearly had a sexual component. Only when Picouto finally resorted to writing a letter to Freightliner's corporate headquarters did Freightliner intervene. The HR Department and Union conducted a joint investigation which Freightliner contends was "inconclusive" with regard to Picouto's more serious allegations. As a result, Freightliner left Picouto's transfer to Chain 3 in place, but took no further action other than asking the Union to talk to Monken.
This court is persuaded that a jury could conclude that a reasonable Hispanic man in Picouto's position would find Monken's conduct to be sufficiently pervasive to render the work environment hostile based on race, national origin, or gender. Taken together, Picouto's evidence is enough to survive summary judgment as to a hostile work environment claim.
Freightliner also contends that it took immediate and appropriate remedial action to end the harassment by Monken, relying on the affirmative defense established by Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807; Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998). This affirmative defense requires Freightliner to prove both that it: (1) exercised reasonable care to prevent  [*91] and promptly correct the harassing behavior; and (2) Picouto unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by Freightliner to avoid the harm. Craig v. M&O Agencies, Inc., 496 F3d 1047, 1057 (9th Cir 2007), citing Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807.
Freightliner maintains that it did not learn of Monken's behavior until Picouto brought the note left on his car to the HR Department on August 17, 2006. This contrasts sharply with Picouto's testimony that he began reporting Monken's behavior to his supervisors in March 2005. Picouto Decl., ¶ 29. Picouto contends that his repeated reports to Freightliner supervisors and his union representative were ignored. Id, ¶¶ 29 (March 2005 report to Production Supervisor Keenan Kahl), 31 (June 2005 report to supervisor Herb Franklin), 33 (reports to LaRochelle after July, 2005), 38 (March 2006 report to union representative Frank Rouse), 47 (May 2006 reports to Keenan Kahl), 50 (July 2006 report to Keenan Kahl), 52 (2006 report to Tim Kelsey), 58, 60 (August 2006 report to Keenan Kahl, Tim Kelsey, and shop steward Ben Carothers).
It is undisputed that Picouto was reassigned to Chain 3 on September 1, 2006, and  [*92] that Freightliner's HR Department and the Union began a joint investigation about six days later. Yet Picouto contends that Monken's behavior continued unabated for the next six months because Monken could simply walk into Picouto's work area in Chain 3. Monken missed many days of work, with an increasing number of those sick days attributable to stress. Freightliner has submitted some evidence which it presumably uses to argue that Picouto was simply feigning work-related stress in order to bolster his harassment claims. However, this court must at this juncture accept Picouto's version of the facts. Viewed in that light, the record reveals a disputed issue of fact concerning the timing and content of Freightliner's notice of the harassing behavior, as well as over the immediacy and efficacy of the actions taken by Freightliner to end the harassment. Accordingly, Freightliner's request for summary judgment based on this affirmative defense should be denied.

c. Conclusion
Picouto has raised a genuine issue of material fact that he suffered harassment due to his race, national origin, or gender sufficient to alter the terms and conditions of his employment. He has also raised a disputed  [*93] issue of material fact as to when Freightliner learned of the harassment and whether its response was a reasonable mechanism to prevent and correct the harassment. Accordingly, Freightliner's motion for summary judgment on the hostile work environment portion of the First and Second Claims should be denied.

RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (docket #41) should be GRANTED against: (1) the First and Second Claims to the extent they allege discrimination or retaliation based on discrete adverse employment actions; (2) the Third and Fourth Claims, except as to an alleged failure to engage in the interactive process or otherwise accommodate Picouto's actual or perceived disability with respect to the May 2008 recall; and (3) the Fifth through Eighth Claims, and otherwise should be DENIED. Therefore, the claims left for trial are: (1) the First and Second Claims to the extent they allege a hostile work environment; and (2) the Third and Fourth Claims alleging discrimination based on a failure to engage in the interactive process or otherwise accommodate Picouto's actual or perceived disability with respect to the May 2008 recall.
