REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

INTRODUCTION
Plaintiffs María Florencia Caldareri ("Caldareri"), Pablo Ciminello, Tomás Ciminello, and Sofia Ciminello (collectively "Plaintiffs"), bring forth the present case alleging unlawful discrimination by Defendants Citibank, N.A., Citi International Financial Services, LLC (for clarity's sake, collectively "Citibank") and Homar Maurás ("Maurás") [*2]  (collectively together, "Defendants").1 Plaintiffs2 aver a variety of violations under federal and local laws stemming from Caldareri's tenure as a Financial Executive at Citibank, which culminated in her dismissal in November, 2014.
Plaintiffs' claims are for disability and gender discrimination, retaliation, payments pursuant to ERISA, violations to local laws, and damages. Specifically, they assert federal causes of action under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C.A. §12101 et seq.; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §2000e, et seq., and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), 29 U.S.C.A. §1001, et. seq. They also aver causes of action under the following Puerto Rico laws: Law 100 (P.R Laws Ann. tit. 29, §146); Law 44 (P.R Laws Ann. tit. 1, §501); Law 69 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 1321); Law 80 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit 29, §185a); Law 115 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §194); and damages under Article 1802 of the Civil Code (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §5141).
Before the Court now is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 67); Plaintiffs' Opposition thereto (Docket No. 91); Defendants' Reply to Plaintiffs' Opposition (Docket No. 105); and Plaintiffs' Sur-reply thereto (Docket No. 125).
On April 12, 2018, the presiding District Judge referred the aforementioned motions to the undersigned for a Report and Recommendation. (Docket No. 111).
For the reasons explained below, it is recommended to the Court to GRANT Defendants' "Motion for Summary Judgment" in its entirety.

STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when "the pleadings, depositions, [*3]  answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 (c). Pursuant to the language of the rule, the moving party bears the two-fold burden of showing that there is "no genuine issue as to any material facts," and that he is "entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Vega-Rodríguez v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 110 F.3d 174, 178 (1st Cir. 1997).
After the moving party has satisfied this burden, the onus shifts to the resisting party to show that there still exists "a trial worthy issue as to some material fact." Cortés-Irizarry v. Corporación Insular, 111 F.3d 184, 187 (1st Cir. 1997). A fact is deemed "material" if it potentially could affect the outcome of the suit. Id. Moreover, there will only be a "genuine" or "trial worthy" issue as to such a "material fact," "if a reasonable fact-finder, examining the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences helpful to the party resisting summary judgment, could resolve the dispute in that party's favor." Id. At all times during the consideration of a motion for summary judgment, the Court must examine the entire record "in the light most flattering to the non-movant and indulge all reasonable inferences in the party's favor." [*4]  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodríguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir. 1994).
The First Circuit Court of Appeals has "emphasized the importance of local rules similar to Local Rule 56 [of the District of Puerto Rico]." Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Colón v. Infotech Aerospace Servs., Inc., 869 F.Supp.2d 220, 225-226 (D.P.R. 2012). Rules such as Local Rule 56 "are designed to function as a means of 'focusing a district court's attention on what is -and what is not-genuinely controverted.'" Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 427 (1st Cir. 2006)). Local Rule 56 imposes guidelines for both the movant and the party opposing summary judgment. A party moving for summary judgment must submit factual assertions in "a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs." Loc. Rule 56(b). A party opposing a motion for summary judgment must "admit, deny, or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of facts." Loc. Rule 56 (c). If they so wish, they may submit a separate statement of facts which they believe are in controversy. Time and again, the First Circuit has highlighted that facts which are properly supported "shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted." Loc. Rule 56(e); P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v. Rivera-Vázquez, 603 F.3d 125, 130 (1st Cir. 2010) and Colón, 869 F.Supp.2d at 226. Due to the importance of this function to the summary judgment process, "litigants ignore [those rules] at their peril." Hernández, 486 F.3d at 7.
Before moving on, the Court must mention that Plaintiff's Opposition [*5]  to Defendants' statement of uncontested material facts was procedurally non-compliant with the Local Rules, insofar as many of the denials do not oppose the truth of the statement offered. A review of Plaintiffs' qualifications to Defendants' fact statements shows that they are either irrelevant to the matter at hand, offered additional evidence not related to the fact in question and/or failed to contradict it, or consisted of mere "speculation, generalities, conclusory assertions, improbable inferences, and, for lack of a better phrase, a lot of 'hot air.'" Domínguez v. Eli Lilly and Co., 958 F.Supp. 721, 728 (D.P.R. 1997).
For instance, Defendants' proffered fact no. 227, which refers to Plaintiff's EEOC charge, states: "Once the discrimination charge was received, Ramirez-Márquez reviewed the allegations with Maurás and escalated the charge to the company's attorneys". Plaintiffs respond with a "Denied", stating: "As admitted by Ramírez-Márquez, Caldareri was terminated a few months after Defendants received the discrimination charge. Ramírez-Márquez also stated that, upon receiving Caldareri's EEOC charge, she escalated it to Maurás and to their attorneys. Also, per Ramírez-Márquez's deposition testimony, Defendants did not investigate if Caldareri's [*6]  EEOC charge was substantiated or not. In fact, when asked about it, Ramírez-Márquez only made comments regarding Caldareri's performance. Also, it is noted that in this line of questioning, opposing counsel presented objection stating: 'The witness has not stated that she investigated anything.'" Clearly, Plaintiffs admit the proffered fact, to wit, that the EEOC complaint was received, examined and escalated to outside counsel. The subsequent, and additional explanations about Ramírez-Márquez not having investigated the charges and the timing of Caldareri's subsequent termination are unrelated to the proffered fact.
Similarly, Defendants' proffered fact no. 287, which was an email exchange between Plaintiff and co-Defendant Maurás, states: "Maurás closed the email by stating that their evaluation continued to reflect deficiencies in processes that are important to reach regulatory goals and commercial goals related to clients. He urged Caldareri to improve in a hurry to limit any risk associated with her poor performance". This email was sent to Plaintiff after meeting with Maurás in the Fall of 2014 in response to her performance.
Plaintiff denies this fact with a long-winded explanation [*7]  of how this did not measure her performance insofar as Maurás' opinion was subjective due to her previous complaints against him, that the email is buttressed by a sham affidavit, and that the instructions given were not in accordance with client needs. While the explanation provided may serve to establish how Plaintiff felt regarding the instructions she received from Maurás and why she failed to comply with them, her denial cannot serve to oppose the proffered fact that the email was sent, and that it stated that her performance was deficient, her goals were not being reached and she needed to improve. This occurred with many of Plaintiffs' denials.
Moreover, Plaintiffs' denials are also procedurally non-compliant because Plaintiffs injected factual matters into their explanations for the denials. For the two aforementioned denials for instance, Plaintiffs would have been better served by incorporating that additional information into a reply statement of facts, which they neglected to do, in direct contravention to the Local Rules. As a result thereof, the Court deemed admitted almost all the proffered facts from Defendants' Statement of Facts.
On the other hand, for many of the other [*8]  facts proffered by Defendants, Plaintiffs assert they are "denied as it pertains to Plaintiffs", immaterial, based on "inadmissible evidence" and fail to offer any citation in support of the denial.
For instance, Plaintiffs denied Defendants' proffered fact No. 67, stating that deposition testimony of the Human Resources official regarding the different options considered for Plaintiff while outside Puerto Rico was inadmissible evidence. They then proceed to inject additional facts into the denial regarding authorized leave and offer no citation to the record for the denial. See Docket No. 90, p. 11, Fact No. 67. Clearly, the testimony of a Human Resources official relating events that she herself participated in and has personal knowledge of is unmistakably admissible. And, while the denial states that it "consists of an issue of material fact that must be decided by a jury", it proffers no evidence to challenge the proposed fact. Finally, as the denial is also unsupported by a record citation, the Court is not obligated to consider it. This was the case with many of Plaintiffs' denials. See, e.g., Docket No. 90, denials to proffered fact nos. 106-118 136, 150, 219-224, among others. [*9] 
For other facts, Plaintiffs posit that they are "immaterial" to the issues at bar. For example, Plaintiffs argue that the reasons given by Citibank to justify assigning a second executive to the Ecuador portfolio,3 which Plaintiff had previously attended to alone, are somehow "irrelevant", when quite the opposite, it is one of the pivotal issues Plaintiff herself has raised in this case. The same goes for statements regarding Citibank's given justifications for the November 2013 reorganization,4 which go to the heart of this case. Nothing could be more relevant to Citibank's non-retaliatory defense that the rationale given to justify the reorganization.
Finally, Plaintiffs have also objected to the fact that Defendants provided several unsworn statements under penalty of perjury in support of their motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs proffer that said statements are inadmissible and that they are "sham affidavits".
First, the fact that a witness with personal knowledge submits an unsworn statement about a fact directly pertaining to the case makes the document's contents highly relevant and, therefore, admissible. The argument that the unsworn statements are inadmissible is also plainly [*10]  incorrect for a second reason, mainly that the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 allows for, among other things, affidavits to be used in supporting a party's claims and defenses. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c)(1)(A). Interestingly, and quite conveniently, although Plaintiffs oppose certain facts supported by the unsworn statements that the claim are inadmissible, they do admit other facts supported by them. See Docket No. 90, Fact 72.
Finally, Plaintiffs aver that the statements offered by Defendants are "sham affidavits", as they contradict previous testimony given in the witnesses' depositions and should therefore not be allowed. Under this doctrine, a party may not use an affidavit after the end of discovery to contradict facts previously provided in order to survive summary judgment, unless the party provides a satisfactory explanation for providing the post-summary judgment affidavit. Morales v. AC Orssleff's EFTF, 246 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.2001).
Plaintiffs misconstrue the object of the sham affidavit doctrine, as it is used by a party to provide extra evidence in order to survive summary judgment, which is not the case here. Second, as previously stated, the rules specifically allow a party to present statements in support of their claims and defenses. Third, even if the sham affidavit doctrine were [*11]  applicable as Plaintiffs would hold, the Court has reviewed the testimony in question offered by Defendants. It finds the statements attend to facts that were not asked during the depositions, but more importantly, offers explanations for other facts addressed in previous deposition testimony and which are necessary in order to admit documents into the record of the summary judgment motion, insofar as the documents were not discussed or admitted during the depositions. As direct participants in the events that dealt with the documents sought to be introduced into the record, there is no other way for the Court to consider the documents except via an unsworn statement. This is clearly allowed by the rules, and complies with the "satisfactory explanation" requirement under Morales, 246 F.3d at 35.
That is not the case, however, with Plaintiff's unsworn statement, which she provided in support of her objections to Defendants' Statement of Uncontested Facts. It is twenty-one (21) pages long, and was signed the day before the opposition was filed. Caldareri's statement is wholly self-serving, was drafted specifically in support of her opposition, and does not attempt to introduce any documents whatsoever in support [*12]  of the arguments presented in her statement5. This is the main difference between Defendants' statements and Plaintiff's statement.
Most, if not all the matters addressed in Caldareri's statement were specifically addressed during her deposition, yet she added new facts not previously disclosed in her deposition, many of which contradict her previous testimony. For instance, Plaintiff specifically stated in her deposition that she could not perform the essential functions of her job, which is one of the fundamental issues in this case. See Docket No. 67, Defendant's proffered fact Nos. 211-213, and Docket No. 90-2, Caldareri's deposition, pp. 163-165. Then, she flatly contradicts this previous testimony in her unsworn statement. Docket No. 90-2, p. 11, ¶ 57. This is precisely the situation the sham affidavit doctrine seeks to avoid.
Notably absent also is any type of explanation as to why none of the additional facts proffered in Caldareri's statement were not previously disclosed. See Reyes v. Prof'l HEPA Certificate Corp., 74 F. Supp. 3d 489, 492 (D.P.R. 2015), aff'd sub nom, 817 F.3d 380 (1st Cir. 2016) ("the lack of explanation as to why Plaintiff's sworn statement came to life post-summary judgment pushes this sworn statement off the table"). It is evident that [*13]  Plaintiff has attempted to create issues of fact in opposition to summary judgment. See Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme Química P.R., Inc., 447 F.3d 105, 110 & n. 2 (1st Cir. 2006) ("[T]he Statement was executed only after [the defendant] had filed its motion for summary judgment, thus suggesting that the Statement was made solely to create an issue of fact for the purpose of surviving summary judgment"); Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2000) (affirming district court's decision to strike affidavits that were offered after defendants had filed motions for summary judgment); Colantuoni v. Alfred Calcagni & Sons, Inc., 44 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1994)) ("[W]e think it significant that the affidavit was offered only after defendants had filed motions for summary judgment....we are persuaded that plaintiff's affidavit should be disregarded"). Therefore, the Court did not consider Plaintiff's unsworn statement.
Based on the parties' submissions, the Court finds the following facts to be uncontested.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Citibank structure

1. Citibank N.A. in Puerto Rico is a fully-owned branch of Citibank N.A., which is a subsidiary of Citicorp Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. D. Exhibit 10.
2. Citibank provides a wide array of banking and financial services to individual consumers, as well as to businesses. Among those services, Citibank offers securities investments and banking products [*14]  and services to customers in Latin America. D. Exhibit 10.
3. Citi International Financial Services ("CIFS") is a Registered Broker Dealer that manages investment products for clients located in Latin America. CIFS offers services to clients in Brasil, Argentina, Colombia, Perú, Chile, Venezuela, Dominican Republic and Central America from Puerto Rico. D. Exhibit 4, p. 21; D. Exhibit 10. CIFS services clients in these countries remotely for a variety of reasons, such as local legal constraints. D. Exhibit 4, p. 22.
4. International Personal Banking ("IPB") is a group of Citibank affiliates which manages banking and investment matters for clients in Latin America. CIFS and the Citibank branches in Latin American countries are part of IPB. D. Exhibit 3, p. 14-15; D. Exhibit 4, p. 166-167; D. Exhibit 10.
5. Co-Defendant Maurás was the Remote Sales Unit Head approximately from 2010-2011, until May of 2017. He was Plaintiff's immediate supervisor from March 2007 through December 2008, and again from August 2010 through November 2014. D. Exhibit 4, p. 24; D. Exhibit 10.
6. Armando Silva ("Silva") was President and CEO of CIFS, and was Maurás' direct supervisor. D. Exhibit 7, p. 15, 19-20. Marcelo [*15]  Coscarelli was Silva's boss at the time. D. Exhibit 7, pp. 64.

Caldareri's initial employment in Argentina
7. Plaintiff Caldareri began to work full time for Citibank in Argentina on October 1, 1994, as a greeter in Citigold. D. Exhibit 1, p. 8-9, 19-21.
8. Caldareri became an Investment and Banking Officer on or about December 1997, after occupying a number of other positions. She was responsible for advising clients in financial matters related to opening accounts, administering financial assets and generating revenues for the bank and the client. Her productivity was measured by: (1) opening of new accounts; (2) assets under management; and (3) revenue. Exhibit 1, p. 22-29, 32.
9. On May 1, 2001, she was transferred to the Citigold Center in Rosario, Argentina, as a Branch Manager. Exhibit 1, p. 28.

Caldareri's move to Puerto Rico
10. In 2002, as a result of a change in the business model, Citibank decided that all assets held within Argentina would be managed from within that country, while assets in the United States belonging to Argentinian clients would be managed from Puerto Rico. D. Exhibit 1, p. 46; D. Exhibit 4, p. 30-31.
11. In May, 2002, Caldareri was offered a position as a [*16]  Financial Executive in Puerto Rico with Citibank as a part of this change in the business model. She would be servicing offshore accounts of Argentinean nationals. D. Exhibit 1, p. 44-46.
12. The offer was contingent upon her approval of the Series 7 exam offered by the Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the "general securities license" in the United States. Between 20 and 25 employees in Argentina were selected to continue managing offshore accounts from Puerto Rico under this agreement. D. Exhibit 1, p. 50-51.
13. After accepting and approving the Series 7 exam, Caldareri signed an employment agreement with Citibank Puerto Rico to become a Financial Executive on July 24, 2002. D. Exhibit 11; D. Exhibit 12. She began working in Puerto Rico the following day. D. Exhibit 1, p. 55; D. Exhibit 4, p.42.
14. Caldareri oversaw advising clients in financial matters as well as banking matters. She provided recommendations to clients per their investment profile, risk tolerance, client's experience, and liquidity needs. D. Exhibit 1, p. 57-58.
15. Her performance was measured in function of a goal in gross commission/gross production, regarding the financial products. Gross [*17]  commission refers to the commission generated from the sale of investment products. She was also measured in revenue generated by banking products sold to clients. D. Exhibit 1, p. 59, 61.
16. Caldareri also had to comply with numerous internal regulations, as well as FINRA regulations related to the management of financial assets. Exhibit 1, p. 63.

Changes to Caldareri's portfolio during her first years in Puerto Rico
17. When Caldareri initially arrived in Puerto Rico, she managed accounts of Argentinean clients with assets in the United States. D. Exhibit 1, p. 64-65; D. Exhibit 4, p. 43-44. She continued to service Argentina clients exclusively until March 2006. At that point, she received an offer to manage investment accounts from Quito, Ecuador, in addition to her existing portfolio. D. Exhibit 1, p. 65-66, 68; D. Exhibit 4, p. 51-52.
18. Caldareri accepted this proposal and would travel one week a month to Ecuador. She would visit clients and speak to them about their financial needs. However, due to legal constraints, she could not offer investments while she was inside Ecuador. D. Exhibit 1, p. 71.
19. She would make the investment offer from Puerto Rico. If the client had questions, [*18]  she would meet them in person, but returned to Puerto Rico to execute the transaction. D. Exhibit 1, p. 71.
20. She also traveled to Argentina during that period, once every three months. D. Exhibit 1, p. 72.
21. On January 1, 2007, due to another change in business model, Caldareri was transferred from Citibank to CIFS. However, she continued to be a Financial Executive, managing Quito, Ecuador and Argentina clients. D. Exhibit 12.
22. Caldareri continued to manage the Quito, Ecuador portfolio, along with the Argentina portfolio until July 2007, when the person managing the Guayaquil, Ecuador portfolio resigned. D. Exhibit 1, p. 73; D. Exhibit 4, p. 54.
23. Maurás then offered Caldareri both Ecuador portfolios, Quito and Guayaquil, but she had to relinquish the Argentina portfolio. D. Exhibit 1, p. 73-74.
24. Maurás wanted her to relinquish the Argentina portfolio, because Citibank believed that, in practical terms, it was difficult to manage both Ecuador portfolios as well as Argentina. D. Exhibit 1, p. 78.
25. Caldareri agreed to take on both Ecuador portfolios if she could keep under her control certain key Argentina accounts, which Maurás agreed to. D. Exhibit 1, p. 80-82, 85.
26. Caldareri [*19]  continued to manage all the Ecuador portfolio along with the Argentina key accounts until July, 2008. D. Exhibit 1, p. 88.
27. At that point, the business decided that all portfolios for Argentina would be managed from Uruguay. D. Exhibit 1, p. 89. Caldareri was offered a move to Uruguay to manage the Argentina portfolios. D. Exhibit 1, p. 92.
28. Ultimately, Caldareri rejected the Uruguay move offer and continued to manage the Ecuador portfolios. She rejected the offer because she would have to stop servicing Ecuador. D. Exhibit 1, p. 110-111, 135.
29. After the Uruguay change, Caldareri only serviced the Ecuador portfolios. D. Exhibit 1, p. 121.

Visa Renewal Process and Tuition Reimbursement
30. Caldareri arrived in Puerto Rico with an L-1B visa. D. Exhibit 1, p. 75. By July 2008, the visa was about to expire. D. Exhibit 1, p. 98.
31. Citibank and CIFS then began to evaluate options for Caldareri and the other employees who arrived from Argentina in 2002, in order for them to remain working for CIFS and in the United States. Ultimately, Human Resources and the legal team opted by beginning a process to obtain permanent residency for these employees in the United States. D. Exhibit 13.
 [*20] 32. At that point in time, Magalys Camacho ("Camacho"), a Human Resources Generalist who assisted employees on visa related matters, informed Caldareri that her approval process was practically impossible because she lacked a college degree. D. Exhibit 1, p. 101; D. Exhibit 8.
33. On May 28, 2008, Camacho instructed Caldareri and other employees who came with Caldareri from Argentina in 2002 to begin studying at a college level to continue the process of obtaining permanent residency in the United States. The reason for this was that the Department of Labor required a college degree to obtain permanent residency. D. Exhibit 3, p. 65; D. Exhibit 4, p. 65; D. Exhibit 8, p. 44-45; D. Exhibit 13; Exhibit 14.
34. It was also agreed that, as far as it was permitted within bank policies, they would help them cover the costs of these courses through the Tuition Reimbursement policy. D. Exhibit 4, p. 65; D. Exhibit 1, p. 113.
35. The Tuition Reimbursement Policy is sent via email from the company offices in New York to all Citi employees in the United States and Puerto Rico. The policy states that employees who earn more than $250,000.00 are not eligible for tuition reimbursement. D. Exhibit 2, [*21]  p. 67-69; D. Exhibit 60.
36. Caldareri began courses at the University of Phoenix to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Business Management. D. Exhibit 1, p. 16-17; D. Exhibit 2, p. 105; D. Exhibit 4, p. 64.
37. The Tuition Reimbursement policy for Puerto Rico was changed on May 1, 2009 to require employees to fill requests online. Prior to this date, the employee would fill out a written form and forward it to Human Resources. This manual process was discontinued at that time. D. Exhibit 2, p. 71-72; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 60.
38. The 2009 policy also stated that employees who earned more than $250,000.00 were not eligible. D. Exhibit 2, p. 72-73.
39. Caldareri received tuition reimbursement payments at some point before 2009. D. Exhibit 2, p. 101. Because it was done manually, she could request tuition reimbursement regardless of her total compensation, which was more than $250,000.00. D. Exhibit 2, p. 101.
40. In 2010, Caldareri escalated a situation to Suzette Ramírez-Márquez ("Ramírez-Márquez"), a Human Resources Generalist, about a denied tuition reimbursement because the system would not allow her to request reimbursements for courses taken during a leave of absence. D. Exhibit 2, [*22]  p. 104; 115-116.
41. In addition, Caldareri would not have been able to access the computer system for tuition reimbursement because her salary was more than $250,000.00. D. Exhibit 2, p. 105.
42. Maurás does not have the authority to grant an exception to the Tuition Reimbursement policy. D. Exhibit 4, p. 68.
43. Both Caldareri and Luis Fernández ("Fernández"), another Financial Executive who arrived from Argentina along with Caldareri, were then unable to request tuition reimbursements after the 2009 change. Exhibit 9, pp. 11-13, 27-28.

Caldareri's 2010 STD and her exit from Puerto Rico
44. By early 2010, Caldareri held an H-1(b) visa, which was also expiring. At that time, her permanent residency process had not begun because she had not complied with the education requirement. D. Exhibit 8, pp. 63-70.
45. Between the end of February and the beginning of March, 2010, Caldareri was absent from the workplace for a number of consecutive days for health-related reasons. On March 3, 2010, Ramírez-Márquez notified Caldareri that, due to her prolonged absence, she had to submit a request for Short Term Disability ("STD") to MetLife, the external provider who managed disability benefits for Citi [*23]  Group, and forwarded the proper procedure. D. Exhibit 2, pp. 88-89; D. Exhibit 12, D. Exhibit 15.
46. Caldareri initially responded to Ramírez-Márquez by stating that, even though she had been absent, she was working from home, would coordinate with her supervisor to continue working from home on a temporary basis and did not see the need to apply for the STD benefit. D. Exhibit 2, p. 89; D. Exhibit 2, p. 96; D. Exhibit 16. Her supervisor at that time was Hiram Cortés ("Cortés"), who supervised Caldareri between 2008 and 2010. D. Exhibit 2, p. 88; D. Exhibit 4, p. 59-60.
47. However, Caldareri submitted the STD request on March 10, 2010. D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 15.
48. Caldareri informed Ramírez-Márquez, Cortés and Castro that she was suffering from fibromyalgia and anorexia at the beginning of the STD. D. Exhibit 2, pp. 88-89; 115-116.
49. Caldareri was on STD for thirteen (13) weeks due to health-related issues, during which she received STD benefits. D. Exhibit 1, p. 121-123; D. Exhibit 2, p. 96; D. Exhibit 3, p. 97.
50. During her STD, Caldareri had to leave the country because her visas expired and she was no longer legally allowed to work within the United States. She left for Argentina [*24]  on May 19, 2010. D. Exhibit 1, p. 115-116, 122; D. Exhibit 2, p. 92; D. Exhibit 3, p. 102-103; D. Exhibit 4, p. 62.
51. At that point, only two members of the original group who had come from Argentina remained in Puerto Rico, to wit, Fernández and Caldareri. D. Exhibit 1, p. 118. They both had to leave the United States because of their expired visas. D. Exhibit 1, p. 116; D. Exhibit 9, p. 33.
52. Caldareri claims that this was the result of the mistakes made by Maurás, who at that time was not her supervisor, Human Resources and Citibank. D. Exhibit 1, p. 115-116.
53. Caldareri does not know if Maurás assisted in having her obtain her visa. She only knows that he attempted to assist in obtaining her visa by having her experience accredited in place of her lack of a college degree. D. Exhibit 1, p. 103-104.
54. Maurás does not make the decisions regarding the visas and was not in charge of the process. D. Exhibit 1, pp. 100, 102.
55. Caldareri continued working on her health issues while in Argentina. D. Exhibit 1, p. 123.
56. After the conclusion of the STD, she was informed that there was also an opportunity to request Long Term Disability ("LTD"), which she proceeded to do. D. Exhibit [*25]  1, p. 126.
57. In Caldareri's request for LTD, she stated that she suffered from depression, anxiety and had a history of anorexia. D. Exhibit 2, p. 90.
58. Ramírez-Márquez assisted Caldareri in requesting the LTD. Her role was informing Caldareri about the application process. All other information was received directly by Caldareri from Met Life. D. Exhibit 2, p. 84-85, 96-97.
59. Caldareri's request for LTD was denied by MetLife. Ramírez-Márquez then guided Caldareri at the time of the denial and furnished the documents for her to file an appeal of the denial. D. Exhibit 2, p. 96-97.
60. Ramírez-Márquez also guided Caldareri to contact MetLife directly to inquire as to updates as to her requests. D. Exhibit 2, p. 98.
61. Caldareri's migratory status was resolved eventually, because Caldareri personally contracted an immigration lawyer that helped her with the process of her residency. D. Exhibit 1, p. 114. She eventually obtained her permanent residency through this method. D. Exhibit 1, p. 115.
62. Caldareri's green card was approved on September 22, 2010. D. Exhibit 2, p. 106.
63. In addition, Caldareri received a medical discharge on February 4, 2011. However, she could not return to [*26]  work because she had not yet received her permission to work on U.S. soil. D. Exhibit 2, p. 99; D. Exhibit 17.
64. After Caldareri's absence exceeded a full calendar year, Human Resources began to evaluate possibilities to extend her leave and keep her on payroll until she returned. D. Exhibit 2, p. 105-106. Eventually, María Eugenia Vásquez ("Vásquez"), Human Resources leader for IPB, approved an exception for Caldareri allowing her to remain on an unpaid leave for an extended period before being reinstated as an employee. D. Exhibit 3, p. 104.
65. Caldareri remained on unpaid leave for an additional two-months to allow her time to complete the process of obtaining a work permit for the United States and return to work. D. Exhibit 3, p. 107-108.
66. This decision was made considering that Caldareri was close to obtaining the permit and was showing interest in returning to work. D. Exhibit 3, p. 108-109.
67. The expectation always was that she would return to Puerto Rico. D. Exhibit 4, p. 62.

Changes During Caldareri's Absence and her Return
68. During Caldareri's absence in 2010-2011, the Ecuador portfolio was serviced by two Financial Executives on a temporary basis. D. Exhibit 1, p. 124-125; [*27]  D. Exhibit 4, p. 80.
69. Beginning on August 4, 2010, Maurás became the Remote Unit Sales Head and began to supervise the Financial Executives assigned to Ecuador. D. Exhibit 2, p. 109; D. Exhibit 10.
70. Shortly after Maurás began to supervise the Ecuador Financial Executives, management from Citibank in Ecuador contacted Maurás to request changes to the services that CIFS provided for Ecuador clients in investment related matters. Diana Torres and Carlos Coronel held various meetings with Maurás, and then confirmed in writing certain agreements made with Maurás as to how they would manage the investment accounts going forward. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 18; D. Exhibit 19.
71. Ecuador wanted to increase the capacity to serve clients by having a second Financial Executive on a permanent basis. This was going to allow for better coverage of the portfolio, given that it would allow for more trips to the country. And, if at any point one of the Financial Executives was absent, service would not be interrupted. D. Exhibit 3, p. 116-117; D. Exhibit 4, p. 80; 238-239.
72. CIFS responded to these requests by Ecuador to modify the model and services that they had at that moment by adding an additional [*28]  Financial Executive to service the country on a permanent basis. D. Exhibit 3, p. 116; D. Exhibit 4, p. 79; D. Exhibit 19.
73. Subsequently, on September 17, 2010, an Internal Job listing was posted for a Financial Executive for Ecuador, who would report to Maurás. D. Exhibit 2, p. 94; D. Exhibit 4, p. 77-78; D. Exhibit 20.
74. This position was awarded to María Mercedes Ramírez on January 1, 2011, and she was given the Quito portfolio. D. Exhibit 4, p. 78; D. Exhibit 12. She was given the Quito portfolio because the Financial Executive that was assigned to Quito on a temporary basis during Caldareri's absence was leaving. Thus, the immediate need was a permanent Financial Executive for Quito. D. Exhibit 4, p. 79.
75. In March of 2011, before her return, Caldareri was informed that Quito had been assigned to María Mercedes Ramírez. She was informed by Maurás that this was a business decision. D. Exhibit 1, p. 129.
76. Maurás also informed Caldareri that she would be servicing only Guayaquil upon her return, and that the country requested that the portfolio be divided because they did not want the whole portfolio under one person. D. Exhibit 1, p. 130-131; D. Exhibit 2, p. 106-107; Exhibit [*29]  4, p. 79, 85. Caldareri was not in agreement with this decision because she understood that she could manage all of Ecuador. D. Exhibit 4, p. 85.
77. The Guayaquil portfolio that Caldareri would be managing was similar in size to portfolios managed by others, and larger than other portfolios. D. Exhibit 4, p. 96.
78. After Plaintiff's return in June 2011, her portfolio did not change again up until the end of her relationship with CIFS. D. Exhibit 1, p. 133.
79. Vásquez met with Caldareri in June of 2011 to discuss these model changes. D. Exhibit 3, p. 118, 122. Present in that meeting were Caldareri, Vásquez, Castro, Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez. D. Exhibit 3, p. 122. The meeting was held to clarify any concerns Caldareri had with regards to the change. D. Exhibit 3, p. 123.
80. Vásquez informed Caldareri that this was a business decision responding to a business need that was not discriminatory. Discrimination was discussed because it was one of the issues raised by Caldareri. D. Exhibit 3, p. 118-119. Vásquez worked with Castro and Ramírez-Márquez to make sure they addressed all of Caldareri's concerns. D. Exhibit 3, p. 123.
81. At some point Caldareri mentioned or complained of disparate [*30]  treatment, regarding the reduction of her portfolio. D. Exhibit 4, p. 186-187.
82. Maurás also explained to her the reasons why the portfolio was divided, and explained that he did not have authority to override decisions the local structure took with regards to internal management. D. Exhibit 4, p. 97.
83. Maurás told Caldareri that they would cover all the costs if she needed to increase travel to Ecuador. D. Exhibit 4, p. 99.
84. Caldareri still expressed that she was not in agreement with the decision, that she wanted to continue to be the only Financial Executive for Ecuador. D. Exhibit 3, p. 126.
85. According to Vásquez and Maurás, this change did not impact Caldareri's compensation because a reduction in portfolio value did not necessarily impact Caldareri's performance. It depended on the activity that the executive has within the portfolio. D. Exhibit 4, p. 83. D. Exhibit 3, p. 119.

Caldareri's 2012 Performance Evaluation
86. On January 30, 2013, Maurás evaluated Caldareri's performance for 2012. D. Exhibit 4, p. 113, 115, 162; D. Exhibit 21. She received an overall rating of "Partially Effective." D. Exhibit 4, p. 118.
87. Even though Caldareri was rated as "Highly Effective" and [*31]  "Consistently Strong" in categories such as "What We Do," and "How We Achieve Our Business Goals", her overall rating responded to having a rating of "Partially Effective" in the "Responsible Finance, Manage Risk and Compliance" and "AML, Sanctions Goal" categories. D. Exhibit 4, p. 116-118.
88. Caldareri did not agree with the assessment and requested a meeting to review the result. D. Exhibit 4, p. 119.
89. The meeting was held between Caldareri, Maurás and Human Resources. Human Resources was involved in the meeting because they wanted to make sure that Caldareri understood the data that was provided in the process. D. Exhibit 4, p. 119.
90. Caldareri claims that, before Maurás even informed her of the result of her evaluation, he first stated that he did not care about her condition. D. Exhibit 1, p. 183.
91. According to Caldareri, Maurás allegedly stated that the reason for the poor evaluation was that she was a woman, a mother and because she had a bad relationship with Ecuador. Caldareri also claims that Maurás stated that other employees believed that she had certain privileges and that there were customer complaints. D. Exhibit 1, p. 184.
92. On February 27, 2013, Maurás modified [*32]  the evaluation. He stated in the "Goals" section that, even though Caldareri did not comply with the ultimate country goals, her performance was very good considering the politico-economic situation in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 4, p. 120; D. Exhibit 22.
93. Maurás also stated in the revised version that the problems with her absences and her tardiness caused a difficult situation to manage with the team's goals. D. Exhibit 4, p. 132-133. Maurás does not remember exactly how many absences and late entries Caldareri had in 2012, but recalls that it was more than the rest of the team. D. Exhibit 4, p. 135.
94. In "Manage Risk and Compliance", Maurás explained that Caldareri failed to comply with the requirement relating to filing the certification that was required whenever an employee managed a client outside of the Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction for a period of seven (7) months in 2012. Thus, the rating given to Caldareri in this aspect was "Partially Effective". D. Exhibit 4, p. 135-136.
95. During those seven (7) months when she did not comply with the regulatory requirements, she was aware that she had to comply with them. D. Exhibit 4, p. 241.
96. Ultimately, Caldareri's overall rating [*33]  remained at Partially Effective, because she failed to comply with an important component of her evaluation: compliance with company policies. In addition, she had an issue with absenteeism and tardiness. D. Exhibit 4, p. 137.
97. The consideration of her absenteeism is tied more to the effect that the absence has on the business than to the number of allowed sick days by the Employee Handbook. D. Exhibit 4, p. 139-140. During 2012, Maurás received complaints from Ecuador management because of Caldareri's absenteeism. D. Exhibit 4, p. 143.
98. To reach this conclusion, Maurás took into consideration all the components of the evaluation, and identified those components that represented a sensitive risk for the business, and, depending on those results, he arrived at a final assessment. D. Exhibit 4, p. 138.
99. Due to this evaluation, Maurás and Caldareri agreed to meet periodically throughout 2013. D. Exhibit 3, p. 132; D. Exhibit 4, p. 140, 148. In those meetings, they would discuss Caldareri's production and service issues related to Caldareri's portfolio. D. Exhibit 4, p. 149.
100. The meetings continued for several consecutive months and ultimately ceased because Caldareri's performance [*34]  regarding the issues that had been raised as concerns — issues with production, absenteeism, and management of the relationship with the country — had improved. D. Exhibit 3, p. 135; D. Exhibit 4, pp. 149-150.

The November 2013 Reorganization
101. In 2013, the different offices of Citibank in Latin America began to analyze the structures in their countries to understand if those structures complied with bank requirements or pursued the ideal business model. D. Exhibit 4, p. 167-168. This was an IPB initiative, which is the business to which CIFS reports to. D. Exhibit 4, p. 166-167.
102. The ideal business model was not designed with any specific country in mind. Many factors were analyzed to understand what should be the best service model. It was up to management in each country to determine how to temper their model to this ideal business model. D. Exhibit 4, p.176.
103. Maurás participated in this process to design the ideal business model for IPB because he had experience managing the countries. D. Exhibit 4, p. 177. Maurás did not offer feedback as to the restructuring of any country in particular, including Ecuador. D. Exhibit 4, p. 177.
104. The ideal business model was designed [*35]  according to how they believed the structure should be managed, taking into consideration the idiosyncrasy of the clients in Latin America. D. Exhibit 4, p. 177. In that sense, what clients in Latin America have in common is that they are looking to diversify their assets to eliminate local risk. The model was created with that common characteristic, to help clients diversify their holdings. D. Exhibit 4, p. 178.
105. From that analysis came a recommendation for each country to compare their status to what the business model was and determine if each individual location complied with what the business expected, to then implement changes to meet the business model. D. Exhibit 4, p. 168.
106. There were different results at each country's level after this exercise. D. Ex-hibit 4, p. 170.
107. In Ecuador's case, they began to try to find a way to make it grow consistent with the proposed models, given that it was a country small in growth opportunities and in which CIFS could not operate with Financial Executives within the country due to regulatory requirements. D. Exhibit 4, p. 166; D. Exhibit 7, pp. 68; D. Exhibit 23.
108. Consequently, various conversations were held to discuss the possibility [*36]  of reorganizing the business in Ecuador during August 2013. These conversations were held between Citibank officials in Ecuador and CIFS. However, the final decisions regarding the reorganization would be taken by the Citibank officials in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 2, p. 115; D. Exhibit 23. CIFS is not the employer of the employees located in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 7, p. 57.
109. Silva and Maurás were kept abreast as to the decisions that were being considered in these conversations. D. Exhibit 7, p. 49-50, D. Exhibit 4, p. 166.
110. At that point, Ecuador had a bifurcated relationship, since Financial Executives were sitting in Puerto Rico but banking was managed by local employees. D. Exhibit 7, p. 52.
111. However, the model for Ecuador had not shown significant growth at that point, had concentrated on low tier accounts and was not maximizing investment value. Because of this situation, the country proposed to reposition the business model, having the two (2) Financial Executives grow their portfolios and begin to manage banking accounts also, and relocating the local bankers out of the country. Basically, they proposed to downsize local service centers and prioritize identification of very [*37]  talented bankers. This model was in keeping with the view for the regional strategy, especially considering that the team in Ecuador would be reduced to the resources required to originate new business and provide relationship management. D. Exhibit 7, pp. 59; D. Exhibit 24.
112. The discussion at that point was primarily to manage the whole relationship from Puerto Rico. This was an issue that was discussed for Ecuador as well as other markets. D. Exhibit 7, p. 53.
113. The entire CIFS business is remote. The only country at that point that was not entirely remote was Ecuador. D. Exhibit 2, p. 116.
114. Maurás participated in the design stage of deciding what the ideal business model was, but did not make the decision regarding what the final structure in Ecuador was going to be. D. Exhibit 4, p. 175. Maurás did not provide any feedback in regards to this decision in Ecuador; it was a decision made by local management. D. Exhibit 4, p. 182.
115. Besides Ecuador, all the other countries took decisions regarding changes to the structure, some more drastic than others. D. Exhibit 4, p. 175.
116. Most Financial Executives were impacted by changes that occured in other countries. Except for [*38]  Argentina, where local activity had ceased prior to the re-structuring, all other countries were impacted. D. Exhibit 4, p. 241-242.
117. Eventually, local management in Ecuador decided that the business was going to restructure at the local level towards the end of 2013. D. Exhibit 1, p. 139-140, 147; D. Exhibit 4, p. 165-166, 184. Ecuador, at that point, decided to reduce its local presence. D. Exhibit 4, p. 170. According to Caldareri, the change consisted in shutting down the Guayaquil office, which was the smaller of the two offices. Exhibit 1, p. 140, 142.
118. Although there were some employees in Guayaquil who continued to assist Caldareri, this change ultimately resulted in having less employees in both Ecuador offices, Quito and Guayaquil. D. Exhibit 4, p. 174, 180, 181. The changes meant that the main influx of new clients was to come from referrals from current clients. D. Exhibit 4, p. 171-172.
119. This change in local structure helped individual clients in that, with this structure, the business was far more capable of managing client needs and they had a structure that was more efficient and cost effective. It also limited the risk of having that structure in each country. [*39]  D. Exhibit 4, p. 179.
120. This change caused CIFS to change the way the business was managed with relation to the clients in Ecuador. The Ecuador Financial Executives, María Mercedes Ramírez and Caldareri, thus had to change the way they managed business. D. Exhibit 4, p. 183-184.
121. Prior to the change, they had a local structure that gave support to the banking activity, in addition to assisting in the management of clients. After the re-structuring, they had a structure that was not going to have the Relationship Manager providing support for banking matters. The result of not having this resource in the country implied that CIFS had to manage that activity. D. Exhibit 4, p. 183.
122. Caldareri's and María Mercedes Ramírez' employment with CIFS was not discontinued because of this reorganization. Their salary and commissions were not altered, nor were they demoted, or reassigned. In fact, their primary functions did not change as a result of this reorganization, as they were still responsible for providing investment advice. D. Exhibit 10.
123. Maurás spoke to María Mercedes Ramírez and Caldareri to explain the changes that were being implemented. D. Exhibit 4, p. 184-185.
124. Caldareri [*40]  was not in agreement with the decision because she believed that it was going to affect her business and her performance because the office that provided assistance to her shut down. D. Exhibit 4, p. 185-186. Caldareri told Maurás that this change was going to affect her and that she believed that the business was looking for a way to affect her. D. Exhibit 4, p. 186.
125. Caldareri's concern was that Mónica Guerrero ("Guerrero") was going to be terminated in the reorganization. Guerrero was the person in Guayaquil that managed banking issues and investments for Caldareri's clients. D. Exhibit 2, p. 116; D. Exhibit 4, pp. 179-180; D. Exhibit 10.

Challenges of the First Months of 2014
126. Although management in CIFS was informed that the changes in Ecuador were going to be implemented, CIFS was not provided with the time frame of those changes. D. Exhibit 10.
127. On January 14, 2014, Maurás complained to local management that the changes made in Ecuador were implemented too quickly and that a transition period was necessary. D. Exhibit 7, p. 69; D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 25. The issue was that the changes to Ecuador were implemented without coordinating with CIFS in late 2013. D. Exhibit [*41]  7, p. 71; D. Exhibit 23.
128. Thus, Maurás requested better coordination by Citibank in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 10.
129. On January 21, 2014, Maurás emailed Ecuador management regarding a recent visit to Ecuador by Caldareri, and former employee Guerrero's attempts to lure clients from Citibank. Maurás reminded Ecuador management that because the Guayaquil branch was shut down, they should be careful when handling clients from Guayaquil. Maurás stated that they would increase the number of trips to Ecuador to focus on retention efforts. Ecuador management responded that the country was acting accordingly and that the remaining employees in Guayaquil were collaborating with the efforts. Maurás responded that the information that he was receiving was to the contrary, and that he had received complaints from clients that the team in Guayaquil was not helping them. He further stated that everything related to Guayaquil had to be channeled through Caldareri. D. Exhibit 7, p. 78; D. Exhibit 10; Exhibit 26.
130. Thus, Maurás was trying to do damage control and have the country respect that the primary contact with clients was Caldareri. D. Exhibit 7, p. 78, 81.
131. Caldareri stated in a conversation [*42]  with Maurás after the 2013 reorganization that she was losing clients to competing companies. Maurás then recommended to Caldareri that, if that was the case, to concentrate on retaining clients. D. Exhibit 4, p. 191.
132. After this, on February 25, 2014, Maurás emailed Douglas Juárez, who managed the calculation of compensation for Financial Executives, requesting that an exception be granted to Caldareri, consisting of not subtracting Caldareri's draw while she continued in retention efforts. D. Exhibit 4, p. 192, 194; D. Exhibit 27. This type of exception is not requested often. D. Exhibit 3, p. 146.
133. The draw is an advance in payment issued to Financial Executives at CIFS. This advance is then generally subtracted from their commissions. D. Exhibit 2, p. 121-122.
134. The decision to allow Caldareri this exception was intended to help her with some compensation if she was unable to meet her goals. D. Exhibit 4, p. 198.
135. The exception was granted because of Maurás's request, after he held a conversation with Caldareri. Exhibit 3, p. 151. This exception was not approved for María Mercedes Ramírez, because she did not request it. D. Exhibit 4, p. 196.
136. Caldareri's performance [*43]  goal was not reduced because an Executive's obligations remain unaltered notwithstanding any incidents that may occur during the year. D. Exhibit 4, p. 197-198. How the goals for a certain portfolio are established depends on the requirements by the country's management. The country informs CIFS their revenue goals are, and CIFS management acts accordingly in assigning employees to meet them. D. Exhibit 4, p. 102.
137. However, there were concerns with Caldareri's performance regardless of the exception granted. D. Exhibit 3, p. 160.
138. The data available at the time evidenced that Caldareri's performance had dropped 84% since November 2013, and had received a substantially lower than normal payout for the past three months. Maurás clarified that the drop was expected because of the changes implemented in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 28.

Caldareri's Internal Discrimination Complaint
139. In February 2014, Caldareri complained internally of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. D. Exhibit 2, p. 66-67; D. Exhibit 3, p. 152, 156; D. Exhibit 5, p. 32, 48-49.
140. Caldareri initially approached Ramírez-Márquez because she belived that that the decision by the Ecuador local structure [*44]  to reorganize the business, particularly the closing of the Guayaquil office that provided support for her, affected her and because she felt discriminated and harassed. D Exhibit 2, p. 114. Caldareri stated she felt that she was being discriminated against, because she was a woman, and that she felt that she was being abused psychologically. D. Exhibit 2, p. 119.
141. Ramírez-Márquez requested evidence as to her claims. She also told Caldareri that she would escalate the situation with the person assigned to manage employee relations, Annette Ramírez-Castillo ("Ramírez-Castillo"), then Senior Human Resources Generalist. D. Exhibit 2, p. 119; D. Exhibit 3, p. 152, 156; D. Exhibit 5, p. 32, 48-49.
142. Ramírez-Márquez also asked Caldareri what she wanted to do with this information, and Caldareri stated that she wanted Maurás to know how she felt. Exhibit 2, p. 119.
143. When Ramírez-Márquez notified Maurás, he requested that from that point on, a Human Resources representative be present in all meetings with Caldareri to avoid any misunderstandings. D. Exhibit 2, p. 120-121; D. Exhibit 4, p. 187. Caldareri requested the same. P. Exhibit 2, pp. 191-192.
144. Maurás explained that the Ecuador [*45]  reorganization was a locally made decision, that it also affected him and affected the entire remote unit in the handling of the portfolio. He stated that he was going to provide Caldareri with the tools necessary, including a licensed assistant that would help her exclusively. He also stated that they were going to work on an exception so that they would not subtract the draw from her compensation. Finally, he stated that, if she needed to travel to conduct retention efforts, he was going to work towards an exception whenever she needed one. D. Exhibit 2, p. 121.
145. Ramírez-Castillo began the investigation by sending an email to Caldareri to set up a meeting to discuss the allegations. D. Exhibit 5, p. 50.
146. Ramírez-Castillo met twice with Caldareri. On one of those occasions, both Castro and Ramírez-Márquez were also present. D. Exhibit 2, p. 119-120; D. Exhibit 5, p. 51-52.
147. Ramírez-Castillo then met with Ramírez-Márquez to understand the concerns that she had received from Caldareri regarding the changes in the business model. In this meeting, Ramírez-Márquez also informed Ramírez-Castillo about concerns regarding communication between Caldareri and Maurás, and that Caldareri [*46]  stated that Maurás was discriminating against her. D. Exhibit 5, p. 58-59.
148. Ramírez-Castillo also received documents from Ramírez-Márquez regarding the complaint. These documents were provided by Caldareri. D. Exhibit 5, p. 51.
149. The evidence offered by Caldareri in the investigation consisted, among others, of transcripts of instant message conversations between Caldareri and other Citi employees. Ultimately, it did not provide any evidence of mistreatment, harassment, discrimination or retaliation. D. Exhibit 5, p. 51; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 29.
150. The second meeting Ramírez-Castillo held during the investigation was with Maurás on February 25, 2014. Maurás explained the changes to the business model and spoke about the communication difficulties with Caldareri in this meeting. He stated that communication with Caldareri was difficult because she disagreed with the changes to the business model. D. Exhibit 5, p. 54-55, 60-61.
151. Maurás also explained that there was a lot of information about the changes that he could not officially share with her. He explained that the changes in Ecuador were also difficult for him to manage because they were not decisions that he was making. [*47]  D. Exhibit 5, p. 61-62.
152. Maurás stated that he had been sharing information to Caldareri and María Mercedes Ramírez since mid-2013 about the local structure. He explained that when he had something final and official, he would inform them. D. Exhibit 5, p. 82.
153. Maurás expressed that Caldareri had traveled to Ecuador for two weeks and was unable to cover all the expected appointments. He also stated that she had been unable to cover her draw in December, obtained only $6,000.00 in commissions in January, but covered the draw in February. He explained that Caldareri believed that they had conspired against her with the change in business model. D. Exhibit 5, p. 80-81.
154. Maurás also stated that the situation was wearing himself and other Financial Executives down, because there was no way to speak to Caldareri. D. Exhibit 5, p. 81-82.
155. Maurás also stated that he was having problems with the Ecuador country manager because Caldareri was not being responsive. Exhibit 5, p. 85.
156. Ultimately, Maurás expressed that he was concerned on managing the day by day with Caldareri and her compensation going forward. D. Exhibit 5, p. 85.
157. Ramírez-Castillo met6 with Caldareri on February [*48]  29, 2014. D. Exhibit 5, pp. 56, 62.
158. Caldareri stated she suffered from fibromyalgia. D. Exhibit 5, p. 87. She also spoke of concerns about her relationship with Maurás, that she could not trust Maurás because he had promised certain things and had not been able to deliver, and was hurt with the way she had been treated. D. Exhibit 5, p. 52-53.
159. Caldareri also spoke of the issues with her portfolio. She stated that half of her portfolio had been removed, mentioned that there were decisions about the business that she was not in agreement with, and stated that she felt discriminated against. D. Exhibit 5, p. 53. Ramírez-Castillo recorded that she complained of discrimination because of a disability, because of gender and having a family. D. Exhibit 5, p. 101.
160. Caldareri claimed that Maurás "did something to her once" when she was out on sick leave. D. Exhibit 5, p. 87.
161. She claimed that he "is He-man, that he considers himself out of this world". D. Exhibit 5, p. 88-89. She claimed that Maurás told her that he had the power to make the decision to remove Caldareri from the Ecuador portfolios; that he stated that "I gave you Ecuador, I can take it away". D. Exhibit 5, p. [*49]  88-89.
162. She also claimed that during a leave, Maurás called her to request that she return the Argentina portfolio and that he told her that her permanent residency in the United States was going to be approved, which was a lie. Exhibit 5, p. 92.
163. She also claimed that Maurás had told her that Ecuador no longer wanted her, yet when she spoke with the country manager, the country manager denied it. D. Exhibit 5, p. 92-93.
164. She also claimed that the following year she was given a rating Partially Effective, and told her that she was a woman, and that could be a problem because she was a mother. Exhibit 5, p. 93.
165. Caldareri stated that, with regards to the evaluation, Maurás himself destroyed communication, because ultimately, he rated her as however he pleased. D. Exhibit 5, p. 98-99. She also stated that he agreed to have monthly meetings with Caldareri, and did not comply. D. Exhibit 5, p. 100.
166. In addition, she complained that everyone went to two due diligences, except her, and that he invited the whole office to eat, yet only invited her while leaving the office. D. Exhibit 5, p. 101.
167. Maurás later explained that the only reason why he invited Caldareri while exiting [*50]  the office was because Caldareri was standing outside of the office when the invitation was made. D. Exhibit 10.
168. Caldareri feared that Maurás was going to scream to her, because he had allegedly screamed on one occasion earlier. D. Exhibit 5, p. 102. In that regard, Maurás recalls having conversations with Caldareri where they had differences and may have spoken to her in an irritated tone. D. Exhibit 4, p. 190.
169. She also claimed that he did not answer her messages, that he lied to her, and did not speak to her for two (2) days, was unable to manage his emotions and did things to her on purpose. D. Exhibit 5, p. 110-113.
170. Caldareri admitted to Ramírez-Castillo that she was unable to cover the draw in December of 2013. Exhibit 5, p. 113. She also admitted that, at that production rhythm she would be unable to survive, as the new model "does not work for her", and that there was "no going back" in regards to her relationship with Maurás. D. Exhibit 5, p. 115.
171. Ramírez-Castillo agreed to speak with Maurás about Caldareri's concerns and to look for a solution. D. Exhibit 5, p. 54.
172. Ramírez-Castillo met again with Maurás. This meeting was to discuss Caldareri's specific [*51]  concerns and clarify certain matters that had been discussed previously with Ramírez-Márquez. Also, Ramírez-Castillo provided recommendations in this meeting. D. Exhibit 5, p. 63-65, 66-67.
173. Specifically, she recommended to have official meetings with Caldareri to clarify doubts and develop an action plan with Caldareri, due to Caldareri's concern that she was not receiving information relating to the changes in business model. D. Exhibit 5, p. 67; D. Exhibit 4, p. 189. The goal was to meet with Caldareri to discuss strategies so she could improve her performance. D. Exhibit 3, p. 162.
174. Ramírez-Castillo also recommended that Maurás work on improving his relationship with Caldareri, because Caldareri continued to show concerns with how Maurás communicated with her. D. Exhibit 5, p. 68-69.
175. They worked on wording of communications, not using words that might be misinterpreted, trying to explain things thoroughly when they informed her of a decision, so that she would have as much information as possible, to always maintain respect in communication with her, among other things. D. Exhibit 4, p. 189-190.
176. Maurás agreed with the recommendations. D. Exhibit 5, p. 69.
177. Afterwards, [*52]  Ramírez-Castillo had another meeting with Caldareri, where Ramírez-Márquez was also present. D. Exhibit 5, p. 70.
178. In this meeting, Ramírez-Castillo informed Caldareri that she had spoken to Maurás about her concerns, that she had recommended that they hold official meetings to discuss her concerns about actions to take and any updates or communications regarding Ecuador and the business model. D. Exhibit 5, p. 71.
179. She also recommended to Caldareri to set aside distractions that ultimatelydid not affect her and to focus on the business plan. D. Exhibit 5, p. 72-73.
180. Ramírez-Castillo ultimately concluded that the claims for discrimination and harassment were not substantiated. D. Exhibit 3, p. 158.

Caldareri's first meeting with Maurás and Ramírez to discuss her performance
181. After the first semester of 2014, Maurás and Caldareri had to continue working to achieve the production goals. D. Exhibit 4, p. 198.
182. According to the Guayaquil work plan, Caldareri had a performance goal of $74,000 in total investment revenue for January 2014. However, because she was on retention efforts, she was only able to obtain $20,442 in investment revenue, which represents a 27.62% of her [*53]  goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; D. Exhibit 31.
183. For February 2014, Caldareri had a performance goal of $78,000 in total investment revenue. Because she was on retention efforts, she was only able to obtain $19,504 in investment revenue that month, 25.01% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; D. Exhibit 31.
184. In addition, she had a performance goal of $84,000 in total investment revenue for March 2014. Because she was on retention efforts, she was only able to obtain $56,374, which represents a 67.11% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; Exhibit 31.
185. Because of this low performance, and Caldareri's previous low performance for the final months of 2013, Ramírez-Márquez and Maurás met with Caldareri on April 4, 2014. D. Exhibit 2, p. 127; D. Exhibit 4, p. 198; D. Exhibit 10.
186. On April 8, 2014, Maurás emailed Caldareri to document the discussion held on April 4. In this communication, Maurás stated that it was important to be aligned as to the strategy to follow. He also detailed the conditions that were approved in her case as an exception for her to concentrate on retaining clients, detailed the areas to work on during the following months, and the steps that [*54]  Caldareri must take to correct her performance from that point on. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 32.
187. Maurás stated that as part of the action plan, Caldareri now had to comply with the production goal as of April, 2014. He also stated that he would be contacting management in Ecuador to ensure that all communication related to offshore products from Guayaquil be managed through Caldareri. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 32.
188. In addition, Maurás requested that Caldareri identify the families of mutual funds which she felt more comfortable working with, in order to obtain a sponsorship to help attract clients. He also requested that Caldareri provide end of month lists of clients contacted, referrals and "deepening" efforts to understand the potential of growth based on her work and identify areas of opportunity for her to comply with financial goals. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 32.
189. Maurás believed that there was an opportunity in having a better allocution of assets than what Caldareri was offering to clients. D. Exhibit 4, p. 219. The issue was one of diversification. D. Exhibit 4, p. 220.
190. In that sense, CIFS developed allocation models that the business believed portfolios should [*55]  be based upon depending on the client's risk appetite. D. Exhibit 4, p. 219, 242-243.
191. Maurás believed that clients had an opportunity to be better diversified and this was verified by the allocation models. This assessment was done both by studying Caldareri's portfolio and studying each client. D. Exhibit 4, p. 220
192. Consequently, during 2014, Maurás gave Caldareri allocation models for specific clients, in order for her to see the difference and to help Caldareri when speaking to clients in order to reallocate assets. D. Exhibit 4, p. 221.
193. This was also a perfect tool for retention efforts. Not all competitors had a system like CIFS, and that was an added value that could be offered to clients. D. Exhibit 4, p. 222.
194. Finally, Maurás mentioned in the email that it was important for Caldareri to adhere to the regular work schedule. D. Exhibit 2, p. 128.
195. Because of this first communication, Caldareri was placed on the "low performers policy" once they sat down with her and explained the steps that she had to take to improve her performance. D. Exhibit 4, p. 207. What was documented and given to Caldareri is like a performance improvement plan. D. Exhibit 4, p. 208-209. [*56] 
196. During the conversations that Maurás held with Caldareri regarding her performance, Maurás specifically informed Caldareri that she had to improve her performance in regards to the areas that were being brought to her attention. D. Exhibit 4, p. 205.
197. Caldareri's performance for April did not improve. According to the work plan for Guayaquil, Caldareri had a performance goal of $88,000 in total investment revenue for April 2014. She was only able to obtain $24,188 in investment revenue, which represents a 27.49% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; D. Exhibit 31.
198. On April 16, 2014, Citibank personnel in Ecuador complained to Maurás that Caldareri was not being responsive to a client's request. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 33.

Caldareri's Request for Reasonable Accommodation
199. Caldareri requested a reasonable accommodation in April, 2014. Requests for reasonable accommodation are sent directly to Live Well at Citi, who then notifies Human Resources of the request. D. Exhibit 1, p. 150; D. Exhibit 2, p. 29, 141; D. Exhibit 3, p. 164; D. Exhibit 4, p. 201; D. Exhibit 12.
200. In the reasonable accommodation request, Plaintiff's psychiatrist stated that the diagnosis was [*57]  "bipolar depressive disorder and fibromyalgia". D. Exhibit 1, p. 161. The request also stated that the treatment was psychotherapy and pharmacology, consisting of Zoloft, Xanax, Ativan, Seroquel and Doxepin. D. Exhibit 1, p. 161. Her psychiatrist also stated that Caldareri was unable to perform the essential functions of her position. D. Exhibit 1, p. 161-162; D. Exhibit 34.
201. The request specifically stated that: "Due to an ongoing medical condition, trastorno bipolar depresivo and fibromialgia7, and the medicine being taken to treat the condition, there will be days in which she won't be able to get up from bed, that is why flexibility is recommended on the work hours and in some cases to work from her home". D. Exhibit 1, p. 162; D. Exhibit 34.
202. The request included a schedule modification ("Flexible schedule in working hours such as late entry time"); remote work ("Whenever her condition worsens") and a lightweight laptop. D. Exhibit 34.
203. In the "Duration of the Requested Accommodation" box, Caldareri's doctor marked "Permanent". D. Exhibit 34.
204. According to Caldareri, this represents the reasonable accommodation her psychiatrist believed was necessary for her condition. [*58]  D. Exhibit 1, p. 163. Caldareri stated her psychiatrist was correct in the observations she made in the document and was in agreement with her psychiatrist's statement that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her position. D. Exhibit 1, p. 163.
205. Caldareri was aware of her functions, explained her functions to her psychiatrist and her day-to-day activities. D. Exhibit 1, p. 164. Caldareri recognized that when her psychiatrist determined that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her positions, this conclusion was made with knowledge of what Caldareri's job entailed. D. Exhibit 1, p. 164.
206. Caldareri's condition worsened between the time when the request was filled and her termination from employment. D. Exhibit 1, p. 168.

Caldareri's 2014 Short Term Disability
207. In May 2014, Caldareri was placed on STD. D. Exhibit 1, p. 134, 138; D. Exhibit 2, p. 131; D. Exhibit 4, p. 199. Caldareri was then out on STD from May 1, 2014 through May 31, 2014 and June 11, 2014 through July 29, 2014. D. Exhibit 12.
208. Caldareri informed Maurás that one of the reasons she had to leave on STD was the stress caused by her work and him, and that she did not feel that she [*59]  had any support. D. Exhibit 4, p. 201.
209. Caldareri also told Ramírez-Márquez that she suffered from fibromyalgia. D. Exhibit 2, p. 87.
210. During August 2014, Caldareri reached out to Ramírez-Márquez to request that she be compensated with commissions for the period she was on leave. Caldareri explained that she had been compensated with her $80,000.00 draw, but requested that she receive an average of commissions, as she had received while on maternity leave several years before. D. Exhibit 2, p. 134-135.
211. Ramírez-Márquez then escalated this issue to the Decision Management Group. D. Exhibit 2, p. 135.
212. On August 7, 2014, Ramírez-Márquez emailed Natalia Sánchez regarding the Disability Manual's language in relation to compensation to employees who are on disability. On September 24, 2014, Ramírez-Márquez followed-up on her email regarding payments to Caldareri during her STD. She stated that the draw had already been approved, but that payment of commissions was still pending. Ramírez-Márquez' specific request was that commissions during her leave be calculated using an average of the six (6) months prior to the leave. D. Exhibit 2, p. 135; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 35.
213. [*60]  Although at that point commissions during a leave were no longer calculated using an average of the six (6) months prior to the leave, but they would request an exception for Caldareri. However, when they calculated the estimate, this included various months during 2014 where Caldareri's commissions were close to zero. Ramírez-Márquez then requested that, as an additional exception, Caldareri's estimated commissions for her leave be calculated as an average of the prior (3) three months. They made the calculation, and obtained an average of $11,695.14. D. Exhibit 2, p. 137; D. Exhibit 12.
214. As before, the exception for commissions was approved. Caldareri's remaining payment for the three months would be $11,695.14 in benefits, minus any possible adjustments. D. Exhibit 2, p. 135; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 35.
215. This amount was ultimately paid out to Caldareri in October 2014. D. Exhibit 2, p. 137; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 36; D. Exhibit 37. A prior overpayment of commissions that was improperly paid to Caldareri was deducted from the payment. D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 36; D. Exhibit 37.

Caldareri's Charge of Discrimination
216. On June 23, 2014, Caldareri filed a charge of discrimination [*61]  with the EEOC claiming disability discrimination. D. Exhibit 1, p. 148; D. Exhibit 3, p. 191; D. Exhibit 4, p. 216. Citibank was notified of said charge on July 17, 2014. D. See Exhibit 38.
217. In synthesis, Caldareri claimed in her charge to suffer severe depression, cyclothymia, anxiety and fibromyalgia. D. Exhibit 1, p. 150.
218. Once the discrimination charge was received, Ramírez-Márquez reviewed the allegations with Maurás and escalated the charge to the company's attorneys. D. Exhibit 2, p. 150.
219. By the time of the charge of discrimination was filed, Human Resources was copied in almost every communication that Maurás had with Caldareri. D. Exhibit 4, p. 217.
220. This was an agreement that had been reached with Human Resources. Both Caldareri and Maurás had previously requested that Human Resources be copied in all communications. D. Exhibit 4, p. 218.

Caldareri's Return from STD and the Final Decision on the Reasonable Accommodation Request
221. In mid-2014, Caldareri requested a reasonable accommodation, which was discussed between Human Resources, Maurás and the Compliance Unit. The decision regarding the requested accommodation was a group decision. D. Exhibit 4, p. 202-203. [*62] 
222. Silva also participated in a discussion with Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez about the options that the business had to be able to try to accommodate what Caldareri was requesting. The primary challenge was that the way that CIFS does business requires on site supervision, because the was the business model is built. There must be physical presence of the Financial Executive and supervision on site. D. Exhibit 7, p. 87.
223. They tried to contemplate different alternatives, but for Silva, allowing Caldareri to work from home was simply something that they could not do due to the nature of the business. D. Exhibit 7, p. 97.
224. The challenge with Caldareri's request was that, from the business perspective, a Financial Executive cannot permanently perform his/her job outside of the Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction, since regulations require that a Financial Executive be present at the Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction to contact clients, or have access to technology to record conversations with clients. Furthermore, information from clients cannot be taken out of company premises. D. Exhibit 3, p. 166-167.
225. CIFS's Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction is the Puerto Rico office located [*63]  at Parque Las Américas 1, 235 Federico Costa Street, Suite 101, San Juan, P.R. 00918. D. Exhibit 10.
226. Although, occasionally, a Financial Executive can work from home as an exception, and under specific terms, allowing a Financial Executive to work from home would require technology and investment. D. Exhibit 4, p. 209. Caldareri had been authorized in the past to perform certain tasks from her home incidentally. D. Exhibit 4, p. 209. However, this still would not address how client information, privileged information, supervision, and other regulatory matters would be handled. D. Exhibit 3, p. 168.
227. The FINRA regulation involved in this prohibition is Rule 3010. D. Exhibit 4, p. 210.
228. Although, Rule 3010 does reference when a residence can be considered a registered office, the rule itself specifies that the business must have supervisory procedures related to the sales activity that are conducted in the residence. CIFS' Supervisory Manual, and CIFS' supervisory procedures did not provide for the supervision of what may happen in the residence of an advisor. D. Exhibit 4, p. 211-212; D. Exhibit 40.
229. Subsection (xxviii) of Section III (Prohibited Activities) of CIFS's Supervisory Manual [*64]  reads as follows: "FEs are prohibited from conducting any business activity at their home and/or through their home computer. This practice constitutes immediate grounds for termination/deregistration. Additionally, under no circumstances may correspondence of any kind, including electronic correspondence, be sent or received through the home or home computer of a FE." D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 61, p. 32.
230. To comply with the requirement of having supervisory procedures for executing transactions outside of the Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction, it is insufficient to ask the advisor to maintain weekly logs of contacted clients and executed transactions. The process is much more complex. CIFS' experience with FINRA has demonstrated that they are very incisive in that both processes have to be well documented and must have rules to mitigate the risk that this activity may represent, both for the business and the client. D. Exhibit 4, p. 213.
231. After Caldareri returned from her STD, she spoke to Ramírez-Márquez about her request for reasonable accommodation, which had been initially denied. D. Exhibit 1, p. 168-169; D. Exhibit 4, p. 202. She asked the reason for the denial and Ramírez-Márquez [*65]  explained that part of her functions could not be performed outside of the office. D. Exhibit 1, p. 170-172.
232. Her request was originally denied because a permanent accommodation of that nature went against the internal policies for management of supervision of the structure. D. Exhibit 4, p. 202.
233. When Ramírez-Márquez and Maurás met with Caldareri to inform her of the denial of her request to work permanently from home, Caldareri asked that they reconsider the position and stated that her physician apparently had not indicated exactly what she needed. She stated that she was only requesting to work on operational and administrative, but not regulatory matters at home and arrive late at work when her condition worsened. D. Exhibit 1, p. 172; D. Exhibit 2, p. 141-142.
234. CIFS reviewed their decision, and partially changed their position. D. Exhibit 1, p. 173.
235. Caldareri's request for accommodation included the following: (1) a lightweight laptop; (2) the ability to come in late to work on those days in which her symptoms did not allow her to come in early; and, (3) the ability to work from home when her symptoms worsened. Of these three requests, two were granted fully (the [*66]  lightweight laptop and the ability to come in late to work), and the third, working from home when her symptoms worsened, was partially granted. She was informed that she could perform certain functions from her home. Specifically, she was allowed to perform operational and administrative tasks, but was not allowed to contact clients and execute transactions from her home. D. Exhibit 1, pp. 173-179; D. Exhibit 2, p. 141, 144-145; D. Exhibit 3, p. 171-172; D. Exhibit 4, p. 203, 209; D. Exhibit 39.
236. This meant that Plaintiff could not buy or sell, or interact with clients from her home when dealing with investment products. D. Exhibit 4, p. 209.
237. Ultimately, the decision was based on risk and CIFS's ability to properly comply with regulatory requirements. To do otherwise, risked regulatory noncompliance, which the business was not willing to take. D. Exhibit 7, p. 88-89. The concern was one of risk compliance and regulations. D. Exhibit 7, p. 99.

Caldareri's Performance From August through November, 2014
238. After Caldareri returned from her STD, her performance continued to fail to meet expectations, and CIFS received complaints from business partners and clients about her. D. [*67]  Exhibit 4, p. 224, 227-228; D. Exhibit 10.
239. Pursuant to the Guayaquil work plan, Caldareri had a performance goal of $83,000 in total investment revenue for the month of August, 2014. However, she was only able to obtain $24,799, which represents a 29.88% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; D. Exhibit 31.
240. On September 3, 2014, Fabián Garzón, a Citibank official in Ecuador, contacted Maurás to hold a conference call regarding attention to clients in Guayaquil. D. Exhibit 41.
241. On September 17, 2014, Caldareri complained to Maurás regarding the transfer of client Alfredo Virgilio Escobar from her portfolio to Miami. Maurás responded that the client had complained on various occasions of the servicing of his account and after consulting with Maurás, decided that his needs were better served in the model managed from Citibank in Miami. D. Exhibit 6, p. 134; D. Exhibit 42.
242. Ultimately, the request was placed by the customer who wanted to leave the firm. These types of requests are handled in CIFS by the Operations Department, but a signed document by the customer is required. Furthermore, the Financial Executive managing the account would not be notified of the outgoing [*68]  account until after the document is generated. D. Exhibit 6, p. 136-138.
243. In addition, CIFS cannot transfer a customer from one branch to another without a written authorization by the client. D. Exhibit 6, p. 140.
244. On September 29, 2014, Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez met again with Caldareri to discuss her performance for August, 2014. Maurás asked Caldareri to come prepared to discuss information related to clients contacted, referrals obtained from the country and of her own volition, and "deepening" activity. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 43.
245. Maurás later confirmed in writing the matters discussed during the meeting. Specifically, in an email dated October 6, 2014, Maurás summarized the matters that had to be worked on by Caldareri in order to improve her performance. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44.
246. First, Maurás instructed Caldareri to increase contact with clients using approved company methods. Maurás stated that Caldareri had to increase her contact with clients versus what was evidenced in CIFS's internal systems, since it was important to provide advice to clients and identify business opportunities. In addition, he instructed Caldareri to discontinue [*69]  contacting clients through unapproved methods to avoid a violation of regulations, because she had previously stated she had used unapproved methods to contact clients. D. Exhibit 10, D. Exhibit 44.
247. Caldareri confirmed to Maurás that she had spoken to clients from her residence, which was not an approved method to contact clients. D. Exhibit 4, p. 214-215. Caldareri also informed Ramírez-Márquez that she had been contacting clients through the instant messaging application "Whatsapp". D. Exhibit 12.
248. Contacting clients with a cell phone is a violation of CIFS procedures if used for buying and selling investment products. D. Exhibit 4, p. 215.
249. Second, Maurás instructed Caldareri to increase the processes of "acquisition" and "deepening". Maurás informed Caldareri that, according to CIFS's internal systems, the "Net New Money" indicator was not showing the expected performance. Maurás told Caldareri that she had to work on a plan to increase deposits and new accounts. He suggested that Caldareri execute an added value activity that would raise interest of existing clients in referring new prospects. He reminded Caldareri that, for this task, she could contact a wholesaler [*70]  from one of the mutual funds that works with them, who would assume the cost of the activity, or request support from CIFS's Products Unit. Maurás also informed Caldareri that he would be requesting a detailed report of her performance for the end of the third quarter, in regards to the "Net New Money" and "acquisition" indicators, to determine any discrepancy. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44.
250. Third, as to "Gross Production" and "Asset Allocation Performance", Maurás informed Caldareri that she had to work to increase her production, as the $24,000.00 registered for August was considerably below expectations. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44.
251. To work on this issue, Maurás attached to the email two (2) exercises he designed with the Products Unit to identify diversification opportunities in regards to portfolio risk, to apply to portfolios where Caldareri had a high concentration of only one product. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44.
252. In the first exercise, they looked at Caldareri's larger clients and they evaluated the same against Citi's recommendations and determined that: (1) the accounts were not aligned with the client's profile; (2) there was a large concentration in the account [*71]  in fixed income products, as well as "High Yield" and "Emerging Market" sectors; (3) she had to offer clients an element of diversification; (4) in the fixed income products, there were products that had a risk of duration, and some products that CIFS had recommended to exit; and, (5) the exposure to Mutual Funds was limited. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44; D. Exhibit 45.
253. In the second exercise, Maurás evaluated the remainder of Caldareri's portfolio to identify re-balancing opportunities. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44; D. Exhibit 46.
254. Maurás closed his communication stating that he would await to hear from Caldareri what efforts she had undertaken regarding client contact and management of her portfolio, to have a better understanding of how she was operating at the moment and identify additional opportunities. Maurás asked her for evidence of her efforts. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 44.
255. The following day, September 30, 2014, Caldareri emailed Maurás and Ramírez Márquez to inform them that because of the meeting held the previous day she spent the evening with tachycardia and high blood pressure and would be absent from work. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 47.
256. [*72]  The same day, Caldareri emailed Marcelle Díaz Brugueras ("Díaz"), the Business Control Unit Manager, to notify her that she would be managing a certain transaction personally when she returned to work, as she did not want to put anyone on the spot given the distrust in her commitment. Díaz responded to Caldareri that nobody had stated anything about distrust in her work. D. Exhibit 6, p. 151-152; D. Exhibit 48.
257. Díaz recalled the situation very well. Díaz had requested that a certain client order be placed in writing because the request was unusual, since Caldareri was in Puerto Rico at the time and, usually in those cases, the Financial Executives would place the order themselves. D. Exhibit 6, p. 153-154.
258. It was not normal for a Financial Executive to place a trade from her home, because it could have placed CIFS's FINRA license at risk. D. Exhibit 6, p. 155-156. In fact, Díaz had never heard of a case where a Financial Executive used his or her primary residence as a place to work out of. D. Exhibit 6, p. 157.
259. To Díaz, Caldareri's reaction was explosive and struck her as odd, considering what was being requested from Caldareri, and Díaz was taken aback by Caldareri's [*73]  reaction. D. Exhibit 6, p. 164-165.
260. Anything out of the normal process of things is typically documented. D. Exhibit 6, p. 167.
261. After the incident occurred, Díaz discussed it with Maurás and asked him if her request was inadequate. Maurás responded that it was not, and that he would have requested the same thing. D. Exhibit 6, p. 169.
262. According to the Guayaquil work plan, Caldareri had a performance goal of $93,000 in total investment revenue for the month of September 2014. However, she was only able to obtain $26,836, which represents 28.86% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30.
263. On October 2, 2014, client Antonio Jara emailed Caldareri stating that he was not satisfied with not having received communication regarding the loss of value of bonds he held through Citibank. He also complained about a bond sale managed by María Mercedes Ramírez. He stated that Caldareri had promised to answer his claims regarding this issue during Caldareri's last visit to Ecuador, and nothing had come of that. He then found out that she had returned to Ecuador and did not contact him for a meeting. He closed by stating that because of these issues, he was going to search for service [*74]  in another bank. Caldareri forwarded the email to Vásquez and Ramírez-Márquez stating that Maurás was defaming her, claiming that the issue with this client was primarily Maurás's fault. Her claim was that Maurás had faulted Caldareri with the client when Maurás spoke to the client. She complained again about Maurás alleging discrimination and retaliation. D. Exhibit 49.
264. However, when Maurás spoke to the client, the conversation was limited to Maurás receiving the client's complaint and assuring the client that Maurás would work on a solution. Maurás did not fault Caldareri in this conversation with the client, nor did he give the client any excuse related to this complaint. After he spoke to the client, Maurás conveyed the information provided by him to Caldareri. D. Exhibit 10.
265. On that same day, Maurás emailed Caldareri. He stated that he was told that Caldareri would be out of work for that day, making it the third consecutive day where she had been absent, and told her she had to bring a medical certificate the day she returned to work. Caldareri responded that she had been working from home all three days in accordance with her reasonable accommodation and that no medical [*75]  certificate was required. Maurás replied that her reasonable accommodation was associated to incidental situations and not prolonged absences from work. He reminded her that she was not authorized to work from home in transactions with clients. Caldareri responded the following day that Americans with Disabilities Act allowed her to work from home whenever her condition did not allow her to leave her house. D. Exhibit 2, p. 145; D. Exhibit 50.
266. The request for medical certificates was made because Ramírez-Márquez asked Maurás if she was providing them, and he stated that she was not. Maurás then told Caldareri that she had to provide a certificate when she was absent from the office for more than three consecutive days. D. Exhibit 2, p. 145.
267. Caldareri's absence was becoming habitual, and her primary task was contacting clients. D. Exhibit 2, p. 145.
268. On October 15, 2014, Caldareri emailed Ramírez-Márquez and Vásquez complaining that Maurás carried favoritism with some brokers. She stated that Marco Bigotti and Luis Fernández, whom she claimed were backups of one another, were both out of the office that week, but that when María Mercedes Ramírez and herself wanted to travel at the same time, Maurás did [*76]  not authorize the travel. D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 54.
269. Maurás explained that there were other Financial Executives who provided advice to Argentina, the country that Bigotti and Fernández advised. Thus, if they were both traveling at the same time, there would still be Financial Executives that could answer a call from an Argentinean client, if that client were to call when they were not present. However, because María Mercedes Ramírez and Caldareri were the only two Financial Executives for Ecuador, if neither was present, no one would be able to properly advise a client who called. D. Exhibit 10.
270. Furthermore, it was not habitual for Bigotti and Fernández to travel at the same time, and even though María Mercedes Ramírez and Caldareri should not travel at the same time, on occasion, because of specific business needs, they had done so. D. Exhibit 10.
271. On October 14, 2014, Maurás received a letter from client Vicente Negrete Alvear, who complained of the poor attention that clients in Guayaquil were receiving since the reorganization of 2013. Maurás spoke to the client, and he expressed that the primary concern was a lack of contact and advice on investment related matters. [*77]  Based on this complaint, Maurás decided to transfer the client to another Financial Executive, and notified Caldareri of this decision that same day. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 52; D. Exhibit 53.
272. On October 16, 2014, Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez met with Caldareri to discuss her performance for September. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 12.
273. Maurás later confirmed in writing the matters discussed in this meeting in an email dated October 30, 2014: (1) there continued to be poor evidence of client contact, and they continued to receive client complaints regarding service; (2) "acquisition" and "deepening" had been limited and she had confirmed as much in the meeting; (3) no proposal had been received from Caldareri to work on "acquisition" and "deepening"; (4) her primary functions related to "Gross Production" was limited to providing advice to twenty (20) clients from a portfolio of more than two hundred and twenty (220), which confirmed his concern that Caldareri was not contacting clients. Maurás also stated in the email that her performance was only $26,000 for September, which did not comply with any goals, that her portfolio continued to be highly concentrated in products that [*78]  were not in agreement with what CIFS recommended, and that she was not registering risky transactions in accordance with compliance policies. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 55.
274. Maurás closed the email by stating that their evaluation continued to reflect deficiencies in processes that were important to reach regulatory and commercial client goals. He urged Caldareri to quickly improve to limit any risk associated with her poor performance. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 55.
275. The next day, Caldareri emailed Maurás, Ramírez-Márquez and Vásquez to inform them that she would be working from home, since her physical and emotional state after the meeting held the previous day did not allow her to come in to work. D. Exhibit 12; D. Exhibit 56.
276. On October 22, 2014, Maurás emailed Caldareri to notify her that client Carlos Garzón contacted him in the office regarding a refund of a commission that Caldareri had promised. He stated that he also had some money deposited that he wanted to invest, but had been unable to do so because of Caldareri's lack of presence in the office. Maurás assigned the transaction to Norvin Ulloa, but informed Caldareri that the client [*79]  would continue in her portfolio and that she would continue to service him. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 57.
277. On October 30, 2014, Caldareri responded to Maurás, stating that the reasons for removing the client were unfounded and that they amounted to an adverse employment action based on discrimination. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 57.
278. On November 3, 2014, Maurás responded that the decisions made with regards to her portfolio had been made to ensure the well-functioning of the business. He also stated that the client was not being removed from her portfolio and that she would continue to service him. He also reminded her that they had received other customer complaints and that no discriminatory action had been taken against her. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 58.
279. According to the Guayaquil work plan, Caldareri had a performance goal of $93,000 in total investment revenue for October, 2014. However, she was only able to obtain $28,145, which represents a 30.26% of her goal. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 30; D. Exhibit 31.

Dismissal
280. Maurás requested to Human Resources that Caldareri's performance be evaluated after these events to determine what course to follow as to her continued [*80]  employment with CIFS. D. Exhibit 10.
281. The request to terminate Caldareri was prompted by the employee's performance throughout the year, the fact that an improvement was not seen, that performance continued to deteriorate, and that complaints were being received from clients regarding service. D. Exhibit 3, p. 194. In addition, CIFS also continued to receive complaints from local management in Ecuador regarding Caldareri. D. Exhibit 3, p. 194.
282. The main concern was the lack of improvement in performance, meaning financial goals, complaints from clients and complaints from business partners. D. Exhibit 3, p. 195.
283. Maurás believed that Caldareri's dismissal was warranted because they had exhausted the tools and resources at hand to obtain different results from Caldareri and there had been no way to manage the relationship with Caldareri. They exhausted all possible methods to steer the relationship another way and they understood that it was time to end the relationship, because no improvement was seen. D. Exhibit 4, p. 231.
284. Vásquez advised in the decision to terminate Caldareri from the Human Resources perspective. Exhibit 3, p. 192. Marcelo Coscarelli, Silva, the Legal [*81]  Department and Maurás were also involved in the decision. D. Exhibit 3, p. 192-193.
285. Vásquez considered that there was no improvement in performance, which continued to deteriorate, that they continued to receive complaints and concerns from clients, and that there were communication issues and complaints from business partners in the decision-making process. D. Exhibit 3, p. 223-224.
286. Silva notified Caldareri of the decision to terminate her. D. Exhibit 7, p. 107. The business understood that it was desirable that Silva execute the dismissal, given the animosity between Caldareri and Maurás. D. Exhibit 7, p. 117.
287. Silva was made aware that this was the decision of the business and he did not object to the same. D. Exhibit 7, p. 107.
288. Caldareri's termination was executed on November 14, 2014. D. Exhibit 10.
289. According to Caldareri, Silva mentioned four (4) reasons for her termination: (1) her 2014 performance was lower than her 2013 performance; (2) she would come in late to work and/or would not come in to work; (3) she declined to sell mutual funds; and (4) failure to correctly communicate with clients. D. Exhibit 1, p. 193-195; Exhibit 7, p. 32.
290. Caldareri admits [*82]  that she did not comply with her goals in 2014. D. Exhibit 1, p. 238.
291. Caldareri's absenteeism and tardiness was considered in the decision to terminate her to the extent these matters were affecting client service. D. Exhibit 10.
292. Mutual Fund sales has always been a goal for Financial Advisors because it is a component of the many products managed by the business, and generate a fee when purchased. D. Exhibit 4, p. 155, 156.
293. CIFS's interest is that clients have a correct allocation of products, more than having a specific product. D. Exhibit 4, p. 157. What Maurás urged Caldareri to do was take into consideration a better allocation of assets. D. Exhibit 4, p. 159.
294. Ultimately, the reason for termination was Plaintiff's performance. D. Exhibit 7, p. 121. She was performing at a quarter of what the target was D. Exhibit 3, p. 199.
295. Caldareri claims that during the dismissal meeting, Silva asked Camacho to verify that Caldareri not steal the "carry-on" which Citibank had assigned Caldareri to carry her computer. D. Exhibit 1, p. 195.
296. Caldareri does not know who made the decision to terminate her. D. Exhibit 1, p. 195-196.
297. After Caldareri's termination, she was [*83]  replaced with Carlos Torres. D. Exhibit 2, p. 154. Torres was given the Guayaquil portfolio, and he would improve the performance of the portfolio shortly after Caldareri's termination. D. Exhibit 10.
298. Immediately after the termination, Caldareri was visibly affected by the same. Silva and Camacho had decided that it would be desirable that Caldareri not return to her work area. She was informed that, if she needed anything, they could retrieve it for her and gave her the opportunity to contact someone if she needed transportation. D. Exhibit 7, p. 124.

PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS PURSUANT TO HER DEPOSITION TESTIMONY

1. Caldareri believes that Defendants discriminated against her because of her physical and emotional conditions for the following reasons:
a. At the beginning of 2012, during María Mercedes Ramírez' pregnancy leave, Caldareri was asked to support the Quito portfolio, soon after having suffered a fall and having a broken arm. Caldareri claims that Maurás stated that he did not believe that she would be able to comply with servicing both Quito and Guayaquil because of her condition.
b. Maurás stated that he did not care about her condition when they discussed the 2012 Year End Evaluation. [*84]  D. Exhibit 1, p. 180,186-187.
2. Caldareri charges that Maurás allegedly stated that he believed that she would not be able to comply with "company policy" due to her condition. She claims that the first time he made this statement was early in 2012. D. Exhibit 1, p. 191.
3. Caldareri believes that her sex motivated her termination for the following reasons:
a. Early in 2013, during the discussion of the 2012 evaluation, Maurás allegedly mentioned the plaintiff's gender;
b. One occasion, in 2013 or 2014, Maurás went to lunch with all the male brokers, and did not invite Caldareri; D. Exhibit 1, p. 196
c. Maurás spoke to her about her clothes, her hair and her weight. D. Exhibit 1, p. 197;
i. He commented that she needed to color her hair on more than five occasions; D. Exhibit 1, p. 199
ii. He commented that she always dressed in black; D. Exhibit 1, p. 199;
iii. On one occasion, in 2013, due to a visit from Marcelo Coscarelli, Silva and Maurás asked Caldareri to wear pants to cover up tattoos Caldareri had on her feet. D. Exhibit 1, p. 199;
iv. On one occasion, while at a restaurant after Caldareri had lost weight, he stared at her behind and exclaimed "Wow, I have a new employee!" D. Exhibit [*85]  1, p. 200-201.
4. Caldareri claims that, on one occasion, between June and September of 2011, she showed Maurás a picture of lighting fixtures she had installed in her apartment and his response was "Wow, you can't have a single pimple". D. Exhibit 1, p. 197-198.
5. Maurás spoke to Caldareri regarding non-compliance with the company's dress code. D. Exhibit 4, p. 239. He commented about the way she dressed because it did not comply with company policy, and had to be verbally admonished. D. Exhibit 4, p. 109-110.
6. As a matter of fact, Ramírez-Márquez asked Maurás to verbally admonish Caldareri for failing to comply with the company dress policy on various occasions. D. Exhibit 12.
7. Caldareri believes that Maurás was envious of her success. D. Exhibit 1, p. 119.
8. On one occasion, in 2011 or 2012, a Mutual Fund called Sun Life, messaged Caldareri to thank her for participating in a Due Diligence meeting, in which she had not participated. When she notified that she had not participated, she later found out that only men had participated in that specific Due Diligence. D. Exhibit 1, p. 229-230, 233.
9. According to Caldareri, the person who decided the individuals that travel to a Due [*86]  Diligence was Maurás. However, she does not know what criteria was used to determine which employees would travel, and does not know if any females ever traveled to a due diligence. D. Exhibit 1, p. 231.
10. Caldareri claims that when she confronted Maurás about this matter, he stated: (1) that it was a mistake, and, (2) that it was because she did not sell mutual funds. Caldareri cadmitted that she did, in fact, sell mutual funds, but not as much as other Financial Analysts. D. Exhibit 1, p. 234-236.
11. CIFS sometimes sent Financial Executives to mutual fund seminars. D. Exhibit 4, p. 104. To determine who participated, many factors were considered. D. Exhibit 4, p. 104. The decision of who goes to the seminars is management's decision. Generally, the Fund will go to management with a list of candidates, and from that list, management decides who participates. It could happen that the Fund did not comply follow this process and notified an advisor prior to the business's approval. D. Exhibit 4, p. 107.
12. Caldareri participated in some of those seminars. D. Exhibit 4, p. 105. According to CIFS' records, Caldareri participated in three mutual fund seminars between 2006 and 2011. Other [*87]  employees that participated in three or less seminars during that same period of time were: José Acebedo, Lucas Ibarra, Adrián Quinteros, Isaías Rodríguez, Dan Tanner, Leonardo Chiodo, Hernán Sapia, Ezequiel Sporleder, Michael Odishelidze, Sonia Galaxe, Andrés Hanania, Frederik Ramos, Italo Reverdito, Alejandra Petrachini, Carlos Torres, Maurás, María Mercedes Ramírez, Máximo González, Fernando Campoo, Alejandro Vicens, Cesar V. Reyna, Alfonso Figueroa, Fernanda Valongo, Marcelle Díaz, Norvin Ulloa, and Kennett Rivera. Furthermore, only two employees went to more seminars than Caldareri during that same period: Luis Fernández and Marco Bigotti. D. Exhibit 10; D. Exhibit 59.
13. Caldareri understands that her dismissal was in retaliation for the following reasons:
a. She alleges that after filing the charge of discrimination, the conduct directed towards her "intensified":
i. Even though the reasonable accommodation request of being allowed to come in to work late was granted, they requested that she provide information on her status (the doctor's note).
ii. They informed her that a client requested a change of broker. Initially, she was informed that the change would not be made. However, [*88]  eventually, the client was assigned to Norvin Ulloa.
iii. Another client was removed from her portfolio even though the client did not name Caldareri in his complaint.
iv. Maurás allegedly instructed her to not copy Human Resources in their communications. However, Human Resources instructed Caldareri to continue copying them.
v. She met with Ramírez on multiple occasions after the filing of the charge to complain that she was not receiving any assistance.
vi. That, during her dismissal, she was kept in Human Resources for forty (40) minutes, she was not permitted to leave the office, nor to take with her a picture of her children. No one was allowed access to the office either. Camacho stood in front of the door with her arms extended to impede the plaintiff from exiting the office.
vii. She was lied to, to have her go to Human Resources the day of the dismissal. Maurás had informed her that it was for a meeting relating to the change of business model in Ecuador. D. Exhibit 1, p. 240-253.
14. Caldareri claims ERISA violations because when she was in Short Term Disability in 2010, her compensation was calculated according to a formula determined by the company, where she was compensated [*89]  with commissions. However, for her 2014 short term disability, Caldareri only received payment of her draw. D. Exhibit 1, p. 255.

LEGAL ANALYSIS
Defendants posit that all claims against them should be dismissed for a variety of reasons, namely: 1) most of the claims are time-barred; 2) Plaintiff fails to proffer direct evidence of discrimination for the only two (2) remaining actions that are not timebarred; 3) she is unable to present a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII as to the 2013 reorganization; 4) she fails to present a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA or establish a failure to accommodate claim; 5) Defendants have proffered legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the 2013 reorganization and Plaintiff's termination and she cannot prove pretext; 6) she cannot establish a claim for harassment under Title VII and the ADA because the alleged conduct was not sufficiently severe and pervasive as to alter her terms and conditions of employment; 7) lack of causal connection to establish a prima facie case of retaliation; 8) no supervisory liability for Maurás; and 9) she was compensated under ERISA according to the Short-Term Disability plan in place [*90]  at the time of her leave. In addition, Defendants aver that Plaintiff's supplemental claims, brought under state law must, be dismissed as well.

A. Time Bar.
It has been well established that under Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA, a plaintiff must file an employment-discrimination charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) (2000) (noting Title VII's charge-filing requirement); Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275, 277-78 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that Title VII's charge-filing requirement applies to the ADA). Thus, a plaintiff is estopped from litigating claims based on conduct falling outside of this period.
Defendants contend that, because Plaintiffs' discrimination claims under Title VII and ADA are based on alleged discriminatory actions which occurred between one and a half (1 1/2) and more than seven (7) years prior to the filing of the charge, many of them are time-barred. Defendants claim the alleged actions are disconnected among themselves and constitute discrete actions, and Plaintiff cannot establish that they were part of a continuing violation, which is Plaintiff's defense against dismissal here. The date of Plaintiff's last actionable claim is February 27, 2013. Thus, Defendants proffer Plaintiff had [*91]  until December 24, 2013 to file a claim for the last of these actions and she failed to do so. The charge of discrimination was filed on June 23, 2014.
When a violation is "of a continuing nature, the charge of discrimination filed ... may be timely as to all discriminatory acts encompassed by the violation so long as the charge is filed during the life of the violation or within the statutory period...." Pilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 868 (1st Cir. 1997) (internal quotations omitted). Continuing violations can be systemic or serial. Id. at 869. Systemic violations occur where an employer maintains a discriminatory policy, responsible for multiple discriminatory acts that may fall outside of the limitations period, which is not the case here. Id. Serial violations occur where the plaintiff experiences a number of similar discriminatory acts arising from the same discriminatory animus. Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 400 (1st Cir. 1990). Such acts are timely if at least one discriminatory event exposes a pattern of actionable discrimination which occurs within the statutory period that anchors the earlier claims. Id.
In O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713 (1st Cir. 2001), the First Circuit set forth three (3) factors to assess the sufficiency of a serial-continuing-violation claim, to wit: (1) whether the subject matter of the discriminatory acts [*92]  is sufficiently similar to render the otherwise untimely acts substantially related to the timely acts; (2) whether the acts occur frequently, repetitively, or continuously or are isolated and discrete; and (3) whether the acts are sufficiently permanent to make the plaintiff aware of the need to assert his or her rights. O'Rourke, 235 F.3d 713, 731 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).
The actions complained of that Defendants aver are time-barred are the following, which range over a span of eight (8) years:
a. The first change to Caldareri's portfolio — when she assumed accounts of Quito, Ecuador — occurred in March of 2006;
b. The second change to her portfolio — when she assumed the accounts of Guayaquil, Ecuador — occurred in July 2007;
c. The changes to the Tuition Reimbursement Policy, that prevented Caldareri from requesting further tuition reimbursement, were adopted on May 1, 2009;
d. The expiration of her visa occurred on May 19, 2010;
e. The third change to Plaintiff's portfolio, which added an additional Financial Executive for Ecuador occurred on January 1, 2011, when María Mercedes Ramírez was named to the position of Financial Executive for Ecuador;
f. Caldareri's original 2012 Performance Evaluation was executed [*93]  on January 30, 2013, and was later revised on February 27, 2013.
Faced with this time bar argument, Plaintiff attempts in her defense to create a "pattern" of discrimination through Maurás' actions for events in 2013, which would fall inside the 300 day window, to anchor her claims in support of the "substantially similar" argument that O'Rourke requires. Plaintiff argues that "the same person [Maurás] is involved throughout the entire spectrum of facts in the same supervisory role and against the same person for essentially the same reasons, namely, gender and disability" to stand for the proposition that the actions are similar. (Docket no. 91, p. 32).
The Court cannot agree, and Plaintiffs cite no caselaw to evidence that actions can be considered similar simply because the same supervisor is involved throughout the claimed time. Caselaw has held that Plaintiff must demonstrate that the actions complained of are sufficiently similar and occurred from the same discriminatory animus in order to shoulder their burden. Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F. 3d 38, 53-55 (1st Cir. 1999).
The Court examines the allegedly time-barred actions first. Regarding the two instances, adding more cities to Plaintiff's portfolio, can hardly be deemed negative. On the contrary, [*94]  Plaintiff complained when items were taken away from her portfolio. Furthermore, said acts were in 2006 and 2007, before she initially disclosed her disability to Citibank, which happened in 2010. Plaintiff's allegation that "[o]n (sic) 2007 Maurás was Caldareri's supervisor when the Ecuador portfolio was first stripped from her"8 finds absolutely no support on this record. If anything, it was Argentina that was taken away from her in 2007, for an entirely different reason, that is, institutionally, it had been decided that said clients would be serviced from Uruguay. An offer to service this portfolio from Uruguay was made to Plaintiff, and she rejected it. The Court can find no discriminatory intent on these actions.
The tuition changes that occurred in 2009 also present problems for Plaintiff, because at the time this event happened, she had not yet disclosed her disability to Citibank. Additionally, another male employee, Fernández, was likewise denied the tuition reimbursement. No gender or disability discrimination can therefore be attributed to this change. Furthermore, although Plaintiff alleges that "Maurás again played a role" in denying her tuition benefits, this in spite [*95]  of the fact that she was not under his supervision at this time, there is no evidence on the record to sustain this fact. Quite the opposite, the uncontested facts show that Caldareri was allowed said reimbursement for a time, specifically when the rules stated she did not qualify for it due to her high salary.
Regarding the visa matter, it is again uncontested that Maurás had nothing to do with the expiration of her visa. Plaintiff in fact states that his mistake was that "he spoke without knowing", but it is uncontested that outside attorneys and the immigration service dealt with this matter exclusively, and that this decision was completely outside Maurás' control. Furthermore, another male, Fernández was also affected, so once again, no discriminatory intent due to gender can be attributed to these facts. It was around this time that Plaintiff initially disclosed her disability to Citibank, yet she has proffered no facts from which to the Court can infer that Citibank dragged out her visa issue due to disability discrimination. If nothing else, once Plaintiff left Puerto Rico for Argentina while she obtained visa, Citibank waited for her and she was able to return to her job once [*96]  the matter had been resolved, which took over one (1) year.
The change to the Ecuador portfolio, which occurred in 2011, added a female executive to Ecuador portfolio, María Mercedes Ramírez. Once again, the uncontested facts show that this change came exclusively via a petition from the country, and therefore no discriminatory intent can be inferred. There is no evidence on the record to sustain Plaintiff's allegation that Maurás was responsible for this action and she proffers none, except her self-sustaining word.
Finally, the 2012 evaluation (revised on February 27, 2013) is the only thing that Mauras was in exclusive control of, when he rated Plaintiff as "partially effective". Yet, one single act by the alleged culprit cannot be considered discriminatory and pervasive.
The actions mentioned above are different in and of themselves, and have little or nothing to do with each other. Thus, the Court finds the past actions cannot meet the "sufficiently similar" and "occurred from the same discriminatory animus" threshold.
Regarding the actions that occurred inside the 300-day window, even assuming Plaintiff was correct, the record is clear that Maurás was not the only person involved [*97]  in those subsequent actions, to wit, complaining about Plaintiff's absences, in originally denying her accommodation request of 2014, or who pushed for her ultimate dismissal. The facts show that these actions all were undertaken by a group of people, which included Maurás as Plaintiff's supervisor, and therefore cannot stand for the proposition that Maurás alone is responsible. Furthermore, the change in Ecuador business model, which Plaintiff claims was "led" by Maurás, equally finds no support on this record, which clearly indicates was a matter undertaken and decided exclusively by Citibank Ecuador and no one else, and which will be discussed in more detail below. While Maurás might have helped set up or design the ideal model due to his experience, the ultimate decision of how each country moved forward rested with each country.
Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that these alleged acts are sufficiently similar and based on the same discriminatory animus.
Regarding the second prong, that the actions occurred frequently or repetitively or on the other hand, sparsely, the record evidences that the acts complained occurred over a span of almost eight [*98]  (8) years, beginning in 2006. It can hardly be said that they were frequent or continuous. In fact, over two (2) years elapsed between Plaintiff's 2012 Performance Evaluation and the previous alleged discriminatory action, the hiring of María Mercedes Ramírez and the subsequent division of the Ecuador portfolio. The case of O'Rourke, which Plaintiffs rely on to support this claim, dealt with hostile work environment comments of a sexual nature, which occurred much more frequently and pervasively, and spanned a timeframe of three (3) years, which is not the case here.
As to the third prong, and as Defendants correctly point out, the acts here were sufficiently permanent to make Plaintiff aware of the need to assert her rights, and the record shows that she complained internally about most, if not all of these issues.
For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that all the aforementioned acts were discrete, and cannot be considered "continuing" in nature. All these actions occurred way before Plaintiff filed her EOOC claim. As such, it is recommended to the Court to find time-barred the above mentioned actions, but for the 2013 reorganization, Maurás' comments and Plaintiff's ultimate dismissal [*99]  which are actionable.

B. ADA and gender discrimination.
To prevail on a disability discrimination claim, a plaintiff must meet certain requirements by a preponderance of the evidence. She may do so by presenting direct evidence of discrimination or indirectly by using the prima facie case and burden shifting methods that originated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (1973). Although claiming to have direct evidence of discrimination, Plaintiffs failed to present such evidence in their opposition, and the Court must therefore focus on the McDonnell standard.
The McDonnell analysis requires a plaintiff to offer evidence sufficient to establish that she (1) has a disability within the meaning of the [ADA]; (2) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action; (4) was replaced by or treated less favorably than a non-disabled employee; and (5) suffered damages as a result. Id. For gender discrimination she must establish: (1) that she is a member of a protected class; (2) that an adverse employment action was taken against her; (3) that she was otherwise qualified for such position; and (4) that a similarly situated male was treated differently. [*100]  DeCaire v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2008).
For both of these, if she establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action. Freadman i. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 99 (1st Cir.2007); see also McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Once the employer offers a non-discriminatory reason, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's justification is mere pretext cloaking discriminatory animus. Freadman, 484 F.3d at 99.
It is important to note that the ADA and Title VII protect disabled individuals from discrimination. Therefore, as part of Plaintiff's burden, she must present evidence that she suffered "an adverse employment action because of that disability" or gender, that is, as part of her prima facie case, she must present "evidence suggesting the presence of [a] disability-based discrimination." E.E.O.C. v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 142 (1st Cir. 1997). It is Plaintiff's burden to prove the necessary causal relationship between her disability or gender and the termination from employment; that is, Plaintiff must have been dismissed "because of" her disability or her gender. Champagne v. Servistar Corp., 138 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1998).
i. The Change in Business Model: The 2013 Reorganization.
The parties agree that Caldareri had a disability, yet disagree whether or not she was able to perform the essential functions of her job. Indeed, Caldareri herself [*101]  admitted that she was unable to perform the essential duties of her job, as did her psychiatrist.9 Giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, however, the Court assumes (without deciding for this analysis) that a prima facie case can be made and she was able to perform the essential duties of her job with an accommodation. It also assumes that some adverse employment action may occurred, insofar as the Guayaquil office shut down and Plaintiff had less support, this in spite of the fact that Plaintiff's primary functions did not change, her salary and commissions were not altered, and she was not demoted, or reassigned. The Court instead focuses of the legitimate non-discriminatory reasons provided by Defendants, and finds Plaintiff cannot meet her burden.
It stands uncontested that the 2013 reorganization that resulted in the closing of the Guayaquil office came about when Citibank in Latin America analyzed the different structures in each country to pursue the ideal business model in 2013, and considered many different factors to be able to construct the best model for client service. It is also uncontested that each country's management determined how to ultimately temper and implement [*102]  their model.
In the case of Ecuador, its management decided to reduce their local presence, looking to diversify their assets and grow, while eliminating local risk. This ultimately resulted in having less employees in both Ecuador offices, Quito and Guayaquil. For Plaintiff, she proffers it resulted in the shutdown of the Guayaquil office which she serviced, and she had a more difficult time managing her portfolio because of the lessened presence.
Although Plaintiff alleges that Maurás "led" said reorganization effort, she offers no evidence for this claim. On the contrary, the uncontested facts evidence that, although Maurás participated in the design stage of designing the ideal business model as he had experience in that field, he did not make the ultimate decision regarding what the final structure in Ecuador, or any other country for that matter, would be. In the end, Citibank in Ecuador had well anchored reasons, from the poor performance of the local structure to an interest in reducing costs, to reorganize. Furthermore, besides Ecuador, all other countries took decisions regarding changes to the structure, some more drastic than others.
Title VII was not "intended to protect [*103]  [ ] workers from the often harsh economic realities of common business decisions and hardships associated with corporate reorganizations, downsizing, plant closings and relocations." Allen v. Diebold. Inc., 33 F. 3d 674, 677 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Peña v. Crowley Am. Transp., Inc., 172 F. Supp. 2d 321, 329 (D.P.R. 2001) (reduction in force held to be valid non-discriminatory reason). For these reasons, the Court finds that Citibank has proffered a valid, legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its 2013 reorganization.
Now that the ball is squarely in Plaintiff's court, she can garner absolutely no evidence in which to base her claims that this reorganization, which was executed in all the Latin American countries where Citibank had offices, and where each country was ultimately responsible for deciding and implementing the measures that benefitted them the most, somehow targeted her and only her, because of gender and disability. Cf. Rodríguez-Ríos v. Cordero, 138 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1998) (rejecting reorganization defense where defendants hastily executed the purported plan without governing board's approval, deviating from normal practice); Hidalgo v. Overseas-Condado Ins. Agencies, Inc., 929 F. Supp. 555, 561 (D.P.R. 1996), aff'd sub nom ("[f]inancial evidence suggesting that a decision, in hindsight, may not have been prudent is not evidence of improper motive; the [ADEA] is not violated by erroneous or even illogical business judgment."). [*104] 
The record is uncontested that all changes were decided upon and ultimately locally implemented. In fact, Maurás even complained to Ecuador that changes made in Ecuador were implemented too quickly, that a transition period was necessary, and that he had received client complaints that the team in Guayaquil was being unhelpful. Plaintiff was unhappy with the change and several meetings ensued to help her understand and deal with the new model, but that alone is not a discriminatory reason. Consequently, no pretext has been shown on the facts on this record as to the 2013 reorganization.
ii. Termination.
Plaintiff's termination claims fare no better, and the Court discusses this issue in detail, insofar as it is the bedrock against which all her subsequent claims are measured, that is, whether Defendants' actions were non-discriminatory and well-founded or rather, pretextual in nature.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's performance had been deteriorating since late 2013, and this ultimately led to her dismissal. The record provides ample evidence for this, and it has been widely held that employee performance is a valid reason for termination. See Sánchez-Ruiz v. Ferguson of Puerto Rico, Inc., 705 F. Supp. 2d 138, 151 (D.P.R. 2010) (Plaintiff dismissed after making numerous [*105]  mistakes after being properly trained, after receiving a poor review and failed to improve); Iverson v. Verizon Commc'ns, No. 08 CIV. 8873(SAS), 2009 WL 3334796, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2009) (Plaintiff dismissed after year end performance review indicated the need to improve, the company received customer complaints and no improvement was seen).
After the reorganization, because there were issues regarding former employee Guerrero's attempts to lure clients from Citibank, Plaintiff was instructed to focus on retention efforts for three (3) months. Maurás requested that she be granted an exception in the form of a forgivable draw during the first three months of 2010 to help her receive compensation if she was unable to meet her quota. Additionally, Maurás reminded Ecuador management that they should be very careful when handling clients from Guayaquil and stressed that all inquiries should be channeled through Caldareri.
In April, 2014, Citibank reviewed Plaintiff's performance and informed her that Maurás would be monitoring her compliance, since she was not reaching the established goals. This decreased performance on Plaintiff's behalf had been ongoing since the end of 2013. Plaintiff had been granted a special exception because she was previously working on retention efforts. [*106]  As of April, however, Plaintiff was specifically instructed to cease retention efforts and was informed that from then on, she had to comply with her production goal. Ramírez-Márquez and Maurás met with Plaintiff and detailed the areas for Plaintiff to work on during the following months, and the steps she had to take to correct her performance.
These steps were summarized in an email from Maurás to Plaintiff dated April 8, 2014. For Citibank, Maurás confirmed the end of the exception and the draw period, that he would instruct Ecuador that all Guayaquil offshore matters would be handled by Plaintiff and further confirmed the date of May 1, 2014 for the full implementation of the new model. As to Plaintiff, Maurás asked her to identify mutual funds which she felt more comfortable working with, and told her to obtain a sponsorship to help attract clients. Additionally, Maurás told Plaintiff to inform him of any Guayaquil operative matters which she had doubts as to how deal with, so he could help her. Maurás also requested that Plaintiff provide end of each month a list of clients contacted, referrals and "deepening" efforts to understand the growth potential based on her work and identify [*107]  areas of opportunity for her to comply with her goals. Finally, Maurás told Plaintiff that compliance with the office working hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) was required unless just cause existed for her absence.
Plaintiff counters in her defense that she was on retention efforts for three (3) months. Yet, as detailed above, the e-mail shows that as of April, 2014, she was explicitly told several things, namely: that she would no longer focus on retention efforts; she was specifically advised that she needed to improve her performance so as to comply with her goals; she would be reviewed on a monthly basis; and she was given specific tools and recommendations to improve. Thus, it is clear that Plaintiff was placed on a performance improvement plan.
Plaintiff proffers that she was never placed on such a status, and that these recommendations were not directed at her specifically, but rather, that she understood these exercises to be a "team effort." The Court is unconvinced. Surely a veteran financial advisor like Caldareri could not have misunderstood the nature of this corrective e-mail, and the others that were sent during that year. All the e-mails sent after the meetings between [*108]  Maurás and Plaintiff specifically discuss the following issues: 1) deficiencies related to her specific portfolio; 2) elaborate on an improvement plan for her portfolio; 3) specifically stated that they would be meeting with her in the future to discuss her performance (and some of them stated that the meeting was to evaluate her performance for a specific month, see, e.g., D. Exhibit 43, titled "August Performance Review"); 4) specifically indicated that Maurás would be following up on her progress and; 5) mentioned she had to evidence the steps and efforts she had undertaken to improve her performance, according to the recommendations given.
Notwithstanding this initial effort, Plaintiff failed to improve. For April 2014, Plaintiff had a performance goal of $88,000.00 in total investment revenue and was only able to obtain $24,188.00 in investment revenue, 27.49% of her goal. At that time, it is uncontested that Citibank personnel in Ecuador complained to Maurás about Plaintiff's unreturned calls to Ecuadorian clients Consuelo Alava and Soledad Granda.
During May, June and July, Plaintiff was out on STD. Upon Plaintiff's return in August, Caldareri had a performance goal of $83,000.00 [*109]  in total investment revenue, yet was only able to obtain $24,799.00, 29.88% of her goal. On September 29, 2014, Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez met once again with Caldareri to discuss her August performance. For the meeting, Plaintiff was asked to come prepared to discuss information related to clients contacted, referrals obtained from the country, and "deepening" activity, as had been previously requested of her in the April, 8, 2014 email. The details for this meeting are evidenced in an e-mail sent by Maurás dated October 6, 2014. If Plaintiff had any doubts or misgivings about the nature of the meeting, the subject header clearly spelled it out: "August Performance Review". It further specifically indicated that the email addressed the issues needed to get better results "over the portfolio we have under your management." This is unmistakable evidence that, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, Citibank was clear that this was not a "team effort", but rather, dealt with issues specifically with her performance and her portfolio.
Like before, Maurás gave her a number of recommendations, such as incrementing contacts with the approved methods, and incrementing acquisition, "deepening", [*110]  gross production and asset allocation performance. Plaintiff was specifically told that the $24,000.00 registered for August was considerably below expectations and included documents to help her diversify her portfolio. Maurás also found that: 1) Plaintiff's accounts were not aligned with the client profile; 2) Plaintiff's accounts were overloaded in fixed income and with little diversification; 3) within the fixed income holdings investments, Plaintiff had some that Citibank had ceased to recommend: 4) Plaintiff had limited exposure to diversified instruments (mutual funds).
Maurás closed stating that he wanted to hear what efforts Plaintiff had undertaken regarding client contact and management of her portfolio, in order to have a better understanding of how she was operating at the moment and identify additional opportunities to work on.
In September, Plaintiff had a performance goal of $93,000.00 in total investment revenue and again came up short, insofar as she was only able to obtain $26,836.00, or 28.86% of her goal. This time, however, Plaintiff was absent for a number of days, thus making her commitment to her work more difficult. Plaintiff posits that she was working "from [*111]  home", as her reasonable accommodation, a subject which will be discussed further on, had been granted at this time.
There is also further uncontested evidence that clients kept complaining about Plaintiff's performance. Around this time, client Antonio Jara complained to Maurás, saying he was going to search for service in another bank. Client Vicente Negrete also complained of the poor attention that clients in Guayaquil were receiving since the 2013 reorganization.
On October 16, 2014, Maurás and Ramírez-Márquez met with Caldareri to discuss her September performance, which was later summarized in an email dated October 30, 2014, and whose subject line again read "September Performance Review". In it, Maurás stated: 1) there continued to be poor evidence in the systems regarding client contact; 2) they continued to receive clients' complaints regarding Plaintiff's inaccessibility; 3) "acquisition" and "deepening" had been limited and Plaintiff had so confirmed in the meeting; 4) no proposal had been received from Caldareri to work on "acquisition" and "deepening" as requested; 5) Caldareri's primary functions related to "Gross Production" was limited to providing advice to twenty [*112]  (20) clients from a portfolio of more than two hundred and twenty (220), barely 9%, which confirmed Maurás' concern that she was not contacting clients. Maurás noted that Plaintiff continued to reflect deficiencies in important processes, and that he continued "observing a portfolio highly concentrated in products that are not in accordance to the recommendation that we have as an entity and that seek overall diversifying the risk in light of possible variations of the market." (D. Exhibit 55). Maurás also noted that Plaintiff's production was barely over $26,000.00, which failed to comply with any of the projected goals for her portfolio. Id. In other words, Plaintiff had implemented none of the actions Maurás had previously recommended that she carry out, on at least three (3) occasions, in order to improve her performance throughout that year.
Around this time, client Carlos Garzón contacted Maurás regarding a commission refund Caldareri had promised, but which she had been unable to attend to because she was out of the office due to her condition. Because of this, the request was ultimately handled by another broker, yet the client remained in Plaintiff's portfolio.
For October, [*113]  2014, Caldareri had a performance goal of $93,000.00 in total investment revenue and was only able to obtain $28,145.00, or 30.26% of her goal. Because of all these situations, Citibank evaluated her continued employment with them and terminated her shortly thereafter, in November 2014.
The record could not be clearer as to the reason why Plaintiff was terminated. Plaintiff's performance throughout the year was sub-par, even if the first three (3) months are not counted, and when she was afforded ample opportunity for improvement and seemingly ignored the tools given to her to that end. As the e-mails aptly demonstrate, Plaintiff simply failed to implement the recommendations that management was giving her. Furthermore, complaints were being received from clients and local management in Ecuador. These are all valid, non-discriminatory reasons for dismissal. Thus, Defendants have submitted sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the reason for dismissing Plaintiff was based on her job performance and not because of her disability or gender.
As such, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to show that the reason provided by Defendants was only a pretext for discrimination. "To meet that burden, [*114]  '[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the veracity of the employer's justification; he must 'elucidate specific facts which would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the employer's real motive: [age] discrimination.'" Santangelo v. New York Life Ins. Co., 785 F.3d 65, 70 (1st Cir. 2015) (citing Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991)). Caldareri has failed to do so.
"Pretext can be shown by such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons." Gómez—González v. Rural Opportunities, Inc., 626 F.3d 654, 662-663 (1st Cir. 2010) (citing Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997)).
Plaintiff proffers that there are inconsistencies over who decided to dismiss her, and summary judgment must be denied because ultimately, this casts doubt on Citibank's proffered reasons. In Plaintiffs' Sur-Reply, they rely on the case of Pérez v. Thorntons, Inc., 731 F.3d 699 (7th Cir. 2013) to stand for the proposition that, because there were inconsistencies surrounding the decision to dismiss Caldareri, that inconsistency is harmful to Defendants' proffered reasons. Yet, the Pérez case dealt with a very specific, and different factual scenario than this case. Pérez [*115]  involved disparate treatment between two (2) employees, where one (1) had been fired and the other merely reprimanded for similar actions. In that sense, the distinction in Pérez of who decided to terminate the plaintiff and who decided to merely reprimand the employee that was not fired was significant, insofar as "the point of determining whether different decision makers were responsible is to determine whether two (2) employees were held to different standards by virtue of the different perspectives and expectations of different and independent decision makers", and further, "Pérez and Koziol answered to the same decision makers, were measured by the same standards, and committed similar but not identical infractions, yet Pérez, a Hispanic female, was fired and Koziol, a non-Hispanic male, was not". Pérez, 731 F.3d at 707. Therefore, this distinction becomes relevant only when disparate treatment of two (2) employees for a similar offense is at stake. That is clearly not the case here.
The record is clear that it was not Maurás alone, but a team of several people, including Human Resources and the Legal Division, among those who made the group decision to dismiss Plaintiff. In fact, it is uncontested that among others, Vásquez advised in the decision to terminate Caldareri from the Human Resources perspective, due to poor performance and lack of improvement, client complaints and communication issues.
In the end, here, it is a distinction without a difference. Regardless of who was actually involved in making the decision, the bottom line is that a group of people made the decision, and that decision was based on Caldareri's poor performance and client complaints, which is amply evidenced in the record. Ultimately, Plaintiff can prove to no pretextual reason why her poor performance at the end of 2013 and through 2014 would excuse [*116]  Citibank from dismissing her.
Plaintiff further proffers in her defense that certain events occurred in 2014 that cannot be attributed to her that affected the overall production of the company, yet that information is not in this record and Plaintiff failed to provide it in support of her claims. Plaintiff further states "[d]efendants have failed to establish that her 2014 performance was an isolated event that merited her termination" because of her previous years of excellent performance, and claims that after the change in Ecuador, she was offered no support. (Docket No. 91, p. 54). Again, the record unquestionably demonstrates that whatever the reasons were, Plaintiff's performance at the end of 2013 through 2014 was subpar, notwithstanding the time she was away on STD. Clients were complaining about her performance,10 her absences became more regular, which in turn affected her work because it required her to be on site, and some clients requested to be transferred from her portfolio.
Additionally, the e-mails exchanged between Plaintiff and Maurás, after the multiple meetings held to improve her performance, belie her repeated assertions that she had no support. In the end, Plaintiff [*117]  chose not to use the tools or follow the recommendations given to her. These are ample justifications for an employee's dismissal and Plaintiff has failed to rebut Citibank's justification for her dismissal with any pretextual reasons.
It is important to note that it is not the Court's role to act as the company's guardian regarding personnel supervision, but rather to ensure no violations of the law occur. See, e.g., Byrnie v. Bd. of Educ., 243 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir. 2001) ("[The court's] role is to prevent unlawful hiring practices, not to act as a superpersonnel department that second guesses employers' business judgments.") (quoting Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep't of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Servs., 165 F.3d 1321, 1330 (10th Cir. 1999); Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1342 (11th Cir. 2002) (federal courts "are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision").
For all the aforementioned reasons, the Court finds that Defendants have presented a valid, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's dismissal, which Plaintiff has failed to rebut. Accordingly, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to Plaintiff's claims brought under the ADA and gender discrimination, be GRANTED and these claims be DISMISSED WITH [*118]  PREJUDICE.

C. Failure to accommodate.
In order to make out a reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must show: (i) that she suffers from a disability, as defined by the ADA; (ii) that she is an otherwise qualified individual, meaning that she is nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job, either with or without reasonable accommodation; and (iii) that the employer knew of his disability and did not reasonably accommodate it. Caez-Fermaint v. State Ins. Fund Corp., 286 F. Supp. 3d 302, 317 (D.P.R. 2017).
As previously stated, the parties agree that Caldareri had a disability, yet bicker as to whether or not she was able to perform the essential functions of her job. Caldareri herself admitted at various times during her deposition that she was unable to perform the essential duties of her job, as did her psychiatrist, Dr. Analid Díaz (See Defendants' Exhibit 34).11 Plaintiff then argues in her opposition that she could perform the tasks and the reason she fared poorly at her job was because Defendants failed to grant her the requested accommodation. Like before, giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and assuming that she was able to perform the essential duties of her job with an accommodation, Plaintiff has not met her burden of establishing [*119]  the third prong, that she was not reasonably accommodated.
In order to establish that Plaintiff's employer had knowledge of her limitations, Plaintiff must establish she made a "sufficiently direct and specific" request for accommodation that "explain[ed] how the accommodation requested [was] linked to some disability." Freadman, 484 F.3d at 102 (quoting Reed v. LePage Bakeries, Inc., 244 F .3d 254, 261 (1st Cir.2001)). The Court looks at what that accommodation entailed.
Plaintiff Caldareri's request for accommodation included: (1) a lightweight laptop; (2) the ability to come in late to work on those days in which her symptoms did not allow her to come in early; and (3) the ability to work from home when her symptoms worsened. The request, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions that it was temporary, specifically states it is permanent. See Docket No. 67, Exhibit 34. Two (2) were fully granted, to wit, the lightweight laptop and the ability to come in late to work. The third, which entailed working from home when Plaintiff's symptoms worsened, was partially granted. Plaintiff was told she could perform certain functions from her home. More to the point, she was allowed to perform operational and administrative tasks, but not regulatory matters. That is, Plaintiff was not [*120]  allowed to contact clients and execute transactions from her home for regulatory reasons. Furthermore, the ability to come in late and work from home was specifically conditioned to when Plaintiff's symptoms worsened. Therefore, from the outset it is clear that when Plaintiff states she was "working from home", this did not mean she was performing all her job duties.
But this was insufficient. Plaintiff wanted to work full time from her home, and faults Defendants for not having in place regulations that would have allowed her to do so. It has been well established that under the ADA, the term "reasonable accommodation" may include, inter alia, "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). This list notwithstanding, "[t]he use of the word 'reasonable' as an adjective for the word 'accommodate' connotes that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in [*121]  which that employee desires." Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F.Supp. 931, 947 (N.D.Ga. 1995).
Courts have found that the word "reasonable" would be rendered superfluous in the ADA if employers were required in every instance to provide employees "the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible." Lewis, 908 F.Supp. at 947; see also Vande Zande v. State of Wis. Dept. of Admin., 851 F.Supp. 353, 360 (W.D.Wis. 1994) ("an employee is entitled only to a reasonable accommodation and not to [a] preferred accommodation"), aff'd, 44 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 1995). Therefore, it is clear that under the ADA a qualified individual with a disability is "not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." Lewis, 908 F.Supp. at 948; see also Tobin v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 553 F.3d 121, 136 (1st Cir. 2009) (plaintiff's burden under the ADA is to show not only that the proposed accommodation would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job, but also that it is feasible for the employer under the circumstances); and Hankins v. The Gap, 84 F.3d 797, 800-01 (6th Cir. 1996) (citing 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. at 415) (regulations confer upon the employer the ultimate discretion in determining the accommodation to be provided and "may choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide").
Defendants have proffered that they accommodated most of Plaintiff's requests, but that federal regulations did not permit Plaintiff to perform all her work duties from home. Furthermore, [*122]  Plaintiff's job description required her physical presence on site for good reason. Therefore, full time work from home was not an option. Findings of Fact Nos. 227-229 explicitly detail this prohibition, which is encased in federal law. Additionally, while the laws in question did permit certain, limited, exceptions to this prohibition, they required a hefty investment on Defendants' behalf, including the drafting and implementation of regulations governing supervision and handling of privileged information, which did not exist at the time. Although Defendants admit that Plaintiff had been permitted to perform certain tasks from her home incidentally, they were not regulatory matters and said concession was not a green light for permanent, full time work from home. Plaintiff brings forth no evidence to substantiate her argument that other brokers had been previously permitted to perform regulatory, full-time work from home.
It seems, however, that Plaintiff confuses her reasonable accommodation with her job requirements. "One element in the reasonableness equation is the likelihood of success." Evans v. Fed. Express Corp., 133 F.3d 137, 140 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 465 (4th Cir. 2012) ("[T]he indefinite duration and uncertain likelihood of success of [plaintiff]'s [*123]  proposed accommodation renders it unreasonable"). The fact that Plaintiff's psychiatrist indicated in the accommodation form that the duration of the request was "permanent" also militates against the reasonableness of Plaintiff's request.
Plaintiff objects to the fact that Defendants asked her to present a medical certificate when she was absent for more than three (3) days. In Plaintiff's defense, she avers she was not absent because she was working from home in accordance with her reasonable accommodation. As previously stated, however, Plaintiff was not granted an accommodation to work from home full-time. She was granted leave to perform certain, limited administrative functions from her house when her condition worsened, and late arrival at work when her condition prevented her from arriving on time. Plaintiff's main job functions still had to be performed from the office, not from home. Therefore, it cannot be said that Plaintiff was "working" from home when her main work functions were to sell and trade investment products and those functions could only be performed from the office.12 This explains why Defendants logically asked for a medical certificate after Plaintiff was absent [*124]  for three (3) days, as they correctly posit that "the worsening of symptoms itself implies a medical determination to that effect." (Docket No. 105, p. 9).
Additionally, while Plaintiff argues she was penalized for working from home, that conclusion likewise finds no support on the record, since, as previously stated, it is uncontested that she could not perform all her duties from home. What Plaintiff was penalized for was her absences, when she was neither working from home nor the office.
Finally, Plaintiff contends that Defendants' argument that client services were affected due to her absences is false because "there is no evidence whatsoever that they can point to that it was due to Caldareri's actions." (Docket No. 91, p. 39). Again, the record is rife with facts about clients complaining that they could not reach Plaintiff, that she failed to respond to information requests, and unhappiness with certain products she sold them, and these facts stand uncontested. This argument is therefore unavailing.
For the reasons stated above, the undersigned finds that Defendants met their burden to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff, actually granting her most of what she asked for and had [*125]  ample justification for denying the request for full time work from home (or to work on regulatory issues from home), all with good reason. Plaintiff, in turn, has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable jury would find that she was not reasonably accommodated on the facts of this record.
Consequently, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the reasonable accommodation claims, be GRANTED and these claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

D. Harrassment.
The Court understands that the claims alleged are hostile work environment due to gender and disability, as Caldareri failed to plead any sexual harassment claims in the Complaint. See Docket No. 1, pp. 26-27, ¶ 121.13 While the Court is well aware that the information a Complaint must contain is not a high hurdle to overcome and has to merely contain a brief statement of the claims asserted and the remedy requested, it has to provide a defendant, at a minimum, with some mention of the claims asserted against him/her. Noticeably absent from the instant Complaint is any mention of sexual harassment.
The Court further notes that Plaintiff attempts to introduce allegations in another case against Citibank, [*126]  Casta v. Citi International, 17-2359 (FAB), as part of the sexual harassment claims she now raises for the first time. Yet, as has been well established, unverified allegations in a complaint are not evidence. Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v. Serrano-Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2010) (allegations in the complaint are not entitled to weight in the summary judgment calculus).14
In Plaintiffs' Opposition documents, they rely on the case of Taboas v. Fiddler, González & Rodríguez, 41 F.Supp.3d 137 (2014) as a basis for the Court to consider the Casta documents in order "to make their allegations more probable." (Docket No. 125, p. 31). Yet, Plaintiffs' reliance on Taboas is misplaced, because at the summary judgment stage the parties are not dealing with the probability of allegations, but rather with evidence. The Taboas' ruling Plaintiffs cite to was in response to a Motion in Limine to exclude "me too" evidence at trial stage in the form of witness testimony, not allegations on paper on summary judgment as Plaintiffs pretend to have the Court do here. The witness' testimony, of course, is for the jury, as ultimate fact finders, to consider and give it the probative value they understand appropriate ("mindful that the jury is free to assign admissible evidence as much or as little weight as it sees fit, the Court finds [*127]  plaintiff's anecdotal evidence regarding Dávila to be relevant"). Taboas, 41 F.Supp.3d at 142. That is not the case here, because the allegations Plaintiff would have the Court consider are mere allegations and not testimony evidence.
The Court will therefore not address the sexual harassment claims Plaintiff brings up in her Opposition or the allegations set forth in the Casta case, as they are inapposite to this case.
The standard to measure harassment claims varies somewhat depending whether they are due to gender or disability, but for both types of claims a plaintiff must demonstrate two things: that the harassment complained of was so pervasive that it affected the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment and that the harassment was because of her sex or disability. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 24, 114 S. Ct. 367, 371, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). Furthermore, a plaintiff must demonstrate not only that she subjectively perceived her workplace environment as hostile, but also that a reasonable person would so perceive it; in other words, that it was objectively hostile. Id.
Factors to be considered with respect to the objective component include "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; [*128]  and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Id. at 23. Conduct that is merely offensive will not suffice to support a hostile work environment action because, as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the federal employment discrimination laws do not establish "a general civility code" for the workplace. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201. Rather, an employee claiming harassment must demonstrate that the hostile conduct was directed at him or her because of a characteristic protected by a federal anti-discrimination statute. Id. at 80; Lee-Crespo v. Schering-Plough Del Caribe, Inc., 354 F.3d 34, 43 n. 5 (1st Cir. 2003).
Defendants posit that the conduct in question is not pervasive enough to alter the conditions of Plaintiff's employment and that she cannot establish that the comments were made because of her sex or disability. The Court agrees.
Caldareri has summarized her harassment claims for gender and disability as follows: Maurás criticized how she dressed as a woman; criticized her because she always dressed in black; she had visible grey hairs and he criticized her for not covering her gray; on one occasion, he commented that she had no acne on her face; he commented how she gained or lost weight; he would stare at her from top to bottom or stare at her from behind, and once, looking [*129]  at her buttocks said "It looks like I have a new employee"; used of foul language to intimidate her; failed to invite her to lunch once; told her that she was unable to do her job due to her condition (she had a broken arm at the time); and he failed to send her to seminars.
It is important to mention that in characterizing the hostile or abusive workplace, courts have drawn a continuum between commonplace indignities and actionable harassment. Offhand remarks, simple teasing, tepid jokes, and isolated incidents are at one end of the continuum, which standing alone, usually does not amount to a hostile work environment. Severe or pervasive sexual remarks, innuendoes, ridicule, and intimidation fall at the other end of the continuum and may support a hostile work environment. Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2005); Figueroa Reyes v. Hosp. San Pablo del Este, 389 F.Supp.2d 205 (D.P.R. 2005); Oncale, 118 S.Ct. at 1002 (supervisor's behavior may have created "an undignified and or even unpleasant working environment", but the actions were not discriminatory).
While the facts presented in this case might indicate an uncomfortable and perhaps, tense working relationship between Maurás and Plaintiff, they are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment. See generally, Arrieta-Colón v. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc., 434 F.3d 75, 88 (1st Cir. 2006) (affirming disability harassment [*130]  verdict where the evidence showed that the plaintiff was subject to "constant mockery" due to his disability); Rosario v. Dep't of the Army, 607 F.3d 241 (1st Cir. 2010) (harassment found when supervisor complained about plaintiff's appearance on a daily basis, regularly drew the attention of her co-workers to her body and undergarments, shadowed her closely, challenged her decisions, mocked her, described her as a street woman to others and criticized her to doctors and patients); Marrero v. Goya of Puerto Rico, Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 19 (1st Cir. 2002) (Plaintiff was subjected to harassment on a daily basis, including humiliating remarks and innuendos); O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 713 (constant and pervasive harassment found actionable); and Colón-Fontánez v. Municipality of San Juan, 660 F.3d 17, 44 (1st Cir. 2011) (supervisor's unprofessional managerial approach and accompanying efforts to assert her authority are not the focus of the discrimination laws).
Plaintiff's sweeping, conclusory statement that Maurás "always" commented on her black clothing and commented about her gray hair on some five (5) occasions is insufficient at this stage. Regarding Plaintiff's clothing, the record has also clearly established that she was not complying with the dress code from time to time, and had to be told to wear pants to cover up tattoos on her feet. The claim about not sending Plaintiff to seminars is equally unsupported, [*131]  as the record shows she participated in three (3) seminars between 2006 and 2011, and ample number of employees, men and women, attended the same number of seminars as she did.
Moreover, the Court finds that the sporadic nature of the comments is insufficient to create such a hostile environment as the law requires in order to be actionable. Quiñones v. Puerto Rico Hospital Supply, 307 F.Supp.2d 352 (D.P.R. 2004) (episodic indignities not sufficient); Landrau Romero v. Caribbean Restaurants, Inc., 14 F. Supp. 2d 185, 191 (D.P.R. 1998) (four (4) or five (5) incidents over seven (7) week period not actionable); Colon-Fontánez, 660 F.3d 17, 44-45 (1st Cir. 2011) (acts episodic, but infrequent in nature; upsetting, but not severe; mildly humiliating, but not physically threatening were not actionable). That is the case here.
Finally, Plaintiff has been unable to establish that the comments were made because she was a woman or because she had a disability. Accordingly, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the harassment claims for gender and disability, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

E. Retaliation.
Once again, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework remains the option of choice in retaliation cases, albeit with slight modifications. Plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that (i) she engaged in protected conduct; (ii) she was thereafter [*132]  subjected to an adverse employment action; and (iii) a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action. Connell v. Bank of Boston, 924 F.2d 1169, 1179 (1st Cir. 1991). Once a prima facie case of retaliation is established, the burden shifts to the employer "to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision". Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir. 1991). If the employer provides a legitimate reason, "the ultimate burden falls on the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered reason is pretext masking retaliation...." Id.
Citing cases that state that two (2) and three (3) months are insufficient, Defendant proffers that Plaintiff cannot establish a causal connection between the filing of the EEOC complaint on June 23, 2014 (notified to Citibank on July 17, 2014) and her subsequent termination on November 14, 2014, as almost five (5) months had elapsed. Plaintiff proffers that the temporal proximity here was enough because she was reprimanded throughout the Fall of 2014.
Making a reasonable inference in Plaintiffs' favor, as the Court must at this stage, the Court assumes Caldareri has established a prima facie case of retaliation and that the time frame in question is sufficient. Yet, as discussed above, the record shows that [*133]  Plaintiff's termination was based on a legitimate non-retaliatory reason, and Plaintiff likewise here fails to prove that Defendants' legitimate non-retaliatory reason for her termination - poor performance and client complaints - constituted a pretext for retaliation. In fact, what the record shows is that Plaintiff's post-filing performance (low numbers from August-October 2014) was essentially the same as the pre-filing performance (end of 2013 and April, 2014, when she was no longer on retention efforts). Moreover, Plaintiffs' arguments that Defendants retaliated against her and "altered" the terms of the reasonable accommodation, "used her absenteeism against her" and "never allowed her an effective accommodation" (Docket no. 91, p. 48) are unsupported in the record, for the reasons already explained.
In light of the foregoing, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to Plaintiff's retaliation claims under the ADA and Title VII, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

F. Supervisory liability.
Plaintiffs also bring forth claims againt Maurás, as Caldareri's supervisor, and urge against dismissal in their Sur-Reply, stating that [*134]  "neither the First Circuit nor the Supreme Court have ruled on this issue." Docket No. 125, p. 32.
Courts in this district and circuit have long declined to impose individual liability under Title VII and the ADA, and it was not until 2009 that the First Circuit definitively held that there is no individual liability under Title VII in Fantini v. Salem State Coll., 557 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 2009); see also Rey-Cruz v. Forensic Sci. Inst., 794 F.Supp.2d 329, 334 (D.P.R. 2011) ("the procedures for instituting an ADA claim are those set forth in Title VII" as both statutes invoke the same "powers, remedies and procedures"); Vera v. McHugh, 622 F.3d 17, 25 n. 8 (1st Cir. 2010) ("Title VII does not create liability against individual employees"); Román-Oliveras v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Authority, 655 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir. 2011) ("The First Circuit has also recognized, like various other Circuit Courts, that the ADA does not impose personal liability on supervisors, because the ADA 'addresses the conduct of the employers only'"); Ríos v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 938 F. Supp. 2d 235, 251 (D.P.R. 2013) ("The First Circuit appears to have been one of the last Court of Appeals to have joined its sister courts in concluding that there is no individual supervisory liability under Title VII"); and Mitchell H. Rubinstein, Employees, Employers, and Quasi—Employers: An Analysis of Employees and Employers Who Operate in the Borderland Between an Employer—and—Employee Relationship, 14 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 605, 654 (2012) (collecting cases, and noting that "all twelve [*135]  circuits have concluded that there is no individual supervisory liability under Title VII").
Because the causes of action against Maurás stem from his role as Caldareri's supervisor, the claims against him in a supervisory capacity cannot lie. Consequently, it is recommended that Defendants' Motion to Summary Judgment, as to the claims against co-Defendant Maurás, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

G. ERISA.
As Plaintiff's final federal claim, she alleges that she was short-changed in her ERISA disbursement, as Citibank agreed to pay her a total of $35,085.42 for her short term disability and she was only paid $19,638.34.
Defendants proffer that Plaintiff was paid more favorably than her prior leave, as the method previously used to calculate the figure was an average of the commissions made during the previous six (6) months, and she was now granted an exception to use only the past three (3) months. This was done to help Plaintiff, because it excluded the months where her performance was near zero.15 Defendants further aver that Plaintiff was not out for the complete three (3) months, therefore she was not entitled to the total monthly compensation. Finally, Defendants [*136]  argue that the agreed upon compensation was minus any adjustments for previously paid erroneous commissions which were, in fact, made and this discrepancy explains the difference.
Plaintiffs proffer absolutely no argument to rebut these uncontested facts and they brings forth no evidence to prove that the deductions were somehow erroneously made. Once Defendants brought forth their explanation for the discrepancy, it was up to Plaintiff to bring forth evidence against such an explanation. She did not. Mere allegations are insufficient at the summary judgment stage to rebut properly pleaded and evidenced facts. Hence, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to ERISA claims, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

H. State law claims.

a. Local Law 80.
Plaintiff also brings forth a wrongful discharge claim pursuant to Law 80, which provides a remedy to employees who are discharged "without just cause." P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185a. For no apparent reason, Caldareri anchors most of her claims to this "just cause" reason and dedicates a good part of her argument to this particular law, and proffers that Defendants have failed to properly address this claim and it [*137]  should therefore be deemed waived and granted in her favor. (Docket no. 91, p. 18-30). While it is true that Defendants' brief did not address these claims as in depth as Plaintiff, they did so because they requested dismissal of the state claims after extensively discussing the federal claims, and aver instead that when federal claims are dismissed, the state claims should likewise be dismissed.
For this same reason, since the Court has recommended dismissal of all the federal claims, it will likewise recommend dismissal of the state claims. See Rodríguez Rivas v. Police Dep't of Puerto Rico, 483 F. Supp. 2d 137, 139 (D.P.R. 2007) (dismissal of plaintiff's federal claim triggers the dismissal without prejudice of any supplemental state-law claims). Yet, in the interest of thoroughness, and because the Court finds Plaintiffs' state law claims to be inadequate, in light of the findings made for the federal claims, the Court will address them more fully below.
Law 80 provides that "[a] discharge made by the mere whim of the employer or without cause relative to the proper and normal operation of the establishment shall not be considered as a discharge for good cause." P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b(f). In order to prevail, "(i) the employee must show that he or she has been discharged and allege that the [*138]  dismissal was not justified; (ii) the burden then shifts to the employer to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the dismissal was justified; and (iii) if the employer shoulders that burden, the employee must rebut the showing of good cause." Echevarría v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP, 856 F.3d 119, 140 (1st Cir. 2017).
Law 80 specifies several grounds that are considered good cause for termination, among them, improper or disorderly conduct, inefficient or negligent work, and violations of the rules of conduct. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185b(c). As the First Circuit has stated, "A 'just' discharge is one where an employer provides a considered, non-arbitrary reason for an employee's termination that bears some relationship to the business operation." Pérez v. Horizon Lines, Inc., 804 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2015). This inquiry, in turn, focuses not on "the objective veracity of the employer's action" but rather "on the employer's reasonable belief"; even "a 'perceived violation suffices to establish that [the employer] did not terminate [the employee] on a whim, but rather for a sensible business-related reason.'" Id. at 10 (quoting Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'ns, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2007)).
Although Plaintiff meets her initial burden, which is not a high one, her claims fail for reasons explained in the discussion of the federal claims, mainly, Citibank's proffered, non-discriminatory reasons for her termination. [*139]  Defendants have shown here that her dismissal was justified by offering several potential bases for a finding of a just-cause termination, namely: Caldareri's poor performance at the end of 2013 and in 2014; her absenteeism and thus, inability to perform the main aspects of her job adequately at times; clients' complaints about her performance, and in general, management's inability to correct her trajectory and get her to improve her performance after multiple attempts. All these reasons are considered non-arbitrary, and certainly bear a strong relationship to Defendants' business operation. See Id. at 9. Therefore, "a reasonable jury could only conclude that [Citibank] has met its burden of showing just cause." Id. at 10.
In the same vein, Plaintiff is unable to rebut Defendants' showing of good cause. For these reasons, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the Law 80 claims, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISED WITH PREJUDICE.

b. Local Law 44.
Law 44 is Puerto Rico's counterpart to the ADA. Arce v. ARAMARK Corp., 239 F.Supp.2d 153, 169 (D.P.R. 2003). It prohibits discrimination against persons with some type of physical or mental disability. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 501(d). As such, "[i]n conjunction with the ADA, Law 44 creates [*140]  an obligation for any employer to provide reasonable accommodations, and prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities." Román Martínez v. Delta Maint. Serv., Inc., 229 F.Supp.2d 79, 85 (D.P.R.2002). Thus, the elements of proof for a claim under Law 44 are essentially the same as those for establishing a claim under the ADA. Zayas v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 378 F.Supp.2d 13, 23-24 (D.P.R. 2005).
The Court has already analyzed Plaintiffs' claims under the ADA and found them wanting. To the extent Caldareri's failure to accommodate and disability discrimination claim under the ADA failed, her claims under Law 44 must also fail. Therefore, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the claims brought forth under Law 44, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJDICE.

c. Local Law 115.
Plaintiff also asserts a claim under Puerto Rico's retaliation statute, Law 115. Law 115 protects employees from dismissal who provide or attempt to provide testimony or information in an administrative, judicial or legislative forum. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 194a(a). This law was amended September 29, 2014 to extend said protection also to employees that "recur to an employee or functionary of their same company to submit a complaint". The Court gives Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and holds that she has made a valid claim [*141]  under this law, as her EEOC claim is undoubtedly protected activity.
However, claims under Law 115 are regularly analyzed in a similar fashion to ADA retaliation claims. See Quevedo-Gaitan v. Sears Roebuck de Puerto Rico, Inc., 536 F.Supp.2d 158, 171 (D.P.R. 2008) (analyzing Law 115 conterminously with ADA retaliation claims); Rivera v. Empresas Y-Nuina, Inc. / Kikuet, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87906, 2011 WL 3443086 at *5 (D.P.R. Aug. 8, 2011) (denying summary judgment based on court's assessment of ADA retaliation claim); Caez-Fermaint v. State Ins. Fund Corp., 286 F. Supp. 3d 302, 320-21 (D.P.R. 2017) (same holding).
Accordingly, based on the analysis of Plaintiff's retaliation claims under federal law and finding them to be insufficient, it is recommended to the Court that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the Law 115 claim, be GRANTED and said claim be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

d. Article 1802.
All Plaintiffs brought forth claims for damages under Puerto Rico general tort statute, Article 1802 of the Civil Code. However, it has been well established that when claims under more specific statutes have been pled, there can be no liability for the same harm under a more general statute, and "to the extent that a specific labor law covers the conduct for which a plaintiff seeks damages, he is barred from using that same conduct to also bring a claim under Article 1802." Rosario v. McConnell Valdés, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13113, 2008 WL 509204, *2 (D.P.R. 2008); see also Santini Rivera v. Serv. Air, Inc., 137 P.R. Dec. 1, 1994 Juris P.R. 121 (1994). Thus, a claim under Puerto Rico Civil Code Article 1802 may only be brought by the employee-plaintiff if it is based on tortious or negligent [*142]  conduct distinct from that covered by the specific labor laws invoked.
Plaintiff Caldareri does not aver any other tortious conduct aside from the alleged discrimination which was already addressed under other laws. As such, no Article 1802 claim on behalf of Plaintiff Caldareri can lie. The only claims that survive under this article are the damages claims brought by Caldareri's spouse and children, which are derivative of her claim, and remain alive as long as her federal claims remain alive.
As above explained, it has been recommended to the Court to dismiss all federal and all state claims. Consequently, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the derivative Article 1802 claims, be GRANTED and said claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

CONCLUSION
For all the aforementioned reasons, it is recommended to the Court that Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 67) be GRANTED in its entirety and all of Plaintiffs' claims, under federal and state laws, be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
The parties have fourteen (14) days to file any objections to this report and recommendation. See Amended Local Rules. Failure to file same within the specified [*143]  time waives the right to appeal this order. Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-151(1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Valencia, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986) and Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 991 (1st Cir. 1988).
