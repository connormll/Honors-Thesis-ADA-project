Opinion


REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court on defendant's motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 26. Plaintiff responded, and the defendant replied. Dkts. 29, 33.
Previously, the Court granted a stipulated motion to dismiss with prejudice all claims against the individual defendant, Ms. Bolton, and the entirety of three causes of action (third cause of action -- discharge based on record of disability; fourth cause of action -- disability discrimination based on plaintiff's having been "regarded as" or "perceived as" a person with a disability; and sixth cause of action -- negligent supervision/retention concerning Ms. Bolton and other [*2]  managers). Dkt. 25; see Dkt. 1, Complaint, at 18 (third cause of action), 18-19 (fourth cause of action), and 20 (sixth cause of action).
In their summary judgment motion, defendant asks the Court to dismiss with prejudice three remaining causes of action: First, that the defendant failed to reasonably accommodate plaintiff's disability; second, that the defendant discharged plaintiff due to her disability; and third, the defendant retaliated against plaintiff due to her expression of intent to enforce the laws regarding discrimination on the basis of disability. Dkt. 26, Motion for Summary Judgment.
The Court should grant partial summary judgment on the claims for which plaintiff alleges that she had a disability; plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing that she had an allergic reaction or otherwise had serious side-effects from the flu vaccine at the point where she requested reasonable accommodation in October and November 2019. As to the remaining claims, the Court should deny summary judgment.
A. Background Facts
The parties agree on the following:
1. Plaintiff was subject to a policy implemented by the defendant that required her, as an employee, to have the flu vaccine by October [*3]  15, 2019. Dkt. 27, Ellis Decl., Dkt. 27-1 Influenza Vaccine Policy (8-28-2018), at 1-2. She found out about the policy during employee orientation in April of 2019. Dkt. 31, Kirby Affidavit, Dkt. 31-5, Richardson Deposition, at 32, 42.
2. Under that policy, if she failed to obtain a flu shot by October 15, 2019, she would be suspended for one week and then terminated if she did not obtain the flu shot during that week. Dkt. 27, Ellis Decl., Dkt. 27-1 Influenza Vaccine Policy (8-28-2018) at 2.
3. In lieu of having a flu shot, plaintiff would be allowed, under the policy, to show that her situation fit within a medical exemption. Id. at 3-4 (Appendix A to Policy).
4. Plaintiff explored the option of applying for a medical exemption, based on her knowledge that she had suffered a severe adverse reaction to a flu shot in the 1980's. She did not submit an application for the medical exemption, because she was not able to obtain the required documentation to support the exemption. Dkt. 31-5, Richardson Deposition, at 6-7, 15-21.
5. Plaintiff was not able to obtain the required documentation before October 15, 2019. On November 15, 2019 the defendant advised plaintiff that she was suspended and [*4]  if she did not obtain a flu shot or provide documentation of the basis for her medical exemption, then her employment would be terminated on November 21, 2019. Plaintiff testified in her deposition that certain documents she requested did not arrive until the end of December or the first few days in January. Id. at 20-21.
a. Plaintiff stated that she could not meet the October 15 or the November deadline because the medical records of her adverse reaction to the flu shot were old and not available. Dkt. 31-5, Richardson Deposition, at 42-43.
b. Plaintiff stated that she did not try to schedule an appointment with an allergist to determine whether, in October of 2019, she had a current allergic reaction to the current flu shot. Dkt. 31-5 at 45, 47, 50.
c. Plaintiff stated that she did not receive an email notification that she was required to obtain a flu shot by October 15, 2019, because her work email was not operating properly; she was notified verbally by a representative of the defendant. Dkt. 31-5, Richardson Deposition, at 13-14, 24-27, 30-37.
6. Plaintiff was suspended on November 15, 2019 and then her employment was terminated on November 21, 2019. Dkt. 27, Ellis Decl., Dkt. 27-8, [*5]  Termination Letter (11-21-2019); Dkt. 28, Bolton Declaration, at 1; Dkt. 31-5, Richardson Deposition, at 20, 30.
7. During a meeting with Lauri Bolton (the individual defendant who has been dismissed from this lawsuit) on November 15, 2019, plaintiff informed the defendant of her intent to pursue legal action. Id. at 52.
The parties' disputes of fact, and whether they are genuine disputes of material fact, will be discussed as relevant to the legal analysis, below.
B. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is supported if the materials in the record "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 56 (a),(c). The moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact for trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine dispute concerning a material fact is presented when there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In this context, materiality means the fact is one that is "relevant to an element of a claim or defense and whose existence might affect the outcome of the suit"; thus, materiality is "determined by the substantive law governing the [*6]  claim." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).
The non-moving party is required to show that genuine issues of material fact "'can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." California Architectural Building Prods., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., 818 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir. 1987) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250) (emphasis in original). When the Court considers a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [their] favor." Anderson, at 255. Yet the Court is not allowed to perform the jury's function - the Court may not weigh evidence, draw legitimate inferences from facts, or decide credibility. Id.
If the moving party meets their initial burden, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading; his or her response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in FRCP 56, must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. FRCP 56(c). The Court may not disregard evidence solely based on its self-serving nature. Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 497 (9th Cir. 2015). "The district court can disregard a self-serving declaration that states only conclusions and not facts that would be admissible evidence." Id.
C. Discussion
1. Americans With Disabilities Act Federal Claims
a. Discrimination by failing to reasonably accommodate a person with a disability; and discharge from [*7]  employment on the basis of disability
"Whether a person is disabled under the ADA is an 'individualized inquiry.'" Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 483, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). Under the ADA, an "individual with a disability" is covered by the protections of the statute. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, 12102(1). The ADA prohibits employers who are covered by the statute from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). A "qualified individual" is defined as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
The ADA definition of "disability" is "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1).
The United States Supreme Court has upheld vaccine mandates when a governmental entity imposed such a requirement to protect public health and safety. Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25-27, 38, 25 S. Ct. 358, 49 L. Ed. 643 (1905).
If an employee has a disability, the employer is required to provide [*8]  a reasonable accommodation process by which a disabled employee can seek a medical exemption to a vaccine requirement. See, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(a), (b)(5)(a) and (b)(6); U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Vaccinations (part K), technical guidance, What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws, https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws#K (accessed on 9-29-2921). "For example, as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance from coworkers or non-employees, work a modified shift, get periodic tests. . .be given the opportunity to telework, or finally, accept a reassignment." Id. Although EEOC Guidelines are not binding on the courts, they "constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944)).
Claims of discrimination under the ADA are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Snead v. Metropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1092-1094 (9th Cir. 2001). "To be entitled to the interactive process that leads to a reasonable accommodation, an employee must have a 'disability' within the meaning of the ADA." Becerril v. Pima Cty. Assessor's Office, 587 F.3d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir. 2009) (per curiam); [*9]  See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes -- . . ."not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity").
Regarding discharge, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case that she was discharged on the basis of a disability; the employer is then required to introduce admissible evidence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the discharge; if that evidence is introduced, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence and carry the burden of persuasion that the employer's proffered reason is a pretext. Snead v. Metropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1092-1094 (9th Cir. 2001).
A plaintiff who alleges discrimination on the basis of disability, concerning an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate their disability, must show a prima facie case that:
(1) They are disabled under the meaning of the ADA;
(2) The employer had notice of the disability;
(3) If a reasonable accommodation were provided, they could perform the [*10]  essential functions of the job;
(4) The employer has refused to make reasonable accommodations.
McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Anthony v. Trax International Corporation, 955 F.3d 1123, 1134 (9th Cir. 2020); Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 817 (2019).
In this situation, no reasonable jury could find that plaintiff makes a prima facie showing she was a disabled person when she requested accommodation. Plaintiff alleges that when she informed the defendant she had a severe reaction to a flu vaccine during the 1980's, this was sufficient to meet the definition of having a known disability.
Under the ADA, an individual is disabled if they have a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). An episodic impairment can qualify as a disability, but it must "substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(D) (emphasis added). A major life activity would include (but is not limited to) "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working," 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). Major life activities also would include operation of significant bodily functions, [*11]  e.g. "neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions". 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A),(B).
"It is important to differentiate between true allergies and temporary intolerances from vaccines." M. Hamza Habib, MD, FACP, FAAHPM, MRCP and Hayley Penan, JD, MPH, Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination for Healthcare Workers: A Medical, Ethical and Legal Overview for Healthcare Systems and Employers. Health Lawyer, Vol. 33 No. 4, at 6, 11 (April 2021). With respect to mandated vaccinations in hospitals and other health care facilities that serve patients, there are ethical and practical reasons that a health care employer may decide to impose such a requirement, and health care employers have done so with limited exemptions. Id., at 13-16.
The Court draws every justifiable inference from the facts in favor of plaintiff, and accepts as true - for summary judgment analysis - that during the 1980's plaintiff had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine. Yet she has not made a prima facie showing that she had a qualifying active episodic disability in October and November 2019 (during the time she sought an exemption and a reasonable accommodation from the defendant). See Dkt. 30, Richardson Declaration, [*12]  at 2, ¶ 3. She has failed to establish that due to an allergic reaction or temporary intolerance to the flu vaccine, she had a substantial limitation on major life activities or significant bodily functions in October and November 2019 -- at the time she requested reasonable accommodation.
Plaintiff has only produced information based on her personal knowledge that she had a severe reaction to a flu shot in the 1980's. Without any evidence that she would, in October/November of 2019, have an active episodic severe reaction (allergybased reaction, or a reaction due to some other physical condition) to the flu vaccine administered in 2019, she cannot establish a prima facie showing of a currently-existing known disability. Norman v. NYU Langone Health System, 492 F. Supp.3d 154, 163-165 (S.D.N.Y 2020) (plaintiff had not established that reactions to the flu vaccine met the definition of disability under the ADA at the time that she requested an accommodation, therefore the Court granted defendant's summary judgment motion as to plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate); Eubanks v. Mercy Med. Ctr., Inc., No. CV WDQ-15-513, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169189, 2015 WL 9255326 at *6 (D. Md. Dec. 17, 2015) (record of employee's allergies did not constitute evidence of a disability under the ADA; therefore employer was not required to provide an exemption from flu vaccine policy).
Defendants also [*13]  argue that plaintiff did not have an obvious impairment, and therefore she was required to produce documentation of the currently-existing adverse reaction to the flu vaccine, before SPMC would have any obligation under the ADA to engage in reasonable accommodation discussions. See Wells v. Winnebago County, Ill., 820 F.3d 864, 867 (7th Cir. 2016) ("disabled employees must make their employers aware of any nonobvious, medically necessary accommodations with corroborating evidence such as a doctor's note or at least orally relaying a statement from a doctor, before an employer may be required under the ADA's reasonableness standard to provide a specific modest accommodation" quoting, Ekstrand v. School District of Somerset, 583 F.3d 972, 976 (7th Cir. 2009)).
This is a distinct analysis from the issue of whether the employer may, as a condition of continued employment, require an employee to provide medical documentation or undergo a medical examination, in order to maintain their employment status (see part b of the analysis, pp. 12-15, below).
Under the 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(a), (b)(5)(a) and (b)(6) disability discrimination framework concerning whether reasonable accommodation was required, and whether plaintiff was suspended and discharged because of a disability, the defendant was allowed to ask for documentation of plaintiff's non-obvious alleged disability. [*14]  See, Garcia v. Salvation Army, 918 F.3d 997, 1010 (9th Cir. 2019) (in the absence of medical evidence, employer was not required to engage in exploration of reasonable accommodation). Plaintiff has not produced any evidence of her condition in October and November of 2019 to counter the deposition testimony of Dr. Taylor; Dr. Taylor stated that he looked up the diagnosis on plaintiff's medical chart but could not find any documentation in plaintiff's medical record that would allow him to fill out the exemption form -- despite plaintiff's memory of having a severe allergic reaction during the 1980's and her belief that she had an autoimmune disease and wanted to be formally exempted from the flu shot requirement on that basis. Dkt. 31-7, excerpts of Dr. Taylor's deposition at 10, 15. Dr. Taylor also testified in his deposition that "I recall in her chart that she had received a TDAP vaccination, which is a tetanus vaccination, and she had tolerated that well." Id. at 16. Therefore, her discrimination claims regarding failure to accommodate, and discrimination by termination of employment, fail as a matter of law.
b. Discrimination by impermissibly requiring a medical examination and medical inquiries
The defendant argues that even if plaintiff [*15]  had a condition that might meet the definition of disability under the ADA, it was not an obvious condition and therefore the employer is allowed to request medical documentation before any accommodation inquiry will proceed. Dkt. 26 at 20-21. There are two separate lines of analysis under the ADA; the first (described above) would require that plaintiff make a prima facie showing that she suffered from a current disability, and give notice to her employer of the non-obvious disability, before the employer would be required to explore any reasonable accommodations.
Yet, there is a second line of authority under which the employer may, under some circumstances, require medical documentation or a medical examination as a condition of employment. Regarding the continued employment of a current employee, the ADA generally prohibits employers from demanding an employee obtain a medical examination and prohibits medical inquiries unless "job-related and consistent with business necessity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4).
To invoke this provision and bring an ADA claim concerning medical examination or inquiries, it is unnecessary for the plaintiff to show they are disabled. Hustvet v. Allina Health System, 910 F.3d 399, 406-407 (8th Cir. 2018). But the plaintiff must show there is a tangible [*16]  injury that resulted from the employer's alleged violation of the ADA. Cossette v. Minn. Power & Light, 188 F.3d 964, 970 (8th Cir. 1999). To comply with the ADA and regulations promulgated by the EEOC, in order to invoke a "qualification standard" such as requiring that an employee take a vaccine or establish a medical exemption to be excused from the vaccine requirement, the employer must show the qualification is job-related and consistent with business necessity. To show business necessity, it must show "a requirement than an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r); see, Yin v. State of Cal., 95 F.3d 864, 868-869 (9th Cir. 1996) (business necessity exception applied to medical examination designed to determine the employee's ability to work); Owusu-Anash v. Coca-Cola Co., 715 F.3d 1306, 1312-13 (11th Cir. 2013).
The first question in this situation is whether SPMC's requirement that plaintiff produce medical documentation of her severe reaction to the flu vaccine is a "medical examination or disability inquiry" under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(6), (d)(4); see, Bates v. Dura Automotive Systems, Inc., 767 F.3d 566, 573-574 (6th Cir. 2014) (summary judgment was improper where there was a genuine question of material fact whether the employer's drug-testing requirement was, or was not, a "medical examination or disability inquiry" under the ADA). The defendant contends that the flu vaccine requirement and the request [*17]  for documentation was a neutral policy. Dkt. 26 at 23-24. The plaintiff argues that the vaccine requirement and requirement for additional testing or documentation was discriminatory, because the defendant suspended her and terminated her employment without offering reasonable accommodation when she requested a medical exemption, and because the defendant did not provide plaintiff sufficient time or assistance to establish whether plaintiff was, in fact, allergic or otherwise likely to experience disabling side-effects if she received the flu vaccine in October or November 2019. Dkt. 29 at 19-21.
This is a genuine dispute of material fact that a reasonable juror could decide in favor of either party. Summary judgment should not be granted on this issue.
Plaintiff does not challenge whether the flu vaccine requirement was job-related. Therefore, the second issue is whether there is a business necessity for the vaccine requirement, and for the employer's requirement of documentation concerning the plaintiff's alleged flu shot allergy or side effect-related episodic disability.
A "direct threat" is defined under the ADA regulations as:
"a significant risk of substantial harm to the health [*18]  or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. The determination that an individual poses a 'direct threat' shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include: (1) The duration of the risk; (2) The nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) The imminence of the potential harm." ). 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r).
Regarding the issue of whether plaintiff has established any genuine dispute of material fact on discrimination based on the defendant's requirement of a medical examination or documentation, plaintiff raises a genuine issue of material fact. Even if plaintiff does not make a prima facie showing that she was currently disabled at the time she requested the exemption, she may still assert discrimination on the basis that defendant impermissibly [*19]  demanded a medical examination or documentation of her episodic disability. The defendant's policy states that it's purpose is "To Minimize the transmission the influenza virus in the workplace by providing occupational protection to staff and thus preventing transmission to members of the community." Dkt. 27, Decl. of Ellis, Dkt. 27-1, Policy, at 1.
Under the ADA, the employer may impose such an examination or documentation if it is job-related, and a business necessity -- "a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r).
Plaintiff has not shown any genuine dispute of material fact regarding job-related requirement. She makes a general allegation that because she was not directly giving patient care, and she worked night shifts, it follows that it was improbable she would ever spread the flu virus in her work area. See Dkt. 30, Decl. of Richardson, Dkt. 30-1, at 3, ¶ 7; referring to plaintiff's letter to the SPMC Human Resources Department dated 11-14-2019 ("Since there is no scientific study to support vaccinations of healthcare professionals plays any party in protecting patients or themselves from the flu, [*20]  plus I work at night as an EVS tech with NO patient contact there is no reason this facility to demand or for myself to risk serious bodily injury since CDC guidelines clearly state wearing a mask is is a acceptable method to safe guard myself and any other persons/patients from the flu.").
Yet this general, conclusory allegation is not supported by a factual foundation. For example, she does not show that a flu virus would only be spread by direct contact with patients. She does not address whether she would have had contact with other workers in the medical facility - including receptionists, maintenance workers, employees in positions who worked in the same unit of the facility where she worked, as well as managers, doctors, nurses, janitorial staff; if exposed to a person with the flu, those individuals would potentially become infected and infect others, including patients. Nor does plaintiff establish any reasoning about why her schedule of working night shifts would preclude flu virus from being spread - she does not specify whether she worked alone at all times, and whether there were there no other persons she could come in contact with anywhere she went to work in the facility [*21]  at night. Therefore, no reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff has met the burden of showing that defendant lacked a job-related reason for requiring medical documentation or examination to support an exemption.
Plaintiff does raise a genuine dispute of material fact concerning business necessity with respect to whether the defendant meets the criteria of the EEOC regulation concerning "a requirement than an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A); 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r). A "direct threat" is defined under the ADA regulations as "a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation". In this situation, plaintiff asserts that she should have been allowed to wear a mask, as a reasonable accommodation that would mitigate the risk of substantial harm to health or safety of others. 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r).
According to the regulations, [t]he determination that an individual poses a 'direct threat' shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on [*22]  a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include: (1) The duration of the risk; (2) The nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) The imminence of the potential harm." 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.2(r). The defendant fails to show there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether, if plaintiff had complied with a mask requirement, her compliance would have been a sufficient way of mitigating the risk of transmitting the flu virus, under the business necessity "direct threat" regulation and the four-part criteria.
c. Discrimination by retaliation
The defendant argues that plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing of retaliation. They assert that plaintiff's deposition shows an admission of non-retaliation. Dkt. 26 at 27-28. Even if plaintiff could make a prima facie showing, the defendant argues that it has established a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for suspending and terminating plaintiff, and thus refutes her claim as a matter of law. Dkt. 26 at 28. [*23] 
Under 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a), "No person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this Act or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this Act." With respect to the retaliation cause of action, the Title VII burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas applies. T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified School Dist., 806 F.3d 451, 472-473 (9th Cir. 2015).
The plaintiff must present a prima facie case "(a) that he or she was engaged in protected activity, (b) that he or she suffered an adverse action, and (c) that there was a causal link between the two." Emeldi v. Univ. of Or., 673 F.3d 1218, 1223 (9th Cir. 2012). The standard for determining whether a causal link exists is but-for causation. T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified School Dist., 806 F.3d at 473. If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing, then the burden shifts to the defendant to offer legitimate reasons for the adverse action. See, Hashimoto v. Dalton, 118 F.3d 671, 679-680 (9th Cir. 1997). Proximity in time is not, standing alone, sufficient evidence to refute proffered legitimate reasons. See Hashimoto v. Dalton, at 680. Making a prima facie showing is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for surviving a motion for summary judgment. T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San Diego Unified School Dist., 806 F.3d at 473.
Plaintiff has made a prima facie case of retaliation concerning her objection to being required to provide evidence of medical testing for [*24]  an allergy or other condition that would potentially produce a severe reaction to the flu vaccine, and also her objection to not being offered a reasonable accommodation such as mask-wearing. The parties agree that plaintiff expressed her intent to sue the defendants when she met with Ms. Bolton on November 15, 2019. The parties also agree that plaintiff was fired from her position on November 21, 2019 and there was no exploration of whether a reasonable accommodation of plaintiff's objection to having medical testing and further documentation of a disabling condition could have been resolved through compliance with a mask-wearing requirement. There has been no evidence whether a maskwearing requirement would, or would not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of spreading the flu virus in the context of plaintiff's working environment. Therefore, defendant's assertion of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason does not require the Court to grant summary judgment; there are issues of fact for which a reasonable jury could find in plaintiff's favor regarding whether defendant's reasons were actually neutral.
Plaintiff has made a statement against interest, by stating in her deposition - [*25]  in response to a question by defense counsel whether plaintiff thought she was terminated from employment because she threatened to sue SMPC -- that "[I]t was already in the works. I mean, by the time we had that conversation [about suing SPMC], the decisions have already been made. So no, I don't." Yet this does not defeat her retaliation claim as a matter of law. The Court should not weigh the disputed facts presented by the plaintiff and defendant concerning the retaliation claim. That is the jury's function.
2. Washington Laws Against Discrimination (WLAD) State Law Claims
The state law discrimination claims are also governed by the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas. Hines v. Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp., 127 Wn. App. 356, 371, 112 P.3d 522 (2005). WLAD is interpreted to be at least as broad in its coverage as the ADA. Kumar v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 180 Wn.2d 481, 491, 325 P.3d 193 (2014). "[C]ourts should look to interpretations of federal anti-discrimination laws, including the ADA, when applying the WLAD." Grill v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 312 F. Supp.2d 1349, 1354 (W.D. Wash. 2004).
Under the WLAD, an employer is prohibited from discharging an employee "because of . . . the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability." RCW 49.60.180(2). Washington courts broadly construe the meaning of disability - "any mental or physical condition may be a disability." Clipse v. Commercial Driver Services, 189 Wn. App. 776, 793, 358 P.3d 464 (2015). To establish a prima facie case based [*26]  on an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate, plaintiff "must show that (1) the employee had a sensory, mental, or physical abnormality that substantially limited his or her ability to perform the job; (2) the employee was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job in question; (3) the employee gave the employer notice of the abnormality and its accompanying substantial limitations; and (4) upon notice, the employer failed to affirmatively adopt measures that were available to the employer. . . to accommodate the abnormality." Davis v. Microsoft Corp., 149 Wn.2d 521, 532, 70 P.3d 126 (2003) (citations omitted); RCW 49.60.040(7). If the plaintiff makes a prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the defendant to present evidence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to produce evidence that the asserted reason was merely a pretext." Hines v. Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp., 127 Wn. App. at 371. Side effects of a prescription drug may constitute a disability under WLAD, if those side effects meet the statutory definition of disability. Clipse v. Commercial Driver Services, 189 Wn. App. at 793.
For the same reasons described under the ADA above, the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the state law discrimination allegations concerning discharge, and reasonable accommodation, [*27]  based on disability. Plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing as to the presence of a disability at the time she asked for reasonable accommodation. RCW 49.60.180(2). Even under the Washington court's liberal interpretation, the Court should find that plaintiff must establish that a disability exists at the point in time when the plaintiff requests the reasonable accommodation. See Norman v. NYU Langone Health System, 492 F. Supp.3d 154, 163-164 (S.D.N.Y 2020) (plaintiff had not established that reactions to the flu vaccine met the definition of disability under the ADA at the time that she requested an accommodation, the Court granted summary judgment as to plaintiff's claim of failure to accommodate).
Regarding the state law retaliation claim, RCW 49.60.210 provides, in relevant part: "(1) It is an unfair practice for any employer, . . . to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because he or she has opposed any practices forbidden by this chapter, or because he or she has filed a charge, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this chapter." Plaintiff makes a prima facie case of retaliation by showing: (1) plaintiff engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) the employer took adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link exists between the protected [*28]  activity and the adverse action. Frisino v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 160 Wash.App. 765, 785, 249 P.3d 1044 (2011). Plaintiff engaged in protected activity if she opposed an employment practice based on a reasonable belief that the practice was unlawful. See E.E.O.C. v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 720 F.2d 1008, 1013 (9th Cir. 1983).
Causation may be shown by "circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that [she] engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision." Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987). "But timing alone will not show causation in all cases; rather, 'in order to support an inference of retaliatory motive, the termination must have occurred 'fairly soon after [Plaintiff's] protected expression.' " Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Paluck v. Gooding Rubber Co., 221 F.3d 1003, 1009-10 (7th Cir. 2000)). Under Washington law, the courts apply a "substantial factor" test to determine causation. Allison v. Housing Auth., 118 Wn.2d 79, 98, 821 P.2d 34 (1991).
The Court should deny summary judgment on plaintiff's WLAD claims concerning retaliation on the same basis described above with respect to the federal claims under the ADA. There are genuine disputes of material fact concerning whether she was discriminated against by retaliation. A reasonable jury could find that plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that adverse action was taken by defendant and a causal link (under the substantial factor test) exists between [*29]  the employer's adverse action and plaintiff's protected activities. Plaintiff was suspended, and then her employment was terminated, within a few days after she stated objections to the requirement for medical testing or documentation, and objected several times to defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate, and that she was fired a few days after she told Ms. Bolton that she intended to file a lawsuit.
D. CONCLUSION
The Court should grant partial summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the issues that depend on plaintiff making a showing that she was a person with a disability at the time she requested a reasonable accommodation from the defendant. Plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing she was disabled at the time she requested reasonable accommodation concerning the flu vaccine policy. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); RCW 49.60.180(2). .
The Court should deny defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(6), (d)(4), and WLAD, RCW 49.60.180(2), regarding whether SPMC's flu vaccine requirement and the medical exemption documentation and testing requirement violated laws requiring reasonable accommodation, and whether plaintiff's employment was terminated in violation of those laws. Likewise, the Court should deny summary judgment on [*30]  plaintiff's ADA and WLAD retaliation claims. The case should proceed to trial on those portions of plaintiff's causes of action under the ADA and WLAD.
The parties have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections thereto. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); FRCP 6; FRCP 72(b)(2). Failure to file objections will result in a waiver of those objections for purposes of appeal. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985). If objections are filed, the parties shall have fourteen (14) days from the service of the objections to file a response. FRCP 72(b)(2). Accommodating this time limitation, this matter shall be set for consideration on November 5, 2021, as noted in the caption.
Dated this 20th day of October, 2021.
