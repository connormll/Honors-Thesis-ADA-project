Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Instrument No. 38).

I.

A.
This case arises from an employment dispute between Plaintiff Dorothea Walker ("Plaintiff") and Defendant Neighborhood Centers, Inc. ("Defendant"). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant denied her reasonable accommodation under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and retaliated against her for requesting reasonable accommodation. (Instrument No. 21). Defendant denies these claims and seeks summary judgment on the basis that it had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination. (Instrument No. 38).

B.
Plaintiff is a teacher and former employee of Harbach Ripley Charter School ("Harbach Ripley"), which is operated by Defendant. (Instrument No. 21 at 2). Defendant hired Plaintiff to work as a third-grade teacher during the 2013-2014 school year. (Instrument No. 38 at 7). The third-grade classroom to which Plaintiff was assigned was originally [*2]  located in a temporary building outside the main school building. Id. at 9. On March 24, 2014, five months after Plaintiff started working at Harbach Ripley, Plaintiff's class was moved from the temporary building to a classroom inside the main school building. Id. at 10.
According to Plaintiff, the classroom in the main building made her ill with dust and possible mold because the room "was very dirty and nasty." (Instrument No. 21 at 3). Plaintiff complained to the school principal and asked to be transferred back to the temporary building. Id. Instead, the principal submitted a request to clean the classroom's air filters, floor, and carpet. (Instrument No. 38 at 10).
The next day, on Tuesday, March 25, 2014, the classroom had not yet been cleaned but Plaintiff returned to work and once again claimed that the air made her sick. Id. After leaving work that day, Plaintiff went to see a doctor, who treated her for allergies and said that she should take one day off work. Id. The principal gave Plaintiff a paid sick day on Wednesday, March 26, 2014, and made sure that the classroom was thoroughly cleaned that day. Id.
On Thursday, March 27, 2014, Plaintiff returned to work but continued to complain about [*3]  the classroom's air quality. (Instrument No. 38 at 11). Plaintiff reiterated her request to be transferred back to the temporary building and sent nine or ten students to the nurse's office, alleging that their eyes and noses were burning and that they were sneezing and coughing uncontrollably. Id. Because Plaintiff continued to feel ill, the principal sent her home for the day and arranged for an environmental consultant, QC Laboratories, Inc. ("Environmental Consultant"), to test the campus for mold and indoor air quality on Friday, March 28, 2014. Id.
On Friday morning, March 28, 2014, Defendant's assistant superintendent and a representative from human resources met with Plaintiff to present an alternative plan so that she would not have to stay in the classroom. Id. at 12. Defendant offered to make Plaintiff a Charter Intervention Teacher, which would allow Plaintiff to tutor students in other classrooms throughout the building while receiving the same salary and benefits. Id. Plaintiff had previously applied to this position a month before, on February 17, 2014. Id. at 9. After Plaintiff was offered this new position, she was given the rest of the day off on paid leave to see a doctor about her [*4]  allergies. Id. at 12.
Plaintiff was not pleased with the reassignment to Charter Intervention Teacher and wrote an e-mail to Defendant's President and CEO complaining about the transfer that Friday night, March 28, 2014. Id. at 13. In this e-mail, Plaintiff asserted that the room was toxic and that the students there needed to be reassigned for their health and safety. Id. The next morning, on Saturday, March 29, 2014, Plaintiff submitted an online complaint to the Texas Department of Health about the classroom. Id. Plaintiff also submitted a complaint to the Texas Education Agency ("TEA"), alleging that Defendant's teachers had engaged in cheating on state-wide standardized tests. Id.
After Plaintiff made these complaints, Defendant's human resources personnel confirmed that none of the third-grade students at Harbach Ripley were sick. Id. at 14. Plaintiff was the only person affected by the air quality in the classroom and test results from the Environmental Consultant confirmed on April 3, 2014 that there was no mold in the classroom and that air quality was acceptable for building occupants. Id. at 16.
On Saturday, March 29, 2014, and Sunday, March 30, 2014, Defendant's human resources personnel conducted internet searches [*5]  on Plaintiff's background and discovered that she had previously been employed by Hitchcock Independent School District, despite not having disclosed this position on her resume or job application. Id. at 14. Plaintiff had previously worked for the school district, had been terminated after complaining about exposure to mold and dust, and had sued the school district in response. Id. at 15.
After a sit-down meeting with Plaintiff on Monday, March 31, 2014, Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment on April 4, 2014 ("Termination Date"). Id. at 16. The reasons stated on Plaintiff's notice of termination were:
[I]mproperly suggesting to students that they may have been exposed to mold in the classroom; fabricating allegations that co-workers had submitted false information to the TEA or had engaged in cheating; failing to cooperate in the investigation of her claims; failing to be forthcoming as to similar complaints against Hitchcock ISD; and failing to disclose her Hitchcock ISD employment on her job application or resume and falsely stating that she was employed by another entity at that time.
Id. at 17. Plaintiff's complaints about cheating were investigated by the TEA and found to be meritless. Id. at 16.

C.
Plaintiff filed a [*6]  charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on September 26, 2014, asserting that she was denied reasonable accommodation and retaliated against in violation of the ADA. (Instrument No. 38 at 7). On September 15, 2015, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter. Id. On September 28, 2015, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant. (Instrument No. 1). Plaintiff then amended her complaint on March 30, 2016. (Instrument No. 21).
Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on December 1, 2016. (Instrument No. 38). On December 8, 2016, Plaintiff filed a response. (Instrument No. 42). Defendant submitted a reply on December 13, 2016, (Instrument No. 44), and Plaintiff filed a surreply on December 15, 2016. (Instrument No. 45).

II.
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Warfield v. Byron, 436 F.3d 551, 557 (5th Cir. 2006).
The "movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material [*7]  fact." Triple Tee Golf Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322). "A fact is 'material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law." Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Tex., 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir. 2009). An issue is "genuine" if the evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
If the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party, the movant may satisfy its initial burden by "showing — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. While the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005). "If the moving party fails to meet [its] initial burden, the motion [for summary judgment] must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response." United States v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, 537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc)).
After the moving party has met its burden, in order to "avoid a summary judgment, the nonmoving party must adduce admissible evidence which creates a fact issue concerning the existence of every essential component of that party's case." Thomas v. Price, 975 F.2d 231, 235 (5th Cir. 1992). The party opposing summary judgment cannot merely rely on the contentions contained in the pleadings. [*8]  Little, 37 F.3d at 1075. Rather, the "party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim." Ragas v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998); Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir. 2007).
Although the court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Connors v. Graves, 538 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir. 2008), the nonmovant's "burden will not be satisfied by some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence." Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075). Similarly, "unsupported allegations or affidavit or deposition testimony setting forth ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Clark v. Am's Favorite Chicken, 110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir. 1997).
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the district court does not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence. Chevron Phillips, 570 F.3d 606, 612 n.3 (5th Cir. 2009). Nor does the court "sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party's opposition to summary judgment." Jackson v. Cal-Western Packaging Corp., 602 F.3d 374, 379-80 (5th Cir. 2010); Malacara v. Garber, 353 F.3d 393, 405 (5th Cir. 2003); Ragas, 136 F.3d at 458; Nissho-Iwai American Corp. v. Kline, 845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir.1988) (it is not necessary "that the entire record in the case ... be searched and found bereft of a genuine issue of material fact before summary judgment may be properly entered"). Therefore, "[w]hen evidence exists in the summary judgment record but the [*9]  nonmovant fails even to refer to it in the response to the motion for summary judgment, that evidence is not properly before the district court." Malacara, 353 F.3d at 405.

III.

A.
Both Plaintiff and Defendant have objected to each other's evidence at summary judgment. Plaintiff objects to Defendant's use of affidavits from witnesses that have not been cross-examined, as well as a job description for the Charter Intervention Teacher position that Plaintiff was offered on March 28, 2014 and board minutes from Hitchcock Independent School District that list the reasons for Plaintiff's prior termination. (Instrument No. 42 at 18). Defendant objects to Plaintiff's attachment of medical records from November 2014, some seven months after the Termination Date. (Instrument No. 44 at 3).
Plaintiff's general objection to Defendant's affidavits is too broad to be properly considered by the Court. See United States v. Avants, 367 F.3d 433, 445 (5th Cir. 2004) ("Evidentiary objections must be specific"); Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1)(B) (a party must "state[] the specific ground" of each objection). Plaintiff's objection to all of Defendant's affidavits is OVERULED.
Plaintiff also objects to the job description of the Charter Intervention Teacher position because it was "not given to Plaintiff when hired." (Instrument [*10]  No. 42 at 7). The record shows that Plaintiff was never formally hired for this position; she was merely offered it in an alleged attempt at reasonable accommodation. (Instrument No. 38 at 12). The job description of this position is relevant to Plaintiffs claim that the position was a demotion from her job as a third-grade teacher, regardless of whether Plaintiff was given this document at the time she was offered the position. Accordingly, Plaintiff's objection to the job description of the Charter Intervention Teacher position is OVERULED.
Plaintiff also objects to Defendant's use of board minutes from the Hitchcock Independent School District School Board, which explain why Plaintiff was fired from that position. (Instrument No. 42 at 7). The board minutes have limited probative value because Defendant claims that Plaintiff's concealment of the prior termination from a previous teaching position is itself grounds for dismissal. (Instrument No. 38 at 15). Plaintiff's deposition testimony also covers the prior grounds for dismissal. (Instrument No. 38-4). The board minutes are prejudicial, however, because the reasons for Plaintiff's prior dismissal are highly similar to the facts [*11]  of this case. Because the evidence's prejudicial effect substantially outweighs its probative value, Plaintiff's objection to the admission of board minutes from Hitchcock Independent School District is SUSTAINED.
Defendant objects to Plaintiff's use of medical records from November 2014 on relevance grounds. (Instrument No. 44 at 3). Plaintiff's employment ended at Harbach Ripley in April 2014, and the medical records she attached relate to mold in another school that Plaintiff started working at several months after she left Defendant's employment. Because this evidence is not relevant to the case and confuses the issues, Defendant's objection to the medical records from November 2014 is SUSTAINED.

B.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate her alleged disability of severe allergies in violation of Title I of the ADA. (Instrument No. 21 at 1). Defendant seeks summary judgment on this claim on the basis that Plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the ADA and that Defendant engaged in the interactive process and did not fail to reasonably accommodate her. (Instrument No. 38 at 20).
The ADA prohibits discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of [*12]  disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Under the ADA, to "discriminate" includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
To state a prima facie case for a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) the plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for such known limitations. Feist v. La., Dep't of Justice, Office of the Atty. Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013).
Once an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation, "the employer is obligated to engage in an 'interactive process' or 'a meaningful dialogue with the employee to find the best means of accommodating that disability.'" Tribble v. Ouachita Par. Police Jury, 939 F. Supp. 2d 626, 632 (W.D. La. 2013) (citing E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009)). The employer must make "reasonable accommodations" necessary to allow an employee with [*13]  a disability to perform the essential functions of the employee's job. An accommodation may include:
(a) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; and
(b) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). "The ADA provides a right to reasonable accommodation, not to the employee's preferred accommodation." E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distribution LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009). "When no reasonable accommodation can be made to the plaintiff's prior job, [s]he may be transferred to another position." Jenkins v. Cleco Power, LLC, 487 F.3d 309, 315 (5th Cir. 2007). "Modifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employee without disabilities" are considered to be reasonable accommodations. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1).
Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability of severe allergies by not moving her to a different classroom [*14]  following her complaints of dust and mold. (Instrument No. 42 at 24). According to Plaintiff, she continuously requested accommodation on March 24, March 25, and March 27, 2014, but "her requests were denied and she continued to suffer in that classroom with bad headaches, her eyes and nose were burning badly and she felt weak, couldn't breathe, etc. [and she could] not [go] home either." Id.
Plaintiff admits, however, that Defendant granted her the day off work on March 26, 2014, after she complained that the classroom was making her sick. (Instrument No. 38-4 at 25). Plaintiff also acknowledges that Defendant thoroughly cleaned the classroom on March 26, 2014 and tested it for mold and air quality on March 28, 2014. Id. at 26. Even though the testing came back negative for mold and dust, Plaintiff claims that no mold or dust was present because Defendant "cleaned the room prior to the mold inspectors coming in." (Instrument No. 42 at 28). Despite this contention, Plaintiff still complained of dust and mold on March 27, 2014, the day after the classroom was cleaned. (Instrument No. 38 at 11). In fact, it was this day that Plaintiff sent groups of students to the nurse's office, claiming that [*15]  their eyes and noses were burning and that they were sneezing and coughing uncontrollably. Id. Plaintiff's assertion that the testing by the Environmental Consultant was invalid because it took place after the classroom was cleaned is therefore at odds with her complaint on March 27, 2014 that the classroom was still making her sick.
Prior to the Termination Date, there is no evidence that Defendant ever failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's known limitations. See Feist, 730 F.3d at 452. In fact, Defendant repeatedly engaged in an "interactive process" and "meaningful dialogue" with Plaintiff to address any problems with the classroom as well as Plaintiff's allergies. See Tribble, 939 F. Supp. 2d at 632. Defendant granted Plaintiff multiple paid sick days, cleaned the classroom, and hired air inspectors to remedy the situation. (Instrument No. 38 at 11). Defendant also offered Plaintiff a position with equal pay and benefits that Plaintiff herself had applied to a month before. Id. at 12. Based on the evidence before the Court, Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact showing that Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate her known limitations. Because Plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her prima facie [*16]  case for failure to accommodate, the Court need not decide whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability pursuant to the ADA. See Feist, 730 F.3d at 452.
Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED on Plaintiffs claim of failure to accommodate.

C.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant retaliated against her for engaging in protected activities under the ADA. (Instrument No. 21 at 2). Defendant seeks summary judgment on this claim on the basis that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and in the alternative that Defendant had legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for Plaintiff's termination. (Instrument No. 38 at 26).
The ADA prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee who seeks to exercise her rights under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing." Id. To establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation, a plaintiff must demonstrate: "(1) engagement in an activity protected [*17]  by the ADA, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected act and the adverse action." Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., 179 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1999). Once a prima facie case is established, the same McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is used as in the context of employment discrimination. See Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., 238 F.3d 674, 684 (5th Cir. 2001). A plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation; if the plaintiff meets this burden, then the burden of production shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions; and if the defendant produces a legitimate reason, then the presumption of retaliation vanishes, and the plaintiff must demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but a pretext for discrimination. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-805, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
Here, Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff engaged in ADA-protected activity by making a request for reasonable accommodation. See (Instrument No. 38 at 25). Plaintiff also experienced an adverse employment action because she was terminated. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) ("No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . discharge of employees"); E.E.O.C. v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 700 (5th Cir. 2014) (finding [*18]  that termination constitutes an adverse employment action).
Plaintiff asserts a causal connection between her termination and request for reasonable accommodation. (Instrument No. 42 at 30). "Close timing" may be sufficient to create a causal connection between protected activity and an adverse employment action when the temporal proximity is "very close." Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001). Here, Plaintiffs Termination Date was April 4, 2014, less than two weeks after she requested reasonable accommodation. (Instrument No. 38 at 17). This creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there is a causal connection between Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation and her termination. See Russell v. University of Texas, 234 F. App'x 195, 207 (5th Cir. 2007) (granting summary judgment where the alleged reprisal took place six months after the protected activity); Ajao v. Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc., 265 F. App'x 258, 265 (5th Cir. 2008) (granting summary judgment where the alleged reprisal took place four months after the protected activity).
Because Plaintiff has established all three elements of a prima facie case, the burden now shifts to Defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff s termination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff was discharged for a number of reasons:
[I]mproperly suggesting to students [*19]  that they may have been exposed to mold in the classroom; fabricating allegations that co-workers had submitted false information to the TEA or had engaged in cheating; failing to cooperate in the investigation of her claims; failing to be forthcoming as to similar complaints against Hitchcock ISD; and failing to disclose her Hitchcock ISD employment on her job application or resume and falsely stating that she was employed by another entity at that time.
(Instrument No. 38 at 17). Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to disclose her employment at Hitchcock ISD on her resume or job application or that she was not forthcoming about her prior termination. See (Instrument No. 42 at 30). In the Fifth Circuit, concealing information from one's employer is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for dismissal. See Heinsohn v. Carabin & Shaw, P.C., 832 F.3d 224, 236 (5th Cir. 2016). Accordingly, the burden now shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that the legitimate reasons offered by Defendant were not its true reasons, but a pretext for discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805.
Plaintiff claims that Defendant "conspired to create pre-textual retaliatory reasons to place [her] on leave and ultimately terminate her employment all because Plaintiff [*20]  requested to be relocated outside in a temporary building." (Instrument No. 42 at 30). Defendant's human resources personnel investigated Plaintiff's employment history after she complained about the classroom's air quality and only then did they discover that she had not reported her prior employment. Id. at 31. According to Plaintiff, "[t]his proves conspiracy" in which Defendant "retaliated by doing an internet search proving they were trying to find reasons to place Plaintiff on leave, knowing they would terminate her employment." Id. at 32.
Despite these allegations, Plaintiff has not put forward any evidence to support her claim that Defendant decided to discharge her before performing the internet searches. To the contrary, Defendant's affidavits show that the superintendent and human resources personnel were still discussing Plaintiff's employment status after the internet searches occurred on Saturday, March 29, 2014 and Sunday, March 30, 2014. (Instrument No. 38 at 15). On Monday, March 31, 2014, Defendant's outside counsel and senior director of human resources interviewed Plaintiff to discuss her complaints. Id. At this meeting, Plaintiff acknowledged that she had concealed her prior employment [*21]  and termination, and only after this meeting did Defendant put Plaintiff on paid leave. Id. at 16. Plaintiff was then discharged four days later, after test results confirmed that there was no mold in her classroom and that the air quality was acceptable. Id. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Defendant's reasons for termination were a pretext for discrimination.
Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED on Plaintiff's claim of retaliation in violation of the ADA.

IV.
Based on the foregoing analysis, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED on Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and retaliation under the ADA. (Instrument No. 38).
The Clerk shall enter this Order and provide a copy to all parties.
