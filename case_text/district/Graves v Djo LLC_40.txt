Opinion



ORDER (1) DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DOC. 42] AND (2) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DOC. 47]
Pending before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff Marie Graves seeks partial summary judgment as to Defendant DJO, LLC's ("DJO") [*2]  21st, 33rd, and 34th Affirmative Defenses. (Grave's P&A [Doc. 42-1] 1:3-8.) Defendant DJO, LLC moves for summary judgment on all of Graves' causes of action. (DJO P&A [Doc 48] 1:2-25.)
The Court decides the matters on the papers submitted and without oral argument. See Civ. L.R. 7.1(d)(1). For the following reasons, the Court DENIES Graves' motion [Doc. 42] and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART DJO's motion [Doc. 47].

I. Factual Background

A. DJO, Graves' employer, relocates to Dallas, Texas.
Plaintiff Marie Graves worked for Defendant DJO, LLC from April 30, 2018 until June 1, 2019 as a Global Medical Device Auditor in its Vista, California headquarters. (Graves Jt. Statement [Doc. 56-1] No. 1; DJO Jt. State. [Doc. 55-4] Nos. 1, 2, 58.1 ) On July 11, 2018, DJO announced it was relocating its headquarters to Dallas, Texas. (Graves Jt. State. at No. 2; DJO Jt. State. at No. 8; DJO Ex. 7 [Doc 47-5].) DJO offered to relocate certain employees, including Graves, to Texas. (DJO Jt. State. at No. 9.) DJO also notified Graves that if she did not relocate, her job would be eliminated effective June 2019. (Id. at No. 11.)
In August 2018, DJO advised Graves that if she chose [*3]  not to relocate, she would receive a severance package upon termination. (Graves Jt. State. at No. 3; DJO Jt. State. at No. 12.) Graves initially considered relocating and travelled to Texas to look for housing, but ultimately declined to relocate. (Graves Jt. State. at No. 4; DJO Jt. State. at Nos. 13, 14; DJO Ex. 11 [Doc. 47-5].)
On September 13, 2018, DJO sent Graves a letter confirming it was "transitioning its corporate headquarters from Vista, CA" and that "[a]s a result, your position is being eliminated from the Vista, CA location and your employment with the Company is estimated to end effective 6/1/2019 ('Separation Date')." (DJO Ex. 13 [Doc. 47-5] 194.) To assist in the transition, DJO offered a competitive separation package "[p]rovided you remain an employee in good standing and perform your duties in a satisfactory manner through the Separation Date...." (Id.) The package included "an estimated 8.67 weeks of severance, which equates to $16,666.67," reimbursement for all applicable COBRA premiums for one month or until Graves was covered by another employer's health plan, and "outplacement assistance." (Id.) In addition, as recognition for Graves' assistance in the "knowledge [*4]  transfer process," the letter stated,
you will be eligible for a $23,000 completion bonus, which will be paid, less applicable withholdings, on your last day of employment along with your final pay check provided you remain an employee in good standing and perform your duties in a satisfactory manner through the Separation Date.
(Id.) To receive the "severance payment, COBRA premium reimbursement, and outplacement assistance," the letter stated Graves would have to "execute a General Release Agreement ('Agreement')" that she would receive "on or around your last day of employment." (Id. at 195)
On October 2, 2018, DJO sent Graves another letter (the "Termination Letter") repeating the terms in the September 13 letter, except that it now confirmed her "employment with the Company will end effective 6/1/2019." (Graves Ex. 2 [Doc. 42-6] DJO 000277-278.) After receiving the Termination Letter, Graves began negotiating a higher completion bonus to stay with the company. (DJO Ex. 1 [Doc. 47-5] 47:25-48:9.) Ultimately, DJO agreed to increase the bonus from $23,000 to $33,000. (Id. at 60:5-24.) On October 3, 2018, Graves signed the Termination Letter that included the changes she negotiated. [*5]  (Id. at 58:5-9; DJO Ex. 15 [Doc. 47-5].)

B. Graves notifies DJO that she is pregnant.
In January 2019, Graves informed DJO that she was pregnant and requested paperwork for FMLA coverage. (Graves Jt. State. at No. 8; Graves Ex. 4 [Doc 42-8] DJO 000377.) Before notifying DJO about her pregnancy, Graves was in discussions with the company's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, Ehab Esmail, about the possibility of continuing to work for the company from Vista as the Manger of Regulatory Affairs. (Graves Opp'n Decl. [Doc. 52-22 ] ¶ 5; Graves Ex. 7 [Doc 42-11] 25:16-26:25, 34:3-35:21.3 ) For example, in December 2018, Graves emailed Esmail regarding the "auditor position based in Vista, CA" and stated that she "had a chance to speak with [her] husband about this and I am open to staying with DJO." (Graves Ex. 6 [Doc. 42-10] DJO 000339.) However, Graves contends that after she informed Esmail that she was pregnant, he stopped discussing the opportunity and instead suggested that she should stay home to take care of her child. (Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.)
On March 13, Graves emailed Colleen Farrell, DJO's in-house recruiter, about the Manager of Regulatory Affairs [*6]  position. (DJO Opp'n Ex. 18 [Doc. 51-4] 316-317.) In the email, Graves stated that Esmail claimed the position was "a temporary position" and had "already been filled by Usman Khan (a contractor working remotely from Vista)." (Id. at 317.) Graves requested confirmation that the information was accurate. (Id.) Farrell responded, "[y]es this role is opening for a contingent worker and Usman has accepted the position." (Id. at 316.) Approximately two weeks later, Graves again inquired about the position because it was "still posted on the DJO website." (Id. at 315.) The next day, Farrell again confirmed that "Usman has accepted this role... starting on 4/16" and explained that the "position stays open until onboarding is complete." (Id.)
On April 17, Graves sent Farrell and Esmail an email stating that she had "tried reaching out to Usman as he is identified as a contact for the upcoming audit next week that I am leading here in Vista" but that she did not receive a response from him. (Graves Ex. 11 [Doc 42-15] DJO 000512.) Graves, therefore, asked if he started "as the RA Manager yesterday as planned" and whether the position was "still open" because the job "posting is still up for both [*7]  roles...." (Id.) Farrell responded that "Usman is still intended to start; however, he has been delayed due to being out of the country." (Id.) Farrell also indicated that Usman was "expected this week, if he is not able to start this week [Esmail] plans on seeking other options." (Id.)
Two days later, Graves sent another email to Farrell, Esmail and DJO's new Director of Regulatory Affairs, Pete Gonzalez, stating:
I applied for [the Regulatory Affairs Manager] position over 1 month ago, and was told that Usman would be starting as a contractor filling it-first in March-then in April, now he is not here and it is almost May. Prior to these positions being posted (specifically in January timeframe) Ehab approached me about this role and asked me if I had any interest in it. This was also (perhaps coincidentally) before I communicated to DJO that I was expecting a baby in May.
I have a few questions about this role now that I see it has been posted for over 45 days without being filled as I was told it was and without any communication to me as to why I was not considered.
(Graves Ex. 12 [ Doc. 42-16] DJO 000536-537.) After comparing her and Usman's work performances, Graves asked whether [*8]  Usman started in the position and, if not, whether she would be considered. (Id. at DJO 000537.) There is no evidence indicating DJO responded to her email.4
On May 5, Graves received an updated organizational chart indicating the Manager of Regulatory Affairs position was still open. (Graves Ex. 10 [Doc 42-14] 5 of 6.5 )

C. DJO extends the termination date for some employees, but not Graves.
On or about April 26, 2019, Graves contends she heard the termination dates for "[e]veryone in the Vista RA group," except herself, were being extended until June 29, 2019. (Graves Ex. 12 at DJO 000536.) Graves emailed Esmail for an explanation about "why I am the only RA employee in Vista not being extended to the end of June," and pointed out DJO had "an audit the week of June 21st from the Ukrainian authorities in Vista." (Id.) Graves stated that she had previously worked with the Ukrainian authorities, knew the auditor, and had an excellent rapport with him. (Id.)
Esmail responded that "[w]e currently do not have any approval to extend any of our contractors beyond" June 2019. (DJO Opp'n Ex. 19 at 330.) Graves immediately responded to Esmail that she was not [*9]  a contractor, "so given that I am a full time employee here at DJO I am not sure if I am eligible to be extended or not." (Id.)

D. While on maternity leave, Graves is asked to assist with an audit.
On or about May 8, Graves began maternity leave. (Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 23.) The day before her leave began, Jim Pomeroy, the Vice President of Global Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs, emailed her regarding an "Assessment Thursday / Friday." (Graves Ex. 14 [Doc. 42-18] at 13 of 366 ; Pomeroy Decl. [Doc. 47-3] ¶ 2.) The email stated:
I have visitors Thursday [May 9] and Friday [May 10] to do a high level assessment on DJO. This came from the acquisition diligence, and some concerns around it. [¶] I need someone on call to help me find procedures and answer questions. Won't be an all the day thing, but need someone knowledgeable to be near their LYNC so they can answer quick questions. [¶] It's not a formal audit, so we're not doing a backroom or documenting the activities. [¶] I will just need some help. [¶] Will you be available?
(Graves Ex. 14 at 13 of 36.) The next day, Graves responded, "I can be available—what time did you need me to be on?" (Id. at 4 of 36.) Pomeroy responded:
I don't [*10]  think I'll need you sitting through the conversations. A lot of what we cover will be more organization and strategic in nature. [¶] If you could just keep an eye on the comms and if you see my name pop up please jump on it quicky since it will be an information request. [¶] If we get to a point where it makes sense to get you on a call, we will. [¶] No need to work special hours, I think normal CA working hours will be fine.
(Id. at 3-4 of 36.)
In addition to Pomeroy, on May 8, Pete Gonzalez asked if Graves "was available for a call at 1:00pm today" to "discuss CA-00793 - related subject matter...." (Id. at 19 of 36.) Graves agreed. (Id. at 20 of 36.) In total, Graves contends she worked between 35 and 40 hours while on FMLA leave without getting paid. (DJO Ex. 1 at 101:1-14, 110:9-24; Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 22.)

E. During her exit interview, Graves was told she needed to sign the Release to receive her "payments."
On May 31, the day before Graves' last day at DJO, she attended an exit interview at the Vista office with Donna Tindel from human resources and Jeff Monroe from quality assurance. (DJO Opp'n Ex 1 at 67:8-24, 70:14-16.) During the interview, Graves contends Tindel stated that [*11]  Graves had 10 days to sign a Confidential Separation and General Release of all Claims (the "Release") and that Graves would receive her "payments" after signing the Release. (Id. at 66:16-67:9, 77:18-22; Graves Ex. 7 at 70:24-71:2, 78:2-24, 282:17-283:12.) Graves claims that because she did not receive the $33,000 completion bonus on her last day of work as set forth in the Termination Letter, she assumed Tindel's reference to "payments" included the bonus. (Id.)
On or about June 10, Graves received a notification stating that she had to sign the Release by June 10. (Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 34.) Because she still had not received the $33,000 completion bonus, Graves continued to believe she had to sign the Release to receive the bonus. (Id. ¶ 29.) Graves, therefore, signed the Release. (Id. ¶ 35; DJO Ex. 16 [Doc. 47-6] 234)

F. Graves files this lawsuit.
On June 17, 2020, Graves filed this lawsuit. (See Compl. [Doc. 1].) The Complaint asserts 13 causes of action for violation of various provisions of the California Labor Code and California Government Code, violation of the Federal Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. (the "FMLA"), intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and [*12]  unfair competition under California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. (Id.)
Graves now seeks partial summary judgment and DJO seeks summary judgment.

II. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56(c) where the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A fact is material when, under the governing substantive law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Freeman v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th Cir. 1997). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. The moving party can satisfy this burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Id. at 322-23. "Disputes over irrelevant or unnecessary facts will not preclude a grant of summary judgment." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).
"The district court may limit its review to the documents submitted for the [*13]  purpose of summary judgment and those parts of the record specifically referenced therein." Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1030 (9th Cir. 2001). Therefore, the court is not obligated "to scour the record in search of a genuine issue of triable fact." Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Richards v. Combined Ins. Co., 55 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1995)).
If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party cannot defeat summary judgment merely by demonstrating "that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252) ("The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party's position is not sufficient."). Rather, the nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by 'the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).
When making this determination, the court must view all inferences drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. "Credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, [when] he [or she] is ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.

III. Discussion
The sole issue raised in Graves' [*14]  motion is whether the Release is enforceable. Graves contends it is not enforceable for two reasons. First, she contends the Release is unconscionable under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5 and Armendariz v. Foundation health Psychcare Services, Inc., 24 Cal.4th 83, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 745, 6 P.3d 669 (2000). Second, Graves argues the Release is illegal under California Labor Code § 206.5.
In response to Graves' motion and in its own motion, DJO argues (1) Armendariz and Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5 do not apply, (2) the enforceability of the Release is governed by Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 481 (1996), and (3) if section 1670.5 and Armendariz apply, the Release is not unconscionable. According to DJO, because the Release is enforceable, summary judgment should be granted. In the alternative, DJO raises separate reasons summary adjudication is appropriate as to each of Graves' causes of action.

A. The validity of the Release.

1. Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5 and Armendariz apply.
DJO contends California Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5(a) and Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th 83, are not applicable to the Release. (DJO Opp'n [Doc. 51] 14:9-12; DJO Reply [Doc. 55] 3:13-14.) In support of this argument, DJO asserts that the "issue in Armendariz was wholly different than this action" because it "addressed the enforceability of arbitration—not severance—agreements in the employment context." (Reply at 3:8-11.) Instead, DJO contends that Skrbina—which involved a challenged to a release agreement—governs this case. (Id. at 3:13-14.) DJO's argument lacks merit.
The primary issue raised in [*15]  Graves' motion is whether the Release is unconscionable. Accordingly, cases addressing that doctrine, particularly California Supreme Court cases such as Armendariz, are particularly relevant or "applicable." In contrast, cases that do not address the unconscionability doctrine are not applicable or less persuasive.
Skrbina did not involve the unconscionability doctrine. While the plaintiff in Skribina challenged the validity of a release, there was no mention of Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5(a) or the unconscionability doctrine. Instead, plaintiff argued "he never intended to abandon his discrimination and harassment claims and that neither the company nor the union told him that signing the release might affect those claims; he was told only that he must sign in order to collect his severance." Id. at 1366. In affirming the trial court's finding that the release was enforceable, the Court of Appeal relied on (1) plaintiff's admission that he "read the release, then signed it 'willingly'" and (2) his failure to offer "evidence that defendants told him the release did not encompass" his employment discrimination claims. Id. at 1367.
In contrast to Skrbina, Armendariz involved the unconscionability doctrine. While DJO attempts to distinguish the case [*16]  on the basis that the contract at issue was an arbitration agreement, the California Supreme Court explained that unconscionability "applies to all contracts generally" because "a contract or provision, even if consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties, will be denied enforcement if, considered in its context, it is unduly oppressive or 'unconscionable.'" Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at 113 (citations omitted).
Because Graves' is challenging the Release as unconscionable, Armendariz governs applies, not Skrbina.

2. Disputed issues of fact exist regarding whether the Release is unconscionable.
California Code of Civil Procedure § 1670.5(a) provides:
If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
Unconscionability has a "procedural" and "substantive" element. A&M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp., 135 Cal.App.3d 473, 486, 186 Cal. Rptr. 114 (1982). The procedural element focuses on "oppression" and "surprise." Id. "'Oppression' arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and 'an absence of meaningful choice.' [*17]  [Citation omitted.] 'Surprise' involves the extent to which the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms. [Citation omitted.]" Id.
The substantive element looks at "the effects of the contractual terms and whether they are unreasonable. Because a contract is largely an allocation of risks, a contractual provision is 'substantively suspect if it reallocates the risks ... in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.' [Citation omitted.]" Marin Storage & Trucking, Inc. v. Bencoj Contracting and Eng'g, Inc., 89 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1052-53, 107 Cal. Rptr. 2d 645 (2001). Thus, for example, a one-sided arbitration agreement requiring one contracting party, but not the other, to arbitrate all claims would be considered overly harsh. Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc., 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 246-47, 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 621 (2014); Little v. Auto Striegler, Inc., 29 Cal.4t 1064, 1071 (2003) ("Substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms, but may generally be described as unfairly one-sided.")
In order to find a contract unenforceable because it is unconscionable, both procedural and substantive elements must be present. Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at 11. "But they need not be present in the same degree. 'Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or [*18]  unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.' [Citations omitted.] In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa." Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC, 61 Cal. 4th 899, 910, 190 Cal. Rptr. 3d 812, 353 P.3d 741 (2015) (quoting Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at 114)).
Here, there are disputed issues of fact regarding the unconscionability analysis. There is a dispute regarding whether DJO changed the terms of the agreement at the last minute. Under the Termination Letter, Graves was to receive the $33,000 completion bonus "on your last day of employment ... provided you remain an employee in good standing and perform your duties in a satisfactory manner through the Separation Date." (Graves Ex. 2 at DJO 000277.) DJO has not argued, much less provided evidence, that Graves was not in good standing and did not perform her duties in a satisfactory manner through the "Separation Date." Nor has DJO argued or identified any evidence establishing that Graves received her completion bonus on her "last day of employment" as required under the Termination Letter.
Moreover, Graves testified that during her exit interview on May 31, 2019, Tindel, DJO's HR representative, [*19]  stated that Graves had to sign the Release to receive her "payments." (Graves Ex. 7 at 282:17-283:12.) Consistent with Tindel's statement, Graves contends she did not receive the completion bonus until after she signed the Release on or about June 10. Under this version of events, a reasonable jury could conclude that DJO unilaterally changed the terms of the agreement during the exit interview by requiring Graves to execute the Release to receive the $33,000 completion bonus. Such a change would amount to a significant level of procedural unconscionability, especially given that by May 31, 2019, Graves had already satisfied her end of the bargain by continuing to remain in good standing and performing her duties in a satisfactory manner since October 2018.
DJO disputes that Graves did not "receive" her completion bonus until after she signed the Release. (See DJO P&A at 11:11-14.) In support of this dispute, DJO cites the Graves' June 7, 2019 wage statement. (Id., citing DJO Ex. 23 [Doc. 47-6].) But the wage statement simply lists Graves' wages; it does not establish when she received her completion bonus. Accordingly, at best, the wage statement creates an inference that Graves may [*20]  have received the completion bonus before signing the Release.
DJO also argues that Graves was not surprised because she "negotiated her separation package (i.e., Severance and General Release Notice) over an eight-month period before signing the Agreement." (DJO Opp'n at 15:5-6.) But DJO confuses the issue, which is not when Graves learned she would need to sign the Release to receive the severance pay, but instead when she learned she needed to sign the Release to receive the completion bonus. Based on Graves' testimony, she did not learn that signing the Release was a condition for receiving the completion bonus until her exit interview.
Next, the Court looks at substantive unconscionability. There is no dispute that the terms of the Release are one-sided, only waiving Graves' claims against DJO:
In consideration of and in return for the promises and covenants undertaken in this Agreement ... Employee ... does hereby release, absolve and discharge the Company and each of the Company's parents, subsidiaries, related companies and business concerns, past and present, and each of them, as well as each of their partners, trustees, directors, officers, agents, attorneys, servants and employees, [*21]  past and present, and each of them (collectively referred to as "Releasees") from any and all claims, demands, ... and liabilities of whatever kind or nature in state or federal law, equity or otherwise, whether known or unknown to Employee (collectively, the "Claims"), which Employee now owns or holds or has at any time owned or held as against Releasees....
(DJO Opp'n Ex. 13 at 197-198.)
DJO nevertheless argues that the Release is not substantively unconscionable because courts "have consistently held that a unilateral release of claims in a severance agreement is proper and not substantively unconscionable." (DJO Opp'n at 17:6-7.) In support of this argument, DJO cites three cases: Skrbina, 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, Zepher v. Kaiser Foundation Hosp., 687 Fed.Appx. 636 (9th Cir. 2017) and Aguilar v. Zep Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65166, 2014 WL 1900460 (N.D. Cal. 2014). None of the cases support DJO's argument.
As discussed above, Skrbina did not involve the unconscionability doctrine and, therefore, does not stand for the proposition that a unilateral release is not substantively unconscionable. Zepher, an unpublished memorandum opinion, is not helpful for at least two reasons. First, the decision does not describe the factual background and it is, therefore, impossible to evaluate whether the case is factually analogous. Second, in finding there was no substantive unconscionability, [*22]  the Ninth Circuit relied on Skrbina. As set forth above, Skrbina did not involve unconscionability and, therefore, does not stand for the proposition that a unilateral release is not substantively unconscionable.
Finally, Aguilar does not support DJO for two reasons. First, unlike this case, the plaintiff failed to establish procedural unconscionability because his claim that he did not understand the release's terms was contradicted by his deposition testimony and the court found that a letter defendant sent to plaintiff "even-handedly" explained the release. Id. 2014 WL 1900460 at *7. Plaintiff's failure to establish procedural unconscionability is significant because as explained in Armendariz, both procedural and substantive unconscionability are required to render an agreement unenforceable. Second, and more importantly, Aguilar specifically found that "[a]n agreement that does not include a mutual release of claims is one-sided in nature." Id. at *7, citing Lara v. Onsite Health, Inc., 896 F.Supp.2d 831, 843 (N.D. Cal. 2012). Accordingly, the case contradicts DJO's contention that a one-sided release is not substantively unconscionable.
Despite the Release's substantive unconscionability, a disputed issue of fact exists regarding procedural unconscionability. Because both are necessary to render the Release [*23]  unenforceable, neither party is entitled so summary adjudication.

3. Even under Skrbina, disputed issues of fact exist regarding whether the Release enforceable.
Even if Skrbina governed this case, disputed issues of fact exist regarding whether the Release is enforceable.
DJO contends that under Skrbina, the Release is valid because "there is numerous indicia of Plaintiff's voluntariness in executing the [Release] and, ultimately, the Agreement." (DJO P&A at 10:11-13.) The problem with this argument is DJO ignores the evidence indicating it changed the terms of Termination Letter with regard to the completion bonus.
DJO contends "there was not a coercive atmosphere" because Graves was "never denied the opportunity to inquire, discuss, or negotiate the terms of her separation package, including the Agreement." (DJO P&A at 10:14-16.) According to DJO, "Plaintiff was not under any duress to sign the Agreement because the [completion] bonus she negotiated (i.e., $33,000) was not conditioned on executing the Agreement." (Id. at 11:8-9, emphasis in original.) As support, DJO contends Graves "received this bonus on June 7, 2019—which was three days before she signed the Agreement...." (Id. at 11:11-12, emphasis [*24]  in original.)
As set forth in the previous section, whether DJO changed the terms of the "Agreement" at the last minute by requiring Graves to sign the Release before receiving the completion bonus is a disputed issue of fact. Additionally, while DJO has provided evidence of when Graves' wage statement was printed, there is no evidence establishing when DJO sent the completion bonus or when Graves received it. Given these disputes, DJO's contention that "there was not a coercive atmosphere" when Graves signed the Release is disputed.
DJO next contends the Release is valid because Graves "was given fifteen days to review the Agreement and consult with counsel of her choice." (DJO P&A at 17-18.) This fact is also disputed. Graves testified that during the May 31 exit interview, she was told she had ten days to sign the Release. (DJO Ex. 1 at 66:16-67:9.) Graves also testified that on the tenth day, she received a notification that she had to sign the Release by June 10. (Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 33.) Because by that date she still had not received the completion bonus, Graves contends she signed the Release. (Id. ¶ 34.)
DJO also argues the terms of the Termination Letter are clear and unambiguous. [*25]  (DJO P&A at 12:6.) While the written terms of the October 3, 2018 Termination Letter are clear, the issue is whether a jury will believe Graves' testimony that DJO changed those terms during the May 31, 2019 exit interview.
For all these reasons, the Court finds disputed issues of fact preclude a finding that the Release is enforceable even under Skrbina.

4. Is the Release illegal under Labor Code § 206.5
Graves argues that because she "was clearly owed wages based in the fact that she was required to work while on FMLA leave," the Release was illegal under Labor Code § 206.5. (Graves P&A [Doc. 42-1] 14:28-15:5.) DJO responds that section 206.5 "does not bar the enforcement of Plaintiff's Agreement because there is a legitimate dispute regarding whether Plaintiff is owed wages." (DJO Opp'n at 21:2-3.)
Labor Code § 206.5(a) provides, in relevant part:
An employer shall not require the execution of a release of a claim or right on account of wages due, or to become due, or made as an advance on wages to be earned, unless payment of those wages has been made. A release required or executed in violation of the provisions of this section shall be null and void as between the employer and employee.
In Watkins v. Wachovia Corp., 172 Cal. App. 4th 1576, 92 Cal. Rptr. 3d 409 (2009), the court explained that this section must be read together [*26]  with Labor Code § 206(a), which, in the case of a dispute over whether wages are owed, requires the employer to "pay, without condition ... all wages, or parts thereof, conceded by him to be due...." Id. at 1586-87. When read together with section 206(a), Watkins held:
... Labor Code section 206.5 simply prohibits employers from coercing settlements by withholding wages concededly due. In other words, wages are not considered "due" and unreleasable under Labor Code section 206.5, unless they are required to be paid under Labor Code section 206. When a bona fide dispute exists, the disputed amounts are not "due," and the bona fide dispute can be voluntarily settled with a release and a payment—even if the payment is for an amount less than the total wages claimed by employee.
Id. at 1587 (citing Chindarah v. Pick Up Stix, Inc., 171 Cal.App.4th 796, 90 Cal. Rptr. 3d 175 (2009)); see also Young v. AmeriGas Propane, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144123, 2014 WL 5092878, at *4-5 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (finding § 206.5(a) did not void a release the plaintiff voluntarily signed in exchange for severance pay because there was a dispute over whether pay for missed meal and rest breaks was owed). Thus, DJO's Release violates section 206.5 if it covered wages DJO conceded were due.
Graves' claim that the Release is illegal under section 206.5 is based on DJO's alleged failure to pay her for (1) the time she worked while on FMLA leave—i.e., the approximately 35 to 40 hours worked from May 13th through the 17th—and (2) her completion bonus. (Graves P&A at [*27]  14:28-15:5; DJO Ex. 1 at 101:4-14.) With respect to the work while on FMLA leave, the evidence establishes that when the Release was signed, there was a bona fide dispute as to whether the wages were owed. Graves admitted (1) she never told DJO that she had not been paid for working during maternity leave, and (2) she never asked to be paid for that time. (DJO Ex. 1 at 110:18-24, 111:14-21.) Additionally, DJO's evidence establishes that on Tuesday, May 28, 2019, DJO's payroll provided Graves with a calendar for May denoting the days worked, hours owed, and what each should be billed as (i.e., holiday, sick day, etc.). (DJO Ex. 23 at 301-304.) In response, Graves corrected the calendar to show "the sick/vacation time that has been paid vs. not." (Id. at 302.) Graves was then paid according to the corrected calendar she provided to payroll. Because Graves failed to notify DJO about the number of hours she allegedly worked while on FMLA leave and failed to notify DJO that it had not paid her for those hours, the Court finds no reasonable jury could conclude that DJO violated section 206.5 with respect to her work while on FMLA leave.
Regarding the compensation bonus, there is no dispute that under [*28]  the Termination Letter, it was "due" on Graves' last day. However, as discussed above, a dispute exists regarding whether DJO required Graves to sign the Release to receive the bonus. Accordingly, a dispute also exists regarding whether the Release violates section 206.5 with regard to the compensation bonus.7

B. Violation of Labor Code § 204 (1st Cause of Action)
Graves's First Cause of Action is for violation of California Labor Code § 204 (Failure to Pay All Wages Owed Every Pay Period). DJO seeks summary adjudication arguing there is no evidence establishing that it knew or had reason to know about Graves's work while on FMLA leave. (DJO P&A at 26:26-27:27.)
Section 204(a) requires that all wages must be paid twice a month during specific periods. See Cal. Lab. Code § 204(a) ("Labor performed between the 1st and 15th days, inclusive, of any calendar month shall be paid for between the 16th and the 26th day of the month during which the labor was performed, and labor performed between the 16th and the last day, inclusive, of any calendar month, shall be paid for between the 1st and 10th day of the following month."). To prevail on this claim, Graves must provide evidence that DJO "had actual or constructive knowledge of [her] alleged off-the clock work." White v. Starbucks Corp., 497 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1083 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (citing [*29]  Morillion v. Royal Packing Co., 22 Cal.4th 575, 585, 94 Cal. Rptr. 2d 3, 995 P.2d 139 (2000)).
DJO argues "[i]t is undisputed DJO never ordered—either implicitly or explicitly—Plaintiff to perform this alleged off-the-clock work." (DJO P&A at 27:12-14.) In support of this argument, DJO contends Graves testified that "no one ever told her to work off-the-clock or that she was required to do so as a condition for her to receive any consideration under the Agreement." (Id. at 27:14-17, emphasis in original.) DJO further asserts that she "understood neither her severance nor her bonuses would be affected by taking time off." (Id. at 27:17-18.) DJO's argument lacks merit.
First, DJO's contention that Graves was not asked to work while on FMLA leave is contradicted by the evidence. During her deposition, Graves testified that while on leave "Jim Pomeroy... had specifically requested me to work during those times." (DJO Ex. 1 at 101:6-24.) Graves' testimony is consistent with Pomeroy's May 8 email requesting her assistance with the "Assessment Thursday / Friday," as well as Gonzalez's request for assistance. (Graves Ex. 14 at 3-4, 13, 19 and 20 of 36.)
Second, DJO's assertion that Graves understood her severance and bonus would not be affected if she refused to assist Pomeroy is also [*30]  contradicted by her testimony. When asked if she told Pomeroy that she did not want to assist him, Graves stated:
I did not. Again, you know, I knew that I had committed to support any activities that DJO and—and in particular, you know, Jim, being the vice president of quality and regulatory, had reached out to me directly to support and communicated the importance of these due diligence activities.
So I took that as commitments that I needed to fulfill to uphold my portion of the agreement that I had committed to as part of my separation.
(DJO Ex. 1 at 131:11-20.) She also testified that under Termination Letter, "if I failed to perform my duties, that I would forfeit my bonus and my severance." (Id. at 131:18-132:2.)
For these reasons, the Court finds DJO is not entitled to summary adjudication.8

C. Violation of Labor Code §§ 226(a) and 226.3 (2nd Cause of Action)
Graves's second cause of action is for violation of Labor Code §§ 226 and 226.3 (Failure to Furnish Timely and Accurate Wage Statements). DJO seeks summary adjudication arguing that Graves failed to establish that DJO's alleged violations were "knowing and intentional." (DJO P&A at 28:19-21.)
A claim under 226(e) requires a "showing of three elements: (1) a violation [*31]  of Section 226(a); (2) that is 'knowing and intentional;' and (3) a resulting injury." Willner v. Manpower Inc., 35 F.Supp.3d 116, 1128 (N.D. Cal. 2014). Courts interpret the terms "knowing and intentional" to mean an intentional failure or refusal to perform a required act. See Rd. Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, Inc., 102 Cal.App.4th 765, 781, 125 Cal. Rptr. 2d 804 (2002) (construing the term "willful" in Labor Code § 203 to mean "intentionally failed or refused to perform an act which was required to be done."). A "knowing and intentional" violation "requires a showing that the defendant knew that facts existed that brought its actions or omissions within the provisions of section 226(a). Willner, 35 F.Supp.3d at 1131. "'[I]solated and unintentional payroll errors' are not subject to damages under Section 226(e) and therefore do not fall within the scope of 'knowing and intentional.'" Id.
According to the opposition, Graves' claim is based on DJO's failure to pay her for the hours worked while on FMLA leave. (Graves Opp'n [Doc. 52] 19:11-17.) In support of this theory, Graves argues:
the argument that DJO may have not known how many hours Ms. Graves worked in responding to her duties imposed upon her by DJO lacks any common sense as DJO was aware that she was assigned tasks while she was on medical leave.
(Id. at 19:13-17.)
Consistent with much of Graves' opposition, she cites no evidence supporting her argument. Here, she failed [*32]  to cite evidence remotely suggesting anyone at DJO knew how many hours Graves worked while on leave. In contrast, as discussed with respect to Labor Code § 206.5, Graves admitted (1) she never told DJO that she was not paid for working during FMLA leave, and (2) she never asked to be paid for that time. (DJO Ex. 1 at 110:18-24, 111:14-21.) Additionally, DJO's evidence establishes that payroll provided her with a calendar for May so that she could indicate the dates for which she had not been paid. (DJO Ex. 23 at 301-304.) In response, Graves corrected the calendar to show "the sick/vacation time that has been paid vs. not." (Id. at 302.) Graves was then paid according to the corrected calendar she provided to Payroll. In light of this evidence, the Court finds there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that DJO knowingly and intentionally violated Labor Code § 226(a). Accordingly, summary adjudication of this cause of action is appropriate.

D. Violation of Labor Code §§ 1174 and 1174.5 (3rd Cause of Action)
Graves's Third Cause of Action is for violation of Labor Code §§ 1174 and 1174.5 (Failure to Maintain Accurate Records). DJO argues this cause of action fails because there is no private right of action under section 1174. (DJO P&A at 29:5-11.) [*33] 
Graves does not respond to DJO's argument. Regardless, DJO is correct that there is no private right of action for violation of section 1174(d). Dawson v. HITCO Carbon Composites, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220221, 2017 WL 7806618, at *7 (C.D. Cal. 2017) (Section 1174(d) "does not contemplate a private cause of action."). Accordingly, summary adjudication of this cause of action is appropriate.

E. Violation of Labor Code § 203 (4th Cause of Action)
Graves's Fourth Cause of Action is for violation of Labor Code § 203 (Failure to Pay All Wages Due Upon Separation). DJO argues this cause of action fails because Graves cannot establish DJO's alleged violations are "willful." (DJO P&A at 28:19-20.)
A "willful failure to pay" under Labor Code § 203 occurs "when an employer intentionally fails to pay wages to an employee when those wages are due." Sansone v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84681, 2022 WL 1478521, at *4 (S.D. Cal. May 10, 2022). To be liable under section 203, "the employer's refusal to pay need not to be based on a deliberate evil purpose to defraud workmen of wages which the employer knows to be due." Barnhill v. Saunders & Co., 125 Cal.App.3d 1, 7, 177 Cal. Rptr. 803 (1981). However, if there is a good faith dispute that any wages are due, waiting time penalties under section 203 will be precluded. A "good faith dispute" occurs "when an employer presents a defense, based in law or fact which, if successful, would preclude any recovery on the part of the employee." Sansone v. Charter Commc'ns, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84681, 2022 WL 1478521, at *4 (S.D. Cal. 2022).
As an initial matter, Graves failed to provide any meaningful opposition to DJO's argument. For this reason [*34]  alone, DJO is entitled to summary adjudication. Additionally, for the reasons discussed with regard to the Second Cause of Action, the Court finds there is no evidence indicating DJO willfully failed to pay Graves for the hours worked while on FMLA leave. For this additional reason, summary adjudication is appropriate.

F. Failure to Relieve from Work Duties While on FMLA Leave (5th Cause of Action)
Graves's Fifth Cause of Action alleges DJO violated the FMLA by requiring her to work while on FMLA leave. DJO argues this claim fails because (1) any contact with Graves during her FMLA leave was "de minimis and did not materially interfere with Plaintiff's leave" and (2) Graves was not required to complete any work-related tasks. (DJO P&A at 17:15-21.)
Under the FMLA, it is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right" guaranteed under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86-87, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002). Whether an employer has unlawfully interfered with an employee's FMLA leave depends on the extent of the employer's contacts with the employee.
In Michelucci v. County of Napa, 2019 WL 1995332 (N.D.Cal. 2019), plaintiff Dante Michelucci was placed on FMLA leave as a result of severe stress caused by harassment he suffered for approximately [*35]  12 months. While on leave, his employer, Napa County, belatedly began investigating the complaints he had made while still at work. Napa County then demanded Michelucci attend an interview and cooperate with the investigation, despite the fact that he was seeking daily treatment and care. "When Michelucci 'explained that he was on FMLA leave, Defendant accused [him] of failing to cooperate' in the investigation," leading Michelucci to resign. Id. at *2. He then sued Napa County for interfering with his FMLA leave.
In moving to dismiss, Napa County relied on two cases that rejected claims of FMLA interference based on the employer's contacts with the employee during leave. In Clark v. AmTrust N. Am, 2018 WL 839148 (N.D.Cal. 2018), the employee's interference claim was based on "several emails" the employer sent asking "when the employee would be returning to work." Id. at *17. In O'Donnell v. Passport Health Commc'ns, Inc., 561 F.App'x 212 (3rd Cir. 2014), the employer's contacts were found to be "de minimis" because they "did not require [the employee] to perform work to benefit the company...." Id. at 218.
While Michelucci acknowledged that Clark and O'Donnell were persuasive, the district court denied the motion to dismiss because it found Napa County's contacts with the employee were more significant:
Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Michelucci, [*36]  as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, these allegations are sufficient at this stage to state a claim for FMLA interference because they go far beyond requiring periodic reporting or other de minimis, work-related contacts, and could support a finding that [Defendant] Napa County used the investigation to discourage Michelucci from taking FMLA leave.
Id. *6.
Similar to Michelucci, the evidence supports a finding that DJO required more from Graves than periodic reporting or "de minimis" contacts. As discussed above, after beginning FMLA leave, Pomeroy asked for Graves' assistance for the ongoing audit. (DJO Ex. 1 at 108:2-109:7, 110:9-24; Graves Ex. 14 at 3-4, 13 of 36.) The evidence also establishes that Gonzalez requested her assistance while she was on FMLA leave. (See Graves Ex. 14 at 19 of 36.) Additionally, Graves claims she worked "about 35 to 40 hours during the week of the 13th through the 17th, including the 13th and 14th." (DJO Ex. 1 at 101:1-10.)
Moreover, Graves testified she believed she was required to assist Pomeroy to be eligible for the severance and completion bonuses under the terms of the Termination Letter. (DJO Ex. 1 at 131:8-132:2.) Those terms required that Graves [*37]  "remain an employee in good standing and perform your duties in a satisfactory manner through the Separation Date." (DJO Ex. 13 at 194.) For these reasons, the Court finds a reasonable jury could find DJO violated the FMLA by interfering with Graves' leave.

G. Discrimination and Harassment/Wrongful Termination (6th Cause of Action)
Graves' Sixth Cause of Action alleges DJO unlawfully discriminated and harassed her in violation of Government Code §§ 12940, et seq. ("FEHA"). DJO argues there is no evidence supporting either claim.

1. Discrimination.
Employment discrimination claims based on FEHA are analyzed under the three-step burden shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat., Inc., 24 Ca1.4th 317, 354 (2000) ("Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes. [Citations omitted.]") Under this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima-facie case of discrimination; defendant must then offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for the action taken; if defendant succeeds, the plaintiff must prove that defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for the action. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.
A prima-facie case of discrimination requires a plaintiff to "offer [*38]  evidence that 'gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.'" Palmer v. Pioneer Inn Associates, Ltd, 338 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). This typically requires plaintiff to provide evidence that he or she "'(1) was a member of a protected class, (2) was qualified for the position he [or she] sought or was performing competently in the position ... held, (3) suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance [that] suggests discriminatory motive.'" Serri v. Santa Clara University, 226 Cal.App.4th 830, 861, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 732 (2014) (brackets in original) (quoting Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 121 Cal.App.4th 95, 111-112, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 717 (2004)). "The requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case ... on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence." Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., 26 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1994). Where the plaintiff meets this burden, a presumption of discrimination arises "which, if unanswered by the employer, is mandatory—it requires judgment for the plaintiff." Serri, 226 Cal.App.4th at 860 (quoting Reeves, 121 Cal.App.4th at 112.)
Under the second step, the employer may dispel the presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. Serri, 226 Cal.App.4th at 861. If the employer is successful, then the under third step, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the employer's proffered reasons are pretext for [*39]  discrimination or the employee must offer other evidence of discriminatory motive. Id. (citing Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 356).
Where the employer moves for summary judgment, the McDonnel-Douglas framework is modified. Serri, 226 Cal.App.4th at 861. Instead, "the employer, as the moving party, has the initial burden to present admissible evidence showing either that one or more elements of plaintiff's prima facie case is lacking or that the adverse employment action was based upon legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors." Id. at (quoting Hicks v. KNTV Television, Inc., 160 Cal.App.4th 994, 1003, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240 (2008)). Accordingly, because DJO is the moving party, Graves is not required to establish her prima facie case, and instead DJO must present admissible evidence that one or more elements are lacking or its decision to not offer her the RA Manager position was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory factors.
Here, DJO argues that Graves' discrimination claim is based on two theories: (1) DJO did not grant her a reasonable accommodation; and (2) Graves was not offered the Regulatory Affairs ("RA") Manager position. (DJO P&A at 18:20-22.)
With regard to the first theory, DJO argues Graves did not suffer an adverse employment action because she "was provided with a reasonable accommodation—maternity leave—pursuant to federal [*40]  and state law." (DJO P&A at 18:23-24.) As set forth below in the section evaluating Graves' eleventh cause of action for failure to accommodate, disputed issues of material fact preclude summary adjudication of that cause of action. Accordingly, for the same reasons, summary adjudication of this issue will be denied.9
As for Graves' claim that she was discriminated against with respect to the RA Manager position, DJO contends the claim lacks merit for two reasons. First, DJO argues that it "had informed Plaintiff—well before she even disclosed her pregnancy—the company would be undergoing a corporate restructure and would relocate its headquarters in Texas. As such, Plaintiff's position would be eliminated." (DJO P&A at 18:26-28, emphasis added.)
The problem with DJO's argument is that it focuses on the wrong position. When DJO announced it was relocating, "Plaintiff's position" was a Global Medical Device Auditor, not the RA Manager. (DJO Jt. State. at No. 1.) With regard to the RA Manager position, the evidence supports a finding that it would remain in Vista. (See Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 5; Graves Ex. 7 at 25:16-26:25, 34:3-35:21; Graves Ex. 6 at DJO 000339; DJO Opp'n Ex. 18 at 316 (organization [*41]  chart showing position in Carlsbad, CA); see also Graves Ex. 10 at 5 of 6.) Thus, DJO's argument is unavailing.
Next, DJO argues Graves' claim lacks merit because the newly created position "could only be filled by a contractor." (DJO P&A at 18:28-19:1.) As support for this argument, DJO cites Graves' deposition testimony, where she acknowledged being told by Esmail that "he would be filling it not as a full-time employee but as a contractor...." (Id. at 19:1-2, citing DJO Ex. 1 at 199:9-23.) This argument is not persuasive for several reasons.
First, the RA Manager's status as a "contractor," standing alone, says nothing about the qualifications of the position in terms of the skills or experience required. Instead, the RA Manager's status as a contractor is relevant to the type of benefits or responsibilities the person has compared to a DJO employee. Nor has DJO provided any evidence—such as a declaration from anyone in HR, Pomeroy or Esmail—indicating why the RA Manager's status as a contractor made Graves ineligible from consideration.
Second, there is evidence indicating that Esmail believed Graves was a contractor. In attempting to explain why Graves'"end date" was not being extended [*42]  like other employees, Esmail stated that it was because "[w]e currently do not have any approval to extend any of our contractors beyond" June 2019. (DJO Opp'n Ex. 19 [Doc. 51-4] 330, emphasis added.) Esmail's belief that Graves was a contractor directly contradicts DJO's purported justification for not hiring her as the RA Manager.
Third, aside from the evidence indicating that Esmail believed Graves was a contractor (which negates DJO's alleged legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason), there is additional evidence of pretext. Specifically, Graves testified that before informing Esmail that she was pregnant, they were communicating "quite regularly about continuing my employment. He continued to do that to other employees after I told him that I was pregnant, but he no longer engaged in those discussions with me...." (DJO Ex. 1 at 174:14-19.) Instead, according to Graves, Esmail suggested she should stay at home with the baby just as his wife did. (Graves Opp'n Decl. ¶ 7.) The proximity between Graves informing Esmail that she was pregnant and the abrupt end of his discussions with her about becoming the RA Manager, as well as his comments regarding staying at home with the baby all support [*43]  an inference of pretext. See Dawson v. Entek Intern., 630 F.3d 928, 937 (9th Cir. 2011) ("[P]roximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision [i]s one [way] a jury logically could infer [that the plaintiff] was terminated in retaliation." (brackets in original) (quoting Keyser v. Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dist., 265 F.3d 741, 751-52 (9th Cir.2001)).
Finally, DJO also argues Graves cannot prevail on her discrimination claim because it "in fact offered Plaintiff a position after her maternity leave." (DJO P&A at 19:10-11.) Oddly, DJO does not cite any evidence, such as a declaration by an HR representative, Pomeroy, Esmail or Tindel in support of this alleged fact. Instead, it relies on the following testimony from Graves:
Also, based on the conversation that I had with Jim Pomeroy where he stated that after I was done with my baby, I could give him a call and they could create or, you know, re-hire me. That particular conversation was what led me to believe most that I was being treated differently because I was pregnant.
(DJO Ex. 1 at 174:2-8.) DJO's reliance on this testimony is misplaced for several reasons.
First, Graves' discrimination claim is based on DJO's hiring decision regarding the RA Manager position, not its failure to hire her for some other unidentified position. [*44]  And DJO cites no authority for the proposition that subsequently offering Graves a different position is a defense to its earlier discriminatory hiring decision regarding the RA Manager position. Second, far from disputing a pregnancy discrimination claim, telling a pregnant employee that you will re-hire her after she is "done with [her] baby," supports the claim that the previous hiring decision was discriminatory. Third, DJO's argument is based on a mischaracterization of Graves' testimony. Contrary to its argument, Graves was not confirming that DJO made a firm—"in fact"—offer of employment. As she explained later in the transcript, what Graves "took the comment to mean [was] that after my child was older and after I was not pregnant anymore and not caring for her anymore, I could give him a call and he would see if there was a position or create a position for me." (Id. at 177:5-9; 177:11-25 (clarifying comment was from "Jim").10 ) Thus, DJO has failed to provide evidence supporting the contention that DJO "in fact offered" her a job.
In summary, the evidence demonstrates that DJO's proffered explanation for its employment decision regarding the RA Manager position is unworthy [*45]  of credence because it is internally inconsistent and, given the evidence, not believable. There is also evidence that suggests unlawful discrimination motivated the decision not to offer the position to Graves. For these reasons, the Court will deny DJO's motion for summary adjudication of the discrimination claim.

2. Harassment
To establish a prima facie hostile-work environment claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing: (1) he or she was subjected to verbal or physical conduct because of his or her protected status; (2) the conduct was unwelcome, and (3) the conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his or her employment and create an abusive working environment. Surrell v. California Water Serv., 518 F.3d 1097, 1108 (9th Cir. 2008). California courts have adopted the same standard for hostile work environment claims under FEHA as federal courts under Title VII. Lyle v. Warner Brothers Television Productions, 38 Cal.4th 264, 279, 42 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 132 P.3d 211 (2006) (citation omitted) (in context of gender harassment). In evaluating whether conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive, courts "look at 'all the circumstances,' including the 'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with [*46]  an employee's work performance." Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters. Inc., 256 F.3d 864, 872 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Isolated, sporadic, or trivial acts do not rise to the hostile standard. Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hosp., 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 609, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989).
DJO argues there is no evidence supporting her claims for harassment based on "her pregnancy status or her gender." (DJO P&A at 20:2-3.) The Court agrees.
Graves' opposition identifies the following three alleged acts of harassment: (1) Esmail suggested that Graves should quit her job and stay with her child11 ; (2) Esmail gave Graves "a shirt and told her he didn't know what size would work on her anymore"; and (3) a fellow employee sent a text message to Graves "comparing a woman with toned abs and the quote '100 sit ups' to a pregnant woman with the quote '1Bend Over." (Graves Opp'n at 15:14-22.)
In Mokler v. County of Orange, 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 68 Cal. Rptr. 3d 568 (2007), plaintiff sued her former employer for a hostile work environment under FEHA. Id. at 575. The claim was based on three acts of harassment by a work colleague that occurred over a five-week period. Id. at 144. The acts consisted of: (1) calling plaintiff an "aging nun"; (2) pulling plaintiff close to the colleague's body and making an inappropriate comment; and (3) placing his arm around plaintiff, stating she looked nice and demanding to know her address. Id. Although [*47]  the court found the conduct was inappropriate, it concluded the "acts of harassment fall short of establishing 'a pattern of continuous, pervasive harassment [citation omitted], necessary to show a hostile working environment under FEHA.'" Id. at 145.
Mokler is instructive for this case. Although the conduct Graves cites in support of her claim is clearly inappropriate, it falls well short of establishing a pattern of continuous, pervasive harassment that is necessary to show a hostile work environment under FEHA. Nor has Graves cited any authority indicating that the three incidents are sufficient to establish her claim or avoid summary adjudication. Accordingly, DJO is entitled to summary adjudication of the harassment claim.

H. Failure to Prevent Discrimination & Harassment (7th Cause of Action)
Graves' Seventh Cause of Action is for failure to prevent discrimination and harassment. DJO argues this claim fails because "[n]o action lies for failure to take necessary steps to prevent unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation if no such unlawful conduct lies. [Citations omitted.]" (DJO P&A at 21:14-16.) According to DJO, because" Plaintiff has no valid claims for discrimination or harassment," [*48]  summary adjudication is warranted. (Id. at 21:20-21.) Because the Court has found disputed issues of fact exist regarding Graves' discrimination claim, summary adjudication will be denied to the extent it is based on the discrimination claim.

I. Retaliation (8th Cause of Action)
Graves' Eighth Cause of Action is for retaliation. DJO seeks summary adjudication for several reasons.
First, DJO argues that Graves has failed to allege she engaged in any protected activity. (DJO P&A at 23:18-24:25.) In support of this argument, DJO argues the retaliation cause of action, as alleged in the Complaint, is based on various California Labor Code sections dealing with unpaid wages (§ 98.6), serving on a jury or domestic violence (§ 230), disclosing wages (§ 232), disclosing working conditions (§ 232.5) and disclosing a violation of law (§ 1102.5). (Id. at 23:1-8.) According to DJO, because "there are no facts to support Plaintiff was retaliated against because (1) she served on a jury, (2) was a 'victim' within the meaning of Labor Code § 230, (3) she disclosed the amount of her wages, or (4) engaged in any disclosure retaliating to her work condition at DJO," summary adjudication of these claims is warranted. (Id. at 23:9-15.) In her opposition, [*49]  Graves does not dispute DJO's argument and does not set forth any facts suggesting she engaged in the conduct protected by the various Labor Code sections. Accordingly, the Court finds Graves has conceded there is no evidence suggesting she engaged in the protected activity set forth in those Labor Code provisions.
DJO also argues there can be no "causal nexus" between the protected activity and her termination because there is no dispute her termination was based on its decision to relocate to Texas and the decision was made before she notified DJO she was pregnant. (DJO P&A at 23:18-24:25.) For the reasons set forth below with regard to Graves' wrongful termination cause of action, the Court agrees.
Finally, in her opposition, Graves argues that DJO retaliated against her when Pomeroy "requested that she work while on maternity leave," and when Esmail stopped communicating with her regarding the RA Manager position. (Graves' Opp'n at 16:4-9.) The problem with this argument is that Graves fails to identify the protected activity she was engaged in when she suffered the retaliation. See Addy v. Bliss & Glennon, 44 Cal.App.4th 205, 214, 51 Cal. Rptr. 2d 642 (1996) (to establish a retaliation cause of action, the plaintiff must establish she was engaged in a protected [*50]  activity).
For all these reasons, the Court will grant summary adjudication of this cause of action.

J. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (9th Cause of Action).
Graves' Ninth Cause of Action is for intentional infliction of emotional distress. DJO argues this claim fails because Graves cannot "establish 'extreme and outrageous' conduct or that she suffered severe emotional distress." (DJO P&A at 24:10-11.)
"Conduct is extreme and outrageous when it exceeds all bounds of decency usually tolerated by a decent society, and is of a nature which is especially calculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress." Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 617, 262 Cal. Rptr. 842 (1989). "Liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities." Id. While conduct that amounts to a hostile work environment will support an intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action (Id. at 618), personnel decisions, even if based on an improper discriminatory motive will not (Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (1996)).
As discussed above, Graves' evidence falls well short of establishing harassment. And while the Court finds the evidence—read in favor of her as the opposing party—supports her discrimination claim, Graves has failed to identify [*51]  evidence of conduct that exceeds all bounds of decency. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary adjudication of this cause of action.

K. Wrongful Termination (10th Cause of Action)
Graves' Tenth Cause of Action is for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. DJO argues Graves cannot prevail on this cause of action because there is no dispute she "was terminated for a legitimate business reason: DJO's corporate restructuring and relocation out-of-state." (DJO P&A at 20:22-23.)
There is no dispute that in July 2018, DJO notified Graves that her position was being relocated to Texas, it offered to relocate Graves to Texas and after considering relocating, Graves turned down the position. (DJO Ex. 7; DJO Ex. 1 at 19:15-24, 21:4-13.) There is also no dispute that the Termination Letter set June 1, 2019 as Graves' Separation Date. (DJO Ex. 15 at 221.) Finally, also undisputed is that Graves received her severance payments based on the Termination Letter she signed months before notifying DJO that she was pregnant. (DJO Ex. 1 at 92:10-25.)
Graves' opposition does not address the wrongful termination cause of action. Nor are there any factual allegations, much less evidence, set forth [*52]  in the opposition that contradict DJO's reasons for terminating Graves' position in Vista. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary adjudication of this cause of action.

L. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation (11th Cause of Action)
Graves's Eleventh Cause of Action is for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Under the FMLA, it is "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right" guaranteed under the FMLA. 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1); Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86-87, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002).
DJO argues this claim fails because it is undisputed she was given FMLA leave. (DJO P&A at 15:22-28.) In response, Graves argues she "was, on several occasions, asked to work and/or remain on standby between May 8, 2019, and May 16, 2019 while on approved Family Medical Leave." (Graves Opp'n at 12:26-28.) In its reply, DJO does not contend that interfering with FMLA leave does not support a claim for failure to accommodate. Instead, DJO refers to its points and authorities where it argued Graves' work while on FMLA leave was "de minimis and not actionable" or she was not required to complete any work-related tasks. (Reply at 4:14-18, citing DJO P&A at 17:24-19:4.) Because a disputed issue of fact [*53]  exists regarding whether DJO required Graves to work while on FMLA leave, the Court will deny DJO's request for summary adjudication.

M. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process (12th Cause of Action)
Graves's twelfth cause of action is for failure to engage in the interactive process. DJO argues this claim fails as a matter of law because there is no dispute Graves "was accommodated and did not request additional accommodations...." (DJO P&A at 15:17-18.)
There is no dispute that on January 9, 2019, Graves notified DJO that she was pregnant, and her due date was May 24. (DJO Ex. 18 at 241.) She also stated that she did not want to use FMLA and instead wanted to use her "vacation time from May 23—May 31st (with my last day being in the office May 22nd )." (Id.) Two days later, Graves contacted DJO to request information regarding maternity leave, which DJO provided the same day. (DJO Ex. 19 at 246-247.) On April 22, Graves submitted her Leave Request Form and DJO continued to respond to her questions related to leave. (DJO Ex. 21 [Doc. 47-6] 258, 263, 270-272.) On May 8, Graves began her FMLA leave. (DJO Ex. 22 [Doc. 47-6] 293.) These facts establish that DJO engaged in the interactive [*54]  process.
While Graves argues that DJO failed to engage in the interactive process, her opposition fails to cite any supporting evidence. Instead, Graves appears to be relying on her claim that she was required to work while on FMLA leave. (See Graves Opp'n at 12:26-27.) But this alleged conduct did not occur during the interactive process and Graves cites no case law or statute suggesting it supports her claim. Generally, an employer causes a breakdown in the interactive process by rejecting a possible accommodation or failing to propose an alternative. See Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1139 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding interactive process broke down when employer rejected employee's request to work at-home and failed to explore other accommodations). An employer may also cause a breakdown by failing to act or delaying in responding to an employee's request for a reasonable accommodation. See Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1116-17 (9th Cir. 2000) ("'A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith.'") (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. Of Regents, 75 F.3d 1103, 1115 (7th Cir. 1996)). Because Graves has not cited any evidence suggesting DJO refused her request for FMLA leave or refused to respond to her questions about FMLA [*55]  leave, the Court finds DJO is entitled to summary adjudication of this cause of action.

N. Business & Profession Code § 17200 (13th Cause of Action)
Graves' thirteenth cause of action is for violation of California Business & Profession Code § 17200. DJO argues this cause of action fails because she "cannot establish she has no adequate remedy at law. (DJO P&A at 26:5-12.)
In Sonner v. Premier Nutrition Corp., 971 F.3d 834, 844 (2020), the Ninth Circuit held that under the traditional principles governing equitable remedies in federal courts, a plaintiff "must establish that she lacks an adequate remedy at law before securing equitable restitution for past harm under the UCL...." See also Guzman v. Polaris Indus., 49 F.4th 1308, 1312 (2022) ("Under those federal equitable principles, we have held that equitable relief must be withheld when an equivalent legal claim would have been available but for a time bar. [Citations omitted.]").
In the opposition, Graves responds that "in her Complaint, Plaintiff request for not only restitution of the wages that DJO has failed to pay her for the time she worked while on maternity leave, but for injunctive relief...." (Graves Opp'n at 20:22-26.) Simply reiterating the relief sought in the Complaint is not the same as demonstrating that such relief is not available under any of the other twelve causes of action. Because Graves failed to establish that she has [*56]  no adequate remedy at law, this Court lacks equitable jurisdiction over her UCL cause of action. See Guzman, 49 F.4th at 1313. Accordingly, the claim must be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at 1314 (holding that where district court lacks equitable jurisdiction to hear the UCL claim, it must dismiss the claim without prejudice).

O. Punitive Damages.
DJO argues Graves cannot recover punitive damages because Graves has not established a corporate officer, director or managing agent was involved in any of the alleged wrongful conduct. (DJO P&A at 29:22-24.) In response, Graves contends that Esmail, as the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs and Regulatory Compliance was "the officer, director, managing agent, or someone who 'exercises substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determinate corporate policy." (Graves Opp'n at 21:13-16.) Graves also appears to contend that Pomeroy was an officer, director or managing agent "after assuming the position of Ms. Graves' supervisor." (Id. at 19-23.)
Punitive damages may be awarded where a jury finds by clear and convincing evidence that an act of oppression, malice or fraud has been committed. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). A corporate employer is liable for punitive damages based on [*57]  the acts of its employees where such "wrongful conduct was committed, authorized, or ratified by a corporate officer, director or managing agent." Id. § 3294(b). Section 3294 defines "malice" as conduct intended to cause injury to a plaintiff or "despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." Id. § 3294(c)(1). "Oppression" is defined as despicable conduct "subject[ing] a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights." Id. § 3294(c)(2).
In asserting that Esmail and Pomeroy were officers, directors or managing agents of DJO, Graves cites White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal.4th 563, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999). (Graves Opp'n 21:16-20.) White evaluated who is a "'managing agent' for determining corporate punitive damage liability under Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b)." Id. at 566. In discussing the history of section 3294, the California Supreme Court cited with approval case law holding that a corporation's "liability for punitive damages should not turn on any official title, but on whether" the "employees acted in a 'managerial capacity.'" Id. at 571. This depends on the "degree of discretion the employees possess in making decisions that will ultimately determine corporate policy." Id. The Court also disapproved of a court of appeal's decision [*58]  holding a corporation liable for punitive damages based on the wrongful conduct of the corporation's district supervisor who "had immediate and direct control over the decision to demote plaintiff, and he was directly responsible for evaluating plaintiff's performance." Id. at 574-575, n. 4. Instead, the Court concluded that,
in amending section 3294, subdivision (b), the Legislature intended that principal liability for punitive damages not depend on employees' managerial level, but on the extent to which they exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy. Thus, supervisors who have broad discretionary powers and exercise substantial discretionary authority in the corporation could be managing agents. Conversely, supervisors who have no discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy would not be considered managing agents even though they may have the ability to hire or fire other employees. In order to demonstrate that an employee is a true managing agent under section 3294, subdivision (b), a plaintiff seeking punitive damages would have to show that the employee exercised substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business.
Id. at [*59]  576-577.
White does not support Graves argument that Esmail and Pomeroy were officers, directors or managing agents under section 3294(b). Her argument relies on Esmail's and Pomeroy's titles, and the fact that they both supervised Graves. But this approach was rejected in White. Instead, Graves was required to offer evidence indicating that Esmail or Pomeroy had broad discretionary powers and exercised substantial discretionary authority in the corporation. She failed to provide any evidence remotely satisfying these factors. At best, Graves established Esmail and Pomeroy supervised her, which is insufficient under White. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary adjudication as to Graves' punitive damage claim.

P. Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith & Fair Dealing
In her opposition, Graves alleges DJO breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (Graves Opp'n at 23:15-25:6.) In its reply, DJO points out that this theory was never alleged in the Complaint, and thus Graves cannot raise it for the first time in her opposition. (DJO Reply at 13:5-24.) The Court agrees. See Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir., 2004) ("At the summary judgment stage, the proper procedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint in [*60]  accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). A plaintiff may not amend her complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment."); see also Netbula, LLC v. BindView Dev. Corp., 516 F. Supp. 2d 1137, 1153 n. 9 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (refusing to consider new fraud theory raised in opposition to summary judgment). Because the Complaint does not allege a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the Court will not consider her argument in the opposition.
