Opinion



ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (D.E. 364)
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendants 245 C & C, LLC and CFH Group, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment, ("Motion," D.E. 364), filed November 16, 2020. Plaintiffs filed a Response on August 3, 2021, ("Response," D.E. 491), to which Defendants filed a Reply on September 3, 2021, ("Reply," D.E. 514). Upon review of the Motion, Response, Reply, and the record, the Court finds as follows.

I. Background
Plaintiff Angie Alonso Morejon ("Angie") is a permanently disabled individual who suffers from, among other things, mental retardation, severe cerebral palsy, and spasticity. (Second Am. Compl. (D.E. 92) ¶ 4.) Plaintiff Carlos A. Alonso Cano ("Alonso") is Angie's father and Plenary Guardian; Plaintiff Fe Morejon Fernandez ("Morejon") is Angie's mother; and Plaintiffs Katy Alonso Morejon [*2]  and Jany Leidy Alonso Morejon are Angie's sisters. (Id. ¶¶ 14-17.)
During the relevant period, Plaintiffs resided in a rental apartment in the Villas of Hialeah apartment complex ("VOH") located in Hialeah, Florida. (Id. ¶ 2.) Defendant 245 C & C, LLC and/or Defendant CFH Group, LLC owns VOH, (id. ¶ 22), while Defendant CFH Group, LLC operates VOH, (id. ¶ 25). Vilma Hernandez ("Vilma") is the Property Manager at VOH.1 (Id. ¶ 27.)

II. Brief procedural history
On May 6, 2019, Alonso, through counsel,2 initiated this federal lawsuit alleging that Defendants violated (1) various provisions of the Fair Housing Act ("FHA"), (2) the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Florida state law, and (3) Section 83.67(1), Florida Statutes, by unlawfully turning off the water to Plaintiffs' home without warning. (D.E. 1.)3 On July 19, 2019, the Court entered an Order Granting in Part Defendants' Corrected Combined Motion to Dismiss Complaint and/or for More Definite Statement. (D.E. 43.) The Court found that the Complaint constituted a "shotgun pleading" that violated federal pleading standards because four of the five Counts alleged multiple claims;4 as such, the Court required Alonso to file an Amended Complaint. (Id. at 9-12.) Although the Court provided [*3]  Alonso leave to file an Amended Complaint, it warned "that it may be the final amendment the Court permits him to make[,]" (id. (citing Brown v. Hillsborough Cnty. S heriff's Off ice, 342 F. App'x 552, 554 (11th Cir. 2009))), and instructed that "Plaintiff should endeavor to remedy all deficiencies, whether discussed in this Order or not[,]" (id. at 15).
On August 9, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint which contained nineteen causes of action. (D.E. 52.) Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, (D.E. 61), which the Court granted in part, dismissing Counts Two, Six, Seven, Eight, Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen with prejudice for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted, (D.E. 90). Although the Court had previously warned Plaintiffs that it may not permit any further amendments, the Court provided Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to add language to one paragraph. (Id. at 64.)
On December 2, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint asserting claims under the Fair Housing Act and Florida state law. (D.E. 92.)
Defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as [*4]  to Counts Thirteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen. (D.E. 368.) The Court entered an Order granting the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Counts Thirteen and Fifteen, and dismissing Count Sixteen with prejudice as an impermissible shotgun pleading. (D.E. 438.) The following claims remain:
• In Count One, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the FHA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, a handicapped parking spot with an access aisle on the driver's side reserved exclusively for Angie, (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 39, 128-43);
• In Count Three, Alonso, Morejon, and Angie allege that Defendants violated the FHA by refusing to permit a reasonable modification to the existing premises—specifically, a modification to Angie's bathroom, (id. ¶¶ 150-56);
• In Count Four, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the FHA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, painting the bathtub in the guest bathroom without using toxic substances, (id. ¶¶ 157-62);
• In Count Five, Alonso, Morejon, and Angie allege that Defendants violated the FHA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, removing the operation of noisy equipment near Plaintiffs' [*5]  apartment, (id. ¶¶ 163-68);
• In Count Nine, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA where, "[a]fter many events that [are] detailed in other portions of the [Second] Amended Complaint," Defendants threatened a $150.00 fine if tape was not removed from Plaintiffs' windows, issued a "SEVEN DAY NOTICE TO CURE," issued a Notice of Termination of Plaintiffs' month-to-month tenancy, and finally issued an eviction notice (id. ¶¶ 187-207);
• In Count Ten, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA where, in retaliation for requesting reasonable accommodations and modifications, the company that controlled VOH's parking areas "used intimidation tactics against Plaintiffs, causing fear, loss of sleep and affecting Angie and his family[,]" (id. ¶¶ 208-16);
• In Count Eleven, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA by instituting eviction proceedings in retaliation for filing a complaint with HUD, (id. ¶¶ 217-27);
• In Count Twelve, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, [*6]  and retaliation in violation of the FHA by appealing the state court's judgment of retaliatory eviction, (id. ¶¶ 228-38);
• In Count Fourteen, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and various provisions of Chapter 83, Florida Statutes, (id. ¶¶ 249-57).
(See Second Am. Compl., D.E. 92.)
On December 16, 2019, Defendants filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses. (D.E. 101.) Defendants' Sixth Affirmative Defense asserts that "Plaintiffs have waived their rights to legal and equitable relief as a consequence of signing the Month-to-Month Lease which contained a Good Conduct Addendum." (Id. ¶ 279.) Defendants' Ninth Affirmative Defense asserts that any claim under the FHA which arose more than two years before the filing of this lawsuit is barred by the FHA's statute of limitations. (Id. ¶ 282.)
On November 16, 2020, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment, (D.E. 364), and a Statement of Material Undisputed Facts in support thereof, (D.E. 366). They also filed a Request for Judicial Notice.5 (D.E. 372.)
On January 11, 2021—after providing Plaintiffs two extensions of time to respond, (D.E. 390, 411)—Plaintiffs filed a Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, (D.E. 413), to which it attached 245 pages of exhibits, (D.E. 413-1). Plaintiffs did not file a Response to Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts, nor did it file a Response to Defendants' [*8]  Request for Judicial Notice.
On February 5, 2021, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Response in its Entirety and to Deem Defendants' Statement of Material Facts Admitted, or to Strike Particular Statements from the Response. (D.E. 435.)
On March 15, 2021—after providing Plaintiffs two extensions of time to respond to the Motion to Strike, (D.E. 437, 446)—Plaintiffs filed a document titled "Response" which did not respond to Defendants' Motion to Strike but was instead an entirely new response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.E. 447.) However, like its predecessor, it did not contain a Response to Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts. Thereafter, Defendants filed a Reply in support of their Motion to Strike. (D.E. 456.)
On May 18, 2021, the Court entered an Omnibus Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Response in its Entirety and to Deem Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts Admitted, Granting Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, Granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, and Closing Case. ("First Order on Summary Judgment," D.E. 468.) First, the Court granted the Motion to Strike by default because "Plaintiffs [*9]  failed to respond to any of the arguments raised in Defendants' Motion to Strike[.]" (Id. at 9.) Alternatively, the Court granted the Motion to Strike on the merits because Plaintiffs failed to comply with Local Rule 56.1. (Id. at 10-13.) The Court explained that because Plaintiffs failed to respond to Defendants' Statement of Material Facts, by operation of Local Rule 56.1, Defendants' facts were deemed admitted to the extent that they were supported by record evidence. (Id. at 12-13.)
Second, the Court granted the Request for Judicial Notice by default because Plaintiffs failed to respond to the Request. (Id. at 15.) Alternatively, the Court granted the Request for Judicial Notice on the merits, finding "that the materials listed in Defendants' request are subject to judicial notice." (Id. at 15-16 (citations omitted).)
Third, the Court granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Id. at 17-87.) Initially, the Court found that all of the facts recited in the Omnibus Order's "Facts" section were supported by record evidence and therefore deemed admitted by operation of Rule 56.1. (Id. at 17 n.12.) The Court then found that the admitted facts and record evidence established that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment [*10]  as to each remaining Count. (Id. at 39-86.) The Court subsequently entered Final Judgment by separate entry and closed the case. (D.E. 469.)
On June 1, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Reopen pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) and (6). (D.E. 470.) They argued that the Court relied upon false statements by Defendants' witnesses when concluding that Defendants' were entitled to summary judgment, and that there is record evidence supporting their claims. (See id. at 2-20.) On the last page of the Motion to Reopen, under the "Legal Standard" heading, Plaintiffs appeared to argue that the Court erred by granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment without first providing Plaintiffs notice of the rules and requirements governing motions for summary judgment. (Id. at 20.) Defendants filed a Response, (D.E. 474), to which Plaintiffs filed a Reply, (D.E. 477).
On June 25, 2021, the Court entered an Order granting the Motion to Reopen. (D.E. 483.) Briefly, the Court found that the Motion was properly construed as one under Rule 59(e), (id. at 9), and found that the Court committed reversible error by granting Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment without first providing notice to Plaintiffs of (1) the rules governing summary [*11]  judgment, (2) their right to file affidavits or other material in opposition to the motion, and (3) the consequences of default, (id. at 9-15 (citing Griffith v. Wainwright, 772 F.2d 822, 825 (11th Cir. 1985)). Accordingly, the Court Vacated in part the Court's Omnibus Order on Summary Judgment,6 and reinstated the Motion for Summary Judgment. (Id. at 17.) The Court further provided the Parties notice of (1) the rules governing summary judgment, (2) their right to file affidavits or other material in opposition to the motion, and (3) the consequences of default, pursuant to Rule 56(c) and (f), Griffith, Couch v. Clark, 725 F. App'x 808, 811-12 (11th Cir. 2018), "and/or otherwise." (Id. at 18-22.)
On August 2, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Request for Judicial Notice. (D.E. 493.) Defendants filed a Response, (D.E. 517), to which Plaintiffs filed a Reply, (D.E. 534).
Also on August 2, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their Responses to the Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 491) and Statement of Material Facts in Dispute (D.E. 492), which contains a section that includes five "New Facts." (Id. ¶¶ 138-42). The same day, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Conventional Filing of Plaintiffs' USB as Appendixes to Summary Judgment. ("Notice of Conventional Filing," D.E. 495.) Plaintiffs attached to the Notice "Appendix A" which contained [*12]  115 pages of documents supporting their Statement of Material Facts in Dispute. (D.E. 495-1.) However, on August 4, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Striking the Notice of Conventional Filing. (D.E. 501.) By operation of the Notice of Striking, both the Notice of Conventional Filing (D.E. 495) and Appendix A attached thereto (D.E. 495-1) have been stricken from the record. Plaintiffs have not refiled Appendix A with the Court.
On August 4, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Motion (1) requesting leave to file a new USB drive with evidence that was specifically prepared to support Plaintiffs' responses to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Statement of Material Undisputed Facts, and (2) striking the USB drive Plaintiffs had previously filed in support of their opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Statement of Material Undisputed Facts. (D.E. 499.) On August 9, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for leave to file a new USB drive and stated that "[t]his will be the final USB the Court permits Plaintiffs to file in support of their opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and Statement of Material Facts." (D.E. 505.) The Court also granted the [*13]  Motion to strike the previously-filed USB drive. (Id.) The new USB does not contain "Appendix A," nor does it appear anywhere else in the record.
On September 3, 2021, Defendants filed their Reply in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 514), their Reply and Objections to Plaintiffs' Statement of New Undisputed Facts (D.E. 520), and a separate Reply "Memorandum" to Plaintiffs' Statement of New Undisputed Facts (D.E. 521).
Also on September 3, 2021, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike Previously Unasserted Claims and New Facts to Support these Claims in Plaintiffs' Response to Motion for Summary Judgment, its Accompanying Statement of Opposing Material Facts and Supporting Affidavits. (D.E. 516.) Plaintiffs filed a Response on September 30, 2021, (D.E. 535), to which Defendants filed a Reply on November 29, 2021, (D.E. 548).
Also on September 3, 2021, Defendants filed Objections to Plaintiffs' Opposing Materials and Declarations Supporting Response to Summary Judgment and Motion to Strike Declarations as Shams. (D.E. 518.) Plaintiffs filed a Response on September 30, 2021, (D.E. 536), to which Defendants filed a Reply on November 29, 2021, (D.E. 549).
Also on September 3, [*14]  2021, Defendants filed Objections to and Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Disputes of Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts, (D.E. 519). Plaintiffs filed a Response on September 30, 2021, (D.E. 537), to which Defendants filed a Reply on November 29, 2021, (D.E. 550).
On August 17, 2022, the Court entered an Omnibus Order: (1) denying Plaintiffs' Request for Judicial Notice, (D.E. 493); (2) granting in part and denying in part Defendants' Motion to Strike Previously Unasserted Claims and New Facts to Support these Claims in Plaintiffs' Response to Motion for Summary Judgment, its Accompanying Statement of Opposing Material Facts and Supporting Affidavits, (D.E. 516);7 denied Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Declarations as Shams and deferred consideration of Defendants' Objections to Plaintiffs' Opposing Materials and Declarations Supporting Response to Summary Judgment (D.E. 518); and denied Defendants' Objections to and Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Dispute of Defendants Statement of Material Facts, (D.E. 519).8 (D.E. 553.) The Court hereby adopts the Omnibus Order as if fully set forth herein.

III. Legal standards
On a motion for summary judgment, the Court is to construe [*15]  the evidence and factual inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). Summary judgment can be entered on a claim only if it is shown "that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Supreme Court has explained the summary judgment standard as follows:
[T]he plain language of [Rule 56] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. In such a situation, there can be no genuine issue as to any material fact, since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (internal quotation omitted). The trial court's function at this juncture is not "to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "An issue of fact is material if it 'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'" [*16]  W. Grp. Nurseries, Inc. v. Ergas, 167 F.3d 1354, 1360 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248). "An issue of fact is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).
The party moving for summary judgment "always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the 'pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. Once the movant makes this initial demonstration, the burden of production, not persuasion, shifts to the nonmoving party. The nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings and by [its] own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,' designate 'specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 324; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In meeting this burden the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is a metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). That party must demonstrate that there is a "genuine issue for trial." Id. at 587. An action is void of a material issue for trial "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not [*17]  lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party." Id.
A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:
(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or
(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). "An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4).

IV. Statements of Facts
Pursuant to the Local Rules, a party moving for summary judgment must separately file a Statement of Material Facts listing the facts that the movant contends are not [*18]  genuinely disputed. S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(1). The party opposing the motion for summary judgment must also file a Statement of Material Facts which "clearly challenge any purportedly material fact asserted by the movant that the opponent contends is genuinely in dispute." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(2). Both the movant and the opponent's Statements of Material Facts must "consist of separately numbered paragraphs, limited as far as practicable to a single material fact, with each fact supported by specific, pinpoint references to particular parts of record material, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, and interrogatory answers[.]" S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(1)(B). "If an opponent's Statement of Material Facts disputes a fact in the movant's Statement of Material Facts, then the evidentiary citations supporting the opponent's position must be limited to evidence specific to that particular dispute." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(2)(C).
Any additional facts that an opponent contends are material to the motion for summary judgment shall be numbered and placed immediately after the opponent's response to the movant's Statement of Material Facts. The additional facts shall use separately [*19]  numbered paragraphs beginning with the next number following the movant's last numbered paragraph. The additional facts shall be separately titled as "Additional Facts" . . . .
S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(2)(D). "All material facts in any party's Statement of Material Facts may be deemed admitted unless controverted by the other party's Statement of Material Facts, provided that: (i) the Court finds that the material fact at issue is supported by properly cited record evidence; and (ii) any exception under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 does not apply." S.D. Fla. R. 56.1(c); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2) ("If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may . . . consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.").
In its First Order on Summary Judgment, the Court clearly explained the applicability and importance of these rules, and the consequences of failing to follow them. (See D.E. 468 at 7-13.) Furthermore, in its Omnibus Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Reopen, the Court clearly instructed Plaintiffs regarding the substance of these rules, and the consequences of failing to follow them. (See D.E. 483 at 18-22.) Specifically, the Court stated:
a) The Court will take Defendants' [*20]  Motion for Summary Judgment, all materials in support thereof, and all materials in opposition thereto under advisement no sooner than twenty-one (21) days from the date of this Order.
b) Plaintiffs shall have SEVENTEEN DAYS from the date of this Order to file an Amended Response in opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, (D.E. 364). Pursuant to the Court's Order of October 15, 2020, Plaintiffs' Response shall not exceed twenty-five (25) double-spaced pages. (D.E. 342.)
c) Defendants may file a reply brief within SEVEN DAYS of Plaintiffs' Response. Pursuant to the Court's Order of October 15, 2020, Defendants' Reply shall not exceed fifteen (15) double-spaced pages. (D.E. 342.)
d) Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, Plaintiffs Response shall be accompanied by a separate and contemporaneously filed Statement of Material Facts that "clearly" challenges any purportedly material fact asserted by Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts (D.E. 366) that Plaintiffs contend is genuinely disputed. S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a). Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts "also may thereafter assert additional material facts that [Plaintiffs] contend[] serve to defeat the motion for summary judgment." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(2). Plaintiffs' Statement [*21]  of Material Facts shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages double-spaced pages.
e) "All material facts in any party's Statement of Material Facts may be deemed admitted unless controverted by the other party's Statement of Material Facts, provided that: (i) the Court finds that the material fact at issue is supported by properly cited record evidence; and (ii) any exception under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 does not apply." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(c). Accordingly, in order to ensure the fair application of Local Rule 56.1 and to guarantee that no fact is deemed admitted without the opposing party's intention to do so, the Parties are hereby INSTRUCTED to file a Statement of Material Facts in Dispute that satisfies the following requirements:
i. First, Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts in Dispute should correspond, on a paragraph by paragraph basis, with Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. See S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(2)(A). Specifically, Plaintiffs shall state, for each of Defendants' numbered paragraphs, whether the facts alleged therein are disputed or undisputed. The first word next to each number shall be "Disputed" or "Undisputed," thereby notifying the Court whether the fact alleged in each of Defendants' numbered paragraphs is disputed or undisputed.  [*22] See S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(2)(B).
ii. Second, if a fact is identified as "disputed," Plaintiffs shall cite record evidence that demonstrates that the fact is disputed—for example, to specific depositions, interrogatory answers, admissions, affidavits, or other evidence on file with the Court. Citations to record evidence should be to specific page, paragraph, and/or line numbers, and otherwise comply with Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(B). If the evidence is on the docket, Plaintiffs shall cite to the specific docket entry, page, and line or paragraph number, if applicable. If the evidence is on a USB drive previously filed with the Court, Plaintiffs shall indicate precisely where on the USB the relevant evidence is located. If the Court cannot locate the evidence, the Court may deem the purportedly disputed fact admitted.
iii. Third, Plaintiffs shall concisely state—in three sentences or less—why the dispute is material. "A factual dispute is 'material' if it would affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law[.]" Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, 516 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2008).
iv. Fourth, if Plaintiffs wish to raise disputed facts not included in Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, those facts shall be stated in numbered paragraphs at the end of Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts [*23]  in Dispute and shall also be supported by specific citation to the record. The additional facts shall use separately numbered paragraphs beginning with the number 138, which is the number following the last numbered paragraph in Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. (See D.E. 366 at 25.)
v. Defendants shall respond to any additional facts asserted in Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts, even if they do not serve a reply memorandum. S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(3). Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' statement of additional facts, if any, shall comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, Local Rule 56.1, and the requirements set forth above.
vi. As previously stated, "[a]ll material facts in any party's Statement of Material Facts may be deemed admitted unless controverted by the other party's Statement of Material Facts, provided that: (i) the Court finds that the material fact at issue is supported by properly cited record evidence; and (ii) any exception under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 does not apply." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(c).
f) If a summary judgment motion is properly supported, a Party may not rest on the allegations in its pleadings alone. To oppose a properly supported motion for summary judgment, a Party will likely need to rebut it with admissible evidence.
g) The Parties may file [*24]  sworn affidavits or other admissible material in support of their positions.
h) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and Local Rule 56.1 govern motions for summary judgment. The Parties should consult these Rules and abide by them.
i) Plaintiff's failure to respond adequately to this Notice, to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, and/or to Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts may result in final judgment adverse to Plaintiffs being entered without the benefit of trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
(Id.) Notwithstanding the Court's Orders, Plaintiffs filed a Statement of Material Facts in Dispute of Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts that is deficient and, in many instances, fails to comply with Local Rule 56.1 and the Court's Omnibus Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Reopen. (See D.E. 492.)
The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that local rules governing motions for summary judgment and statements of material facts in support of and in opposition thereto, like the Southern District of Florida's Local Rule 56.1, are designed to "protect[] judicial resources by 'mak[ing] the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge.'" Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy, 400 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 2005), and citing Libel v. Adventure Lands of Am., Inc., 482 F.3d 1028, 1032 (8th Cir. 2007) ("Courts have neither the duty nor the time to investigate the record in search [*25]  of an unidentified genuine issue of material fact to support a claim or defense.")). They also "streamline[] the resolution of summary judgment motions by 'focus[ing] the district court's attention on what is, and what is not, genuinely controverted.'" Id. (quoting Mariani-Colon v. Dep't of Hom eland Sec., 511 F.3d 216, 219 (1st Cir. 2007)). Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts in Dispute of Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts has the opposite effect.

a. Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts (D.E. 366)
For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Facts 1-9, 11-18, 20-26, 29-32, 34-36, 38-73, 75-82, 86-96, 98, 102-03, 105-24, 127-34, and parts of Facts 37 and 135 of Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts are undisputed and/or deemed admitted pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 and/or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e)(2).
First, Plaintiffs explicitly assert that they do not dispute Facts 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 21, 29, 63, 86, 108, 109, 110, 120, 121, 122, and 123 of Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts. (D.E. 492 at 1.) Plaintiffs separately assert that Facts 26, 31, 32, 45, 47, 48, 49, 98, and 112 are undisputed. (Id. at 6-7.)
Similarly, Facts 17, and 51 are undisputed and/or deemed admitted to the extent that they are supported by properly cited record [*26]  evidence because they are not controverted by Plaintiffs' opposing Statement of Material Facts.9 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(B) and (c); Reese, 527 F.3d at 1267-69.
Facts 2, 15, 38, 50, 64, 82, 105, 124, 125, and 127 of Defendants' Statement of Material Undisputed Facts are undisputed and/or deemed admitted to the extent that they are supported by properly cited record evidence because Plaintiffs failed to cite any evidence in support of the purported dispute.1011 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(B), (c), and (d); Reese, 527 F.3d at 1267-69 (upholding local rule providing that the movant's facts may be deemed admitted if (1) supported by record evidence and (2) the opponent's response fails to specifically cite evidence supporting a purported factual dispute) (citing Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007) ("Given the vital purpose that such rules serve, litigants ignore them at their peril."); Smith v. Lamz, 321 F.3d 680, 683 (7th Cir. 2003) ("[J]udges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs.")); Tomasini v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. of Fla., Inc., 315 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1260 n.11 (S.D. Fla. 2004) ("[T]he Court is not required to scour the record to determine whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); BFI Waste Sys. of N.A. v. Dekalb Cnty., Ga., 303 F. Supp. 2d 1335, 1358 ("Numerous of BFI's citations to record evidence do not support the propositions for which they are cited. Although the Court has attempted to locate such evidence, it [*27]  is not the Court's duty to comb the record to attempt to find reasons to deny a motion for summary judgment.").
Facts 3, 4, 16, 20, 35, 36, and 119, and the first sentence of Fact 12, are undisputed and/or deemed admitted to the extent that they are supported by properly cited record evidence because Plaintiffs' opposition to those Facts are not supported by citations to record evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(B), (c), and (d); Reese, 527 F.3d at 1267-69; Tomasini, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 1260 n.11; BFI Waste Sys., 303 F. Supp. 2d at 1358. Rather, the only evidence Plaintiffs cite in support of their purported disputes of these Facts is contained in "App. A," (D.E. 495-1), which has been stricken from the record pursuant to Plaintiffs' Notice of Striking, (D.E. 501).12
Facts 8, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 34, 46, 65, 66, 67, 68, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 102, 103, 106, 111, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 137; the second, third, fourth, and fifth sentences of Fact 12; the first sentence of Fact 37; most of Fact 104; and the second and third sentence of Fact 135 are undisputed and/or deemed admitted to the extent that they are supported by record evidence because the explanation Plaintiffs provide for the purported dispute, and/or the evidence cited in support of the purported dispute, do not "controvert," S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(c), or "clearly [*28]  challenge," S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a)(2)—and sometimes do not even address, "properly" or otherwise, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2)—the corresponding Fact.13 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Local Rule 56.1(a), (b)(1)(B), (c), and (d); Reese, 527 F.3d at 1267-69; Tomasini, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 1260 n.11; BFI Waste Sys., 303 F. Supp. 2d at 1358.
Facts 39-44, 52-62, 69-73, 87-96, and 128-34 are deemed admitted to the extent they are supported by record evidence because the purported disputes are not separately stated and "limited as far as practicable to a single material fact . . . ." S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(1)(B); and because the purported disputes are lumped together, the evidentiary citations supporting the purported disputes, if there are any, are not "limited to evidence specific to that [one] particular dispute," S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(b)(2)(C); and, if citations are included, it is unclear which citation is intended to support which supported dispute.14 See Tomasini, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 1260 n.11; BFI Waste Sys., 303 F. Supp. 2d at 1358.
Finally, Plaintiffs include additional facts throughout their Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, rather than at the end in a separate section titled "Additional Facts," as required by Local Rule 56.1(b)(2)(D) and this Court's Omnibus Order Reopening the Case, (D.E. 483 at 20-21). (See Defs.' Resp. Facts ¶¶ 28, 30, 46, 65-66, 76-77, 78, 79-81, 102-03, 106.) The Court exercises its discretion to consider these additional facts to the extent the Court can discern them, they are material, they are supported by properly cited record evidence, and they have not already been stricken. See Silverstein v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharms., Inc., Case No. 19-CIV-81188-Ruiz/Reinhart, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188176, 2020 WL 6110909, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 7, 2020) ("Despite the parties' [*30]  non-compliance with Local Rule 56.1, to the extent the additional facts are material and supported by evidence in the record, I consider them.").

b. Plaintiffs' "New Facts" (D.E. 492 at 24-25)
At the end of Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts in Dispute of Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts, Plaintiffs assert five "New Facts." The New Facts are single-spaced and therefore fail to comply with this Court's Order of June 25, 2019, which requires that "all filings shall be doubled-spaced (with the exception of block quotations) . . . ." (D.E. 21 at 6.) The New Facts also suffer from other deficiencies, as noted below.

1. New Fact 138
In New Fact 138, Plaintiffs assert:
138. - Defendants arguments allegedly supported by the "Month to Month Good Conduct Addendum" (MMGCA), are invalid and mere pretexts, because: (1) most provisions included in the MMGCA, are contrary to the statutes in Chapter 83 of Fla. Stat and the regulations in the (File # 56) at (PSUSB), and (2) those provisions, were drafted based in the false statements, that Vilma, fraudulently and without telling about it to the plaintiffs, added as the (2nd) and (3rd) lines in the handwritten language on the lease addendums of 2013, [*31]  2014 & 2015, because the plaintiffs never violated the rules and did not have bad records as tenants, which materially altered those contracts, therefore making them and the MMGCA void and non-enforceable. See (point # 101) of (CAAFF) and the (File # 33/Vilma Falsified the Lease Addendums) both at (PSUSB). See (Point # 22) at [ECF No. 470]. As it was explained in [ECF No, 470], the plaintiffs were evicted through fraud on the court committed by Vilma and fraud upon the court, committed by Mr. Lowenhaupt. Plaintiffs really were evicted for requesting reasonable accommodations for Angie on (9/12/17) and (9/18/17) and for telling Vilma on (9/18/17) that a new HUD complaint against her would be filed. See the explanation in the (points # 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 & 17) at [ECF No. 470].
(D.E. 492 (emphases in original).) Defendants' response to New Fact 138 states:
Disputed as to any "facts" raised in ¶138 and objected to for the following reasons: ¶138 does not add new facts relating to the remaining counts of the SAC but attempts to add two entirely new legal claims never previously pled in the SAC based on fraud and an FHA retaliation claim and previously undisclosed material fact which [*32]  has been raised for the first time post-MSJ in Plaintiff's Response. These claims are subjects of Defendants' Motion to Strike Previously Unasserted Claims and New Facts. ¶138 is based entirely on legal opinion, legal argument, and legal conclusion ("invalid") ("mere pretexts"), ("contrary to statutes") ("fraudulently") ("materially altered") ("void") ("unenforceable") ("really were evicted ... for telling Vilma on 9/18/17...."); personal opinion ("the plaintiffs were evicted through fraud..."). The issue of fraud on the court is barred by res judicata because it was raised in the Eviction Proceeding between the same parties on the same issue in a post-trial motion made by Plaintiffs under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540(b) and denied by the Miami-Dade County Court on 1/11/21. See [Def. Supp. Appx, Tab G1]. The only claim remaining in the SAC related to the parties' landlord-tenant relationship in Count 14. To the extent that Plaintiffs raises new issues of fact about never violating any rules, Defendants refer to their Summary Judgment motion [DE 364], all materials in their prior Appendix [DE 380], their Reply and all materials in the Supplemental Appendix.
(D.E. 520 (emphasis in original).)
First, the Court finds [*33]  New Fact 138 is made up almost entirely of legal arguments and/or legal conclusions, not "facts," including that: (1) Defendants' arguments regarding the Good Conduct Addendum "are invalid and mere pretexts"; (2) most provisions of the Good Conduct Addendum are "contrary to" Chapter 83, Florida Statutes and the regulations cited in File # 56 of Plaintiffs' USB drive; (3) the Good Conduct Addendum was drafted "fraudulently" and is "void and non-enforceable"; (4) Plaintiffs' were "evicted through fraud on the court"; (5) Plaintiffs were evicted in retaliation for requesting reasonable accommodations; and (6) Plaintiffs were evicted in retaliation for telling Vilma that Alonso was going to file a HUD complaint against her. The Court will disregard these legal conclusions.15 See Zatarain v. Brown, No. CV-11-BE-3508-M, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73100, 2014 WL 2434478, at *1 (N.D. Ala. May 29, 2014) ("Although the Plaintiff also lists conclusions of law as 'facts' . . . the court finds that the legal conclusions are not facts; therefore, the court includes below the undisputed facts but not the legal conclusions."); Daniels v. Howe Law Firm, P.C., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:15-cv-00827-SCJ-RGV, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196699, 2016 WL 11581822, at *2 (N.D. Ga. May 17, 2016) (disregarding "those facts that . . . are stated as issues or legal conclusions"); Farina v. Sushi Takara, Inc., CASE NO. 07-60069-CIV-GOLD/TURNOFF, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142748, [WL] at *1 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 7, 2008) ("[L]egal conclusions are not proof of fact for purposes of summary judgment."). [*34] 
In the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, New Fact 138 could be construed to assert the following purported facts: (1) Vilma added the 2nd and 3rd lines in the handwritten language on the 2013, 2014, and 2015 lease addendums; (2) Plaintiffs never violated the rules and did not have bad records as tenants; (3) Plaintiffs submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation on September 12, 2017; (4) Plaintiffs submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation on September 18, 2017; and (5) Plaintiffs told Vilma on September 18, 2017 that a new HUD complaint would be filed against her.
The Court finds that Fact 138 violates Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(A) because it is not "limited as far as practicable to a single material fact, with each fact supported by specific, pinpoint references to particular parts of record material . . . ." At best, it is limited to five facts, and only one of those facts if supported by specific, pinpoint references to particular parts of record evidence—specifically, the allegation that Vilma added the 2nd and 3rd lines in the handwritten language on the 2013, 2014, and 2015 lease addendums is supported by a citation to Alonso's Affidavit. Although Plaintiffs cite "points" made in Docket [*35]  Entry 470 to support other statements made in Fact 138, those "points" are "arguments" made in their Motion to Reopen, and not evidence. Also, the Court has already stricken the allegation that Plaintiffs told Vilma on September 18, 2017 that a new HUD complaint would be filed against her. (See D.E. 552 at 33, 38.)
The Court will consider Plaintiff's statement that Vilma added the 2nd and 3rd lines in the handwritten language on the 2013, 2014, and 2015 lease addendums if material to a fact in issue.

2. New Fact 139
In New Fact 139, Plaintiffs assert:
139. - In the Count XIV of the Amended Complaint, [Plaintiffs' former attorney] Mr. Lufty to save space, did not put all the violations that occurred at VOHA, which plaintiffs narrated to him and they considered as violations of their right to the quiet enjoyment of the premises. Instead, Mr. Lufty used the expression ("including but not limited to"). Plaintiffs provided to Mrs. Langbein, the statements about those violations during their depositions and the evidence during discovery. The court could find them all from the (point # 76) to the (point # 90) of (CAAFF) at (PSUSB), and see each folder included in the (Files # 20, 21, 22, 23, [*36]  24, 26, 27, 28, 29 & 30) at (PSUSB).
(D.E. 492 (emphases in original).) Defendants' response to New Fact 139 states:
Disputed that the evidence Plaintiffs attempt to incorporate to prove Count IV [sic] constitute "new facts." All the materials in Files 20-30 of PSUSB were previously produced by Plaintiffs. The events displayed in the photos and videos were testified to by ALONSO at his deposition and argued in the MSJ. Plaintiffs argued these points in their Response. ¶139 is a misuse of Rule 56.1(b)(2) to re-argue the same points.
(D.E. 520.)
The Court finds that New Fact 139 is not a material fact; rather, Plaintiffs are attempting to assert that the statements made in Paragraphs 76 to 90 of Alonso's Affidavit are additional material facts—specifically, ways in which Defendants breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment. By merely citing to Alonso's Affidavit, the "facts" have not been properly raised. If Plaintiffs desired to argue that Defendants breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment in ways not specified in the Second Amended Complaint, they should have listed those ways in the "Additional Facts" section so that Defendants had an opportunity to dispute each of them. See Laremore v. Holiday CVS, LLC, CASE NO. 20-CIV-61650-RAR, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134672, 2021 WL 3053348, at *3 (S.D. Fla. July 20, 2021) [*37]  ("By failing to comply with Local Rule 56.1, [Plaintiffs] prevented [Defendants] from responding to each specific factual assertion relevant to the Motion."). Even assuming arguendo that Paragraphs 76 to 90 of Alonso's Affidavit contain material facts, New Fact 139 is not "limited as far as practicable to a single material fact . . . ." Local Rule 56.1(b)(1)(B). Rather, it purports to incorporate many material facts. Additionally, Paragraphs 76 to 90 are single-spaced in violation of the Court's Order of June 25, 2019, (D.E. 21 at 6), and span six pages. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have attempted to incorporate Paragraphs 76 to 90 of Alonso's Affidavit into their New Facts to get around the five-page limitation on statements of additional facts imposed by Local Rule 56.1(b)(2)(D). For these reasons, the Court will disregard New Fact 139.

3. New Fact 140
In New Fact 140, Plaintiffs assert:
140. - On (9/20/20), Plaintiffs asked to defendants for other reasonable accommodation request for Angie, asking them to allow Angie to state in the (Apt. 1301) at VOHA, because it was the most suitable and safe apartment for him until that time and to protect Angie from an infection with COVID-19, but defendants denied the request [*38]  outright, with total disregard for Angie's rights and based in their false arguments to evict plaintiffs. See (docs. # 75, 76 & 77) of (App. "A") and the (File # 64/Angie's Aggressive Behavior . . .) at (PSUSB).
(D.E. 492.) The Court has already stricken this allegation as being "wholly outside the scope of the Second Amended Complaint." (D.E. 552 at 25.) The Court adopts that finding. The allegation is also not supported by the record evidence to which Plaintiffs cite. For these reasons, the Court will disregard New Fact 140.

4. New Fact 141
In New Fact 141, Plaintiffs assert:
141. - Fe and Jany, recorded the videos included in (File #2/Angie Can Heard While Sleeping). See the explanation about such videos in (point # 20/page #11) at [ECF No. 447].
(D.E. 492.) Defendants' response to New Fact 141 states:
Disputed and objected to because this video was never produced in discovery prior to the discovery cut-off and it purposefully was not disclosed for the purpose of impeachment at trial. See Plaintiffs Response to Motion to Strike at [DE 447] which was itself stricken.
Objections: unscientific audiological testing and medical opinion offered by Plaintiffs who have no training in audial sensitivity; [*39]  irrelevant to the issue of whether ANGIE's "mental condition" makes him more sensitive to loud noise and in any event its relevance is substantially outweighed by its staging, waste of time, prejudice, and confusion of issues under Rule 403[.]
(D.E. 520.)
The Court finds that whether Fe and Jany recorded the videos included in File #2 of Plaintiffs' USB drive is not a material fact; rather, Plaintiffs are attempting to offer additional evidence regarding Angie's alleged sensitivity to hearing that they believe should be considered.
However, "[o]n motions for summary judgment, [a court] may consider only that evidence which can be reduced to an admissible form." Rowell v. BellSouth Corp., 433 F.3d 794, 800 (11th Cir. 2005). See also Snover v. City of Starke, Fla., 398 F. App'x 445, 449 (11th Cir. 2010) (same); Peter Letterese & Assocs., Inc. v. World Inst. of Scientology Enters., 533 F.3d 1287, 1299 (11th Cir. 2008) ("The grant of summary judgment is appropriate where, upon viewing the admissible evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there remains no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."); United States v. Jones, 29 F.3d 1549, 1554 (11th Cir. 1994) ("Summary judgment may be based on any evidence which would be admissible at trial."). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(ii), requires a party to produce "a copy--or a description by category and location--of all documents, electronically stored information, [*40]  and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment[.]" "If a party fails to provide information . . . as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). ""The burden of establishing that a failure to disclose was substantially justified or harmless rests on the nondisclosing party." Mitchell v. Ford Motor Co., 318 F. App'x 821, 824 (11th Cir. 2009).
Here, because the videos of Angie opening his eyes would be used to prove Plaintiffs' claims, they must be considered substantive and not solely for impeachment. See Kapp v. Schiavi, CIVIL NO. 1:08-cv-2-HSO-JMR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161413, 2010 WL 11530416, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 11, 2010) (citing Chiasson v. Zapata Gulf Marine Corp., 988 F.2d 513 (5th Cir. 1993)). As such, Plaintiffs were required to disclose the videos during discovery pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). See id. Their failure to do so precludes them from using the videos in opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment unless their failure to disclose was "substantially justified or is harmless." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of establishing that their failure to disclose these videos was substantially [*41]  justified or is harmless. Consequently, the Court will not consider these videos at the summary judgment stage.

5. New Fact 142
In New Facts 142, Plaintiffs assert:
142. - On (09/18/17), Carlos informed Vilma that he had already filed a complaint with HUD, but he would file another one after leaving her office. See (point # 53) of (CAAFF) in (PSUSB).
(D.E. 492.) The Court has already stricken this allegation as an improper attempt to amend the Second Amended Complaint in Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (D.E. 552 at 38 (citing Pycsa Panama, S.A. v. Tensar Earth Techs., Inc., 625 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1238 (S.D. Fla. 2008) ("'A complaint cannot be amended merely by raising new facts and theories in plaintiffs' opposition papers, and hence such new allegations and claims should not be considered in resolving the motion' for summary judgment."); Schambau Props., LP v. Waffle House, Inc., CIVIL ACTION 11-0029-WS-B, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149607 , at *20 (S.D. Ala. Dec. 30, 2011) ("Plaintiff's de facto attempt to amend its pleadings via summary judgment response to assert a brand new, unpleaded set of facts and circumstances giving rise to ASI's liability is impermissible.").) As such, the Court will disregard this allegation.

V. Facts16
During the relevant period, Defendant 245 C&C LLC owned the Villas of Hialeah Rental Apartments ("VOH") located in Hialeah, FL. [*42]  (Defs.' Facts ¶ 1.) Vilma Hernandez ("Vilma") has been the Property Manager at VOH since 2008. (Id. ¶ 3.)
In October 2011, Plaintiffs Carlos Alonso Cano and Fe Morejon Fernandez entered into their initial one-year lease with VOH.17 (Id. ¶ 4.) Thereafter, the family—consisting of Alonso, Morejon, their adult son Angie, and their daughters Jany and Katy—resided in Apartment 1301, a two-bedroom, two-bath unit on the third floor of the "2500 Building" at VOH. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.)
The family's one-year lease was renewed from year to year until August 3, 2016. (Id. ¶ 12.) They were given an option to vacate Apartment 1301 or agree to a month-to-month lease with additional terms called a "Good Conduct Addendum." (Id.) The Good Conduct Addendum had two purposes: first, to establish a quid pro quo waiver of certain rights in exchange for the privilege to remain tenants at VOH; second, to place them on notice that any violation of the month-to-month lease or Good Conduct Addendum could result in immediate termination of their lease. (Id.) Alonso and Morejon took a month to make the decision. (Id.) On October 28, 2016, they decided to remain VOH residents and signed the month-to-month lease and the Good [*43]  Conduct Addendum. (Id.)

a. Handicapped parking space (Count One)
Angie is the only family member who is handicapped; he cannot drive, but Alonso obtained a Florida handicapped parking permit for him under Section 320.0848, Florida Statutes. (Id. ¶ 7.) Angie never walked anywhere; he was always transported in his wheelchair to and from Apartment 1301 and the handicapped parking area. (Id. ¶ 32.)
Alonso owned a 2010 Chevy Venture minivan during the time Plaintiffs lived at VOH. (Id. ¶ 18.) The minivan was six feet wide; Angie's wheelchair was thirty-two inches wide. (Id.) The minivan's rear door slid back rather than swung open. (Id.) The minivan was not equipped with a wheelchair ramp or lift. (Id.)
VOH was constructed in 1989 with thirteen officially designated handicapped parking spaces. (Id. ¶ 13.) Each of the thirteen handicapped parking spaces measured eleven feet wide and abutted a six-foot wide striped access aisle. (Id. ¶ 17.) The five handicapped parking spaces in front of the 2500 Building were the closest spaces to its entrance. (Id. ¶ 14.) A sixth handicapped space was located at the rear of the 2500 Building and was accessible through a rear entrance. (Id.) All parking at VOH was on a first come, first served [*44]  basis. (Id. ¶ 15.) Alonso never drove around the property to find other handicapped parking spaces. (Id.)
In early February 2013, Alonso requested an assigned handicapped parking space, but Vilma denied this request based on the "first come, first served" policy. (Id. ¶ 28.) Plaintiffs dispute this fact—not as to accuracy but as to completeness. Specifically, they assert that they requested an assigned handicap space "several times," including on March 29, 2017 and April 7, 2017.18,19 (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 28.)
There was no need to drive Angie to a daycare, a program, a school or anywhere else on a daily basis; he spent most of the day watching television or sleeping due to medications he took. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 20.) Plaintiffs transported Angie in the minivan for medical appointments and family outings. (Id. ¶ 21.) Plaintiffs never were late for or had to cancel a medical appointment for Angie because of their inability to load him into the minivan. (Id. ¶ 22.)

b. Parking issues (Count Ten)
VOH contracts OnCall Patrol LLC, d/b/a OnCall Parking (hereafter, "OnCall Parking") to provide parking management services that include registering tenants' and guests' vehicles, collecting parking permit [*45]  fees, issuing parking permits, notifying tenants and guests of expired parking permits and other types of parking violations, and monitoring parking on the property. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 86.) At VOH, OnCall Parking's onsite team began their shift at 10:00 PM and ended it the following morning at 6:00 AM. (Id.) The onsite team's function was to patrol the property. (Id.)
The only tenant information to which OnCall Parking had access was tenants' names, email addresses, cell phone numbers and the make, model, and license tag of their vehicles. (Id. ¶ 88.) This information was acquired from tenants at the time they registered their vehicles online with OnCall Parking Management software system. (Id.)
OnCall Parking's onsite team affixed warning stickers to unauthorized vehicles on the property and the vehicles of tenants or guests who committed violations of the property's parking regulations. (Id. ¶ 89.) Team members entered the violations into the OnCall Parking Management software system's central database. (Id.) The OnCall Parking Management software system then automatically sent electronic (email or text message) notifications to the affected tenant's email/cellphone in real time. (Id. [*46] ) The OnCall Parking electronic messaging system is programmed to automatically send text messages to residents whose parking permits have expired. (Id. ¶ 95.) The system is programmed to send daily reminders until a tenant takes action to renew the permit. (Id.)
VOH also used the OnCall electronic messaging system to notify all registered tenants about important information, such as the dates the management office would be open to accept payment of rent. (Id. ¶ 90.)
Tenants were able to access OnCall Parking's system and email customer service to resolve issues through OnCall Parking's internet site or its smart phone application. (Id. ¶ 91.)
Alonso registered his minivan with OnCall Parking. (Id. ¶ 92.) When he did so, he gave express consent to receive text messages from OnCall Parking about his vehicle. (Id.) Any text messages he received from OnCall were the result of reminders, an expired parking permit, or parking violations entered by the onsite patrol team or VOH using the OnCall Parking Management software system to send a notification to all tenants about a particular property management related matter. (Id.)
The Management Office at VOH is not open the same hours that the OnCall [*47]  onsite team works. (Id. ¶ 87.) The onsite team, therefore, does not interact with Vilma or her staff. (Id.) No one with OnCall Parking, including its administration or onsite team staff had access to tenant files. (Id.; Guadalupe Decl. ¶ 5 (App'x at 80).) Millie Guadalupe, Director of Client Services with OnCall Parking, never spoke to Vilma or any of her staff about issues concerning Alonso's tenancy nor discussed his tenancy with any member of OnCall's onsite team at VOH. (Id. ¶ 96.) She has never been directed to send electronic messages to Alonso for the purpose of harassing or intimidating him. (Id.)

c. Modification of bathroom (Count Three)
Angie's bedroom had its own bathroom. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 9.) Upon moving into VOH, Angie was always bathed by sitting on a shower chair and being washed, rather than showered. (Id. ¶ 37.)
Angie participated in the CDC+ Medicaid Waiver program which is administered by the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities ("APD"). (Defs.' Facts ¶ 39.) The CDC+ program allows Medicaid Waiver participants the greatest flexibility to self-determine how they will use Waiver funds to satisfy their needs. (Id.) A CDC+ consultant assists program participants [*48]  in planning and preparing their budget and support plans. (Id.) Angie's CDC+ consultant was Amanda Ortiz ("Ortiz") of Superior Life Management Care, Inc. (Id.) Alonso served as Angie's representative under the Medicaid Waiver programs. (Id.)
APD publishes the CDC+ Handbook to explain the permissible uses of CDC+ funds and the criteria it uses to approve funding request. (Id. ¶ 41.) Another handbook, published by the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, titled Developmental Disabilities Individual Budgeting Waiver Services and Limitations Handbook, explains the procedures recipients must use to prepare an "iBudget" and draw down from funds to make purchases. (Id.) Both handbooks specify that Medicaid is a payor of last resort for services and that Medicaid Waiver fund recipients first must exhaust available community resources, natural supports, and saved funds. (Id.)
The first step in APD's administrative process to obtain approval for the use of CDC+ funds to pay for a reasonable modification is to obtain approval to conduct an Environmental Accessibility Adaption Assessment ("EAAA"). (Id. ¶ 44.) A request to use funds for this purpose also must be budgeted and approved by [*49]  APD. (Id.)
In August 2018, Alonso conferred with Ortiz about setting funds aside from Angie's monthly Medicaid funds to pay for a bathroom modification. (Id. ¶ 45.) They prepared and submitted an "iBudget" request dated August 4, 2018 seeking approval to spend $789.58 for an EAAA. (Id.)
On August 26, 2018, Alonso emailed Vilma requesting permission to modify Angie's bathroom to remove the bathtub.20 (Id. ¶ 47.) Vilma forwarded the email to VOH's attorney, Ken Lowenhaupt, Esq., who responded to Alonso the following day, August 27, 2018, granting Alonso's request. (Id.; Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 19 (App'x at 42).)
Alonso's EAAA request was partially approved by APD on November 20, 2018. (Id. ¶ 49.) However, he never spent the $789.58 for an EAAA, and never took any other steps to complete the APD's administrative process for approval to use Angie's CDC+ funds to modify the bathroom. (Id. ¶ 50.)

d. Painting bathtub without toxic substances (Count Four)
On August 5, 2018, Alonso emailed Vilma requesting that VOH refinish the surface of the bathtub in the apartment's guest bathroom. (Id. ¶ 52.) VOH's attorney, Mr. Lowenhaupt, responded by letter dated August 7, 2018 advising that Plaintiffs [*50]  needed to sign and return the consent/release form required by the tub refinishing service, Tobby Tubs Refinishing Corp., and that the work could not be completed without it. (Id. ¶ 53; Aug. 7, 2018 Letter from Lowenhaupt to Alonso (App'x at 503); Vilma Decl. ¶ 22 (App'x at 8); Archila Decl. ¶ 8 (App'x at 61).)
The same day, August 7, 2018, Alonso emailed Mr. Lowenhaupt stating that Tobby Tubs uses a toxic ingredient in the painting process, and requested—as a "reasonable accommodation"—that Tobby Tubs not use the toxic ingredient when painting inside the apartment. (Aug. 7, 2018 email from Alonso to Lowenhaupt (App'x at 502).) Alonso stated that he was making the request "in order to protect our son's health, because now he is suffering of severe cerebral palsy and spasticity, and is very difficult to move him out from the apartment, and keep him out for many hours." (Id. (caps omitted).)
On August 25, 2018, Alonso emailed Vilma and Defendants demanding a response to his prior request that VOH refinish his guest bathtub without toxic substances. (Aug. 25, 2018 email from Alonso to Vilma (App'x at 505).) He asserted that the toxic substances "could affect [his] disabled son's health, [*51]  who is allergic." (Id.)
It is impossible to refinish the surface of a bathtub without using toxic substances. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 55; Archila Decl. ¶¶ 4-7, 9.)
On August 27, 2018, Vilma visited Plaintiffs' apartment to deliver Plaintiffs a copy of Tobby Tubs' consent/release form. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 58.) While she was there, she inspected the bathtub. (Id.) She discovered that the bathtub did not need to be refinished, but just needed a good cleaning. (Id.) Plaintiffs cleaned the tub and continued to use it. (Id.) Alonso never returned Tobby Tubs' consent/release form to Vilma and she never heard anything further from them about refinishing the guest bathtub. (Id. ¶¶ 59-60; see also Vilma Decl. ¶ 24 (App'x at 8).)

e. Operation of noisy equipment near Plaintiffs' apartment (Count Five)
The Villas of Hialeah apartment complex is comprised of two separate four story, garden-style apartment buildings, each with an open interior courtyard. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 62.) There were tall trees and palms planted in the interior courtyard of the 2500 Building. (Id.) Additionally, the parking areas and open spaces surrounding each apartment building were shaded by large, mature hardwood trees and palms. (Id.)
Defendant [*52]  contracted with a tree service to provide annual, and sometimes semi-annual, trimming of all the trees and palms throughout the property. (Id. ¶ 63.) One tree service is scheduled ahead of hurricane season, and others occur as needed. (Id.) It takes multiple days to complete the tree trimming. (Id.)
The tree trimming company used a large truck with a hydraulic bucket lift, gas-powered chain saws, and a gas-powered industrial size mulcher/chipper to perform the tree trimming service. (Id. ¶ 64.) Its crew stationed and moved the truck and woodchipper together for efficiency of task and time. (Id.) The gas-powered chainsaws allowed the crew to efficiently cut through thick branches and fronds. (Id.) The mulcher/chipper was used to shred the debris so the property could be quickly cleared of tree trimmings. (Id.) The machinery and equipment are and were essential to the tree company's operations. (Id.)
On September 12, 2018, at 3:33 PM, Alonso emailed Vilma to inform her that the tree company had parked its machinery in front of Apartment 1301, and claimed that the loud noise awakened Angie and disturbed the family. (Id. ¶ 65.) In the email, Alonso requested that Vilma ask the crew to move [*53]  its trucks and equipment farther away from Apartment 1301 so that Angie would not suffer "discomfort." (Id.) The email contained no information connected to a disability.21 (Id.)
It was too late in the day and the project to consider what administrative and logistical issues would arise from Alonso's request. (Id.) Defendants' compliance with Alonso's request would have created great inefficiency in the tree service's operations, logistical problems for tenants and visitors, and further increase the time needed to complete each tree trimming project. (Id. ¶ 66; Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.) For example, parking the mulcher/chipper at a radius of at least 300 feet away from the 2500 Building would require the tree service's on-site crew to make numerous trips throughout a work day to lug branches and fronds from the areas being trimmed to wherever the truck and mulcher/chipper could be parked. (Id.) The time each crew member spent making repeated trips to the mulcher/chipper to lug cut branches and fronds effectively reduces the amount of time they have to perform the tasks that must be completed that day. (Id.) The inefficiency is compounded because then another crew member must stop performing [*54]  assigned duties to act as a traffic controller, stopping vehicles from crossing the roadway and parking area each time the other crew members are dragging the branches and fronds away from the 2500 Building. (Id.) This would not only disrupt the tree service's planned workflow, but also result in a constant logjam of traffic flowing in, out, and throughout the property. (Id.) Additionally, lugging branches and fronds across internal roadways and parking areas to reach the mulcher/chipper parked a substantial distance away from a work area also increases the risk of property damage to vehicles that likely would occur while dragging the branches and fronds through the roadway or parking areas. (Id.) It also increases the likelihood of worker's compensation claims as crew members strain to drag the heavy branches and fronds over and over for longer distances. (Id.) Finally, placing the machinery a substantial distance away from the 2500 Building would impact tree trimming services at the 2510 Building next to it. (Id.) The inefficiencies to operations and additional assumed risk would have caused the All Smooth Lawn Maintenance and Landscaping, Inc. to raise its charges to CFH by an additional [*55]  $3,000 or more for the additional days of work it would require to complete each tree trimming. (Id.)
Plaintiffs have not identified a non-handicapped comparator who was not similarly affected by the noise of the tree-cutting machinery equipment. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 67.)
On January 23, 2019, VOH gave one week's advance notice to all tenants of the 2500 Building that it was going to be pressure-cleaning the corridors. (Id. ¶ 68.)
One week later, on January 30, 2019, VOH began a maintenance job to pressure clean the corridors of the 2500 Building. (Id. ¶ 69.) The crew began on the fourth floor and planned to work their way down to the first floor. (Id.) Alonso made no complaint about noise on January 30, 2019. (Id.)
The next day, January 31, 2019, the crew pressure cleaned the third floor (where Apartment 1301 is located). (Id. ¶ 70.) Alonso did not notify Vilma about any issues with noise on January 31, 2019. (Id.)
The next day, February 1, 2019, at 1:10 PM, while the maintenance crew was pressure cleaning the second floor, Alonso emailed Vilma complaining that the noise from the pressure cleaning on January 30, January 31, and February 1 kept Angie from napping in the afternoon. (Id. ¶ 71; [*56]  Alonso's Feb. 1, 2019 email to Vilma (App'x at 554).) The email requested "a reasonable accommodation" that VOH relocate the pressure cleaning machine farther from Apartment 1301. (Id.) Plaintiffs never informed Vilma or anyone else about a handicapping condition that required this action. (Id.)
Defendants assert that Vilma had no way to station the pressure cleaning equipment farther away, (id. ¶ 74); Plaintiffs dispute this assertion and cite to a photograph and video of the pressure washing machine, (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 74).
On April 18, 2019, the tree trimming company returned to VOH to prepare the property for hurricane season. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 76.) At 10:59 AM, Alonso emailed Vilma stating that although Angie was not sleeping he feared the noise would keep Angie awake. (Id.) Alonso requested that the machines be relocated farther from Plaintiffs' apartment as a "reasonable accommodation" so that Angie could sleep. (Id.; Alonso Apr. 18, 2019 email to Vilma (App'x at 555).) Plaintiffs produced no information regarding what condition Angie suffered from that made the effect of the noise any different on him than other similar non-handicapped tenants.22 (Id.)
On July 2, 2020, during [*57]  the course of this lawsuit, Alonso and Morejon took Angie to audiologist Dr. Molly Smeal at University of Miami Health Systems. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 79.) Alonso told Dr. Smeal that Angie was bothered by loud sounds. (Id.) Dr. Smeal performed a series of audiological tests on Angie but could not replicate Angie's purported reactions to loud sounds, as alleged by Alonso. (Id.) Indeed, Angie showed no physical reaction at all to noises up to 100 decibels in loudness except that he smiled when Alonso's voice was projected into a sound booth at 60 decibels. (Id.)
Ultimately, Dr. Smeal was unable to reach any conclusion about Angie's hearing sensitivity or establish a correlation between Angie's vocalization and sounds he heard or did not hear. (Id. ¶ 80.) To the contrary, Dr. Smeal diagnosed Angie with "unspecified hearing loss." (Id.; Smeal Report (App'x at 251).) She recommended that Alonso follow up with Dr. Michael Hoffer if he wanted a medical letter.23 (Id.; Smeal Report (App'x at 254).)
Defendants assert that Paul Gallner, CFH Group LLC's Safety and Compliance Manager, tested the noise level of the tree trimming equipment used at VOH and found that at a distance of 25 feet from the [*58]  noise sources, the wood chipper and the gas-powered chainsaws together produced sound at a level of 85.3 decibels. (Defs. Facts ¶ 83.) He also measured the distance from the base of the balcony of Apartment 1301 to the ground and found that the distance was 18 feet. (Id.) Alonso measured the distance from Angie's bed to the balcony and found that it was 13 feet. (Id.) Consequently, Angie was approximately 31 feet from the noise source of the tree equipment when it was parked directly below Apartment 1301. (Id.) Given that OSHA standards predict sound for a source decreased by 6 decibels for every meter from the sound source, the tree trimming equipment would have been approximately at a level of 73.3 decibels without factoring the insulating factor of the sliding glass door. (Id.) Mr. Gallner tested the sound level of the gas-powered generator Plaintiffs placed on Angie's patio on September 12 and 13, 2017 and determined that it emitted sound at a level of 76.6 decibels at a distance of ten feet. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 84.)
Plaintiffs dispute these facts on the grounds that Mr. Gallner's measurements are not admissible evidence because (1) Mr. Gallner is not an expert witness or otherwise [*59]  certified to take such measurements, (2) the measurements are not reliable, and (3) the measurements were not certified by an authorized institution. (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶¶ 83-84.)

f. Lease termination (Count Nine)
On June 11, 2017, Alonso and Morejon filed a housing discrimination complaint with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") under penalty of peury.24 (Id. ¶ 29.) It was never processed by HUD nor served on Defendants. (Id.)
Hurricane Irma was scheduled to strike South Florida on September 10, 2017. (Id. ¶ 97; National Weather Service, Hurricane Irma Local Report/Summary, available at https://www.weather.gov/mfl/hurricaneirma (last visited Apr. 16, 2021).) Defendants assert that Vilma sent all VOH tenants notice to prepare for the hurricane and reminded them that they could not tape their glass windows or doors. (Defs.'s Facts ¶ 97; Pre-Hurricane Irma Notice, App'x at 478.) The notice further informed tenants that they could not have gas generators inside their units. (See id.; App'x at 478.) Plaintiffs dispute these assertions, arguing that Defendants did not inform tenants before Hurricane Irma that they could not put tape on their glass doors [*60]  and windows or that they could not use gas generators. (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 97.)
On September 12, 2017, Alonso requested to be provided with a portable gas generator and portable air conditioner as a reasonable accommodation for Angie. (Id. ¶ 99; Alonso's Sept. 12, 2017 Reasonable Accommodation Request (App'x at 550).) Defendants assert that Vilma denied the request because it was illegal. (Id.; Vilma Decl. ¶ 39.) Plaintiffs dispute this assertion and state that Vilma refused to give them a generator because she did not have one, not because it was dangerous or prohibited.25 (Pls.' Resp. Fact. ¶ 98.)
In any event, Alonso purchased a gas generator. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 100.) According to Defendants, Plaintiffs operated the generator on their balcony while other residents, including Plaintiffs' upstairs neighbor in Apartment 1401, had their windows open. (Id.; Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 19, 21.) It operated from about 9:00 PM on September 12, 2017 to about 5:00 AM on September 13, 2017, in violation of the Florida Fire Prevention Code. (Id.) Plaintiffs dispute these assertions. (See Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 100.) They state that the generator [*61]  ran from about 10:30 PM on September 12, 2017 to about 2:30 AM on September 13, 2017, and that their upstairs neighbors were not home during that time.26 (Id.)
Defendants assert that on September 13, 2017, they warned Alonso and other tenants that if they continued to use gas generators the police would be called. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 101.) Plaintiffs dispute this assertion. They appear to concede that Vilma sent an email regarding the use of generators on September 13, 2017, but argue that the email did not apply to Plaintiffs because "plaintiffs' generator was not running" at the time, and "Defendants never told plaintiffs that the police would be called on them, because they never saw our generator running." (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 101.)
Defendants assert that on September 14, 2017, Vilma sent a follow-up notice instructing all tenants who had not removed tape from their windows to do so, (Defs.' Facts ¶ 102; Sept. 14, 2017 Notice (App'x at 482)); Alonso received [*62]  a copy of the notice, (id.). On September 15, 2017, Vilma sent a notice to all remaining residents with tape on their windows stating that if they did not remove it they would be subject to a $150 fine. (Id. ¶ 103.) According to Plaintiffs, they first "received" a notice to remove tape on the morning of September 16, 2017. (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 102.)
On September 18, 2017, Alonso requested, as a "reasonable accommodation," that he be able to leave the tape on his glass doors and windows through the end of hurricane season and not be fined. (Id. ¶ 104.) The request was denied. (Id.)
Alonso failed to comply with the notices and on September 25, 2017, Vilma issued a Seven Day Notice to Cure to Alonso and Morejon demanding that they remove the tape within seven days or face a lease termination. (Id. ¶ 106; Vilma Decl. ¶ 45; Sept. 25, 2017 Seven Day Notice to Cure (App'x at 487).)
On September 26, 2017, Mariela Hernandez, Plaintiffs' upstairs neighbor in Apartment 1401, complained to Vilma about being harassed by Alonso and Morejon and also informed that she and her family were forced to vacate their apartment when Alonso and Morejon operated the gas generator on the balcony of their apartment. [*63]  (Defs.' Facts ¶ 107.) Plaintiffs dispute that Ms. Hernandez and her family were forced to vacate their apartment due to the generator.27 (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 107.) They assert that Ms. Hernandez and her family left the apartment before the hurricane and did not return until after Plaintiffs' generator stopped working.28 (Id.; see also id. ¶ 100.)
Vilma conferred with her regional manager, Marlen Garcia, and they made the decision to non-renew Plaintiffs' lease. (Id. ¶ 108.) CFH directed its attorney, Kenneth Lowehaupt, P.A., to prepare a notice terminating Plaintiffs' month-to-month tenancy. (Id.) The letter was posted on their door the same day, September 26, 2017. (Id.) The letter required Plaintiffs to vacate the apartment by October 31, 2017. (App'x at 488.)
On September 27, 2017, Alonso and Morejon filed a second housing discrimination complaint with HUD. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 109.) HUD Equal Opportunity Specialist Adoniram Vargas was assigned to investigate the charge of discrimination. (Id. ¶ 110.) Defendants received the charge on or about October 3, 2017. (Id. ¶ 111.) Defendants' attorney, Mr. Lowenhaupt, immediately reached out to Vargas to introduce himself and request an extension [*64]  of time to respond to the charge. (Id.) During that conversation, Vargas asked Lowenhaupt if Defendants were willing to extend the family's move-out date to January 31, 2018 to permit HUD time to complete its investigation. (Id.) Varags stated that if Defendants agreed to this proposition and Plaintiffs failed to move out on January 31, 2018, then Defendants would be free to initiate the eviction immediately. (Id.) Defendants agreed to HUD's request and Lowenhaupt sent a new termination letter extending the date by which Plaintiffs must move out to January 31, 2018. (Id.)
Vargas interviewed Alonso on two separate occasions. (Id. ¶ 112.) He also interviewed Vilma, Mariela Hernandez, and CDC+ Consultant Amanda Ortiz. (Id.)
On December 26, 2017, at the conclusion of its investigation into Plaintiffs' September 27, 2017 HUD Complaint, HUD issued a report finding that no reasonable cause existed to believe that a discriminatory housing practice had occurred. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 116; see also Dec. 26, 2017 HUD Letter (App'x at 611).)

g. Eviction proceedings (Count Eleven and Twelve)
Plaintiffs refused to move out on January 31, 2018, and 245 C & C, LLC initiated eviction proceedings in Miami-Dade [*65]  County Court on February 1, 2018, per its understanding with HUD. (Id. ¶ 118.) The eviction case was tried in the Miami-Dade County Court on November 15, 16, and 19, 2018. (Id. ¶ 120.) The trial judge retired before issuing a ruling. (Id.) A successor judge was appointed and issued a final judgment on June 20, 2019, finding in favor of Alonso and Morejon. (Id. ¶¶ 120-21.) 245 C & C, LLC appealed the adverse final judgment, and on September 3, 2020, the Appellate Division of the Miami-Dade Circuit Court reversed the final judgment and remanded the case with instructions to enter judgment for 245 C & C, LLC and to calculate an award of attorney's fees for 245 C & C, LLC. (Id. ¶ 122; Appellate Division Opinion (Defs.' App'x at 316).)

h. Implied covenant of quiet enjoyment (Count Fourteen)
There is one main water shutoff for the entire 2500 Building. (Id. ¶ 130.) There are no sub-meters to individual apartments. (Id.) When there is a leaking pipe or any other type of water emergency in the 2500 Building, it is necessary to shut off the water to the entire building to make the repair and prevent damage to the tenant's and Defendants' properties. (Id.) Water emergencies interrupt all 103 apartments [*66]  in the 2500 Building. (Id. ¶ 131.) There is not enough time to notify all 103 tenants that the water must be shut off due to an emergency. (Id.) The repairs are made as quickly as possible so that the water can be turned back on. (Id.) At no time was the water shut off specifically and only to Apartment 1301. (Id. ¶ 132.)
When a repair or maintenance is capable of being planned in advance, VOH gives tenants as much advanced notice as possible. (Id. ¶ 133.)
There is no provision in the lease that obligates Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with a laundry room and working laundry room equipment. (Id. ¶134.) Alonso notified VOH's Management Office around February 18, 2017 about broken laundry equipment.29 (Id. ¶ 135.) The equipment was owned by a contractor. (Id.) The contractor replaced the laundry equipment two weeks later. (Id.)

VI. Discussion

a. Count One
In Count One, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Fair Housing Act by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, a handicapped parking spot with an access aisle on the driver's side reserved exclusively for Angie. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 39, 128-43.)
Defendants argue that this claim is barred by the FHA's two-year statute of [*67]  limitations, because Alonso only requested an assigned handicapped parking space twice, first on February 3, 2013, and second on August 5, 2016, both of which are beyond the limitations period. (Mot. at 4-5.) They further argue that the claim otherwise fails on the merits because the requested accommodation was neither reasonable nor necessary. (Mot. at 5-9.) Defendants argue that the request was unreasonable because: (1) if they had assigned Plaintiffs a reserved handicapped space, it would have denied all others access to the space, which would have the effect of permanently obstructing the space in violation of Florida law and the Miami Dade County Code of Ordinances, thereby "fundamentally alter[ing] Florida's and Miami Dade County's statutory schemes[,]" (id. at 6); and (2) if they had assigned Plaintiffs a space, it would have decreased "an already limited number of parking spaces available to other handicapped persons." (Id. at 6.) Defendants argue that a reserved handicapped parking space was unnecessary because Angie "was not enrolled in any school, program or organizational activity[;]" "had no need to be transported anywhere on a daily basis[;]" "[v]irtually all of ANGIE's [*68]  time was spent in Apt. 1301 with MOREJON sleeping or watching TV[;]" "[m]ore often than not" Plaintiffs parked in their "preferred" spot anyway; Plaintiffs could not recall a single time when they returned from a family outing to find no handicapped spaces available; Plaintiffs could not recall a single time that they were forced to miss an appointment or an outing because Angie could not be loaded into the minivan; and based on the dimensions of the handicapped parking spaces and Angie's wheelchair, there was no need for an access aisle to load and unload Angie from the minivan. (Id. at 7-8 (citations omitted).) Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs cannot "meet their burden [even] when measured against ANGIE's nearest handicapped comparator." (Id. at 8.) Specifically, Osvaldo Cordero "is a senior with a mobility disability who also resided in the 2500 Building during the Relevant time Period. He used a rollator as an aid." (Id.) "Unlike Mr. Cordero who physically ambulated the 360 feet from his apartment to the handicapped parking area, ANGIE exerted no physical effort when coming and going between his apartment and the parking lot: he was always seated in a wheelchair." (Id. [*69] )
Plaintiffs appear to argue that this claim is not barred by the statute of limitations because Alonso also requested an assigned handicapped parking space on March 29, 2017 and April 7, 2017, both of which are within the limitations period. (Resp. at 11.) Plaintiffs further appear to argue that the requested accommodation was reasonable and necessary because Angie is a member of a protected class under the FHA and has the right to go out at any time, and Plaintiffs had difficulty getting Angie into and out of the van when not parked in an accessible parking space. (Id. at 13-14.) Plaintiffs argue that Angie was entitled to a reserved parking space pursuant to the Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice ("Joint Statement"), (Resp. at 13), and cite to App. A, (see id. at 3). However, App. A. has been stricken from the record pursuant to Plaintiffs' Notice of Striking. (D.E. 495, 501.) They further appear to argue that pursuant to Section 320.0848, Florida Statutes, Angie was "entitled" to a specific, reserved parking space of Alonso's choosing. (Id. at 13.) They further argue that Osvaldo Cordero is not "comparable" to Angie because Mr. Cordero "ambulated the 360 [*70]  feet from his apartment to the handicapped parking area," whereas Angie could not. (Id. at 14.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that a reserved handicapped parking space was reasonable or necessary to afford Angie an equal opportunity to enjoy VOH. (D.E. 514 at 5.) They argue that Plaintiffs have failed to show that the other handicapped parking spaces were unusable or unsuitable. (Id.) They argue that the Joint Statement does not require a landlord to assign a handicapped space to any person with a visible mobility impairment. (Id. at 6.) They argue that there is no evidence showing that Angie suffered pain or distress while being transferred to and from the parking area in his wheelchair, or that he was subject to risks or embarrassment while being transferred to and from the parking area in his wheelchair. (Id. at 7.) Similarly, they argue that there is no evidence that Angie's enjoyment of living at VOH diminished because his parents were not assigned a handicapped parking space. (Id. at 7-8 (citing United States v. Cal. Mobile Park Home Park Mgmt. Co., 107 F.3d 1374, 1381 (9th Cir. 1997)).)
"The FHA prohibits discriminating against a person on the basis of a 'handicap,' or a disability, by refusing to make reasonable accommodations [*71]  when necessary to afford the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." Bhogaita v. Altamonte Heights Condo. Ass'n, 765 F.3d 1277, 1285 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B)). The FHA prohibits discrimination "because of a handicap" against persons with handicaps and "any person associated with that person." 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2)(C). "A successful failure-to-accommodate claim has four elements. To prevail, one must prove that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the FHA, (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) the requested accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the accommodation." Id. (citing Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1218-19 (11th Cir. 2008)). It is undisputed that Angie has a disability for purposes of the FHA. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 7; Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 7.) "Whether a requested accommodation is required by law is 'highly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case determination.'" Loren v. Sasser, 309 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Groner v. Golden Gate Gardens Apts., 250 F.3d 1039, 1044 (6th Cir. 2001)).
The FHA provides for a two-year statute of limitations in which a plaintiff must commence his action. 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A). Specifically, an "aggrieved person" who has been "injured by a discriminatory housing practice" is entitled to file a civil action "not later than 2 years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice, . . . ." [*72]  42 U.S.C. §§ 3602(i)(1), 3613(a)(1)(A). The FHA's "statute of limitations begins to run when 'facts supportive of the cause of action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person similarly situated.'" Wood v. Briarwinds Cond. Ass'n Bd. of Dirs., 369 F. App'x 1, 4 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hipp v. Liberty Nat'l Ins. Co., 252 F.3d 1208, 1222 (11th Cir. 2001)). For example, the FHA's statute of limitations begins to run when a request for a reasonable accommodation, or for permission to make a reasonable modification, is denied. See Oliver v. Fox Wood at Trinity Cmty. Ass'n, Inc., Case No: 8:17-cv-585-T-30AAS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220246, 2018 WL 4608325, at *7-8 & n.5 (M.D. Fla. July 30, 2018) (finding that the FHA's statute of limitations began to run when a reasonably prudent person would have become aware that a requested accommodation or permission to modify was denied, and that an injury is not a "continuing injury" simply because a request was denied) (citing Telesca v. Vill. of Kings Creek Condo. Ass'n, Inc., 390 F. App'x 877, 882 (11th Cir. 2010)). However, "[t]he computation of such 2-year period shall not include any time during which an administrative proceeding under this subchapter was pending with respect to a complaint or charge under this subchapter based upon such discriminatory housing practice." 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(B). The FHA's statute of limitations is not tolled by a request for administrative review of a no-cause determination. See Allen v. Hous. Auth. of City of Auburn, Ala., 638 F. App'x 825, 831 (11th Cir. 2015) (observing that "nothing in the statutory scheme of the FHA expressly contemplates such review" and that "the FHA's implementing regulations do not provide for administrative [*73]  review of determinations of no reasonable cause").
First, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Plaintiffs requested a reasonable accommodation, and whether Defendants denied such a request, within the FHA's limitations period. Defendants assert that Alonso only requested a reserved handicapped parking space one time, in February 2013. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 28; Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 29:13 - 30:13.) Vilma denied the request, advising Alonso that "the handicapped parking spaces were on a 'first come, first served' basis, which is what Florida law and ordinance require." (Defs.' Facts ¶ 28; Vilma Decl. ¶ 15 (App'x at 5).) Alonso never contacted Vilma about an assigned handicapped parking space again after that.30 (Vilma Decl. ¶ 15 (App'x at 5).) However, Plaintiffs assert that Alonso requested an assigned handicapped parking space on March 29, 2017 and April 7, 2017, (Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 28; Alonso Aff. ¶¶ 29-34, 39), and Vilma denied the request each time. (Alonso Aff. ¶¶ 29-34, 39.) Although Plaintiff filed the original Complaint in this case more than two years later on May 6, 2019, (D.E. 1), the limitations period was tolled for approximately [*74]  three months during HUD's investigation, from approximately September 27, 2017 to December 26, 2017. See Kennedy v. Warren Props., Inc., CIVIL ACTION NO. 17-00114-KD-N, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197908, 2017 WL 6002803, at *5 (S.D. Ala. Dec. 1, 2017); Binns v. Marietta Hous. Assistance Program, Civil Action No. 1:07-CV-0070-RWS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26747, 2010 WL 1138453, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 22, 2010). The Court finds that a reasonable jury could conclude, based on the record evidence, that Alonso requested a reserved handicapped parking space as a reasonable accommodation, and Defendants denied such a request, within the FHA's two-year limitations period.
Next, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a reserved handicapped parking space with an access aisle on the driver's side was "'necessary to afford [Angie] equal opportunity to use and enjoy' the relevant dwelling." Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1288 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B)). "The word 'equal' is a relative term that requires a comparator to have meaning." Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226. "Under the FHA, the comparator is a person without a disability, and an accommodation extends an equal opportunity when it addresses the needs the disability creates." Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1288 (citing Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226). "Thus, a 'necessary' accommodation is one that alleviates the effects of a disability." Id. (citing Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226).
It is undisputed that that there was no need to drive Angie anywhere [*75]  on a daily basis, and he spent most of the day watching television or sleeping due to medications he took. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 20.). It is undisputed that Angie never walked anywhere; he was always transported to and from Apartment 1301 and the handicapped parking area. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 32.) Plaintiffs transported Angie in the minivan for medical appointments and family outings, but they could not remember any specific instances where they were late for or had to cancel a medical appointment for Angie because of their inability to load him into the minivan. (Id. ¶¶ 21-22.) Defendants produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that based upon the dimensions of the handicapped parking spaces, the width of Alonso's van, and the width of Angie's wheelchair, a handicapped parking space with an access aisle on the driver's side was unnecessary, and Angie could get into and out of the van from any handicapped parking space. (Mot. at 7-8; Defs. Facts ¶¶ 17-18.)
On the other hand, Plaintiffs have produced video and photographic evidence showing Alonso and Morejon transferring Angie from his wheelchair into the van. (See Pls.' USB File # 4.)
The Court finds that based on the photographs [*76]  and videos, a reasonable jury could conclude that a reserved handicapped parking space with an access aisle on the driver's side was necessary to provide Angie an equal opportunity to enjoy Apartment 1301. Stated differently, a reasonable jury could find that a reserved handicapped parking space access aisle on the driver's side ameliorates the effects of Angie's disability, which cause him to be transported to and from the van in a wheelchair.
Finally, the Court finds that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a reserved handicapped parking space with an access aisle on the driver's side was reasonable. The reasonableness determination "asks whether the requested accommodation 'is both efficacious and proportional to the costs to implement it.'" Bhogaita 765 F.3d at 1289 (quoting Oconomowoc Res. Programs v. City of Milwaukee, 300 F.3d 775, 784 (7th Cir. 2002)). For example, an accommodation is unreasonable if (1) it would impose an undue financial and administrative burden on the housing provider or (2) it would fundamentally alter the nature of the housing provider's operations. See Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1220 (citing Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 288 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Harris v. Thigpen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1527 n.48 (11th Cir. 1991)); see also Warren v. Delvista Towers Cond. Ass'n, Inc., 49 F. Supp. 3d 1082, 1086 (S.D. Fla. 2014).
Here, Defendants argue that the requested accommodation is unreasonable because it would fundamentally alter the legal schemes governing handicapped parking spaces. [*77]  (Mot. at 6 (citing United States v. WHPC-DWR, LLC, 491 F. App'x 733 (7th Cir. 2012) (affirming district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of property owner where tenant claimed that property owner violated FHA's reasonable accommodation provision by denying him an assigned parking space near the building's entrance, but declining to reach issue of reasonableness of accommodation request); Money v. Kendallville Place Apts., 1:14-cv-00253, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28320, at *9-13 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 7, 2016) (finding that FHA accommodation request to create access aisle around plaintiff's reserved parking space was unreasonable after balancing interests). Plaintiffs do not expressly address the reasonableness inquiry, other than to argue that Defendants' arguments are "mere pretexts." (Resp. at 12.)
Based on the record evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that a reserved handicapped parking space with an access aisle on the driver's side was a reasonable accommodation. See WHPC-DWR, LLC, 491 F. App'x at 737-38 (observing that "HUD regulations interpreting the FHA assume that in some circumstances a 'first come, first served' parking policy must yield to accommodate residents with impaired mobility"). Accordingly, Defendants Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count One is denied.

b. Count Three
In Count Three, Alonso, Morejon, and Angie allege that Defendants violated the FHA by refusing to [*78]  permit a reasonable modification to their apartment. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 150-56.) Specifically, they allege that "from March 2017 to August 2018, Carlos requested that they be allowed to modify the bathroom of Angie, but Vilma in more than one occasion refused the modification, saying they never allowed it in 'Villas.'" (Id. ¶ 59.) They concede that Defendants "eventually provided an authorization to the bathroom's modification on August 27, 2018[,]" (id. ¶ 60), but allege that they received a "constructive denial[,]" (id. ¶ 153).
Defendants argue that there is insufficient evidence regarding Alonso's alleged March 2017 request for a reasonable modification to defeat summary judgment. (Mot. at 9-10 (citing McBride v. Vill. of Michiana, Case No. 4:92-CV-155, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6082 (W.D. Mich. Apr. 2, 1998); Chandler v. James, 985 F. Supp. 1094, 1100 (M.D. Ala. 1997)).) They argue that "[b]ecause Plaintiffs cannot recall 'specific facts' to counter Defendants' denial of alleged requests for a bathroom modification before 8/26/[2018],31 their generalized statements do not create disputed issues of fact." (Id. at 10.) They further argue that Count Three is not ripe because after Defendants approved the modification Plaintiffs failed to complete APD's administrative procedures by paying the $789.58 for an environmental accessibility adaption evaluation, [*79]  even though Alonso received approval to use $798.58 of Angie's Medicaid Waiver account for the evaluation. (Id. at 10-11.) They argue that "Plaintiffs seek a judicial determination that they were denied opportunities to modify ANGIE's bathroom when the record clearly establishes they were neither ready nor willing to commence the bathroom modification using their own funds until APD determine[d] if they could apply funds in ANGIE's CDC+ Medicaid Waiver account for that purpose. Count III is simply an abstract dispute not ripe for adjudication." (Id. at 11.)
Plaintiffs argue that Alonso requested permission to modify Angie's bathroom at the beginning of March 2017, and on March 29, 2017. (Resp. at 14 (citing Alonso's Aff. ¶¶ 26-33).) They further argue that after Defendants approved the August 27, 2018 request, they did not complete APD's administrative procedures for "many reasons," including that the approval was not timely. (Id. at 17 (citing Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 50).)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' failure to recall specific facts about the March 2017 requests to modify Angie's bathroom until their opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment evinces [*80]  "gamesmanship," the new details Alonso provides are "inherently inconsistent" with his prior deposition testimony, and the new details the rest of the family provides are inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rules of Evidence 602 and 802. (Resp. at 9.) They further argue that even if Plaintiffs could establish that they requested the modification in March 2017, "the requested modification was unnecessary because an alternative means was found to accomplish the same purpose and it achieved the same effect"—specifically, Alonso built Angie a shower chair that fit in Plaintiffs' bathtub. (Id. at 10.) Defendants argue that there is no evidence showing that this alternative means caused Angie pain or discomfort. (Id.)
The FHA prohibits discrimination "in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(2). For purposes of the FHA, "discrimination" includes
a refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises [*81]  except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted.
42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(A). "To prevail on a section 3604(f)(3)(A) claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) she is disabled or handicapped within the meaning of the FHA, (2) she requested a modification of the premises, (3) such modification was reasonable, (4) such modification was necessary to afford her full enjoyment of the premises, and ([5]) the defendants refused to permit the modification to be made at plaintiff's expense." Sackman v. Balfour Beatty Cmtys., LLC, No. CV 113-066, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125389, 2014 WL 4415938, at *5 (S.D. Ga. Sept. 8, 2014). "The failure to make a timely determination after meaningful review amounts to constructive denial of a requested accommodation [or modification], 'as an indeterminate delay has the same effect as an outright denial.'" Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1286.
The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on this claim. During his deposition, Alonso testified that he requested a modification to Angie's bathroom in the "[b]eginning of March '17." (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 83:8.) He stated that he asked to "[r]emove the bathtub [*82]  completely from the bathroom, make a — install flooring that was completely flat. . . . And in the flat bathroom install a chair that was bigger and more comfortable for Angie." (Id. at 90:12-17.) Although the deposition transcript is not entirely clear as to what Vilma's specific response was, a reasonable jury could conclude that Vilma denied the request. (See id. at 90:5 - 92:21.)
However, Vilma submitted a sworn Declaration denying that Plaintiffs requested a reasonable modification to Angie's bathroom prior to August 2018. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 18 (App'x at 6-7).) She states that
[t]he first time the issue was ever raised with me was on 8/26/2018 when ALONSO emailed me a request for permission to modify their son's bathroom and remove the bathtub. I turned the letter over to our attorney, Ken Lowehaupt, Esq. to answer because ALONSO then was represented by attorneys (whom he copied on the request). Mr. Lowenhaupt responded to ALONSO the following day via email with a letter attached. The letter denied ALONSO's claim that he previously had discussed this with me but indicated that 245 C and C LLC granted approval of the request with conditions that ALONSO performed the work with a permit, [*83]  hired a licensed contractor, and coordinated construction with my office. . . .
Three days later on 8/30/18, ALONSO sent me an email again asking for approval. This time I responded to him directly and told him to review Mr. Lowenhaput's 8/27/18 responsive letter. I also informed him that in addition to the conditions already set out in Mr. Lowenhaupt's letter, he would be financially responsible for returning the bathroom back to its original condition at the conclusion of their lease.
I never heard anything further after this exchange from ALONSO or MOREJON about moving forward with the bathroom modification project.
I have never told ALONSO or MOREJON that 245 C&C LLC or CFH Group LLC would not permit reasonable modifications. . . .
(Id. ¶¶ 19-21.) Additionally, when asked by HUD Equal Opportunity Specialist Adoniram Vargas on October 13, 2017 whether she had ever spoken with Plaintiffs about specific plans for a bathroom modification, Vilma replied: "Never." (App'x at 602.) When asked whether she had spoken with Plaintiffs about who would pay for any such modification, or who would restore the bathroom to its original condition if Plaintiffs left the unit, Vilma replied: "Never." ( [*84] Id.)
Thus, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether (1) Plaintiffs requested a modification to Angie's bathroom in March 2017, and (2) whether Defendants refused to permit the modification to be made at Plaintiffs' expense.
Although Defendants argue that Alonso's failure to recall specific facts regarding the March 2017 request is insufficient to create a factual issue, the Court disagrees. The cases Defendants cite are distinguishable. In McBride, the plaintiff alleged that certain individuals made derogatory statements about her in phone calls. 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6082, at *13-15. The plaintiff provided no foundation for her knowledge of the contents of those phone calls, and the individuals who allegedly made the phone calls could not remember what was said during the phone calls. Id. As such, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to raise genuine issues of material facts as to those claims. Id. Here, Alonso did not testify that he could not remember what he spoke with Vilma about—rather, he testified that he had a conversation with Vilma in March 2017 about modifying Angie's bathroom, but that he cannot remember the precise date on which it occurred. (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 21:22.) Thus, McBride is [*85]  inapposite.
In Chandler, the court found that "a witness who states that he cannot remember whether or not an event alleged to have happened by the moving party actually took place does not help the nonmoving party to meet its burden." 985 F. Supp. at 1100. "The nonmoving party must come up with evidence that negates the version of events alleged by the moving party—an acknowledgment that the event may have occurred, but the witness cannot remember, falls short." Id. In this case, Alonso did not testify that he could not remember whether he requested permission to modify Angie's bathroom in March 2017—rather, he testified that he did request such permission, but that he cannot remember the precise date on which it occurred. (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 21:22.) Thus, Chandler is inapposite.
Although Defendants argue that this claim is not ripe because when Defendants did approve Plaintiffs' request to modify Angie's bathroom they did not commence the modification, a reasonable jury could conclude that the circumstances had changed such that the modification was not yet feasible. There is evidence that Plaintiffs requested permission to make a reasonable modification to Angie's bathroom in March 2017, and that Defendants [*86]  denied the request. (See Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 83:8 - 93:21.) Then, on September 26, 2017, Defendants terminated Plaintiffs' lease and ordered them to move out by October 31, 2017. (Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 11 (App'x at 40).) The next day, September 27, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint. (App'x at 577.) Defendants subsequently extended the move-out date to January 31, 2018 so that HUD could complete its investigation. (Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 13.) On December 26, 2017, HUD issued its conclusion that no reasonable cause existed to believe a discriminatory housing violation occurred. (App'x at 610-11.) However, Plaintiffs refused to vacate Apartment 1301 on January 31, 2018, and Defendants instituted eviction proceedings on February 1, 2018. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 118.)
Then, Plaintiffs made another request for permission to modify Angie's bathroom on August 26, 2018, (App'x at 506), which was granted the following day, August 27, 2018, (App'x at 6-7, 42). Vilma conditioned the permission to modify Angie's bathroom on Plaintiffs' agreement to return the bathroom to its original condition at the conclusion of their lease, at Plaintiffs' expense. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 19.) Ultimately, [*87]  Plaintiffs did not move forward with the modification after securing approval to use $798.58 of Angie's Medicaid Waiver account for the environmental accessibility adaption evaluation. (Ortiz Aff. (App'x at 93).)
Construing the evidence, and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could conclude that in light of the pending eviction proceedings and the fact that they would be required to return the bathroom to its original condition at their expense at the conclusion of their lease, Plaintiffs did not move forward with the modification because they were uncertain whether they would be permitted to remain in Apartment 1301.
Therefore, the Court finds that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment as to Count Three.

c. Count Four
In Count Four, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the FHA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, painting the bathtub in the guest bathroom without using toxic substances. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 157-62.)
In their Statement of Facts, Defendants state that on August 5, 2018, Alonso made a written request to VOH to refinish the guest bathtub. (Defs.' Facts [*88]  ¶ 52.) In their Motion, Defendants state that the request was made on August 6, 2017. (Mot. at 11.) The evidence to which Defendants cite in their Statement of Facts reflects that the request was made in August 2018. (See Vilma Aff. ¶ 22 (Defs.' App'x at 8); Aug. 7, 2018 email from Alonso to Lowenhaupt (App'x 502).)
Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on this claim for at least three reasons: (1) the requested accommodation was impossible to carry out and therefore unreasonable, (Mot. at 12 (citing Reyes-Garay v. Integrand Assur. Co., 818 F Supp. 2d 414, 438 (D.P.R. 2011)); (2) Plaintiffs refused to cooperate by suggesting an alternative means to complete the project, (id. (citing Polite v. Winn Residential, NO. 3:14-cv-01921 (VAB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5233 (D. Conn. Jan. 15, 2016)), and also by denying Defendants' entry into their apartment to complete the project when opportunities to do so were available, (id.); and/or (3) refinishing the bathtub was not necessary due to an effective alternative that was suggested and accepted, (id.).
Plaintiffs devote most of this section of their Response to arguing that the request was made on August 7, 2017, and Defendants "decided to ignore the request" for twenty days, when they asked Plaintiffs to sign Tobby Tubs' waiver. (D.E. 491 at 17-18.) The Court considers this to be a typographical [*89]  error, and that Plaintiffs intended to assert that the request was made on August 7, 2018, as there is no evidence of any request to refinish a bathtub in August 2017. Plaintiffs appear to argue that Defendants' constructively denied the request by not promptly responding to it. (Id. at 18.) Although Plaintiffs appear to dispute some of Defendants' factual assertions, they do not directly respond to the remainder of Defendants' legal arguments, other than to assert that they "are after the fact mere pretexts[.]" (Resp. at 18.)
In their Reply, Defendants state that "Plaintiffs correctly state their request to paint the tub in guest bathroom was made on 8/7/18, not 8/20/18." (Reply at 10.) However, they argue that this fact is immaterial because a twenty-day gap between a reasonable accommodation request and a response is not unreasonable. (Id. (citing Moody v. Gongloff, 687 F. App'x 496, 499 (6th Cir. 2017); Taylor v. The Hous. Auth. of New Haven, 267 F.R.D. 36, 70 (D. Conn. 2010); Elliott v. QF Circa 37, LLC, Case No. 16-cv-0288-BAS-AGS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98668 (S.D. Cal. June 12, 2018)).) Defendants argue that after Alonso refused to sign the Tobby Tub's consent form, Plaintiffs never made an effort to find an alternative means to paint the tub, and never contacted Vilma about the issue again. (Id. at 11.) They argue that "[a] plaintiff must demonstrate behavior consistent with a good faith effort to find a reasonable [*90]  accommodation." (Id. (citing Gray v. Coliseum Med. Ctr., CASE NO.: 5:09-CV-0069 (WLS), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162726 (M.D. Ga. Mar. 31, 2011)).)
As previously stated, "[t]he FHA prohibits discriminating against a person on the basis of a 'handicap,' or a disability, by refusing to make reasonable accommodations when necessary to afford the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1285 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B)). "A successful failure-to-accommodate claim has four elements. To prevail, one must prove that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the FHA, (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) the requested accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the accommodation." Id. (citing Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1218-19).
The admitted facts establish that on or about August 5, 2018, Alonso emailed Vilma requesting that VOH refinish the surface of the bathtub in the guest bathroom. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 52.) On August 7, 2018, Mr. Lowenhaupt emailed Alonso a letter advising that Plaintiffs needed to sign Tobby Tubs Refinishing Corp.'s consent form before the work could commence. (Id. ¶ 53; see also Lowenhaupt Aug. 7, 2018 email and letter (App'x 502-03).) On August 7, 2018, Alonso responded to Mr. Lowenhaupt's email/letter and requested, as a reasonable accommodation, [*91]  that the bathtub be refinished without the use of toxic substances. (App'x at 502.) On August 25, 2018,32 Alonso emailed Vilma and Defendants demanding a response to his prior request that VOH refinish his guest bathtub without toxic substances. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 54; Aug. 25, 2018 email from Alonso to Vilma (App'x at 505).) He asserted that the toxic substances "could affect [his] disabled son's health, who is allergic." (Id.) On August 27, 2018, Vilma visited Plaintiffs' apartment to deliver Plaintiffs a copy of Tobby Tubs' consent/release form. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 58.) While she was there, she inspected the bathtub. (Id.) She discovered that the bathtub did not need to be refinished, but just needed a good cleaning. (Id.) Plaintiffs cleaned the tub and continued to use it. (Id.) Alonso never returned Tobby Tubs' consent/release form to Vilma and she never heard anything further from them about refinishing the guest bathtub. (Id. ¶¶ 59-60; see also Vilma Decl. ¶ 24 (App'x at 8).)
Denis R. Archila, the President of Tobby Tubs Refinishing Corp., has submitted a sworn declaration describing the standard industry method for resurfacing a bathtub, which includes the application of epoxy paint. [*92]  (Archila Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.) He avers that "there is no epoxy paint that can be used to refinish a bathtub that does not contain toxic fumes. Therefore it was impossible to complete the job." (Id. ¶ 9; see also Defs.' Facts ¶ 55-56.)
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Count Four because the requested accommodation was neither reasonable nor necessary to afford Plaintiffs an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling. First, the accommodation was unreasonable because the admitted facts and record evidence establish that "[i]t is impossible to refinish the surface of a bathtub without use of toxic substances." (Defs.'s Facts ¶ 55; Archila Decl. ¶¶ 4-9.) An accommodation that is impossible to provide is an unreasonable one. See Reyes-Garay, 818 F. Supp. 2d at 438 (finding that the plaintiffs' requested accommodation was unreasonable where the plaintiffs requested to relocate to a particular apartment unit that was uninhabitable due to damage from concrete falling from the ceiling).
Second, the accommodation was not necessary to afford Plaintiffs an equal opportunity to enjoy their dwelling. The admitted facts establish that Plaintiffs cleaned their guest bathtub and continued to use it. [*93]  (Defs.' Facts ¶ 58.) During the deposition of Angie's sister, Jany, the following exchange occurred:
Q. Do you know that it's extremely toxic to paint a bathtub with - and it has to be painted with epoxy. So there are dangerous fumes. And you have to leave the apartment to do that. So can you give me any suggestion of how we can get this done?
A. No.
Q. Have you talked to your dad about how he thinks it could get done?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So in the meantime that you haven't had the bathtub painted have you suffered any damages because of that?
A. No. Because we clean it.
Q. Okay. So the bathtub is cleaned and - and most of the stain is gone?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Was the stain caused by dirt? Just extremely -
A. Yes.
Q. -- hard to remove dirt?
A. Yes.
(App'x at 189.) Because refinishing the bathtub without toxic substances was not necessary for its utility as a bathtub or to afford Plaintiffs the equal opportunity to use and enjoy Apartment 1301, it was not a necessary accommodation. See Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226 ("The FHA's reasonable accommodation provision requires only those accommodations that 'may be necessary . . . to afford equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.'") (42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B)); cf. Polite, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5233 at *9-10 (finding that the plaintiff failed to [*94]  state an FHA failure to accommodate claim where the plaintiff rejected the defendant's proposed reasonable accommodation without suggesting a reasonable alternative).
Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Four.

d. Count Five
In Count Five, Alonso, Morejon, and Angie allege that Defendants violated the FHA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation—specifically, removing the operation of noisy equipment near Plaintiffs' apartment. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 163-68.) The Second Amended Complaint alleges that "[t]his accommodation was reasonable and necessary due to Angie's disabilities, to provide Angie and his family a peaceful and healthy living in 'Villas,' avoiding discomfort to Angie, who needs sleep and rest, and to afford them equal opportunity to use and enjoy its apartment." (Id. ¶ 166.)
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have produced no admissible medical evidence or expert testimony to establish that during the relevant time period an effect of Angie's handicaps was a particularized sensitivity to noise. (Mot. at 12-13 (citing Magee v. Boston Land Co. Mgmt. Servs., 90 F. App'x 560 (2d Cir. 2004); Matarese v. Archstone Pentagon City, 761 F. Supp. 2d 346, 364 (E.D. Va. 2011); Davis v. Echo Valley Condo. Ass'n, 349 F. Supp. 3d 645, 658-59 (E.D. Mich. 2018)).) They argue that
Dr. Hoffer's letter of medical necessity is inadmissible because his conclusions were based on reviewing [*95]  (unidentified) videos of ANGIE made by ALONSO (i.e. self-diagnosis) rather than on his personal observations of ANGIE under such conditions and his conclusions directly conflicted with Dr. Smeals' test findings which Dr. Hoffer reviewed prior to his consultation with ALONSO and ANGIE. See Knox v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 314 Fed Appx. 230 (11th Cir. 2008) [holding inadmissible a medical certificate issued by a doctor due to his lack of personal knowledge about the patient's needs and relying instead on a plaintiff's self-diagnosis]. Dr. Hoffer's letter also does [not] address if non-handicapped persons would be similarly affected, as discussed in Matarese, supra.
(Id. at 13 n.23.) As such, Defendants argue that "Plaintiffs cannot meet their burden to prove ANGIE's handicaps produced a condition that harmed him in a way that did not similarly impair a non-handicapped tenant much less to establish a nexus between that condition and the need for the requested accommodation." (Id. at 13 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B); Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226).) They further argue that even if Plaintiffs had met these burdens, they failed to establish that Defendants owed Angie a duty to accommodate because their vague requests—which noted that Angie was "awakened" or "inconvenienced" by the noises and that the noises disturbed the [*96]  entire family—did not place Defendants on notice of Angie's purported sensitivity to noise. (Id. at 13-14 (citing Hawn v. Shoreline Towers Phase 1 Condo. Ass'n, 347 F. App'x 464 (11th Cir. 2009); Bone v. Vill. Club Inc., 223 F. Supp. 3d 1203, 1213 (M.D. Fla. 2016); Patton v. Jacob's Eng'g Grp., 863 F.3d 419, 425-26 (5th Cir. 2017); Chandler v. Chartwell Holdings, Civil No. 19-cv-36-PB, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156634 (D.N.H. Sept. 13, 2019)).) They further argue that Plaintiffs' April 18, 2019 request was not based on Angie's hearing but rather on his need to take medication. (Id. at 14.) They further argue that by signing the Good Conduct Addendum Plaintiffs "implicitly admitted that the noise would not affect ANGIE and/or agreed to accept the risk and tolerate it, and waived their right to object to, noise associated with tree-trimming and other maintenance projects." (Id.) They further argue that the fact that Plaintiffs placed a very large gas generator on Angie's balcony after Hurricane Irma undermines their claim that Angie suffers from a sensitivity to loud noise. (Id. at 15.) As to reasonableness, Defendant argue that a balancing of the Parties' interest does not weigh in Plaintiffs' favor—to wit:
It was far easier for them to plan in advance how they would manage ANGIE's purportedly sensitivity to loud noise than to require Defendants and their vendor to create and execute a large-scale logistical plan on the spur of the moment in the middle of a tree trimming project that required moving an [*97]  essential piece of machinery 324 ft. away from the spot it needed to be and with little time to consider how implementation of the requested accommodation would affect all other residents and visitors of VOH and the mode, methods and efficiency of the work yet to be done. Implementation of the accommodation not only would have created a logistical and administrative nightmare, but also would have substantially increased Defendants' costs. [TAB A 1 ¶ 28; TAB A 5 all parts]. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, could have easily achieved the same benefit for ANGIE by simply purchasing an inexpensive set of ear plugs or the like. This alternative was recommended by Dr. Smeal. [TAB J 1.1] Query: if ANGIE truly suffered from sensitivity to loud noise, it is unclear why ALONSO and MOREJON purposely chose not to avail themselves of this option. [TAB C, pp. 266:15-24; 267:5-15]. Harsy v. Mid-American Apt. Cmtys, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97751 at HN 14 (E.D. Va. 2017) [accommodation unnecessary where the purported effect on a handicap's condition could have been avoided through plaintiff's own action].
(Id.) Defendants argue that the same principles apply to Plaintiffs' claim regarding the pressure cleaning project:
Assuming Plaintiffs were able to establish through admissible medical [*98]  proof that ANGIE suffered from a sensitivity to loud noise, they tendered no evidence that ANGIE actually heard and suffered injury from noise originating in the corridors of the 2500 Building. It is undisputed that ANGIE's bedroom is located at the rear of Apt. 1301 whereas the pressure cleaning took place outside in front of their unit. [TAB E, pp. 58:17-23]. Second, it is also undisputed that (like the annual tree trimmings), Plaintiffs were given advance notice of the pressure cleaning project with sufficient time to advance plan how they would manage ANGIE's condition, if necessary. [TAB N 16]. Again, Plaintiffs' made their request for an accommodation in the middle of the project: Plaintiffs never made a request on either the 1st day of the pressure cleaning project when the equipment was used in the corridors of the floor above their apartment nor on the 2nd day when it was used on their own floor and would have had the greatest impact on ANGIE if he could hear it. Instead, Plaintiffs waited until mid-project to suddenly request the pressure cleaning equipment be moved farther away. See [TAB A 1 ¶¶ 30-33] and Defendants' response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Relief [DE [*99]  337] (incorporated by reference). Third, Defendants had no greater knowledge of ANGIE's particularized sensitivity to loud noise; all they were told was that ANGIE was awakened by the pressure washer's noise, the same effect that a non-disabled person might suffer while attempting to take an afternoon nap.
(Id. at 16.)
Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Smeal and Dr. Hoffer both determined that Angie was "sensible [sic] to loud noise, and it cause a lot of distress to him, because he is mental retarded, wheelchair dependent and could not move far from the source of the noise as any normal person." (Resp. at 18.) They argue that Alonso first complained to Vilma in 2012 that maintenance workers woke Angie up when they "knocked hard" on the front door when they needed to fumigate. (Id. at 19.) At Vilma's request, Alonso provided a medical letter in September 2012. (Id.) Plaintiffs argue that based on the medical letter and Alonso's complaints, Defendants knew or should have known that the "workers and vendors should not make noise or locate any noisy machine[s] near plaintiffs' apartment." (Id.) Plaintiffs state that Alonso first requested that Defendants move the woodchipper machines in 2013. ( [*100] Id.) They argue that Defendants almost always ignored Alonso's requests, and only once denied Alonso' request outright. (Id. at 20.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendants were required to engage Plaintiffs in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation was necessary. (Id. (citing Jankowski Lee & Assocs. v. Cisneros, 91 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 1996); Jacobs v. Concord Vill. Condo. X Ass'n, Inc., No. 04-60017CIVLENARD, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4876, 2004 WL 741384, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 17, 2004); Armant v. Chat-Ro Co., L.L.C., No. Civ.A.00-1402, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11386, 2000 WL 1092838, at *2 (E.D. La. Aug. 1, 2000)).) Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' arguments regarding the reasonableness and necessity of the requested accommodation, and the undue burden it would cause, "are after the facts mere pretexts . . . ." (Id.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that there is no evidence that Defendants were aware the Angie suffered from a disability that made him sensitive to loud noise. (D.E. 514 at 2.) They further argue that there is no "competent" evidence establishing that Angie is hypersensitive to loud noise. (Id. at 3.) They argue that because Plaintiffs failed to designate an expert witness to prove that Angie had a condition that made him hypersensitive to loud noises, they are now attempting to reinterpret Dr. Smeal's findings, "[b]ut the scientific, clinical tests she administered to ANGIE established he suffered from hearing loss. And because ANGIE displayed no reaction to sound up to 100 [*101]  dB, Dr. Smeal could not determine ANGIE's degree of aural sensitivity." (Id.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs "are not trained audiologists and their lay opinions cannot substitute for Dr. Smeal's interpretation of scientific, clinical test results." (Id. (citing Fed. R. Evid. 701).) Defendants maintain that Dr. Hoffer's medical notes are inadmissible hearsay and are based on hearsay, and argue that Plaintiffs' failure to respond to this argument in their Response constitutes an abandonment of their position that Dr. Hoffer's notes are admissible. (Id.) Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs' failure to identify a comparator is fatal to Count Five. (Id. at 4.) They argue that Jany, Katy, and Morejon's Affidavits establish that the loud noises had the same effect on them as they did on Angie. (Id.)
As previously stated, "[t]he FHA prohibits discriminating against a person on the basis of a 'handicap,' or a disability, by refusing to make reasonable accommodations when necessary to afford the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1285 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B)). "A successful failure-to-accommodate claim has four elements. To prevail, one must prove that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the FHA, [*102]  (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) the requested accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the accommodation." Id. (citing Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1218-19).
The FHA's reasonable accommodation provision requires only those accommodations that "may be necessary . . . to afford equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B) (emphases added). The word "equal" is a relative term that requires a comparator to have meaning. In this context, "equal opportunity" can only mean that handicapped people must be afforded the same (or "equal") opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling as non-handicapped people, which occurs when accommodations address the needs created by the handicaps. If accommodations go beyond addressing these needs and start addressing problems not caused by a person's handicap, then the handicapped person would receive not an "equal," but rather a better opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, a preference that the plain language of this statute cannot support.
Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1226. "Thus, a 'necessary' accommodation is one that alleviates the effects of a disability. Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1288. Of course, for liability to attach, the defendant must know [*103]  of the plaintiff's disability and that the accommodation is, in fact, necessary. United States v. Hialeah Hous. Auth., 418 F. App'x 872, 875 (11th Cir. 2011) (citing Schwarz, 544 F.3d at 1219).
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Five because there is no evidence that Defendants knew Angie suffered from a disability that caused audio sensitivity, or required "sleep and rest" in the middle of the day, (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 166), such that the requested accommodation was necessary to alleviate the effects Angie's handicap. To begin with, the admitted facts establish that Angie's hearing was never medically tested until July 2, 2020—during the pendency of this lawsuit. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 79.) Plaintiffs made an appointment at University of Miami Health Systems with audiologist Dr. Molly Smeal for the purpose of obtaining proof to use in this case. (Id. (citing Smeal Report (App'x at 251); Hoffer Report (App'x at 255)).) Alonso and Morejon told Dr. Smeal that Angie was bothered by loud sounds. (Id. (citing Smeal Dep. Tr. at 13:2-18 (App'x at 232)).) Alonso showed Dr. Smeal some videos of Angie allegedly reacting to loud sounds recorded in the apartment. (Id. (citing Smeal Dep. Tr. at 37:19 - 38:15 (App'x at 243-44)).) Dr. Smeal performed a series of [*104]  audiological tests on Angie but could not replicate Angie's purported reactions to loud sounds that were allegedly reflected in the videos. (Id. (citing Smeal Dep. Tr. at 14:1-5 (App'x at 233), 15:18-21 (App'x at 234)).) For example, Dr. Smeal performed audiometry and tympanometry tests, and Angie showed no physical reaction at all to noises up to 100 decibels with one exception—he smiled once when he heard Alonso's voice projected into a sound booth. (Id.; see also (Smeal Dep. Tr. at 15:16-24 (App'x at 234); 27:16-25 (App'x at 237); 29:2-13 (App'x at 238)).) Dr. Smeal was unable to reach any conclusion about Angie's hearing sensitivity or establish a correlation between Angie's vocalization and sounds he heard or did not hear. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 80 (citing Smeal Dep. Tr. at 36:6-20 (App'x at 242)).) In fact, she diagnosed him with "unspecified hearing loss" in both ears. (Id. (citing Smeal Report (App'x at 251)).)
Nor did Alonso inform Defendants that Angie suffered from a disability that caused audio sensitivity in his three requests to move noisy equipment far from Apartment 1301. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants knew or should have known that loud noise affected Angie since September [*105]  13, 2012, when Plaintiffs submitted a medical letter from Dr. Gladys Y. Alonso, M.D. (Resp. at 19.) Dr. Alonso's letter states:
The patient mentioned above has been under my medical care since November 2012. After two examinations, I have diagnosed the patient with obesity, abnormality of gait, difficulty walking, wheelchair dependence, memory deficiency, generalized anxiety, full incontinence, abnormal speech, mental retardation and chronic allergies. The patient is requires [sic] assistance performing all activities of daily living. He also requires assistance managing his own affairs and medication regiment [sic]. He is mostly unable to communicate effectively when he is feeling badly. Therefore, at the suggestion of his parents and at my professional suggestion, it should be wise and beneficial to refrain from spray pesticides around his apartment. . . .
(D.E. 470 at 98.) Dr. Alonso's letter says nothing about audio sensitivity or a need to shield Angie from loud noises. Thus, Dr. Alonso's letter does not create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Defendants knew that Angie had a disability that resulted in loud noises causing Angie "discomfort."
The record further [*106]  reflects that on September 12, 2018, Alonso emailed Vilma to complain about the noise caused by the tree trimming service. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 65 (citing Sept. 12, 2018 email from Alonso to Vilma (App'x at 553)).) The email states, in its entirety:
Good morning Vilma Hernandez
During this weeks workers contracted by you are cutting trees in this property. They are parking trucks and equipmnts [sic] in front of our aparatment [sic], causing loud noises, which awakened my disabled son, and are disturbing my family.
I request you talk to these workers and request them to move those trucks and equipments far from our apartment, since the parking area in thies [sic] apartment complex is big, and allow them to park their equipment farder [sic], in order to not cause discomfort to my disabled son.
1.- When they are not introducing the branches in the bigger cutting machine, still keep that machine running, causing a great discomfort.
2.- I suggest that they use small cutting machines to cut the branches first, and tranport [sic] them to a place located far from our apartment, since the noise is bigger when they introduce the branches in their big cutting machine, causing an unbearable noise, awakening [*107]  my disabled son, several times on Tuesday (9/11/18), and also today Wednesday (9/12/18). Right now they are still causing these loud noises, disturbing my son's pattern of sleep.
(App'x at 553.) In her sworn Declaration, Vilma acknowledges that she received Alonso's September 12, 2018, email but states that she "had no idea what ALONSO meant by 'sleep pattern' because ALONSO never had spoken to me about their son's daily routine or activities. ALONSO also never had informed me or anyone else in the Management office of the full nature and extent of his son's handicaps." (Vilma Decl. ¶ 27 (App'x at 9-10).)
Next, on February 1, 2019, while a maintenance crew was pressure cleaning the second floor of the 2500 Building, Alonso emailed Vilma to complain about the noise. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 71.) The email states, in its entirety:
To whom it may concern:
1.- On Wednesday (1/30/2019), the maintenance workers of Villas of Hialeah, started cleaning the building 2500, where we live at Apt #1301 (at the third floor), that day they cleaned the 4th floor.
2.- On Thursday (1/31/2019), they cleaned the 3rd floor, where we live.
3.- Today Friday (2/1/2019), they are cleaning the second floor.
They are using what [*108]  it sees an old power washer macheine [sic], which is very loud, causing a discomfort to my disabled son, who could not sleep afternoon for the previous two days, as he normally does. Not sleeping afternoons, also make him not sleep well at night, making my wife and me to wake up several times overnight to accommodate him, or turning him around in his bed, trying to allow him to sleep better, but not. That also had caused that we are tired for also not sleeping well at night for two days now.
Because the reasons above, the pattern of sleep of my disabled son and our pattern was affected.
Then, by this email I am "REQUESTING A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR MY DISABLED SON, TO THE MANAGER OF VILLAS OF HIALEAH APARTMENTS, TO ASK THEIR MAINTENANCE WORKERS TO RELOCATE THE POWER WASHER MACHINE, IN THE MOST POSSIBLE SUITABLE PLACE, FARDER FROM OUR APARTMENT, AND IF IT IS POSSIBLE WITH SOME WALLS, OBSTRUCING THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SOUND WAVES DIRECTLY TO OUR APARTMENT, SINCE THEY HAVE ENOUGH AND LARGE HOSES TO DO THAT ACCOMMODATION, IN ORDER TO AVOID MORE DISCOMFORT TO OUR SON.
We sincerely appreciate the cleanliness that is being made, because this building needed it, we recognize that they are [*109]  doing a good job, but it is a job that needs several days to be done, and maybe they will need another one or two days to finish in our building. We also want to remember that any apartment complex manager should by law (ADA, Fair Housing Law) provide certain accommodations for disabled persons as my son, when necessary.
Then we maintain our request, which is legal, reasonable, fair and necessary, and hope that you will take all the actions to grant it.
(App'x at 554.) In her sworn Declaration, Vilma asserts that Alonso "never provided any papers, medical documents, photos or videos to support his need for the reasonable accommodation requests he made on behalf of their son." (Vilma Decl. ¶ 34.)
Finally, on April 18, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Vilma to complain about the tree cutting machines. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 76.) The email states in its entirety:
To whom it may concern:
In the past, several times, I have asked Vilma (manager of Villas oh [sic] Hialeah) verbally, not to allow the workers hired by her to put their trucks and noisy machines to cut trees, near or in front of our apartment, for the inconvenience that it causes to my disabled son.
Last time I did it in writing on September 2018. [*110] 
Today they are using these machines again, and although they are not in front of our apartment, we can hear the noise they make, because today these machines are located at more less at 20 meters of my apartment, but in other position in the back of our apartment, which cause the same effect. If they keep these machines in those near positions, with respect to our apartment, their strident noises will not allow my son to sleep or be calm as he need, since he takes medications to be calm and rest.
So I'm asking to try this as a "reasonable accommodation request for my disabled son", and relocate these machines farther from our apartment.
Thanks. Carlos Alonso
(App'x at 555.) As stated in Vilma's sworn Declaration: "Again he made no mention [] of any condition that affected his son differently than any other resident." (Vilma Dexl. ¶ 29 (App'x at 10).)
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that there is no record evidence that Defendants knew that Angie suffered from a disability that caused audio sensitivity and/or required "sleep and rest," (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 166), or that moving noisy equipment far from Apartment 1301 was necessary to afford Angie an "equal" opportunity to enjoy Apartment [*111]  1301.
The Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants were required to engage Plaintiffs in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable accommodation was necessary. "[I]f a landlord is skeptical of a tenant's alleged disability or the landlord's ability to provide an accommodation, it is incumbent upon the landlord to request documentation or open a dialogue." Hialeah Hous. Auth., 418 F. App'x at 875 (quoting Jankowski Lee, 91 F.3d at 895). See also Bhogaita, 765 F.3d at 1287. However, the landlord's duty arises only when the landlord has notice of the tenant's alleged disability and the necessity of the requested accommodation. Hialeah Hous. Auth., 418 F. App'x at 875. Here, there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants had notice of a disability that caused audio sensitivity or required sleep during the day. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could not find that Defendants violated the FHA by denying Plaintiffs' request to remove noisy equipment far from Plaintiffs' apartment, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Five. See Hawn v. Shoreline Towers Phase I Condo. Ass'n, Inc., 347 F. App'x 464, 468 (11th Cir. 2009) (affirming summary judgment for the defendant on the FHA failure to accommodate claim because the plaintiff had failed to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the defendant's knowledge [*112]  of the plaintiff's disability and the necessity of the requested accommodation).

e. Count Nine
In Count Nine, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA where, "[a]fter many events that [are] detailed in other portions of the [Second] Amended Complaint," Defendants threatened a $150.00 fine if tape was not removed from Plaintiffs' windows, issued a "SEVEN DAY NOTICE TO CURE," issued a Notice of Termination of Plaintiffs' month-to-month tenancy, and finally issued an eviction notice. (Id. ¶¶ 187-207.)
Defendants note that each of these events occurred before Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint, (Mot. at 17 (citing Rafiq v. Lopez, CIVIL ACTION NO. H-15-2210, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12038 (S.D. Tex. Jan. 3, 2017))), and Defendants lacked knowledge that Plaintiffs intended to file a charge of housing discrimination, (id. (citing Martin v. Fin. Asset Mgmt. Sys., 959 F.3d 1048 (11th Cir. 2020); Vales v. Miami-Dade College, 463 F. App'x 843 (11th Cir. 2013)). As such, they appear to argue that Plaintiffs cannot rely on the filing of the second HUD Complaint as the "protected activity" that triggered the alleged retaliation.33 (See id.) They further argue that the only "protected activity" Plaintiffs engaged in before Defendants threatened the fine, issued the Notice to Cure, and issued a Notice of Termination was their September 18, 2017 request [*113]  to keep tape on their glass doors and windows. (Mot. at 17.) In this regard, Defendants argue that "guising a landlord-tenant dispute as a 'reasonable accommodation' request does not turn it into 'protected activity' under the FHA." (Id. (citing Solomon v. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Kitchen v. Phipps Houses Grp. of Cos., 380 F. App'x 99 (2d Cir. 2010)).) They further argue that Plaintiffs could not have held an objective good faith belief that waiver of a fine and being the only residents allowed to keep tape on their windows was related to Angie's handicaps and necessary for Angie's use and enjoyment of Apartment 1301. (Id. at 17-18 (citing Roman v. Jefferson, 495 F. App'x 804 (9th Cir. 2012)).) They further argue that the September 18, 2017 request "lacked even subjective good faith" in that the letter does not assert disparate treatment or that the request was related to Angie's handicaps. (Id. at 18 (citing Kendrick v. Greenburgh Hous. Auth., No. 07-CV-5859 (CS), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29866 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2011)).) Rather, the relief was justified as necessary to protect the safety of all the Plaintiffs, which reflects that it is an issue of habitability and a desire not to be fined, and not protected activity and discriminatory intent. (Id. (citing Reule v. Sherwood Valley 1 Council of Co-Owners, Inc., 235 F. App'x 227 (5th Cir. 2000)).) They further argue that the $150 fine notice was not issued for a discriminatory or retaliatory purpose, as it was applicable to all tenants who did not remove tape from their glass doors [*114]  and windows and was issued "before Plaintiffs engaged in any act that might constitute 'protected activity.'" (Id.)
Plaintiffs argue that prior to Hurricane Irma's landfall, Vilma did not provide tenants notice that they were not permitted to put tape on the glass doors and windows. (Resp. at 21.) They further argue that Vilma's notice requiring tenants to remove tape from glass doors and windows was "unlawful" because Section 50-30 of the City of Hialeah Code permitted them to use tape during an emergency. (Id. at 21-22.) Plaintiffs further argue that they had a good faith belief that by taping their doors and windows and requesting to keep the tape on the doors and windows they were engaging in protected activity under the FHA "to ameliorate a bad effect on Angie due to his physical disability . . . ." (Id. at 22.) They argue that Carlos and Fe taped the glass doors and windows "to protect Angie who is bedridden and could not move from his bedroom by himself if an object crashed through the glass door located between Angie's bedroom and the balcony of Plaintiffs' apartment." (Id. at 23.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not [*115]  established that taping windows is an "approved protection device" under the Florida Fire Prevention Code and City of Hialeah Code Section 50-30 "because they neither provided the Court with a certified copy of that code section nor reference the Fire Prevention Code provision that supports their claim." (Reply at 12.) They further argue that Plaintiffs "cannot establish they held a good faith belief that requesting not to be fined was a reasonable accommodation" because, inter alia, "City of Hialeah Code Section 50-30 was not even enacted until 2019 - two years after Hurricane Irma." (Id. (citing certified copy of City of Hialeah Ordinance No. 2019-056, City of Hialeah Code Section 50-30 (D.E. 515 at 202-04)).) They further argue that "the Response does not rebut Defendants' point that not being fined has no ameliorative effect on ANGIE's handicaps." (Id.)
The FHA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by" the FHA. [*116]  42 U.S.C. § 3617. "'To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant subjected him to an adverse action; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.'" Philippeaux, 598 F. App'x at 644 (quoting Walker, 272 F.3d at 1128). "'A plaintiff engages in statutorily protected activity when he or she protests . . . conduct which is actually lawful, so long as he or she demonstrates a good faith, reasonable belief that the [conduct engaged in] was . . . unlawful[.]'" Id. (quoting Harper v. Blockbuster Entm't Corp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1388 (11th Cir. 1998)). "A plaintiff's belief that the conduct was unlawful must be objectively reasonable." Id. (citing Harper, 139 F.3d at 1388).
The Court finds that a reasonable jury could not find that Plaintiffs engaged in a protected activity. To begin with, the Court finds that the only "protected activities" that could form the basis of Plaintiffs' claim in Count Nine is (1) placing tape on their window before Hurricane Irma and (2) their post-Hurricane Irma, September 18, 2017 request for permission to keep tape on their glass doors and windows through the end of hurricane season without being fined, as there is no evidence of any causal link between any other possible protected activity and the alleged [*117]  adverse actions.34
Next, the Court finds that there is no record evidence demonstrating Plaintiffs had a subjective belief that Defendants' conduct was unlawful—much less an objectively reasonable one. As to the subjective prong, Plaintiffs second HUD Complaint—filed just ten days later on September 27, 2017—says nothing about Defendants' refusal to permit Plaintiffs to keep tape on their windows, the Notice threatening a $150 fine, or the Seven Day Notice to Cure. (See App'x at 578.) As to the objective prong, the Court has found no legal authority that can reasonably be believed to prohibit a landlord from prohibiting a tenant from keeping tape on their glass doors and windows. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could not conclude that Plaintiffs had an objectively reasonable, good faith belief that the conduct they were protesting was unlawful. Dixon v. The Hallmark Cos., Inc., 627 F.3d 849, 857 (11th Cir. 2010) (finding, in a Title VII retaliation case, that although the plaintiffs presented evidence that they subjectively believed that the defendant's policy against displaying religious artwork in the workplace was unlawful, their subjective belief was not objectively reasonable because there was "no statutory or case law that can reasonably be believed [*118]  to prohibit a private employer from keeping its own workplace free of religious references").
The Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that they believed they were engaging in protected activity pursuant to City of Hialeah Code Section 50-30, as that law was not enacted until August 13, 2019—two years after Hurricane Irma. (See City of Hialeah Ordinance No. 2019-056, City of Hialeah Code Section 50-30 (D.E. 515 at 202-04).)
Because Plaintiffs failed to establish a prima face case of retaliation under the FHA, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Nine.

f. Count Ten
In Count Ten, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA where, in retaliation for requesting reasonable accommodations and modifications, the company that controlled VOH's parking areas, OnCall Parking (or "On Call Patrol"), "used intimidation tactics against Plaintiffs, causing fear, loss of sleep and affecting Angie and his family." (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 210.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege:
95. From January 2018 to March 2018, a company, called "On Call Patrol" that controlled parking areas for Defendants, used intimidation tactics against Plaintiffs, sending unwanted messages [*119]  by email and cell phone to Carlos, under the assumption that Carlos was illegally parking his car in "Villas."
96. These actions made Plaintiffs nervous and scared because one of the threats was that their only owned car could be towed from "Villas." In addition, these tactics caused Angie to wake up repeatedly, due to the text messages that were made when he was asleep, thus affecting Angie's sleep pattern and his rest. Angie's parents were affected too, because they had to attend and comfort Angie when he was awakened by these tactics. In addition, Carlos and Fé could not sleep well at night for the fear that their car could be unfairly towed, since "On Call Patrol" used to tow the cars overnight or at dawn.
(Id. ¶¶ 95-96.) Plaintiffs allege that OnCall Parking threatened to tow Alonso's minivan because he was without a parking permit. (Id. ¶ 211.) They allege that "[t]his activity was directed at Plaintiffs, including Mr. Alonso and his wife, because, among other things, they requested reasonable accommodations and modifications, and initiated a HUD investigation." (Id. ¶ 212.)
Defendants argue that Count Ten fails as a matter of law for three reasons. First, "the 3-month gap between [*120]  the 2nd HUD charge and the alleged adverse action destroys any inference of a causal connection between the events." (Mot. at 19-20 (citing Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006)).) Second, "Plaintiffs' proof of retaliatory intent is based on conclusory statements and sheer speculation." (Id. at 20.) Third, Defendants have established a nonretaliatory legitimate reason for the 5 text messages sent by OnCall Parking during the time period stated in ¶ 210." (Id.) They argue that each text message related to an expired parking permit, (id. (citing emails from OnCall Parking (App'x at 698))), and was generated by OnCall Parking's automated electronic notification system, (id. (citing Guadalupe Decl. ¶ 6 (App'x at 80))). They further argue that OnCall Parking had no access to VOH's tenant files and had no knowledge of Plaintiffs' requests for accommodations, the second HUD Complaint, or any other protected activity. (Id.) They further argue that none of the messages contained a threat of towing. (Id. (citing emails from OnCall Parking (App'x at 698)).)
In their Response, Plaintiffs refer the Court to Point #132 of Alonso's Affidavit, and Page 15 of their Statement of Material Facts, and assert, ipse dixit, that "[t]he evidence [*121]  suggest [sic] the inference that Defendants are no [sic] entitled to summary judgment in Counts IX, X, XI and XII." (Resp. at 25.) Point #132 of Alonso's Affidavit cites to File #57 of Plaintiffs' USB drive. File #57 of Plaintiffs' USB drive appears to contain videos and photos of text messages and emails Alonso received from OnCall Parking stating that Alonso's parking decal was expired.35 Alonso's Affidavit states that he could not renew his parking sticker because he was subject to an eviction notice. (Alonso Aff. ¶ 132(a).) Alonso's Affidavit states that he never received these texts and emails "before defendants filed the Eviction Lawsuit against us[.]" (Id. ¶ 132.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have provided no evidence supporting the allegation that OnCall Parking sent the text messages and emails in retaliation for Plaintiffs' filing a HUD complaint. (D.E. 514 at 14.) They argue that the Response "does not rebut Defendants' argument that when Plaintiffs signed up for OnCall messaging they consented to receive the text messages and email." (Id.)
The FHA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise [*122]  or enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by" the FHA. 42 U.S.C. § 3617. "'To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant subjected him to an adverse action; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.'" Philippeaux v. Apt. Inv. Mgmt. Co., 598 F. App'x 640, 644 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Walker v. City of Lakewood, 272 F.3d 1114, 1128 (9th Cir. 2001)).
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Count Ten. To begin with, the admitted facts establish that Alonso consented to receiving the electronic notifications from OnCall Parking. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 92.)
Regardless, assuming without deciding that OnCall Parking's emails and text messages can be (1) considered "adverse actions" and (2) imputed to Defendants, Plaintiffs cannot establish that Defendants' adverse actions were "on account of" Plaintiffs' filing a Complaint with HUD or requests for reasonable accommodations and modifications. See Fisher v. SP One, Ltd., 559 F. App'x 873, 877-78 (11th Cir. 2014). The admitted facts establish that Plaintiffs made various requests for accommodations and modifications on February 3, 2013 (reserved handicapped parking [*123]  space), (Defs.' Facts ¶ 28); August 26 and 29, 2017 (bathroom modification), (id. ¶¶ 47-4836 ); August 20, 2017 (refinish bathtub with nontoxic paint), (id. ¶ 54); September 18, 2017 (tape on glass doors and windows), (id. ¶ 104), and then not again until September 2018, (id. ¶ 65). Plaintiffs also assert that they made reasonable accommodation requests on March 29, 2017 and April 7, 2017. (See Pls.' Resp. Facts ¶ 28; Alonso Aff. ¶¶ 29-34, 39.) Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint on September 27, 2017. (App'x at 574.)
OnCall Parking began sending Plaintiffs automated texts and emails beginning January 31, 2018—more than four months after Plaintiffs' most recent request for an accommodation and more than four months after Plaintiffs filed the second HUD Complaint. (App'x at 698-704.) There is no other evidence of retaliatory motive in the record. Without any other evidence of retaliatory motive, a four-month delay between the alleged protected activity and the alleged adverse action is too long to establish a causal connection. Drago, 453 F.3d at 1308 ("We have previously held that, in the absence of any other evidence of causation, a three and one-half month proximity between a protected [*124]  activity and an adverse employment action is insufficient to create a jury issue on causation.") (citing Wascura v. City of S. Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir. 2001)); Fisher, 559 F. App'x at 877-78 ("Without any other evidence of a retaliatory motive in the record, the three-month delay between Fisher's [HUD] complaint and the alleged adverse action was too long to establish a causal connection under our precedent.") (citing Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that a three-month period between the protected conduct and the adverse action was not sufficient to allow a reasonable inference of causality in an Americans with Disabilities Act retaliation suit); Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) ("A three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough."); Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (noting that temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action in Title VII retaliation suits must be "very close" in order to be sufficient evidence of causality)).
However, even if Plaintiffs could establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Defendants have presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their actions, and Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the actions were pretext for a discriminatory motive. See Philippeaux, 598 F. App'x at 644 (citing Walker, 272 F.3d at 1128 for the principle that Title VII's burden-shifting framework applies to retaliation claims under [*125]  the FHA). Specifically, Defendants assert that the emails and text messages were generated by OnCall parking's automated electronic notification system as a result of Alonso's expired parking permit. (Mot. at 20 (citing emails from OnCall Parking (App'x at 698); Guadalupe Decl. ¶ 6 (App'x at 80)).) Defendants' Appendix contains five emails from OnCall Parking to Alonso during the period alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. (App'x at 698-704.) Three of the emails were sent on January 31, 2018: one indicated that OnCall parking had issued a "violation warning" for Alonso's minivan because his parking decal had expired, (id. at 698); one indicated that VOH had issued a "do not tow" request for Alonso's minivan, (id. at 699); and one indicated that his parking pass had been extended for 90 days, (id. at 700). On March 12, 2018 and March 19, 2018, OnCall Parking emailed Alonso indicating that VOH issued a "do not tow" request for his minivan. (Id. at 703-04.) Plaintiffs have also produced an additional six emails (dated February 11, 12, 18, and 26, and March 2 and 5, 2018, respectively), and five text messages (dated January 31, 2018, February 11, 18, and 26, and March 2, 2018, respectively), [*126]  all of which indicate that Plaintiff had an expired parking decal. (Pls.' USB File #57.) There is no evidence that Defendants' legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the emails and text messages was pretext for a discriminatory motive. Consequently, a reasonable jury could not conclude that the emails and texts were sent for a discriminatory reason, and for this additional reason Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Ten. See Echemendia v. Gene B. Glick Mgmt. Corp., No. 1:05-CV-53, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20118, 2007 WL 869196, at *9-10 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 20, 2007) (granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant on FHA claims because the plaintiff failed to rebut the defendants' legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the asserted actions).

g. Count Eleven
In Count Eleven, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA by instituting eviction proceedings in retaliation for filing a complaint with HUD. (Id. ¶¶ 217-27.) The Second Amended Complaint notes that the Miami-Dade Circuit Court found that Defendants had committed a retaliatory eviction under Florida law, and alleges that the same conduct must be considered retaliatory under 42 U.S.C. § 3617. (Id. ¶¶ 223, 225.)
Defendants initially argue that the eviction proceeding was not a new adverse action, [*127]  "but the end point of a continuum that started before Plaintiffs filed their 2nd HUD Charge: the 9/26/17 notice of termination and its revision, the 10/4/17 letter extending their moveout date, notified Plaintiffs that their failure to vacate by a date certain would result in the filing of an eviction proceeding." (Mot. at 20.) They argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish a causal connection because the process began before Plaintiffs filed the second HUD Compliant. (Id.) They further argue that "the entire factual predicate for Count XI -- a final judgment in their favor in the Eviction Proceeding -- was gutted when Defendants won the Appeal." (Id. (citing Appellate Division Opinion (App'x at 293)).) They argue that
The opinion of the Appellate Division, Miami Dade Circuit Court found that the final judgment of the County Court was based on an erroneous application of the law and was the product of an abuse of discretion because 245 C and C, LLC had proven good cause to seek a writ of possession in the Eviction Proceeding. This, in turn, eviscerates Plaintiffs' claim in Count XII that Appeal was filed for a retaliatory purpose under the FHA. Ward v. Wal-mart,140 F. Supp 2d. 1220, 1231 (D.N.M. 2001).
(Id. at 20-21.) Defendants argue that the [*128]  same evidence that supported Defendants' decision to non-renew Plaintiffs' lease in the eviction proceedings now suffices here to establish Defendants' defense of legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the alleged adverse action—specifically, that Plaintiffs violated the terms of their lease and Good Conduct Addendum. (Id.) Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot show that Defendants' asserted reasons are pretext for discrimination. (Id. at 21-22.)
Plaintiffs wholly fail to substantively respond to Defendants' argument as to Count Eleven. They merely assert, ispe dixit, that "Defendants are no [sic] entitled to summary judgment in Counts IX, X, XI & XII." (Resp. at 25.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' failure to respond constitutes an abandonment of any arguments that could have been raised in opposition. (D.E. 514 at 15 (citing Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir. 2001)).)
The FHA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected by" the FHA. [*129]  42 U.S.C. § 3617. "'To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) the defendant subjected him to an adverse action; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action.'" Philippeaux, 598 F. App'x at 644 (quoting Walker, 272 F.3d at 1128).
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Eleven because Plaintiffs are unable to establish a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory action. The admitted facts and record evidence establish that Defendants issued the Notice of Termination of Month-to-Month Tenancy on September 26, 2017—the day before Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint. (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 107-09; see also Notice of Termination (App'x at 488); Vilma Decl. ¶ 47 (App'x at 15).) The Notice of Termination required Plaintiffs to vacate the premises by October 31, 2017, (App'x at 488), but that date was later extended to January 31, 2019 as a concession to HUD so that it could complete its investigation, (Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶¶ 13-14 (App'x at 41); see also App'x at 607-08). The HUD investigator told Defendants' attorney, Mr. Lowenhaupt, that if Plaintiffs "did not move out by January 31, [*130]  2018, [Defendants] were free to commence an eviction action." (Defs.' Facts ¶ 111; Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 13 (App'x at 41).) On December 26, 2017, HUD issued findings of no probable cause. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 116; Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 16.) Plaintiffs did not move out of Apartment 1301 on January 31, 2018 at the end of the agreed-upon lease extension with HUD. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 118; Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶ 17.) As a result, Plaintiffs became holdover tenants under Chapter 83, Florida Statutes,37 and Defendants filed suit to obtain possession of Apartment 1301 on February 1, 2018. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 118; Lowenhaupt Decl. ¶¶ 17-18.)
There is no evidence that Defendants filed the eviction action "on account of" Plaintiffs filing the second HUD Complaint. 42 U.S.C. § 3617.
The filing of the eviction proceedings in Miami-Dade County Court cannot be viewed in isolation—it was simply the final step in the eviction process that began on September 26, 2017 when Defendants issued the Notice of Termination of Month-to-Month Tenancy and ordered Plaintiffs to vacate the premises. Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint on September 27, 2017—the day after the eviction process began. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 109.) Because Defendants began the [*131]  eviction process before Plaintiffs filed their second HUD Complaint, Plaintiffs cannot establish a causal connection between the alleged retaliatory action and the protected activity. See Manley v. DeKalb Cnty., Ga., 587 F. App'x 507, 513 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding, in a Title VII retaliation case, that the plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection because the alleged retaliatory acts preceded the protected activities). Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Count Eleven.

h. Count Twelve
In Count Twelve, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA by appealing the state court's judgment of retaliatory eviction. (Id. ¶¶ 228-38.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have "no legitimate argument that the lower court" erred. (Id. ¶ 232.) They argue that "the appeal is frivolous and an abuse of process, being used as a legal tactic to better position 245 C&C, LLC in this action." (Id. ¶ 235 (emphasis in original).)
Defendants argue that the fact that the Appellate Division of the Miami Dade Circuit Court found that the final judgment of the County Court was based on an erroneous application of the law and was the product of an abuse of discretion because 245 C and C, [*132]  LLC had proven good cause to seek a writ of possession in the Eviction Proceeding "eviscerates Plaintiffs' claim in Count XII that Appeal was filed for a retaliatory purpose under the FHA." (Mot. at 20-21.)
Plaintiffs wholly fail to substantively respond to Defendants' argument as to Count Twelve. They merely assert, ispe dixit, that "Defendants are no [sic] entitled to summary judgment in Counts IX, X, XI & XII." (Resp. at 25.)
In their Reply, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' failure to respond constitutes an abandonment of any arguments that could have been raised in opposition. (D.E. 514 at 15 (citing Wilkerson, 270 F.3d at 1322).)
The Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Twelve because the the Appellate Division of the Miami-Dade Circuit Court found that the lower court did err, reversed the lower court's judgment, and remanded with directions to enter judgment for 245 C&C LLC; it also granted Defendants' Motion for appellate attorneys' fees and costs. (See App'x at 293-316.) As such, a reasonable jury could not find that the appeal was frivolous and/or an abuse of process. See Treat v. Florida ex rel. Mitton, 121 Fla. 509, 163 So. 883 (Fla. 1935) ("A frivolous appeal is not merely one that is likely to be unsuccessful. It is one that is so [*133]  readily recognizable as devoid of merit on the face of the record that there is little, if any, prospect whatsoever that it can ever succeed. It must be one so clearly untenable, or the insufficiency of which is so manifest on a bare inspection of the record and assignments of error, that its character may be determined without argument or research.") (internal citation omitted); Bothmann v. Harrington, 458 So. 2d 1163, 1169 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) ("There is no abuse of process . . . when the process is used to accomplish the result for which it was created, regardless of an incidental or concurrent motive of spite or ulterior purpose. In other words, the usual case of abuse of process involves some form of extortion."). And in any event, there is no evidence that Defendants appealed the Miami-Dade County Court's judgment to coerce, intimidate, or retaliate against Plaintiffs.
Because the premise of Count Twelve is demonstrably false, a reasonable jury could not find that Defendants engaged in coercion, intimidation, and retaliation in violation of the FHA by appealing the state court's judgment of retaliatory eviction.

i. Count Fourteen
In Count Fourteen, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and violated [*134]  various provisions of Chapter 83, Florida Statutes. (Id. ¶¶ 249-57.) Specifically, they allege that
Defendants engaged in a course of conduct meant to interfere with Plaintiffs' quiet enjoyment of its apartment through conduct including but not limited to, allowing the Defendants' maintenance staff to enter Plaintiffs' apartment without a twelve[]hour notification (¶ 82);38 repeatedly attempting to fumigate inside Plaintiffs' apartment despite constant warnings that Angie was allergic to the chemicals and harassment to Plaintiffs' family (¶ 83);39 permitting other tenants to have their children making noises and its dogs barking incessantly without any reprimand (¶ 84);40 and failing to maintain the laundry rooms in "Villas," allowing the washers and dryers made unbearable noises for the human ear that affected the sleep's pattern of Plaintiffs' family (¶ 85).41
(Id. ¶ 254.) They further argue that "Defendants' employees who entered Plaintiffs' apartment without prior notice and harassed Plaintiff and his family violated the [Fla. Stat.] § 83.53(3)." (Id. ¶ 255 (citing Second Am. Compl. ¶ 82).42 )43 Although not specifically mentioned in Count Fourteen, Alonso testified during his deposition that Count Fourteen is also based on Defendants cutting [*135]  off the water to the 2500 Building on several occasions.44 (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 248:24 - 249:2.)
Defendants argue that many of these claims are waived by express covenants contained in Plaintiffs' lease agreements and Good Conduct Addendum, (Mot. at 22-23), while others are barred by the relevant statutes of limitations, (id. at 23). They further argue that other claims are refuted by the record evidence. (Id. at 23-24.) They further argue that "[a]ll of the occurrences about which Plaintiffs complain are common inconveniences or annoyances associated with apartment living[;]" Vilma addressed many of the issues through notices to cure, calling vendors, or fulfilling maintenance orders; other issues were outside Vilma's control; and Plaintiffs never provided written notice to Defendants under Section 83.56(1), Florida Statutes, or demanded reduced rent pursuant to Section 83.56(1)(b), to account for these conditions. (Id. at 24.) They further argue that these issues are not actionable because they did not substantially interfere with Plaintiffs' right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy. (Id. (citing Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates, 125 Cal. App. 4th 578, 22 Cal. Rptr. 3d 832 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005)).) In this regard, they argue that Plaintiffs never considered moving elsewhere, [*136]  chose to renew their lease year after year (and then month after month) despite the purported nuisances, and therefore waived their rights to claim breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. (Id. at 24-25 (citing Kaplan v. McCabe, 532 So. 2d 1354 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988); Farina v. Meridian Grp., Inc., 218 Wis. 2d 166, 578 N.W.2d 210, 1998 Wisc. App. LEXIS 339 (Wisc. Ct. App. 1998)).)
Plaintiffs argue that "competent substantial and verifiable evidence provided by Plaintiffs[] shows that Defendants violated the Plaintiffs' right to the quiet enjoyment of the premises several times, in different forms, causing a lot of discomfort and damage to Plaintiffs." (Resp. at 25 (citing Alonso Aff. points #76-90).)45
In their Reply, Defendants argue that the facts Plaintiffs allege are "are vague as to when the purported incidents occurred and because of this they cannot prove whether the events are within or barred by the Statute of Limitations." (D.E. 514 at 15.) They further argue that plaintiffs "fail to present any legal argument why this evidence is sufficient to state a claim for breach of the Lease or of common law. And, simply denying that the GCA did not 'waive' the claims also does not save their claim from entry of summary judgment." (Id.)
"Absent any inconsistent express covenants to the contrary, every lease carries an implied covenant [*137]  of peaceable and quiet enjoyment." McClosky v. Martin, 56 So. 2d 916, 918 (Fla. 1951) (citing Hankins v. Smith, 103 Fla. 892, 138 So. 494, 496 (1931)); see also Stinson, Lyons, Gerlin & Bustamante, P.A. v. Brickell Bldg. 1 Holding Co., Inc., 923 F.2d 810, 813-14 (11th Cir. 1991). Where express lease provisions are inconsistent with the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, a district court may give effect to the express covenants. Stinson, 923 F.2d at 815 (citing Hankins, 138 So. at 496).
There is little authority from Florida courts defining or discussing what constitutes a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. See generally 34 Fla. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant § 91 (2021). However, other states recognize that the covenant protects "the lessee from any act or omission by the lessor which interferes with the lessee's right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the lease." Avalon Pac.-Santa Ana, L.P. v. HD Supply Repair & Remodel, LLC, 192 Cal. App. 4th 1183, 1191, 122 Cal. Rptr. 3d 417 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011) (citation omitted). See also Pollock v. Morelli, 245 Pa. Super. 388, 393, 369 A.2d 458 (Pa. 1976) (observing that in Pennsylvania, the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached "where the landlord so substantially altered some essential features of the premises as to render the property unsuitable for the purpose for which it was leased"); W. Stock Ctr., Inc. v. Sevit, Inc., 195 Colo. 372, 578 P.2d 1045, 1051 (Col. 1978) ("The covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached by any disturbance of a lessee's possession by his lessor which renders the premises unfit for occupancy for the purposes for which they were leased, or which deprives the lessee of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises, [*138]  causing him to abandon them.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "Minor inconveniences and annoyances are not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. To be actionable, the landlords act or omission must substantially interfere with a tenants right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy." Andrews, 125 Cal. App. 4th at 589 (citations omitted); see also Blue Cros s Ass'n v . 666 N. Lake Shore Dr. Assocs., 100 Ill. App. 3d 647, 427 N.E.2d 270, 273, 56 Ill. Dec. 190 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981) (finding that implied covenant of quiet enjoyment could be breached by private nuisance, defined as "an individual wrong arising from an unreasonable, unwarranted or unlawful use of one" property producing such material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt that the law will presume a consequent damage") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
The admitted facts and record evidence establish that Plaintiffs one-year lease was renewed from year to year until August 3, 2016, when they were given an option to vacate Apartment 1301 or agree to a month-to-month lease with additional terms via the Good Conduct Addendum as a condition of remaining tenants. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 12 (citing Vilma Decl. ¶ 8 (App'x at 4)).) The Good Conduct Addendum had two purposes: first, to establish a quid [*139]  pro quo waiver of certain rights in exchange for the privilege to remain tenants at VOH; second, to place them on notice that any violation of the month-to-month lease or Good Conduct Addendum could result in immediate termination of their lease. (Id. (citing Vilma Decl. ¶ 8).) Alonso and Morejon took a month to make the decision. (Id.) On October 28, 2016, they decided to remain VOH residents and signed the month-to-month lease and the Good Conduct Addendum. (Id. (citing Vilma Decl. ¶¶ 8-9; Good Conduct Addendum (App'x at 461)).) It appears that all of the issues contained in Count Fourteen occurred in 2017—after Plaintiffs entered the month-to-month lease and Good Conduct Addendum. (See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 102-18.)

1. Maintenance workers and fumigation
To the extent that Count Fourteen alleges that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by "allowing the Defendants' maintenance staff to enter Plaintiffs' apartment without a twelve[]hour notification[,]" (id.), and "repeatedly attempting to fumigate inside Plaintiffs' apartment despite constant warnings that Angie was allergic to the chemicals and harassment to Plaintiffs' family[,]" (id.), the Court finds that [*140]  the claim is waived by the lease. Paragraph 12 of Plaintiffs' Lease Agreement provides, in relevant part, that "Landlord shall have the right to enter the Apartment at any reasonable time, without notice for inspection, maintenance and pest control." (App'x at 450.) Consequently, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on these claims.46 (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 254.)
To the extent that Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' maintenance workers "harassed Plaintiffs by (1) unexpectedly knocking loudly on the door of Plaintiffs' apartment and (2) sometimes used master keys to enter the apartment when Angie was sleeping and/or Fé and her daughters were not dressed for Defendants' workers to enter[,]" (D.E. 92 ¶ 106), the Court finds that the claim is waived by the Good Conduct Addendum. Paragraph 11 of the Good Conduct [*141]  Addendum states that Plaintiffs "acknowledge that when they place a service request, maintenance will come to their unit, knock on their door three times, and if there is no answer they will enter to do the service." (App'x at 461.) Thus, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
To the extent that Count Fourteen is premised upon "Defendants' employees who entered Plaintiffs' apartment without prior notice and harassed Plaintiff and his family[,]" (id. ¶ 255), the only evidence to which Plaintiffs cite is provided by Alonso's Affidavit. (Resp. at 25.) Alonso vaguely asserts that
a) - During 2016 and 2017, a maintenance worker called José, during two or three different days, came alone to our apartment and entered in it using his master keys without knocking the door three times and without a reasonable and timely notice, even knowing that my wife Fé mostly was in our apartment taking care of Angie.
b) - In two different occasions, José entered when my daughters were in the apartment, and my younger daughter Katy was playing or watching TV alone in the living room. Katy was able to see when José already was inside the apartment and when I went out [*142]  of my bedroom and confronted José. See (pages # 188, 189 & 190) at [ECF No. 470], showing the declarations of my daughter Jany about those events.
(Alonso Aff. ¶ 77.) It is unclear whether Jose failed to knock on the two occasions he entered when Katy was playing or watching television. (See id.) However, even assuming Jose did fail to knock on these four or five occasions, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could find that these incidents substantially interfered with a Plaintiffs right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy. Andrews, 125 Cal. App. 4th at 589.

2. Noisy neighbors
To the extent that Count Fourteen alleges that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by "permitting other tenants to have their children making noises and its dogs barking incessantly without any reprimand," (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 254), the Court finds the claim (and the evidence supporting it) constitutes "[m]inor inconveniences and annoyances [that] are not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment." Andrews, 125 Cal. App. 4th at 589.
Under Florida law, where a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is "mainly or exclusively within the knowledge of" the tenant, the tenant must give [*143]  notice of the breach and demand performance. Richards v. Dodge, 150 So. 2d 477, 483 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963). Additionally, Paragraph 10 of the Good Conduct Addendum states that Plaintiffs "acknowledge that there is a certain amount of noise associated with apartment living that will occur on a daily basis. That includes normal walking around in the apartment . . . . Residents shall . . . advise management of any problems and will allow management staff to handle it in an appropriate manner." (App'x at 461.)
The record evidence establishes that Alonso complained twice about children playing in the corridors outside—on August 4, 2017 and December 1, 2016. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 67.) Both complaints were made to the nighttime security guard. (Id.) The Court finds that two instances of children making noise while playing in the apartment corridors are "[m]inor inconveniences and annoyances [that] are not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment." Andrews, 125 Cal. App. 4th at 589. The Court further finds that there is no evidence that the noises made by these children produced "material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt[.]" Blue Cross, 427 N.E. 2d at 273. In fact, Jany Alonso Morejon testified that although she heard kids playing and "screaming" in the corridor two to three times a day [*144]  for a minute or two each time, the noises did not disturb Angie. (Jany Alonso Morejon Dep. Tr. at 58:7 - 59:9, 83:7-13 (App'x at 177-79).) Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Kehl v. Davmar Corp., 195 A.2d 266, 267 (D.C. 1963) (affirming trial court's directed verdict in favor of landlord on plaintiff's claim that that the landlord's failure to control the cotenant's excessive noise resulted in a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment).
The record evidence further establishes that Alonso complained to Vilma about the dogs in Apartment 1401 four times. The first time was on January 7, 2017 when he complained about Mariela Hernandez's dog continuously barking. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 68.) On January 9, 2017, Vilma issued a Seven Day Notice to Cure to Mariela Hernandez based on Alonso's complaint about her "dog making noise constantly which disturbs them." (App'x at 476.)
The second complaint occurred on May 23, 2017 when Alonso complained that either a dog or child was making noise and disturbing him. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 68.) On May 24, 2017, Vilma issued another Notice of Violation and Seven Day Notice to Cure to Mariela Hernandez based on Plaintiffs' complaint "that your Kids or your dog are making [*145]  noise disturbing other Residents." (App'x at 477.)
Alonso's third and fourth complaints about Mariela Hernandez's dog barking were on January 29, 2020 and January 30, 2020, respectively, as Mariela and her family were packing and moving from their apartment after early terminating their lease due to harassment by Alonso and Morejon. (Vilma Decl. ¶ 68.) These complaints occurred after Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint and therefore cannot form the basis for Count Fourteen.
It appears that Alonso also complained about noise emanating from Apartment 1401 to the nighttime security guard on two occasions. (See Hernandez Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17.) The security guard responded by visiting Apartment 1401 regarding the noise each time. (Id.)
There is no evidence that Defendants ignored any of Plaintiffs complaints regarding the noise caused by the tenants of Apartment 1401 (or others). Therefore, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could not conclude that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by permitting other tenants to have their children making noises and their dogs barking incessantly without any reprimand. The Court further finds that there is no evidence that [*146]  the noises made by the dog and children produced "material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt" such that it would be an actionable breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Blue Cross, 427 N.E. 2d at 273. For these reasons, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on these claims. See Kehl, 195 A.2d at 267.

3. Laundry facilities
To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the laundry rooms and "allowing the washers and dryers made unbearable noises for the human ear that affected the sleep's pattern of Plaintiffs' family," (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 254), the Court finds that the claim is unsupported by record evidence. Although Plaintiffs provide video evidence of the "noisy" laundry machines, the videos taken from inside the apartment establish that the machines are barely audible inside Plaintiffs' apartment. (See Pls.' USB File #22.) As such, no reasonable jury could find that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by and "allowing the washers and dryers made unbearable noises for the human ear that affected the sleep's pattern of Plaintiffs' family." (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 254.)
Regardless, the admitted facts establish [*147]  that there is no provision in the lease that obligates Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with a laundry room and working laundry room equipment. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 134.) Neither CFH Group LLC nor 245 C&C LLC own the laundry equipment. (Id. ¶ 62.) In mid-February 2017, Alonso contacted VOH's management office to report that the laundry equipment in the laundry room near their apartment was making loud noises. (Id.) "This was the first and only time a complaint was made about noise coming from the third-floor laundry room." (Id.) VOH called the company that owns the laundry equipment and informed them of the problem. (Id.) Alonso was also advised that he could call the company and VOH's assistant manager gave him its telephone number. (Id.) The company that owned the equipment came and replaced the equipment about two weeks later. (Id.)
Although a "landlord's failure to fulfill an obligation to repair or to replace an essential structure or to provide a necessary service [c]an result in a breach of the covenant if the failure substantially affects the tenant's beneficial enjoyment of the premises[,]" Petroleum Collections Inc. v. Swords, 48 Cal. App. 3d 841, 846, 122 Cal. Rptr. 114 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975), the admitted facts and record evidence establish that in this case, the landlord did not [*148]  have an obligation to provide, repair, or replace the laundry equipment. Accordingly, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could not find that Defendants breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the laundry rooms and allowing the washers and dryers to make unbearable noises. Cf. Macke Co. v. Hous. Mgmt. Co., 38 Md. App. 425, 381 A.2d 313, 316 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1978) (affirming trial court's directed verdict in favor of landlord on the plaintiffs' claim that the landlord negligently maintained the laundry room of their apartment building where the evidence established that the landlord leased the laundry room to a third party and there was no evidence that the landlord retained control over the laundry area).

4. Water shut-off
Finally, although not specifically mentioned in Count Fourteen, Alonso testified at his deposition that Count Fourteen was based in part on the fact that Defendants cut the water off to the 2500 Building several times. (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1) at 248:24 - 249:2.) In this regard, the Second Amended Complaint alleges that "[i]n 2017 alone, the Defendants often turned off the water in Plaintiffs' building for periods of three (3) to four (4) hours, sometimes more, without proper warning to them." (D.E. 92 ¶ 120.) [*149]  "This occurred more than thirty (30) times in various weeks and in different days of the week, either in the morning or afternoon, sometimes both." (Id. ¶ 121.) "Even though Carlos requested Vilma and coworkers about the need to be warned before turning the water off as a reasonable accommodation, to allow them to save a suitable amount of water due to Angie's condition, and the hygiene needs of its family, these requests were all ignored." (Id. ¶ 122.) "Vilma refused to notify Carlos or Fé with a simple phone call, claiming that they were no different or better than other tenants. Vilma also affirmed that it would cost a lot of money to put a written notice on each tenant's door because of the cost of paper and ink." (Id. ¶ 123.) "Vilma's refusal to provide such notice caused a discriminatory effect with a disparate impact on Angie and his family." (Id. ¶ 124.) Plaintiffs allege that
Angie suffered various infections with different bacteria by the lack of water, which prevented his parents to clean or bath [sic] Angie when needed. These infections caused damages to Angie, which included fever, high blood pressure, bleeding, loss of sleep, skin irritation, pain, suffering, and medical's [*150]  [sic] expenses, as well as having caused further deterioration of Angie's health. The lack of water also affected Angie in other ways, because it prevented others to cook his food, to brush his teeth, to wash his clothes, to clean his bedroom or bathroom when it was needed.
(Id. ¶ 125.) They further allege that Jany and Katy suffered "because they could not clean their faces, wash their hands, brush their teeth or maintain their personal hygiene when they returned from the school." (Id. ¶ 126.) They further allege that Alonso and Morejon were damaged "because the lack of water prevented them from taking proper care of their children's hygiene as needed. They were unable to prepare their children's food in time. They could not maintain the hygiene of their home nor wash their children's clothes properly, especially Angie's clothes." (Id. ¶ 127.) These paragraphs are incorporated by reference into Count Fourteen. (See id. ¶ 249.)
Defendants argue that the water shut-offs were due to emergencies for which Plaintiffs waived liability under the Lease Agreement and Good Conduct Addendum. (Mot. at 24.)
The admitted facts establish that there is one main water shutoff for the entire 2500 Building. [*151]  (Defs.' Facts ¶ 130.) There are no submeters to individual apartments. (Id.) When there is a leaking pipe or other type of water emergency in the 2500 Building, it is necessary to shut off the water to the entire building to make the repair and prevent damage to the tenant's and Defendants' properties. (Id.) Water emergencies interrupt service to all 103 apartments in the 2500 Building. (Id. ¶ 131.) There is not enough time to notify all 103 tenants that the water must be shut off due to an emergency. (Id.) The repairs are made as quickly as possible so that the water can be turned back on. (Id.) At no time was the water shut off specifically and only to Apartment 1301. (Id. ¶ 132.) When a repair or maintenance is capable of being planned in advance, VOH gives tenants as much advance notice as possible. (Id. ¶ 133; see also Notice of Water Shut Off (App'x at 490).)
The Court finds that this claim is waived by the Lease Agreement and Good Conduct Addendum. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants shut off the water to their apartment in 2017. (Id. ¶ 120.) During his deposition Alonso testified that the water to Plaintiffs' apartment was shut off "more than 35 times from November [*152]  through September - from November 2016 through September of 2019." (Alonso Dep. Tr. (D.E. 462-1 at 226:11-13.) From November 2016 through September 2019, Plaintiffs' lease was subject to the provisions of the Good Conduct Addendum. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 12.)
Paragraph 10 of the Lease Agreement provides that the "Landlord shall furnish, as part of the Lease Agreement, the following utilities only: water, sewer, garbage removal." (App'x at 450.) It further states that "[u]nder no circumstances shall Landlord be responsible to Resident for any interruption in furnishing services." (Id.) In Paragraph 9 of the Good Conduct Addendum, Plaintiffs agree and "acknowledge that they understand that if there is an emergency at the property, it is possible that the water may be turned off temporarily without notification." (App'x at 461.) Because Plaintiffs waived this claim pursuant to the Lease Agreement and Good Conduct Addendum, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment to the extent Count 14 is premised on the water shut-offs.

VII. Conclusion
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:
1. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (D.E. 364) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART consistent with this [*153]  Order;
2. Trial on the surviving counts (Counts One and Two) will be set by separate Order.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida this 17th day of August, 2022.
