REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
TO: THE HONORABLE ROBERT PITMAN
UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Before the Court are Defendant Microsoft Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. No. 21, Plaintiff's Response, Dkt. No. 25, and Microsoft's Reply, Dkt. No. 27. The undersigned submits this Report and Recommendation to the United States District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Rule 1(h) of Appendix C of the Local Court Rules.

I. GENERAL BACKGROUND
This is an employment discrimination case. Plaintiff John Thompson brings this action alleging that Defendant Microsoft Corporation committed several violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12001, et seq. Specifically, Thompson alleges: (1) discrimination; (2) failure to accommodate; (3) retaliation; and (4) hostile work environment. Microsoft now moves for summary judgment on each claim.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW [*2] 
Summary judgment shall be rendered when the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-25, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Washburn v. Harvey, 504 F.3d 505, 508 (5th Cir. 2007). A dispute regarding a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is required to view all inferences drawn from the factual record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio, 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Washburn, 504 F.3d at 508. Further, a court "may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence" in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254-55.
Once the moving party has made an initial showing that there is no evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, the party opposing the motion must come forward with competent summary judgment evidence of the existence of a genuine fact issue. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586. Mere conclusory allegations are not competent summary judgment evidence, and thus are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007). Unsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation are not competent [*3]  summary judgment evidence. Id. The party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his claim. Adams v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Conn., 465 F.3d 156, 164 (5th Cir. 2006). Rule 56 does not impose a duty on the court to "sift through the record in search of evidence" to support the nonmovant's opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Id. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing laws will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed fact issues that are "irrelevant and unnecessary" will not be considered by a court in ruling on a summary judgment motion. Id. If the nonmoving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to its case and on which it will bear the burden of proof at trial, summary judgment must be granted. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.

III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE
Viewing the evidence pursuant to this standard, the relevant facts are as follows. Thompson is a forty-four year old former sales support professional with Autism Spectrum Disorder ("ASD"). Dkt. No. 21 at 1. In November of 2010, Thompson was hired by Microsoft to work as an Architecture Technology Strategist [*4]  ("ATS"). Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 7. Though Thompson initially received positive feedback on his performance, by early 2014 Thompson's supervisors identified his "increasingly downward performance trend since his start date." Dkt No. 21-2 at 15. In a mid-year performance review, a manager specifically noted his "strong concerns" regarding Thompson's "long history of not delivering on his commitments," "lack of communication," and low critical metrics. Id. On September 5, 2014, during a meeting with his supervisor to discuss a negative review, Thompson attributed his performance issues to "symptoms of a cognitive disability" that he had "struggled with for many years." Dkt. No. 21-1 at 9. In light of Thompson's disclosure, the supervisor connected Thompson with the appropriate personnel in Microsoft's human resources and benefits departments. Dkt. No. 21 at 12. After conferring with the benefits personnel, Thompson informed his supervisors he would be taking a Disability Leave of Absence to "build a comprehensive plan to manage [his] disability, so that its effects no longer reduce the value I bring to Microsoft." Dkt. No. 21-2 at 41. Thompson also noted that he and his medical care providers [*5]  felt he should "not return to work until [he] can be fully effective in [his] role." Id.
Upon his return from medical leave, Thompson formally requested accommodations related to his ASD. Dkt. No. 21-2 at 49-51. Thompson's requests were signed by his doctor, who confirmed that Thompson's disability "substantially impacts [his] ability to perform any one or more of the essential functions of [his] job." Id. at 50. Thompson and Microsoft engaged in negotiations and Thompson submitted a revised "draft" of his requests. Id. at 68-73. Although able to meet many of Thompson's requests, Microsoft deemed some of his requested accommodations unreasonable with regard to the ATS position and instead offered Thompson participation in Microsoft's job reassignment program as an alternative accommodation. Dkt. No. 21 at 15-16. Thompson accepted the job reassignment offer. Dkt. No. 21-3 at 51.
Thompson expressed particular interest in a transfer to the position of Enterprise Architect ("EA"), despite the fact that the Microsoft benefits specialist had noted the EA position "seems to have all of the job duties which your physician is advising against." Dkt. No. 21 at 14. Through the job reassignment program, Thompson applied [*6]  for several EA positions and communicated essentially the same accommodation requests to those potential supervisors. Dkt. No. 21 at 17; Dkt No. 21-3 at 60-68. After several hiring managers identified Thompson's "accommodation needs" as "hard to meet given the complexity of [the EA] role, the number of accounts, the travel required, and the support he would need administratively," Thompson ultimately withdrew his formal request for accommodations. Dkt. No. 21-4 at 1-3. In an email to his recruiting contact, Thompson stated, "All discussions of my status as a person with a disability seem to be met with hostility. As a result, please UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES disclose that I have a disability, or that I have requested any accommodations at any time in the past. I no longer request any accommodations whatsoever, and I will endeavor to perform all essential functions of the Enterprise Architecture role without any assistance or accommodation from Microsoft." Dkt. No. 21-4 at 7. Microsoft granted Thompson a thirty day extension of the job reassignment program to allow him to continue to search for a position without the accommodation requests. Id. at 12.
In August of 2015, Thompson applied for an open [*7]  EA position in Austin, Texas through the job reassignment program. Dkt. No. 21-4 at 16. Microsoft contends that "as an accommodation" to Thompson, though not requested by him, Microsoft granted Thompson an abbreviated hiring process for the Austin EA position. Dkt. No. 21 at 18. The hiring manager for the position, Marc Garcia ("Garcia"), testified that Thompson was presented to him as a "forced hire." Dkt. No. 24-5 at 8-9. Garcia testified that a human resources representative for Microsoft asked him if Thompson would be a candidate to be interviewed for the EA position. Id. at 9. Once Garcia responded that Thompson would be a potential candidate, he was informed that Thompson must be given an offer. Id.; Dkt. No. 21-4 at 49. As Thompson had specifically requested that his ASD diagnosis be kept confidential, when he was hired as an EA his new supervisors in Austin were not informed of his disability and Thompson did not ask for any accommodations. Dkt. No. 21-1 at 108. Thompson began as an EA in Austin on September 2, 2015. Dkt. No. 21-4 at 45.
In the EA position, Thompson once again received negative feedback regarding his performance. Dkt. No. 24-5 at 12-19; Dkt. No. 21-4 at 57-59. Due to [*8]  "consistently missing deliverables," and "sub-par and delayed results," Thompson was removed from his first project as an EA. Dkt. No. 21-4 at 57-59, 62-68. In January of 2016, Thompson disclosed his ASD diagnosis to Garcia, who referred him again to Microsoft's benefits specialist and HR department. Dkt. No. 24-5 at 19; Dkt. No. 21-5 at 9, 28. Following the disclosure, Thompson took short-term disability leave and began to work with the benefits department regarding accommodation requests. Id. at 20; Dkt. No. 21-5 at 12-13, 53-55.
Thompson submitted a new formal accommodation request for his EA position on April 2, 2016, seeking many of the same accommodations he had previously requested in his ATS position. Dkt. No. 21-5 at 57-60. These accommodations included: providing a noise-cancelling headset, handheld voice recorder and voice transcription service, specialized software to support time management and organization, a specialized job coach with experience with ASD, training classes or conferences on managing ASD and ADHD in the workplace, and a providing Thompson with a qualified individual to transcribe meeting notes, translate information provided verbally by Thompson into written format [*9]  (including PowerPoint, Word, and email), and to assist him with administrative tasks such as travel booking, time & expense reporting, meeting scheduling, monitoring deadlines and providing reminders Dkt. No. 21-5 at 60. Thompson and Microsoft's benefits specialist engaged in several weeks of back and forth correspondence regarding Thompson's requests and whether Microsoft could make the accommodations for the EA position. Dkt. No. 21-6 at 6-55. During the negotiations, Thompson stated "I'm fully capable of performing 100 percent of the essential functions of my current role, provided the accommodations identified by my physician are granted by Microsoft." Dkt. No. 21-7 at 5.
On July 11, 2016, Microsoft informed Thompson that while it could accommodate most of his requests, ultimately some of his requests "would require fundamental changes to the essential functions of [his] Enterprise Architect job" thus rendering them unreasonable accommodations. Dkt. No. 21-7 at 1. Unable to provide all of Thompson's accommodation requests, Microsoft informed Thompson he would be removed from his EA position and entered into the job reassignment program again. Id. Once informed of Microsoft's decision [*10]  to move Thompson to the job reassignment program, Thompson responded that if Microsoft was "issuing a 'take-it-or-leave-it' ultimatum, then I have no choice but to accept the accommodations Microsoft is willing to provide, and I will make alternate arrangements for any other needs that I may have. Based on the available job opportunities that I can see in the //career tool, I do not believe that a job reassignment effort will produce a satisfactory conclusion for either of us." Id. at 3. Over his objections, Thompson was formally placed on job reassignment on July 18, 2016. Dkt. No. 21-2 at 44. While on job reassignment, Thompson indicated he would not consider any positions outside of the Austin area or that paid a lower salary, and did not submit any applications for open positions. Dkt. No. 21-7 at 27; Dkt. No. 24-4 at 3. Thompson is currently still employed by Microsoft, and has been on longterm disability since March 16, 2017. Dkt. No. 21-2 at 44; Dkt. No. 21-7 at 48-49.

IV. ANALYSIS
Thompson asserts claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodations, discrimination, and hostile work environment.1 Microsoft moves for summary judgment, arguing there is no genuine, material issue of fact [*11]  warranting a trial on any of Thompson's claims.

A. Failure to Accommodate Claim
Thompson alleges Microsoft failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability and failed to participate in the "interactive process" in good faith.2 To establish a prima facie case of ADA Failure to Accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by his employer; and (3) the employer failed to make a reasonable accommodation for such known limitations. Neely v. PSEG Tex., L.P., 735 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 2013). Reasonable accommodations include, but are not limited to, "job restructuring," and "reassignment to a vacant position" and "appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). A "reasonable accommodation" is not necessarily "the employee's preferred accommodation." E.E.O.C. v. Agro Distribution, LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Hedrick v. Western Reserve Care System, 355 F.3d 555, 457 (6th Cir. 2004)). Instead, the accommodation need only "meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated." Id. (quoting 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, App., § 1630.9). The employer has the final say, and is free to "choose the less expensive accommodation or the accommodation that is easier for it to provide." Id. When no reasonable accommodation can be made to [*12]  the plaintiff's prior job, he may be transferred to another position. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); Gonzales v. City of New Braunfels, 176 F.3d 834, 838 (5th Cir. 1999). Employees and employers "should engage in flexible, interactive discussions to determine the appropriate accommodation." Agro, 555 F.3d at 471. "When an employer's unwillingness to engage in a good faith interactive process leads to a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee, the employer violates the ADA." Loulseged v. Akzo Nobel Inc., 178 F.3d 731, 736 (5th Cir. 1999). By the same token, if the process breaks down because of an employee's action, "an employer cannot be found to have violated the ADA." Id.
Thompson's failure to accommodate claim revolves around Microsoft's decision to enter Thompson into the job reassignment program as an alternative accommodation after finding his requested accommodations unreasonable for the EA position. Dkt. No. 25 at 16. According to Thompson, Microsoft was responsible for the breakdown of the interactive process because after finding that not all of Thompson's accommodation requests were reasonable for the EA position, Microsoft did not allow Thompson to continue as an EA with the limited accommodations requests Microsoft had agreed to. Id. at 17. Thompson alleges this refusal demonstrates that Microsoft's participation in the process was "a sham exercise designed [*13]  to appear in good faith." Id. at 18. Thompson further alleges the job reassignment program was not a reasonable accommodation because there were only three or four similar jobs available within 200 miles of his home, and none "were a match" for his skills or experience. Dkt. No. 25 at 18-19.
Microsoft argues that because Thompson and his doctor represented his accommodation requests as necessary for him to perform his job as an EA, Microsoft's decision not to return Thompson to the EA position when Microsoft found some of those requests incompatible with the position's essential duties was reasonable. Dkt. No. 27 at 2. Microsoft also contends that Thompson's argument that he withdrew the accommodation requests which Microsoft was unable to provide precludes Thompson's current claim of failure to accommodate. Id. Further, Microsoft argues that the job reassignment program was a reasonable accommodation due to the incompatibility of Thompson's requested accommodations with the essential job duties of an EA. Dkt. No. 21 at 25. Since Thompson refused to participate in the job reassignment program, Microsoft argues Thompson failed to take advantage of that accommodation and thus caused the breakdown [*14]  in the interactive process. Id.
The record shows a genuine effort on both sides to negotiate accommodations. See, e.g., Dkt. 21-6 at 6, 16, 39; Dkt. No. 21-7 at 5. Ultimately, however, Thompson was unable to perform the essential functions of the EA role even with reasonable accommodations. Thompson himself stated that he was fully capable of performing the EA role, "provided the accommodations identified by my physician are granted," indicating that otherwise, he would be unable to do so. Dkt. No. 21-7 at 5. Despite months of communications and attempts to find a solution, Microsoft found that some of Thompson's requests were not compatible with the essential functions of the EA position. Notably, Thompson does not attempt to argue that any of the denied accommodations were in fact reasonable—instead, Thompson focuses on Microsoft's decision to place Thompson in the job reassignment program rather than allowing him to continue as an EA with only some of his requested accommodations. However, job reassignments or transfers are frequently upheld as reasonable accommodations. Gonzales, 176 F.3d at 838. Given the representations by Thompson and his physician, it was not unreasonable for Microsoft to transfer Thompson [*15]  out of the EA position when it could not grant all of the accommodations he and his doctor said were necessary for him to do that job. Thompson's argument that "he did not wish to enter the job reassignment program," does not make it an unreasonable accommodation. Dkt. No. 25 at 17; see Agro, 555 F.3d at 471. The job reassignment program was a reasonable accommodation and under the ADA Microsoft was entitled to choose which reasonable accommodation to offer. See Jenkins v. Cleco Power, L.L.C., 487 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir. 2007) ("A disabled employee has no right to a promotion, to choose what job to which he will be assigned, or to receive the same compensation as he received previously."). Thompson's failure to take advantage of the reasonable accommodation offered effectively terminated the interactive process and is fatal to his claim for failure to accommodate.
Moreover, Thompson has held disability status since he went on long-term disability leave on September 15, 2016. Dkt. No. 21 at 25. To maintain this status, Thompson has had to continually demonstrate that his ASD and impairments prevent him from performing his job duties. Dkt. No. 27 at 3; Dkt. No. 21-7 at 28-29. Thompson's argument that he "was prepared to continue in his role as an EA" with only some of [*16]  the accommodations he had requested is belied by his continued disability status. Dkt. No. 25 at 19. See McConathy v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Corp., 131 F.3d 558 (5th Cir. 1998) (holding that employee who stated on social security disability benefits application that she was unable to hold any position even on a part-time basis was judicially estopped from arguing she was a qualified employee under the ADA).
Given the abundant evidence of flexible, interactive accommodation discussions as well as the offered reasonable accommodation of job reassignment, Thompson has failed to produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Microsoft failed to satisfy the ADA's requirements. That Thompson was unhappy with the job reassignment program as the selected accommodation does not create a genuine issue for trial. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted with regard to Thompson's claim for a failure to accommodate.

B. Discrimination Claim
Thompson alleges Microsoft intentionally discriminated against Thompson because of his disability in violation of the ADA. Specifically, Thompson alleges his ASD was a determining or motivating factor in Microsoft's decision to remove him from the EA position. In employment discrimination cases relying on circumstantial evidence, [*17]  as in this one, ADA claims are analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas framework. E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606 (5th Cir. 2009); see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). Under this framework, a plaintiff must first make a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA by establishing the following: (1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is qualified for the job despite the disability; and (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action due to his disability. Moss v. Harris Cnty. Constable Precinct One, 851 F.3d 413, 417 (5th Cir. 2017). If the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a "legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action." McInnis v. Alamo Cmty. College Dist., 207 F.3d 276, 280 (5th Cir. 2000). Once the employer articulates such a reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the articulated reason was merely "a pretext for unlawful discrimination." Id. (citation omitted).
The parties do not dispute Thompson's disability. Microsoft, however, argues Thompson cannot make out a prima facie claim of discrimination because Thompson was not a "qualified individual" for the EA position and because there is no evidence of an adverse employment action. Dkt. No. 21 at 31-35. Microsoft further asserts that even if Thompson could make out a prima facie case, his claim still fails [*18]  because Microsoft had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its decisions. Id. at 36. Thompson alleges he was a qualified individual and was "meeting his employer's expectations," but was removed "as a direct result of his disability." Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶ 21, 22. According to Thompson, there is at least a factual issue as to whether he was qualified individual, as he did not get the regular training a new EA typically receives and because he was only in the position for a short period of time thus unable to demonstrate his ability to do the job. Dkt. No. 25 at 9-10. Thompson argues that the removal of duties as an EA and his ultimate removal from the EA position altogether constitute adverse employment actions for the purposes of an ADA discrimination claim. Id. at 10-12. Finally, Thompson alleges Microsoft's explanation that its actions were justified by Thompson's poor performance is a pretext for discrimination, rather than a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. Id. at 13-15.
Thompson presents some evidence that there may be a fact question as to whether he was a "qualified individual" for the EA position. However, the Court need not address that issue because Thompson fails to allege an adverse employment action. [*19]  Thompson's mere allegations that he was removed from the EA pool for a period of time and subsequently placed in the job reassignment program do not qualify as adverse employment actions for the purposes of an ADA claim. Thompson has not and cannot prove the job reassignment program is "objectively worse" than the EA position because Thompson did not participate in the program and was not transferred to a different position. See, e.g., Hernandez v. Napolitano, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24724, 2012 WL 641033, at *6 (W.D. Tex. February 27, 2012) (holding that "[a] change in position or job duties can constitute an adverse employment action" if "the new position or responsibilities are objectively worse") (citing Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, 492 F.3d 605, 613-15 (5th Cir. 2007)); Forsyth v. City of Dallas, 91 F.3d 769, 774 (5th Cir. 1996). Thompson cannot allege a transfer was "objectively worse" and thus an adverse employment action when he rejected any transfer and instead chose to take long-term disability leave. Thompson's failure to allege any adverse employment action taken against him is fatal to his ADA discrimination claim.
The Court's analysis of Thompson's disability discrimination claim is simplified, as its finding that Thompson was not subject to any adverse employment action results in the failure of that claim as a matter of law. Although the Court need not reach the question, it further finds that [*20]  Thompson's claim also fails on the basis of Microsoft's presentation of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Microsoft contends the decision to remove Thompson from the EA position was based on Thompson's poor performance. Dkt. 21 at 36. Microsoft points to Thompson's well-documented poor performance reviews, peers' requests to have Thompson removed, inability to meet deadlines, and inadequate deliverables as legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for Thompson's removal from the EA position. Id. Although Thompson contends that external factors and "blocking" caused his poor deliverables, rather than his own poor performance, Microsoft argues that all employees encounter external "blocks" and the EA position requires finding a way to work around those blocks. Dkt. No. 27 at 4. Microsoft's decision to remove Thompson from the EA position and place him in the job reassignment program in light of his poor performance and inability to overcome external blocks is a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for its decision. E.E.O.C. v. LHG Group, Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 701-702 (5th Cir. 2014) (finding that termination of an employee when the employee's performance was "unsatisfactory according to management's business judgment" is "legitimate [*21]  and nondiscriminatory as a matter of law").
Thompson's discrimination claim fails because he has not alleged any adverse employment action and thus cannot make out a prima facie claim of discrimination. Even if Thompson could establish a prima facie case, he cannot demonstrate pretext. Microsoft has alleged legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions and Thompson offers nothing but a threadbare assertion that Microsoft's decisions were motivated by discriminatory animus. This is insufficient to survive summary judgment. E.g., Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994). Thompson's discrimination claim cannot overcome Microsoft's Motion for Summary Judgment and should be dismissed accordingly.

C. Hostile Work Environment Claim
Thompson alleges he was subjected to a hostile work environment by Microsoft as a result of his disclosure of his ASD diagnosis. To establish a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his disability; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5) the employer knew or [*22]  should have known of the harassment and failed to take remedial action. Patton v. Jacobs Eng'g Grp., Inc., 874 F.3d 437, 445 (5th Cir. 2017). Hostile work environment claims are analyzed on the totality of the circumstances, considering "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 670 F.3d 644, 651 (5th Cir. 2012). Where a plaintiff points only to a few "isolated incidents" or "offhand comments," he cannot meet "the Fifth Circuit's high bar for a hostile work environment." See Patton, 874 F.3d at 445; see also Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., 321 F.3d 503, 509 (5th Cir. 2003).
Thompson's Complaint generally alleges that his managers at Microsoft "engaged in a pattern of harassment and discrimination." Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 16. Some of the alleged conduct identified in Thompson's Complaint as harassment includes: (1) copying in-house counsel on emails to Thompson criticizing his job performance; (2) insulting Thompson in front of his peers; (3) preventing him from attending customer meetings or otherwise interacting with customers; (4) instructing Thompson not to interact with his peers; and (5) Garcia's statement that he should "find another career," in response to Thompson's disclosure of his ASD diagnosis. [*23]  Id. Thompson's Complaint additionally states that he filed a formal complaint of harassment, discrimination, and hostile work environment with Microsoft on April 1, 2015, but that it was dismissed on July 13, 2015 and Thompson was not provided with a substantive response. Id. at ¶ 10. In moving for summary judgment, Microsoft contends that none of the alleged conduct is sufficiently pervasive or severe to support a hostile work environment claim, and further that Microsoft adequately responded to Thompson's allegations by conducting an internal investigation. Dkt. No. 21 at 37-39.
The incidents Thompson identifies as harassment are not the type that courts find create a hostile work environment. See, e.g., Credeur v. La. Through Office of Attorney Gen., 860 F.3d 785, 796 (5th Cir. 2017) (finding no basis for hostile work environment claim where an employee was subjected to rude comments and dirty looks, shunned by co-workers, and given undesirable shifts and teams); McConathy, 131 F.3d at 561-64 (holding that employer did not create hostile work environment when supervisor (1) told employee he would "no longer tolerate her health problems;" (2) ordered employee to take a business trip while still recovering from painful surgery; and (3) caused employee to defer necessary surgery). Allegations [*24]  that criticism of Thompson's performance was made public to in-house counsel or even to Thompson's peers is not sufficiently severe conduct to support a hostile work environment claim. Kumar v. Shinseki, 495 Fed. Appx. 541, 543 (5th Cir. 2012) (criticism in the workplace and threats to employee's job did not constitute actionable harassment). Garcia's comment that Thompson should seek a different career in light of his ASD, as insensitive as it was, is the type of "offhand comment" or "isolated incident" that courts routinely hold does not meet the Fifth Circuit's high standard for hostile work environment claims. See Patton, 874 F.3d at 445. Microsoft's removal of Thompson from projects as an EA and instruction that he not interact with clients while his accommodation needs were being addressed likewise cannot support his claim, because these workplace conditions are not harassment but rather decisions made in light of Microsoft's legitimate business needs. Nadeau v. Echostar, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155725, 2013 WL 5874279, at *33 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 30, 2013) (where a reasonable condition is placed on an employee due to a legitimate business reason, it is not a hostile work environment).
With regard to Thompson's allegation that Microsoft did not properly address the formal complaint of harassment, the evidence indicates otherwise. According to the record, Thompson [*25]  referenced "workplace bullying" in an accommodation suggestion document provided to the Microsoft benefits specialist. Dkt. No. 21-3 at 12. The benefits specialist informed Thompson that in light of the allegation, she was referring the case to the proper personnel for an internal investigation. Id. During the investigation, a member of Microsoft's Employee Relations Investigations Team reached out to Thompson and provided him the opportunity to further elaborate on his earlier allegation of bullying. Id. at 38. Based on this meeting, the investigator interviewed each of the employees Thompson had identified as having treated him unfairly, spoke with potential witnesses, and gathered emails and other documentary evidence. Id. at 40. The investigation concluded that Microsoft's internal anti-harassment policies had not been violated. Id. Thompson was informed of this outcome via email on July 13, 2015. Id. In addition to explaining the findings to Thompson, the investigator further offered to meet with Thompson in person to discuss the matter and stated that if he had any concerns going forward he should be sure to raise them. Id. Thus, Thompson's allegations that Microsoft did not sufficiently respond [*26]  to any reports of harassment are not supported by the record.
Given the lack of evidence demonstrating any pervasive or severe pattern of disability harassment, the undersigned concurs with Microsoft that there is no genuine, material issue of fact as to whether Thompson was subjected to a hostile work environment. Accordingly, summary judgment should be granted in regard to Thompson's ADA hostile work environment claim.

IV. RECOMMENDATION
Based upon the foregoing, the Magistrate Court RECOMMENDS that the District Court GRANT Defendant Microsoft's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. No. 21, and DISMISS Thompson's claims WITH PREJUDICE.
Finally, the Court notes that the motion for summary judgment and related briefing was all filed under seal. Accordingly, this Report and Recommendation will also initially be filed under seal. No later than January 18, 2020, Thompson shall file an advisory to the Court stating whether he objects to the public filing of the order, and if so, which portions of the R&R he would request be redacted, and a legal basis for any requested redactions. It is the Court's ultimate intention to publish the R&R as fully as possible, given that court proceedings are public, [*27]  and a court's orders should similarly be public.

V. WARNINGS
The parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party filing objections must specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which objections are being made. The District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or general objections. See Battle v. United States Parole Comm'n, 834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987). A party's failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this Report within fourteen (14) days after the party is served with a copy of the Report shall bar that party from de novo review by the District Court of the proposed findings and recommendations in the Report and, except upon grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from appellate review of unobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District Court. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 150-53, 106 S. Ct. 466, 472-74, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985); Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).
SIGNED this 2nd day of January, 2020.
