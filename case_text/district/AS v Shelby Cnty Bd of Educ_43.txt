Opinion



ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDMENT
Before the Court is Plaintiff's Autumn Sanders' "(Plaintiff") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support, filed on October 30, 2020. (ECF Nos. 168 & 168-1.) Accompanying Plaintiff's Motion is Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts. (ECF [*2]  No. 168-2.) On December 4, 2020, Defendant Shelby County Board of Education ("Defendant") filed a Response in Opposition (ECF No. 180) and a Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts (ECF No. 180-1.) On December 11, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Reply. (ECF No. 181). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment should be DENIED.

LEGAL STANDARD
In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, federal courts are guided by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that summary judgment shall be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment must prove by clear and convincing evidence that there is no genuine issue of material fact, while the court must draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Kochins v. Linden-Alimak, Inc., 799 F.2d 1128, 1133 (6th Cir. 1986) (citing Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970)); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party can meet this burden by pointing out to the court that the respondent, having had sufficient opportunity for discovery, has no evidence to support an essential element of his case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2); see also Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479 (6th Cir. 1989) ("The respondent cannot rely on the hope that the trier of fact will disbelieve the [*3]  movant's denial of a disputed fact, but must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.") (internal quotation marks omitted).
The nonmovant has the duty to point out specific evidence in the record that would be sufficient to justify a jury decision in his favor. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1); InterRoyal Corp., 889 F.2d at 111. Rule 56(e)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure indicates that a court may "grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it," in the event the nonmovant "fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(3).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The facts of this case have been set out in prior orders by this Court and need not be reiterated here. (See ECF Nos. 32, 68, 74 & 93.) For purposes of ruling on Plaintiff's Motion, the Court does, however, note that Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against Defendants on January 22, 2019 asserting violations under (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("§ 504"), 29 U.S.C. § 794; (2) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101; and (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 ("§ 1983"). (ECF No. 1, 1.) Plaintiff now moves for Partial Summary Judgment against Defendants on her Title II and § 504 claims. (ECF No. 168, 1-2.) Plaintiff [*4]  Reid's § 1983 claim and individual claim for unlawful retaliation have been dismissed in previous Orders. (See ECF Nos. 32 & 93.)

ANALYSIS
The American with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act ("RA") combat discrimination against the disabled. Title II of the ADA provides, in relevant part, that: no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. Similarly, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that a qualified individual with a disability shall not "solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Each Act allows disabled individuals to sue certain entities, like school districts, that exclude them from participation in, deny them benefits of, or discriminate against them in a program because of their disability. Anderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 357 (6th Cir. 2015). Because claims brought under Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the RA require proof of substantially similar elements, courts often treat the two in the same manner and analyze [*5]  ADA and RA claims together. See S.S. v. E. Ky. Univ., 532 F.3d 445, 452-453 (6th Cir.2008) (analyzing ADA and RA claims together, but recognizing that, unlike the ADA, the RA reaches only federally funded entities and is limited "to denials of benefits 'solely' by reason of disability").
To establish a violation under either the ADA or § 504, Plaintiff must prove that (1) she has a disability; (2) she is otherwise qualified for participation in the program; (3) she is being excluded from participating in, being denied the benefit of, or being subjected to discrimination under the program because of her disability; and (4) that the program or activity receives federal funding. G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, 635 (6th Cir. 2013); Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 525, 241 (6th Cir. 2019).
Plaintiff cites Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F. 3d 901, 907 (6th Cir. 2004) and I.L. through Taylor v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Ed., 257 F. Supp. 3d 946, 969 (E.D. Tenn. 2017) to support her position that Title II and § 504 do more than just prevent public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities; and that intentional animus and deliberate indifference are not necessarily required to prove discrimination under the ADA and § 504. (See ECF No. 168-1, 6.) As the Sixth Circuit explained in Ability, there are two cognizable claims under Title II and § 504: claims for intentional discrimination and claims for reasonable accommodation. Ability, 385 F. 3d at 907. Further, as the Court explained in a previous order, in the Sixth Circuit, deliberate indifference [*6]  is not the correct standard in ADA and § 504 cases. (See ECF No. 68, 7.)
In Plaintiff's Motion, she contends that Defendants violated the ADA and § 504 by (1) failing to provide meaningful elevator access at Central High School, (2) failing to provide the agreed upon reasonable accommodations when elevator access was unavailable, and (3) failing to provide the agreed upon reasonable accommodations during Plaintiff's testing procedures. (ECF No. 168, 1.) The Court will address these arguments in turn.
1. Lack of Meaningful Elevator Access at Central High School
In the instant case, Plaintiff argues that the elevators at Central were unreliable and would go down almost every month for 1 to 3 days and even for a period of 2 to 3 weeks. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 49; ECF No. 168-1, 7-8; ECF No. 168-10, 12; ECF No. 168-11, 19.) Plaintiff argues that Defendants refused to provide her with elevator access to attend classes on the second floor and that the lack of elevator access resulted in compromised instruction. (ECF Nos. 168, 1 & 168-1, 7.) As a result, Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated the ADA and § 504. (Id.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on this claim should be denied [*7]  for three reasons. (ECF No. 180, 12-15.) First, Defendants note that Plaintiff admits that there was a contingency plan in place in her IEP to accommodate her when elevators went offline. (Id. at 13; see also ECF No. 168-7.) Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence or testimony tying a particular elevator outage to a redressable injury under the ADA or § 504. (ECF No. 180, 14.) Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to establish that she "requested and was denied an accommodation." (Id. at 15.) The Court evaluates Plaintiff's claims under both intentional discrimination and reasonable accommodation standards.

a. Intentional Discrimination Claim - Elevator Outage
To prevail on an intentional discrimination claim under Title II of the ADA or § 504, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled; (2) that she was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of services; (3) that such exclusion or discrimination was based on plaintiff's disability; and (4) that the discrimination was intentionally directed toward her. Anderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F. 3d 338, 357 (6th Cir. 2008). Under the ADA or § 504, Plaintiff may show intentional discrimination through direct or indirect evidence. Rosebrough v. Buckeye Valley High Sch., 582 F. App'x 647, 650 (6th Cir. 2014). In the instant case, Plaintiff has not produced [*8]  direct evidence to support her intentional discrimination claim, so the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Anderson, 798 F. 3d at 356. Under this framework, if Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the next step in the analysis is for the Defendant to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its challenged conduct. 798 F.3d at 357. If the Defendant can meet this burden of production, then Plaintiff must present evidence that the Defendant's explanation is a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id.
As noted above, Plaintiff argues that the elevators at Central were unreliable and would go down almost every month for 1 to 3 days and even for a period of 2 to 3 weeks. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 49; ECF No. 168-1, 7-8; ECF No. 168-10, 12; ECF No. 168-11, 19.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff admits that there was a contingency place in her IEP for when elevators went offline. (ECF No. 180, 13.) However, Plaintiff responds that this "back up plan was as reliable as the elevators themselves." Plaintiff contends that the repeated instances of inoperable elevators amount to categorical exclusion from the non-ground floor levels of Central High School, and intentional discrimination under Title II and [*9]  § 504. (ECF No. 168-1, 7-10.) Defendants respond that, consistent with the contingency plan, when the elevators went down, every reasonable effort was made to get them repaired as quickly as possible. (ECF No. 180, 13; ECF No. 168-10, 12-13.) In view of the evidence provided, and as the Court concluded in a previous Order, Defendant appears to have consistently responded to the elevator outages through maintenance and repair. (See ECF Nos. 68, 8 & 169-9.) However, factual disputes exist with regard to Plaintiffs' claim of discrimination based on her disability, and if the discrimination was specifically directed towards her to satisfy the third element required for an intentional discrimination claim. Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on this claim is Denied. Ultimately, a jury will decide the issue.

b. Reasonable Accommodation Claim - Elevator Outages
Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claim on this issue is denied for similar reasons. To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate a disability under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the service, with or without a [*10]  reasonable accommodation; (3) the defendants knew or had reason to know of her disability; (4) she requested an accommodation; and (5) the defendants failed to provide the necessary accommodation. Judge v. Landscape Forms, Inc., 592 F. App'x 403, 407 (6th Cir.2014).
Plaintiff argues that during times when elevators were inoperable, her placement in the library and inability to attend classes on the second floor prevented her from receiving any direct instruction on schoolwork and guided instruction from teachers on complicated topics. (ECF No. 168-1, 7; ECF No. 168-11, 20-21.) Plaintiff points out that the teachers were directed to provide instruction to her in the library. (ECF No. 168-1, 10.) The deposition of Erin Courtney ("Ms. Courtney") provides that when Plaintiff was in the library, teachers would send down work, if appropriate, or find alternative assignments to send. (ECF No. 168-11, 20.) Ms. Courtney further testified that she never went down to the library to provide direct instruction; that only one school employee, Dr. Taylor, went to see Plaintiff. (Id.) Thus, Plaintiff missed out on group work and scaffolding, a form of direct instruction. (Id. at 20-21.) As a result, Plaintiff argues that she was deprived of her disability accommodations [*11]  and that Defendants violated the ADA and § 504. (ECF No. 168-1, 9.)
Conversely, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff "has never testified that she felt excluded or missed critical educational opportunities as a result of accommodating her in the library when the elevator was inoperable." (ECF No. 180, 14.) Dr. Taylor testified that in the event of an elevator outage at Central, the school would "bring the education to that student or take it to that student." (ECF No. 168-4, 9.) Defendants also reiterate that Plaintiff admits that there was a contingency plan in her IEP when elevators went offline (ECF No. 180, 13), even though Plaintiff contends that this "back up plan was as reliable as the elevators themselves." (ECF No. 168-1, 10.) Defendants say that Plaintiff has not and cannot set forth any evidence tying a particular elevator outage to an injury redressable under the ADA or § 504. (ECF No. 180, 14.)
It is undisputed that Plaintiff is disabled, qualified for benefits and services under the ADA and § 504, and Defendants knew of her disability. Therefore, Plaintiff satisfies elements one, two and three of her reasonable accommodation claim. However, Defendants contend that Plaintiff is unable to [*12]  prove the remaining two elements of the claim because Plaintiff cannot show that she requested a specific disability accommodation and that Defendant failed to provide the accommodation. (ECF No. 180, 15.) Therefore, the Court begins its inquiry with the fourth element of the prima facie case: whether Plaintiff requested an accommodation. Based on the information provided in the IEP Team Meeting Minutes, Plaintiff can show that she requested a reasonable accommodation when the elevators were inaccessible. In fact, part of the purpose of the meetings was to discuss the plan to be implemented in the event the outages occurred. (ECF No. 168-7, 28.) Thus, it appears that Plaintiff has satisfied the fourth element of the claim. However, there is a dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff was denied a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff claims that she did not receive a reasonable accommodation during elevator outages and Defendants respond that their actions in response to the outages were reasonable, and Plaintiff cannot provide proof to the contrary. (Compare ECF No. 168-1, 7-10 with ECF No. 180, 14-15.) Thus, there is a material dispute of fact as to whether Defendants failed to provide [*13]  necessary and reasonable accommodation. Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for Defendants' alleged failure to provide reasonable accommodations during elevator outages is Denied. A jury shall decide the outcome of this claim.
2. Read-Aloud
Plaintiff argues that she requested read-aloud accommodations, during assignments and testing, as outlined in her IEP, but was denied. (ECF No. 168-1, 10-15.) Defendants first contend that Plaintiff's Motion should be denied because a violation of an IEP is akin to an educational injury subject to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act's ("IDEA") administrative procedures. (ECF No. 180, 2.) Alternatively, Defendants argue that in the event Plaintiff's claim is not precluded from summary judgment for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the claim should be denied because Plaintiff cannot show that the alleged discrimination was intentionally directed towards her. (ECF No. 180, 3 & 7-12.) (emphasis added.)
Here, the Court need not consider whether Plaintiff's claim requires administrative exhaustion under the IDEA because the Court already concluded in a previous Order that Plaintiff's grievances regarding the read-aloud accommodations, are not subject to [*14]  the IDEA. (ECF No. 181, 3; see also ECF No. 32, 13-14.) In the instant case, Plaintiff is seeking money damages for the seizures allegedly caused by Defendants' failure to provide read-aloud accommodations. (Id; Id.) Plaintiff "is not seeking changes to her IEP or any other remedy provided for under the IDEA." (ECF No. 181, 3.) Therefore, as the Court previously determined, "exhaustion of the IDEA's administrative processes would be futile and is not required" for Plaintiff to proceed with her read-aloud accommodation claim under the ADA and § 504. (See ECF No. 32, 14; see also Covington v. Knox Cty. Sch. Sys., 205 F.3d 912, 917 (6th Cir. 2000)).

a. Reasonable Accommodation Claim - Read Aloud
As noted above, to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate a disability under the ADA, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the service, with or without a reasonable accommodation; (3) the defendants knew or had reason to know of her disability; (4) she requested an accommodation; and (5) the defendants failed to provide the necessary accommodation. Judge, 592 F. App'x at 407.
In the instant case, it is undisputed that Plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the ADA, that she is qualified to receive [*15]  an accommodation, and that Defendants knew about Plaintiff's disability. Thus, elements one, two, and three are satisfied. However, Defendants contend that Plaintiff is unable to prove elements four and five of the claim because Plaintiff cannot show that she requested read-aloud accommodations and that Defendants failed to provide the accommodations. (ECF No. 170, 6-7.) More specifically, Defendants assert that Plaintiff cannot satisfy elements four and five because the word "request" only appears twice in the Complaint; first, when Plaintiff referenced a radio request to an assistant principal; and second, regarding a request that the heat be turned on in a room where Plaintiff would undergo her routine catheter procedure. (Id.) As such, Defendants contend that these requests are not the type of requests for accommodation envisioned by the ADA. (Id.) However, there is no bright line rule regarding accommodation requests. A Plaintiff is required to make his or her request for accommodation sufficiently clear that a provider need not speculate as to the need or desire for an accommodation." Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1046-47. The individual also must make it clear that the request is being made because of a disability. [*16]  Leeds, 249 F. App'x at 449; Judge, 592 F. App'x at 407.
According to the evidence, there are several instances where Plaintiff appeared to have requested a read-aloud accommodation and was denied. First and foremost, Plaintiff initially requested read-aloud accommodations during assignments and testing, as demonstrated and outlined in her IEPs. (ECF No. 168-5; ECF No. 168-6; ECF No. 168-7.) In addition, the record shows that there were several specific requests for read-aloud accommodation. (See ECF Nos. 1 & 168.) First, on October 26, 2015, Plaintiff asked Ms. Seay, her one-on-one assistant, to provide her with a read aloud accommodation for a test. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 21; ECF No. 168-1, 11; ECF No. 168-12; Seay Dep. 16:20-25.) However, Ms. Hardy, the English Teacher, directed Ms. Seay not to provide Plaintiff the read aloud accommodation for that type of test. (Id.) Second, on October 30, 2015, Ms. Hardy administered another test and again directed Ms. Seay to deny Plaintiff the read aloud accommodation outlined in her IEP. (ECF No. 168-1, 11; ECF No. 1, ¶ 21; ECF No. 168-12; Seay Dep. 16:20-25.) Third, on November 4, 2015, Ms. Burrell, another teacher at Snowden, gave Plaintiff a work packet to complete and Plaintiff, again, asked Ms. Seay [*17]  to provide a read aloud accommodation. (ECF No. 168-1, 11; Seay Dep. 21:9-24:23; ECF No. 168-2; ¶¶ 32-35.) However, Ms. Seay, was again directed to deny Plaintiff her read aloud accommodation. (Id.) Last, in March 2018, Ms. Courtney, a teacher at Central High School, administered the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test. (ECF No. 168-1, 13.) Plaintiff asked Ms. Courtney to provide her with a read aloud accommodation, but Dr. Taylor, Plaintiff's case manager, instructed Ms. Courtney not to provide Plaintiff with any disability accommodations for this exam. (ECF No. 168-1, 13; Courtney Dep. 16:23-18:7 & 19:5-21:21.)
Contrary to Defendants' position, and consistent with the September 2016 report issued by the United States Department of Education — Office for Civil Rights ("OCR"), Plaintiff satisfies elements four and five by showing that she requested read aloud accommodations for testing and that Defendants denied the accommodation requests. Moreover, in Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts, Defendants concede, for the purpose of ruling on the motion for summary judgment, that Plaintiff requested a read-aloud accommodation and was denied. (ECF [*18]  No. 180-1, ¶¶ 16-18; ECF No. 181, 4.) However, factual issues exist relative to the reasons for the denial of read-aloud accommodation, and if those reasons are sufficient to justify Defendants' actions. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for read-aloud accommodations under a reasonable accommodation standard is Denied.

b. Intentional Discrimination Claim - Read Aloud
To prevail on an intentional discrimination claim under Title II of the ADA or § 504, Plaintiff must show that: (1) she is disabled; (2) that she was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of services; (3) that such exclusion or discrimination was based on plaintiff's disability; and (4) that the discrimination was intentionally directed toward her. Anderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 357 (6th Cir. 2008). Under the ADA or § 504, Plaintiff may show intentional discrimination through direct or indirect evidence. Rosebrough v. Buckeye Valley High Sch., 582 F. App'x 647, 650 (6th Cir. 2014). Although it is a close case, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not sufficiently produced direct evidence to support the discrimination claim, so the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Anderson, 798 F. 3d at 356. Under this framework, if Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the next step in the analysis is for the Defendant to offer [*19]  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its challenged conduct. 798 F.3d at 357. If the Defendant can meet this burden of production, then Plaintiff must present evidence that the Defendant's explanation is pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id.
Here, Defendants concede that Plaintiff is disabled and qualifies for benefits and services under the ADA and § 504. (ECF No. 180, 10.) Thus, elements one and two for an intentional discrimination claim are satisfied. However, Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot produce any evidence that Defendants discriminated against her solely because of her disability or demonstrate the discriminatory animus required by the statute to prevail on an intentional discrimination claim. (Id. at 10-12.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff did not receive a read-aloud accommodation on the Measure of Academic Progress ("MAP") Test, administered on October 26, 2015 for two reasons. First, because it was the first year that the test was administered in Shelby County Schools and there were a lot of questions surrounding the test at that time. (ECF No. 170, 13-14; ECF No. 169-8, 30-33.) Second, Defendants contend that to the extent that a read-aloud accommodation was denied, [*20]  the denial did not originate from Shelby County Schools, but from the Tennessee Department of Education. (Id; Id. at 32-33.) Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that discriminatory animus was directed against her. (ECF No. 180, 11-12.) Ultimately, Defendants argue that the directives from the Tennessee Department of Education justified their actions in denying read-aloud accommodation. (ECF No. 170, 13-14; ECF No. 169-8, 30-33.)
However, the record reflects that Plaintiff had an IEP on file with Defendants which provided for read-aloud accommodations when needed, and specifically for state and district mandated testing. (ECF Nos. 168-5 & 168-7.) The IEP does not indicate any exceptions or circumstances where the school or those administering the IEP should deviate from it. (Id.) Plaintiff alleges and Defendants admit that Defendants did not provide Plaintiff with read-aloud accommodations during testing. (ECF No. 168-1, 10-12; ECF No. 180-1, ¶¶ 16-18.) Yet, because of state requirements, factual disputes exist as to whether Defendants acted intentionally or unreasonably towards Plaintiff in violation of the ADA and § 504. Thus, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary [*21]  Judgment on this claim under an intentional discrimination standard is Denied. This claim shall proceed to trial.

CONCLUSION
Factual disputes exist with regard to Plaintiff's claims of intentional discrimination and failure to provide reasonable accommodations. Thus, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED.
IT IS SO ORDERED this 27th day of September 2021.
