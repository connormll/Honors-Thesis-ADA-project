REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
GO, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE:
Plaintiff Phyllis Jackson commenced this action against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department (the "NYPD") (collectively, the "defendants") asserting claims for employment discrimination on the basis of her race, color, and disability and for retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ("Section 1981"), the Americans with Disabilities Act  [*2] (the "ADA"), the New York State Human Rights Executive Law § 296 (the "NYSHRL") and the New York City Administrative Code § 8-107 (the "NYCHRL"). See Complaint ("Compl.") (ct. doc. 1) at ¶¶ 1, 19.
Defendants' motion for summary judgment has been referred to me by the Honorable Roslynn R. Mauskopf to report and recommend. For the following reasons, I respectfully recommend that the Court grant defendants summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims of race discrimination and retaliation and all claims against the NYPD and deny defendants summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims of disability discrimination against the City of New York.

PERTINENT FACTS
The following facts are undisputed, except where otherwise noted.
Plaintiff was hired as a Police Officer for the NYPD on January 20, 1987. See Deposition Transcript of Phyllis Jackson at 12 ("Jackson Dep.") (attached as Exh. F to the Declaration of Christopher L. Heer dated December 20, 2007 ("Heer Decl.") (ct. doc. 26)). While on duty on September 14, 2001, plaintiff suffered from hyperglycemia and was taken to the emergency room of Long Island College Hospital following a "syncopal episode." See Heer Decl., Exh. H (NYPD Sick Report dated  [*3] September 19, 2001 of NYPD Surgeon). The NYPD surgeon reported that at the time of this incident, plaintiff had a blood glucose level of 354 and was taking Glucotrol, Glucophage, and Zestril for type II diabetes. See id.; see also Jackson Dep. at 41-42; Heer Decl., Exh. L (Letter from Dr. Marlon Seliger to Dr. Norman Greeley dated November 19, 2001). On September 15, 2001, plaintiff was examined by an NYPD surgeon of the Police Department's Medical Division, who determined that plaintiff's blood sugar was not controlled but cleared plaintiff to return to work on limited duty. See Heer Decl., Exh. H.
On September 28, 2001, plaintiff was responding to a call for medical assistance at the Borough Hall subway station when she began to feel nauseated and light-headed. See Jackson Dep. at 31. Plaintiff, who does not know what happened next, was told by her supervisor present, Sergeant Caldwell, that plaintiff was unresponsive and stared blankly. See Jackson Dep. at 32; Heer Decl., Exh. I (Letter from Sergeant Zbigniew Drozd dated September 28, 2001). Sergeant Caldwell escorted plaintiff to the street where plaintiff recovered. See Jackson Dep. at 32; Heer Decl., Exh. I. Plaintiff denies blacking  [*4] out or having to be resuscitated during this incident but has no recollection of what happened. See Jackson Dep. at 32-36. Plaintiff was taken from the scene by an NYPD patrol car to Long Island College Hospital where plaintiff was admitted for further testing and diagnosis. See Jackson Dep. at 34; Heer Decl., Exh. I.
In a subsequent Sick Report dated October 4, 2001, an NYPD surgeon observed that plaintiff's description of the episode resembled a "petit mal seizure," that all tests were normal, that no medicine was given, that plaintiff's private physician, Dr. Greeley, had been notified and that the final diagnosis was diabetes. See Heer Decl., Exh. K (NYPD Sick Report dated October 4, 2001). The NYPD surgeon cleared plaintiff to return for limited duty effective October 6, 2001. Id.
On November 19, 2001, Dr. Marlon Seliger, a board certified neurologist and sleep specialist, wrote a report to Dr. Greeley regarding his consultation with plaintiff following the episode of September 28, 2001. He noted that plaintiff had been working a variable shift, had been sleeping poorly and was very tired. See Heer Decl, Exh. L. Dr. Seliger also noted that plaintiff was diabetic and had been having  [*5] difficulty controlling her glucose at that time. Id. Plaintiff reported she felt well until she suffered a similar episode on November 15, 2001. Id. Dr. Seliger concluded that plaintiff had experienced two episodes of loss of consciousness, with the first episode having some suggestive seizure activity. Id. He also opined that hypoglycemia may have been a contributing cause, if not the precipitating cause, of these episodes. Id.
In a Sick Report dated December 17, 2001, an NYPD surgeon noted that plaintiff fell in a bathtub several days earlier, but that her diabetes was "okay now." See Heer Decl., Exh. M (NYPD Sick Report dated December 17, 2001). The NYPD surgeon also noted that plaintiff stated that she blacks out but does not faint and drives her own car for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. 1 See Heer Decl., Exh. M. In her deposition testimony, plaintiff denied that she blacked out and fell in a bathtub and generally referred to her episodes as "light-headedness." See Jackson Dep. at 49-50.
Plaintiff was again placed on limited duty starting December 18, 2001. Heer Decl., Exh. M. On January 7, 2002, the NYPD surgeon diagnosed plaintiff as suffering  [*7] from uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and syncope, and plaintiff was placed on restricted duty and prohibited from operating an NYPD vehicle. See Heer Decl., Exh. N (NYPD Restricted Duty Designation dated January 7, 2002).
In a report of a follow-up visit by plaintiff on February 6, 2002, Dr. Seliger reported that the MRI, MRA and neurological examinations performed on plaintiff were unremarkable. See Heer Decl., Exh. O (Letter from Dr. Marlon Seliger to Dr. Norman Greeley dated February 6, 2002). Dr. Seliger noted that plaintiff "was generally doing well until last week when she had an episode of perhaps five minutes while talking on the phone when she apparently became partially unresponsive . . . ." Id. Dr. Seliger also noted that plaintiff reported another incident on February 5, 2002 during which plaintiff "was unaware of her surroundings and unresponsive." Id. About two minutes after this incident, plaintiff measured her blood glucose which was over 200. Id. Noting that hypoglycemia was unlikely to be the cause of the episodes, Dr. Seliger concluded that complex-partial seizures due to sleep deprivation was the most likely diagnosis. See Jackson Dep. at 49; Heer Decl., Exh. O. Dr.  [*8] Seliger prescribed Trileptal as treatment for the seizures, ordered performance of an overnight polysomnogram to evaluate plaintiff for sleep apnea, and discussed the importance of weight loss for general health and to alleviate sleep apnea. See Heer Decl., Exh. O. The report of a diagnostic polysomnogram performed on April 6, 2002 contained impressions that plaintiff had severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias. See Heer Decl., Exh. S (Diagnostic Polysomnogram report by Dr. Marlon Seliger dated April 6, 2002).
On February 22, 2002, a monthly restricted duty evaluation was performed on plaintiff. See Heer Decl., Exh. Q (NYPD Restricted Duty Monthly Evaluation from February 22, 2002 through April 10, 2002). The NYPD surgeon noted that plaintiff was taking Glucophage, Glucotrol, Zestril and Trileptal and reported that her prognosis was guarded. Id.
In a March 14, 2002 report of a follow-up visit, Dr. Seliger reported normal results from plaintiff's EEG, but Dr. Seliger reported two occurrences on consecutive days at the end of February involving "brief loss of awareness without definite loss of consciousness." See Heer Decl., Exh. R (Letter from Dr.  [*9] Marlon Seliger to Dr. Norman Greeley dated March 14, 2002).
On March 20, 2002, the NYPD surgeon noted in a monthly restricted duty evaluation that plaintiff's prognosis was guarded and referred plaintiff to Dr. N. Tsirilakis, a Police Department neurologist. See Heer Decl., Exh. Q. In a Sick Report dated April 10, 2002, an NYPD surgeon noted that plaintiff "feels better," but plaintiff was continued on restricted duty. See Heer Decl. Exh. T (NYPD Sick Report dated April 10, 2002).
After examining plaintiff and reviewing her case, Dr. Tsirilakis concluded on April 23, 2002 that she should be continued on restrictive duty. See Heer Decl., Exh. U (NYPD Consultation Referral dated April 23, 2002). Dr. Tsirilakis noted that plaintiff had been under treatment since September 28, 2001 for recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness of abrupt onset and resulted in plaintiff having momentary post-ictal confusion and no recollection of ictal events. Id. Plaintiff reported having about two or three such episodes a month, with one episode of tongue biting. Id. Dr. Tsirilakis concluded that if plaintiff's seizures were not under control in six months that plaintiff be "surveyed" for disability retirement.  [*10] Id.
Dr. Seliger noted after plaintiff's visit on May 1, 2002 that she reported one episode of loss of awareness for which she sought emergency room treatment followed by two more episodes. Heer Decl., Exh. V (Letter to Dr. Marlon Seliger to Dr. Norman Greeley dated May 1, 2002). These episodes involved "loss of awareness without tonic-clonic activity," and occurred without prior warning. Id. Dr. Seliger also noted that plaintiff had stopped taking her Trileptal. Id. Dr. Seliger concluded that plaintiff had severe sleep apnea and complex-partial seizures, and opined that sleep apnea "could certainly exacerbate her seizures." Id.
On June 4, 2002, plaintiff called in sick, reporting that her glucose had risen above 200, she was not feeling well and she was going to call her private physician. See Heer Decl., Exh. W (NYPD Sick Report dated June 5, 2002). After plaintiff visited the medical office of the NYPD on the following day, the NYPD surgeon noted that plaintiff's glucose level had increased, her weight had risen to 250 pounds, and plaintiff reported feeling dizzy. Id.
Notes on a monthly restricted duty evaluation form dated July 10, 2002, indicate that plaintiff reported suffering seizures  [*11] on June 16, June 21, June 26, and July 2, 2002 and her prognosis was guarded. See Heer Decl., Exh. AA (NYPD Restricted Duty Monthly Evaluation from June 3, 2002 through November 29, 2002).
On September 17, 2002, plaintiff was seen again by Dr. Seliger. See Heer Decl., Exh. Y (Letter from Dr. Marlon Seliger to Dr. Norman Greeley dated September 17, 2002). Dr. Seliger noted that plaintiff had another partial complex seizure during the last three weeks but was apparently not taking the Trileptal as advised. Id. Dr. Seliger also noted that plaintiff had been using her Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine with fairly good effect and plaintiff reported sleeping better. Id. That same day, Dr. Seliger wrote a note advising that plaintiff had a seizure disorder, a history of seizures, and should not "engage in driving or doing activities where loss of awareness could be hazardous." See Jackson Dep. at 49; Heer Decl., Exh. Z (Handwritten note from Dr. Norman Seliger dated September 17, 2002).
On September 18, 2002, a monthly restrictive duty evaluation was performed, and plaintiff reported that she started on insulin that week. See Heer Decl., Exh. AA. During plaintiff's monthly  [*12] restricted duty evaluation on November 29, 2002, plaintiff reported suffering a seizure and that Dr. Langman prescribed Dilantin for her seizure disorder. Id.
On January 3, 2003, the NYPD surgeon, Dr. Edelman, recommended that plaintiff be "surveyed" for disability retirement because she had been on restricted duty for one year and suffered from seizure disorder and diabetes mellitus. See Heer Decl., Exh. DD (NYPD Recommendation for Survey dated January 3, 2003). Dr. Edelman noted that plaintiff had been taking medication due to her history of seizure disorder resulting from complex epilepsy. Id. Dr. Edelman also noted that plaintiff was a fragile diabetic who took various types of insulin and was obese. Id. Plaintiff, however, disagreed with the recommendation that a survey be performed. Id.
On February 25, 2003, plaintiff was assigned to an additional three to six months of restricted duty status by the Chief Surgeon of the NYPD. See Heer Decl., Exh. EE (NYPD Application for Restricted Duty Status dated February 25, 2003).
On July 24, 2003, Dr. Langman, a neurologist, wrote in a handwritten note that plaintiff was being treated for seizure disorder and had not had a seizure in the prior  [*13] two months. See Heer Decl., Exh. FF (Note from Dr. Leonard Langman dated July 24, 2003). Dr. Langman opined that plaintiff could return to full duty at the end of September 2003. Id. On September 2, 2003, the NYPD Supervising Chief Surgeon, Dr. Charles Martinez, recommended that plaintiff be examined by the Article II Medical Board (the "Medical Board") because she had been on restricted duty since January 8, 2002 due to seizure disorder. See Heer Decl., Exh. GG (NYPD Report by Supervising Chief Surgeon Charles Martinez dated September 3, 2003). Dr. Martinez noted that plaintiff was on anti-seizure medication and her prognosis for a return to full duty was poor. 2 Id.
On October 1, 2003, the Medical Board reviewed plaintiff's file, including Dr. Martinez's report, Dr. Seliger's report dated March 14, 2002, the EEG results dated February 6, 2002, the diagnostic polysomnogram results dated April 6, 2002, Dr. Tsirilakis' report dated April 23, 2002, the results of an MRI of the brain  [*14] dated December 24, 2002, and Dr. Langman's report dated July 24, 2003. See Heer Decl., Exh. II (Medical Board Police Pension Fund dated October 1, 2003). The Medical Board also examined and interviewed the plaintiff. Id. Based on this review, the Medical Board diagnosed plaintiff with seizure disorder, unanimously determined that plaintiff was disabled from performing the full duties of a police officer and recommended that the Police Commissioner's application for ordinary disability retirement ("ODR") be approved. Id.
By letter dated December 4, 2003, Dr. Langman advised the Medical Board that plaintiff had been under his care for seizure disorder since November 14, 2002. See Heer Decl., Exh. JJ (Letter from Dr. Leonard Langman to the Police Pension Board dated December 4, 2003). He ceased prescribing Dilantin in July 2003 and she had not had any seizures since then. Id. Dr. Langman opined that plaintiff's prior diabetes medications may have caused her seizures but those medications had been discontinued. Id.; see Jackson Dep. at 57. Dr. Langman further opined that plaintiff was seizure free and able to return to her line of work. Herr Decl., Exh. JJ.
In a letter dated December 8,  [*15] 2003, Dr. Sadhis Rivas advised the NYPD that the plaintiff suffered from diabetes mellitus and had previously been treated with Amaryl and Lantus insulin. See Heer Decl., Exh. KK (Letter from Dr. Sidhis Rivas to the NYPD dated December 8, 2003). Dr. Rivas stated that while plaintiff was taking these medications, she experienced recurrent hypoglycemic reactions. Id. After plaintiff's medications were changed to Lantus and Humalong insulin before meals, she had not suffered any hypoglycemic reactions. Id. Dr. Rivas also stated that while on these new medications, plaintiff was much less likely to have the hypoglycemic reactions which may have caused her previous seizures. Id.; see Jackson Dep. at 57.
On December 17, 2003, at the request of the Board of Trustees, the Executive Director of the Police Pension Fund ("PPF") remanded plaintiff's case to the Medical Board to review the new evidence submitted. See Heer Decl., Exh. MM (Letter from Police Pension Fund to the Medical Board dated December 17, 2003).
The Medical Board reviewed plaintiff's case a second time on February 18, 2004, including review of Dr. Langman's letter and Dr. Rivas' letter dated December 8, 2003. See Heer Decl., Exh.  [*16] NN (Medical Board Police Pension Fund Report dated February 18, 2004). The Medical Board also interviewed plaintiff, who reported that she felt well, had not had any seizures since April 2003, was taking insulin four times a day, and had been on restrictive duty since January 2002. 3 Id. After considering this information, the Medical Board again determined that plaintiff could not perform the full duties of a Police Officer and reaffirmed the prior recommendation of approval of the Police Commissioner's application for ODR. Id. Diagnosing plaintiff as having Diabetes Mellitus, Type I (insulin dependent) and possible seizure disorder, the Medical Board stated that "[w]hat is critical is that the officer is an Insulin dependent diabetic, who has to check her blood sugar several times during the day and takes Insulin, four times a day." Id.
On May 8, 2004, Dr. Earl Ellis wrote a letter stating that plaintiff took twenty units of Lantus insulin in the morning and eighteen units in the evening and confirmed that she had not had a hypoglycemic reaction since April 2003. See Heer Decl., Exh. OO.
On May 12, 2004, the PPF Executive Director, at the request of the Board of Trustees which met that same day, remanded plaintiff's case to the Medical Board to review new evidence. See Heer Decl., Exh. PP (Police Pension Fund Request for Reevaluation and Verbatim Minutes dated May 12, 2004). On July 14, 2004, the Medical Board reviewed plaintiff's case a third time, to consider the new evidence submitted by Dr. Earl Ellis and the minutes of the Board of Trustees' meeting. See Heer Decl., Exh. QQ (Medical Board Pension Fund Report dated July 14, 2004). The Medical Board noted that at plaintiff's most recent interview, plaintiff stated that she felt well, had not had any hypoglycemic reactions since she was  [*18] seen by the Medical Board six months earlier and had had no reactions since she was put on insulin. Id. The Medical Board acknowledged that plaintiff "checks her blood sugar and evidently has it under control." Id. After reviewing plaintiff's medical file and interview, the Medical Board determined that plaintiff could not return to normal patrol duties because of the possibility that she would not be able to eat or take her insulin on time. Id. The Medical Board reiterated its unanimous recommendation that the Police Commissioner's application for ODR be approved. Id.
On October 13, 2004, the Board of Trustees again remanded plaintiff's case to the Medical Board. See Heer Decl., Exh. RR. On November 24, 2004, the Medical Board reviewed plaintiff's case for the fourth time and again interviewed the plaintiff. See Heer Decl., Exh. SS. In the interview, plaintiff stated that she took insulin twice a day and checked her sugar. Id. Following this review, the Medical Board reiterated that its determination was based on the findings of plaintiff's own physicians, diagnostic reports, and its own findings, not on speculation. Id. The Medical Board stated the following in its conclusion:
It is  [*19] the policy of the [NYPD] not to put an officer back on normal patrol duties because of the possibility [that she] would not be able to eat on time or take her insulin on time. Should this occur, disastrous result might follow.
Id. The Medical Board further stated that it often had to make decisions "based on certain situations which may occur, which for one reason or another, a police officer would not be able to handle properly such as the case here." Id. The Medical Board, therefore, affirmed its prior determination and recommended approval of the Police Commissioner's application for ODR. Id. On February 9, 2005, the Board of Trustees accepted the recommendation of the Medical Board and retired plaintiff on ODR. See Heer Decl., Exh. TT (Police Pension Fund Minutes dated February 9, 2005).

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On April 25, 2005, plaintiff filed a complaint of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights ("SDHR"). See Heer Decl., Exh. C (SDHR Complaint dated April 25, 2005). The SDHR issued a Determination and Order of Dismissal for Administrative Convenience on December 29, 2005. See Heer Decl., Exh. D (SDHR Determination and Order of Dismissal dated December 29,  [*20] 2005). On January 18, 2006, plaintiff received a Right to Sue letter from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). See Heer Decl., Exh. E (EEOC Right to Sue Letter dated January 18, 2006). Plaintiff commenced the instant action on April 11, 2006. See Heer Decl., Exh. A (Complaint).
In her complaint, plaintiff alleges that defendants forced her to retire but treated similarly situated white employees differently. Id. at ¶¶ 15-16. Plaintiff also alleges that defendants subjected her to a discriminatory discharge on the basis of her medical condition. Id. at ¶¶ 13-14. Finally, plaintiff alleges that she was subject to retaliation for engaging in protected activity. Id. at ¶¶ 17, 27, 30.

DISCUSSION
I. Legal Standards for Summary Judgment
Summary judgment is appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In considering a motion for summary judgment, "the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine  [*21] the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the court must resolve ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Id. The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating an absence of material facts and once it has done so, the burden shifts to the non-moving party. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A genuine issue for trial exists if, based on the record as a whole, a reasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.
The Second Circuit has cautioned trial courts to be particularly careful in granting summary judgment in discrimination cases because there is rarely direct proof of an employer's discriminatory intent. See, e.g., Chertkova v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). Accordingly, courts must scrutinize the record "for circumstantial evidence that could support an inference of discrimination." Id. at 87.
II. Discrimination Claims
A. Discrimination on the Basis of Race
Plaintiff  [*22] generally asserts in her first claim that defendants engaged in "unlawful discrimination" in violation of Title VII, the Constitution and state and local law. 4 Courts must evaluate claims of discrimination brought under Title VII according to the three-step burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and later refined in Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981), among other cases. See Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc., 259 F.3d 91, 98 (2d Cir. 2001); Citroner v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., 208 F. Supp. 2d 328, 342 (E.D.N.Y. 2002). First, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-53; McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. At this stage, plaintiff's burden to defeat a summary judgment motion is de minimis. See McNulty v. N.Y. City Dep't of Finance, 45 F. Supp. 2d 296, 299 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (quoting McLee v. Chrysler Corp., 109 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 1997)).
Second, if the plaintiff presents a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252 (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802). This burden is only of production, not of persuasion. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000).
Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason offered by the defendant was merely a pretext for  [*25] discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252 (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802). While the presumption of discrimination "drops out of the picture" once defendant provides a legitimate non-discriminatory explanation, the court "may still consider the evidence establishing plaintiff's prima facie case and the inferences properly drawn therefrom . . . on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 143. "If the defendant has stated a neutral reason for the adverse action, 'to defeat summary judgment . . . the plaintiff's admissible evidence must show circumstances that would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer that the defendant's employment decision was more likely than not based in whole or in part on discrimination.'" Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 152 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ., 131 F.3d 305, 312 (2d Cir. 1997)).
Plaintiff claims defendants discriminated against her on the basis of race by forcing her to retire involuntarily from the NYPD. In order to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment in employment, plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) is a member of a  [*26] protected class, (2) who was qualified for her position, (3) who suffered an adverse employment action, (4) under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. See Collins v. New York City Transit Authority 305 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2002); Moultrie v. VIP Health Care Services, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22413, 2009 WL 750219, *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). Defendants challenge only the plaintiff's failure to establish the requirements of the second and fourth prongs of a prima facie case. See Defs.' Mem. of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at 12 ("Defs.' Mem.") (ct. doc. 26).
In determining whether a plaintiff satisfies the fourth prong of a prima facie case, a court must determine "whether the 'proffered admissible evidence shows circumstances that would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a discriminatory motive.'" Cronin v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 46 F.3d 196, 204 (2d Cir. 1995) (quoting Chambers v. TRM Copy Centers Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 38 (2d Cir. 1994)). At this stage, an inference of discrimination may be drawn from the mere fact that a similarly situated person not in the plaintiff's protected class was treated more favorably than the plaintiff. See Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 1999);  [*27] see also Shumway v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 118 F.3d 60, 63 (2d Cir. 1997).
Even assuming that plaintiff satisfies the first three prongs of a prima facie case, plaintiff has failed to establish that her involuntary retirement occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of race discrimination. Here, plaintiff has failed to provide evidence to support her argument that she was forced to retire from the NYPD while similarly situated white police officers were permitted to remain on the force. See Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n to Motion for Summary Judgment at 10 ("Pl.'s Mem.") (ct. doc. 23). Plaintiff points to eight white police officers whom she claims have similar or more severe conditions and were permitted to remain employed by the police department. Id. However, she provides virtually no admissible evidence to support her claim that she was treated differently and relies exclusively on her deposition testimony recounting hearsay statements regarding the eight alleged white diabetic officers. As she admits in her deposition, she does not personally know six of the officers (Off. M., Off. G.R., Sgt. J.L., Off. G., K.R. and Off. E.P.) 5 and learned from others that the officers  [*28] are diabetic and white. Dep. Tr. 78-80 (Off. M); 80-82 (Off. G.R.); 82-84, 86 (Sgt. J.L.); 85-87 (Off. G.); 89-91 (K.R.); 91-92 (Off. E.P.). She did not know where most were employed, the severity of the medical condition of any of these officers or whether they had retired. Id. On the other hand, plaintiff had worked in the same precinct with two officers —Sgt. S., who was her supervisor, and Off. F.H. — and points to the hearsay statement of each that he was diabetic. Id. at 92-93 (Sgt. S.); 93-97 (Off. F.H.) Plaintiff was not aware of the severity of the medical condition of Sgt. S., including whether he is insulin dependent, but testified that Off. F.H. had often been sick until he voluntarily retired. Id. at 93-97.
In response, defendants state that they were able to confirm the employment of only five of the officers (Off. M., Off. G.R., Sgt. J.L., K.R., Off. E.P. and Sgt. S.), produced the medical records of four officers and claim that the fifth officer has no medical history whatsoever, pointing in support of this contention to their objections and response to plaintiff's document request. See Statement of Undisputed Facts at ¶¶ 58, 60 (citing Heer Decl. at Exh. VV) (ct. doc. 26-2). The objections were simply signed by an Assistant Corporation Counsel but were not verified or made under oath. Although such statements by defendants would ordinarily not be admissible, they may be considered by the Court since plaintiff also included the defendants' responses and attached medical records in her submissions. See ct. docs. 23-2 at ¶ 8; 29-1 (attached as Exh. G to Declaration of Stephen C. Jackson ("Jackson Decl.")); Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 353 Fed. Appx. 558, 561 (2d Cir. 2009); Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 55-56 (2d Cir. 2005). In any event, it is the plaintiff's burden to come forward with admissible  [*30] evidence establishing a prima facie case rather than the defendants' burden to come forward with evidence negating plaintiff's claims which are not supported by admissible evidence.
After searching an NYPD database containing information voluntarily provided by employees of their race, Lt. Anthony Gazi stated that of the five officers whose names were provided by the Corporation Counsel's office and identified as "comparators," three are black, one is Asian and one is white. 6 See Heer Dec., Exh. WW (Aff. of Lt. Gazi) at ¶ 6. Thus, based on the admissible evidence before the Court, the plaintiff has presented medical evidence of only two officers who are outside her protected racial classification. See Woods v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., 288 Fed. Appx. 757, 760 (2d Cir. 2008) (comparator in the same protected group as plaintiff cannot support an inference of racial bias).
This Court notes that although  [*32] defendants state that they were not able to verify the employment of Off. F.H., this Court credits the deposition testimony of plaintiff that she worked with this officer and has personal knowledge that he is white. Jackson Dep. at 94-95. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that plaintiff spelled the surname of Off. F.H. with only an "e" in her interrogatories and document requests, but testified in her deposition that the surname is spelled with two "ee's." Compare Defs.' Exhs. UU, VV (ct. doc. 26-5 at 50, 66) with Jackson Dep. at 77-78, 94. There having been no discovery dispute raised before this Court over the production of the medical records pertaining to Off. F.H., this Court examines the defendants' motion based on the admissible evidence presented.
This evidence consists of evidence that there are medical records for two black officers who had a history of diabetes, one who is Asian (Off. J.L.) and one who is white (Sgt. S), as well as plaintiff's testimony that Off. F.H. is white and had diabetes. Although the medical records of Off. J.L. and Sgt. S show a history of diabetes and glucophage usage, these officers are not similarly situated to the plaintiff. See Jackson  [*33] Decl., Exh. G. In recommending plaintiff's involuntary retirement, the Medical Board relied heavily on plaintiff's history of seizures and dependence on insulin. See Heer Decl., Exhs. II, NN, QQ, SS. In contrast, plaintiff has submitted no evidence indicating that either Off. J.L. or Sgt. S is insulin-dependent or suffered seizures.
Although plaintiff testified that Off. F.H. told her he used a pump (presumably for release of insulin), Jackson Dep. at 94-95, this evidence, even assuming it is admissible for purposes of this motion, does not suffice to show that Off. F.H. is similarly situated. Although plaintiff claims the officer was often sick, she had no knowledge of the severity of Off. F.H.'s medical condition and provided no testimony or records showing that he had a history of seizures in addition to diabetes. Jackson Dep. at 94-98.
Notably, the medical records of "comparator #1," who Lt. Gazi states is black, indicate that this officer has serious medical problems, including insulin dependency with possible renal failure, as well as a history of hypertension. Ct. doc. 26-5 at 76-80. Insofar as plaintiff is correct that this officer, as well as the other officers she identified,  [*34] were permitted to continue working despite having diabetes, she has failed to make a prima facie showing that the defendants required her to retire on account of her race. See Springer v. City of New York, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8857, 2006 WL 526028 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (finding no prima facie case where defendants hired one carpenter that was the same race as plaintiff); Samuels v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. Servs., 94 Civ. 8645, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6739, 1997 WL 253209, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 1997) (no prima facie case of race discrimination where two of the four persons promoted were members of plaintiff's protected class); Smith v. Planas, 975 F. Supp. 303, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (no prima facie case where five of the seven individuals identified by plaintiff as having received higher paying assignments were members of plaintiff's protected class).
Even if plaintiff has successfully demonstrated a prima facie  [*35] case of discrimination, the defendants have clearly articulated non-discriminatory reasons for plaintiff's termination. As set forth in the record, defendants have offered sufficient evidence to establish that plaintiff's involuntary retirement was based on the Medical Board's opinion that she was physically unable to perform her duties.
Since the defendants have articulated a non-discriminatory reason for plaintiff's involuntary retirement, the plaintiff bears the burden of rebutting this explanation with specific evidence showing not only that the defendant's explanation is false, but that discrimination was the real reason for plaintiff's discharge. See Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42, 50 (2d Cir. 2000). Plaintiff argues that defendant's explanation is pretextual because the medical evidence submitted by plaintiff "clearly dispels the defendants' contention that plaintiff's ailment prevented her from working." See Pls.' Mem. at 11. Even assuming that the defendants incorrectly concluded that plaintiff was unable to work, plaintiff has not proffered any competent evidence that suggests that plaintiff's forced retirement was based on her race. See McPherson, 457 F.3d at 216;  [*36] Grillo v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 291 F.3d 231, 234 (2d Cir. 2002) (on a summary judgment motion, plaintiff must "come forward with at least some credible evidence that the actions of [defendants] were motivated by racial animus or ill-will"). The Medical Board reviewed the plaintiff's medical record four times and each time recommended that the application for ODR be approved. There is simply no evidence that would permit a rational fact finder to infer that defendant's decision to place plaintiff on ODR was more likely than not based on racial discrimination.
For all the reasons discussed above, I find that plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that she was a victim of racial discrimination with respect to her forced retirement. Accordingly, I recommend that defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted as to plaintiff's claims under Title VII and Section 1981. Since the claims under Title VII, the NYSHRL and the NYCHRL are governed by the same standards, I recommend that this Court exercise pendent jurisdiction to dismiss the state and local law claims for the reasons stated above. See Demoret v. Zegarelli, 451 F.3d 140, 152-54 (2d Cir. 2006); Quinn, 159 F.3d at 765;  [*37] see also Patterson, 375 F.3d at 225-26 (applying Title VII analysis to Section 1981 claims).
B. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability
The ADA prohibits a covered employer from discriminating against "a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to . . . [the] discharge of employees . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The statute defines "qualified individual with a disability" to mean "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." Id. § 12111(8). The term "discriminate" is defined by the ADA to include "[n]ot making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an . . . employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such [employer]." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Although the term "essential functions" is not defined in the ADA, the regulations promulgated by the EEOC define this term as the "fundamental" duties to be performed in the position  [*38] in question, but not functions that are merely "marginal." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1). The regulations further state that
evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to: (i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; (ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or (vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n). The "considerations set out in this regulation are fact-intensive. Usually no one listed factor will be dispositive, and the regulations themselves state that the evidentiary examples provided are not meant to be exhaustive." Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997).
Under the ADA, the term reasonable accommodation may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, . . and other similar accommodations for  [*39] individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). The regulations promulgated pursuant to the ADA provide that an employer is required to provide "modifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(ii).
In order to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she is an "individual who has a disability" within the meaning of the statute; (2) the employer had notice of her disability; (3) plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer refused to make such accommodation. See Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006); Schroeder v. Suffolk County Community College, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52533, 2009 WL 1748869, *4 (E.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009). If plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer "to demonstrate that the . . . proposed accommodation would have resulted in undue hardship." See Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 332 (2d Cir. 2000).  [*40] The plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her employment. See Jackan v. N.Y. State Dept. of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 566 (2d Cir. 2000). On the other hand, the plaintiff "bears only a light burden of production" with regard to the reasonableness of a proposed accommodation and the burden of persuasion falls on the employer. See McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97 n.3 (2d Cir. 2009).
Defendants challenge only the third prong, arguing that plaintiff's alleged disability renders her unable to perform the essential functions of a police officer, with or without reasonable accommodation. See Defs.' Mem. at 6. Plaintiff counters that she is capable of fulfilling the duties of a police officer if defendants permit her to occassionally work on "light duty" and allow her to eat while on-duty. See Pl.'s Mem. at 6. In response, defendants contend that this accommodation is unreasonable because an essential function of being a police officer is the ability to perform patrol duties and to respond to unforeseen emergencies at all times. See Defs.' Mem.  [*41] at 6-10. I find that there are disputed issues of material fact on the record presented as to whether plaintiff is able to perform patrol duties with reasonable accommodation and whether patrol duties are an essential function of being a police officer.
Specifically, defendants argue that although the plaintiff has not had a seizure since July 2003, the possibility that she could have a seizure in the future renders her unfit to perform patrol functions. Defs.' Mem. at 8-9; Defs.' Reply Mem. at 2. Each party has submitted letters written by three treating physicians between July 2003 and June 2005 stating that plaintiff had not had a seizure since April 2003. 7 See Herr Decl., Exhs. FF, JJ, KK, OO. Plaintiff also testified before the Medical Board that she had not had any seizures since April 2003. See Heer Decl., Exh. NN at 2. Two of plaintiff's doctors opined that plaintiff's seizures may have been caused by medications for diabetes that she had previously taken and she was "much less likely" to have such reactions in the future since the medication was changed. See id., Exhs. JJ, KK. Plaintiff's treating neurologist cleared her to return to full duty as early as September 2003. See  [*42] id., Exh. FF. Significantly, the Medical Board initially principally relied on a diagnosis of seizure disorder in finding plaintiff disabled from performing her duties, see Heer Decl., Exhs. II, NN, but in subsequent reviews relied exclusively on the diagnosis of diabetes, see id., Exhs. QQ, SS. I find that the letters of plaintiff's treating physicians are sufficient evidence to raise an issue of fact as to whether plaintiff is capable of performing patrol duties despite her prior history of seizures.
Defendants further argue that being an insulin dependent diabetic renders plaintiff unable to perform patrol duties. Defs.' Mem. at 8-9. The last two Medical Board reviews found that plaintiff was unable to return to normal patrol duties because of the possibility that she  [*43] would not be able to take her insulin or eat on-time. Plaintiff argues that she is able to perform patrol duties if she is permitted two reasonable accommodations, eating while on duty and occasionally being assigned to "light duty" if her hypoglycemic symptoms recur. 8 See Pl.'s Mem. at 6-7.
Plaintiff has submitted the medical records of four police officers who suffer from diabetes, one of whom is insulin dependent, and were not permanently removed from duty as a result of their medical condition. See Jackson Decl., Exh. G. This evidence would appear to contradict the statement of the Medical Board that it is NYPD policy to restrict a diabetic police officer from performing normal patrol duties because of the posssibility that she could not eat or take insulin on-time. See Herr Decl., Exh. SS. Although plaintiff has presented no evidence as to what duties these officers performed, drawing all inferences  [*44] in her favor, it appears that the City has viewed other diabetic police officers as capable of performing patrol duties. In addition, although plaintiff takes insulin twice a day, she testified at her deposition that she does not suffer any adverse reaction if she misses a dose. See Jackson Dep. at 65. Plaintiff has met her "light burden of production" with regard to the reasonableness of her proposed accommodation. In contrast, the defendants have not submitted any admissible evidence as to the burden imposed on the City by permitting a patrol officer to eat while on-duty. Thus, the defendants have not met their burden of establishing as a matter of law that it would be unreasonable or create an undue burden to permit plaintiff to consume food or beverages sufficient to maintain her necessary blood sugar level while on-duty.
In addition, the plaintiff proposes that she be permitted to work occasionally on "light duty" should her symptoms recur. In the instant case, whether assignment to "light duty" is a reasonable accommodation implicates the question of whether full patrol duties are an essential function of being a police officer. The defendants argue that every police officer must  [*45] be capable of performing full patrol duties at any time. See Defs.' Mem. at 6. In their moving papers, defendants state that an essential function of being a police officer is being "ready, willing and able to assume patrol duties whenever required by the contingencies of the Department." Id.
In Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92 (2d Cir. 1997), a paraplegic firefighter who was injured in an off-duty accident sought a transfer to a light-duty position. The fire department refused his request because it claimed that fire suppression was an essential function of being a firefighter. The Second Circuit reversed summary judgment for the defendant, noting that the district court "gave undue weight to the title 'firefighter'" in determining whether fire suppression is an essential function of the job. 118 F.3d at 100. The court recognized that the fire department had assigned other firefighters to light-duty positions following injuries, including permanent assignments, and found that the city had not established that giving the plaintiff a permanent light-duty assignment would be an unreasonable or unduly burdensome accommodation.
The determination of whether a particular function  [*46] is essential is "fact-intensive." Stone, 118 F.3d at 97; see Russell v. City of New York, No. CV 05-0948, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55876, 2006 WL 2333728, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2006) (denying motion for judgment on the pleadings because whether carrying a firearm is an essential function of being an NYPD officer "is a factual issue"); King v. Town of Wallkill, 302 F. Supp. 2d 279, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) ("whether plaintiff's inability to perform certain tasks renders him unable to perform the essential functions of police work in the Town generally requires a fact specific inquiry"). Although the employer's judgment is highly relevant evidence of what constitutes "essential functions," see 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3)(i), the defendants have not submitted any admissible evidence to support their position as to the essential functions of the job of police officer. The record does not contain any policies, job descriptions or collective bargaining agreements that require all police officers to carry out the duties of a patrol officer. See Stone, 118 F.3d at 99; King, 302 F. Supp. 2d at 290. Nor have the defendants offerred any testimonial evidence that it is NYPD policy to call upon every police officer in times of emergency.  [*47] Stone, 118 F.3d at 99-100. Even if they had presented such evidence, in the face of evidence to the contrary, the employer's judgment alone would be insufficient to establish as a matter of law that the ability to perform patrol duties is an essential function of being a police officer. In fact, the New York City Administrative Code provides that for police officers who were employed when this particular provision took effect,
[i]n case of partial permanent disability not caused by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which may occur after ten years service in such department, the member so disabled may be relieved by the commissioner from active service, but shall remain a member of the police force . . . and be assigned to the performance of such light duties as a police surgeon . . . may certify him or her to be qualified to perform.
N.Y. City Admin. Code § 13-206; 9 see also id. § 14-122 (permitting commissioner to relieve from active duty on patrol any police officer who becomes disabled as a result of an on-duty injury and to assign such officer to "light duties"). Thus, it appears that certain police officers who are disabled as a result of off-duty accidents  [*48] or illnesses may be assigned to light duties permanently. The defendants have not submitted any evidence to the contrary. Cf. Giordano v. City of New York, 274 F.3d 740, 749 n.5 (2d Cir. 2001) (expressing doubt as to the City's claim that NYPD has no "full duty/non-patrol positions"). Indeed, the plaintiff herself was assigned to light duties for almost two years. 10 Moreover, the plaintiff testified that Off. F.H., with whom she worked, "[n]ever went out on patrol." Jackson Dep. at 95. The NYPD's policy of assigning police officers to light duties for extended periods, and in some cases permanently, raises an issue of fact as to whether patrol duties are an essential function of the job of police officer. See Stone, 118 F.3d at 99-100; Russell, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55876, 2006 WL 2333728, at *3; King, 302 F. Supp. 2d at 290 (genuine issue of material fact about the essential functions of the position of a police officer); Clark v. City of Chicago, No. 97 C 4820, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21515, 2000 WL 875422, at *9 (N.D. Ill. June 28, 2000) (denying summary judgment because evidence did not establish that walking and shooting a weapon while standing are essential functions of limited duty); Sharp v. Abate, 887 F. Supp. 695, 699 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)  [*49] ("whether the supervision of inmates is an essential function of a correction officer raises a genuine issue of fact"); cf. Price v. City of New York, 264 Fed. Appx. 66, 68-69 (2d Cir. 2008) (vacating grant of summary judgment because district court did not allow sufficient discovery as to whether patrol duty was an essential function of the light duty position that plaintiff requested). In light of these facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants have not established that patrol duties are essential functions of a police officer and that permitting the plaintiff to occasionally perform light duties would create an undue burden on the City.
The cases cited by the City for the proposition that performing patrol duties is an essential function of being a police officer are distinguishable. In Giordano v. City of New York, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2039, 2001 WL 204202, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. March 1, 2001), the defendants submitted a declaration of the NYPD's Chief of Personnel stating that all full duty police officers must be able to perform patrol duties whenever required and that there are no full duty, non-patrol positions within the NYPD. 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2039, 2001 WL 204202, at *5; see also Hardy v. Village of Piermont, 923 F. Supp. 604 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (evidence demonstrated that no light duty position existed or was feasible in police force of eight). Although the Second Circuit did not decide whether the NYPD had established that patrol duties are an essential function, it noted that evidence presented by the plaintiff "tends to call this proposition into doubt." Giordano, 274 F.3d at 749 n. 5. In Santos v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10168, 2001 WL 875422 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 1995),  [*51] the defendant submitted evidence that officers are prohibited from being assigned "to any single particular task for the duration of a tour of duty." 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10168, [WL] at *3. In addition, in virtually all of the cases cited by the City, the plaintiffs requested permanent light duty positions whereas the plaintiff here merely requests permission to be assigned to light duty on occasion. See Feeley v. New York City Police Dep't, No. 97-CV-2891, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25431, 2001 WL 34835239, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2001); King v. Town of Wallkill, 302 F. Supp. 2d 279, 291 (S.D.N.Y. 2004); Giordano, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2039, 2001 WL 204202, at *5; Santos, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10168, 1995 WL 431336, at *3.
Finally, the defendants assert the affirmative defense that the plaintiff would pose a direct threat to others. A direct threat is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(3). "The risk can only be considered when it poses a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm; a speculative or remote risk is insufficient." Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 219 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Hamlin v. Charter Township of Flint, 165 F.3d 426, 432 (6th Cir. 1999)). The determination  [*52] must be based on an individualized assessment that relies on a reasonable medical judgment. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r); see Lovejoy-Wilson, 263 F.3d at 220.
Here, plaintiff's neurologist concluded that she was able to return to full duty. The City has not identified any incidents where plaintiff was injured or caused harm to others while on-duty as a result of her affliction. See Simms v. City of New York, 160 F. Supp. 2d 398, 405-06 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (in finding genuine issue of fact as to whether diabetic firefighter posed direct threat, court stated that "[d]efendants must present more than speculation as to possible safety concerns posed by" plaintiff). To the extent the plaintiff suffered hyperglycemic or other diabetes related episodes while on-duty, plaintiff has submitted evidence that those incidents occurred before her doctors changed her medications which they believed caused those episodes. While the defendants are correct that "there is no guarantee that [plaintiff] will continue to be seizure free," Defs.' Reply Mem. at 2, more than a remote risk is required to constitute a "direct threat" within the meaning of the ADA. The Medical Board claimed that "[i]t is the policy of the  [*53] Police Department not to put an officer back on normal patrol duties because of the possibility of her not being able to eat or take her Insulin on time." Heer Decl., Exh. SS. Yet, the record demonstrates that there were at least four police officers with diabetes who may not have been retired on disability. Thus, the defendants have not established that plaintiff poses a significant risk of substantial harm.
For the reasons discussed above, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of a police officer, whether plaintiff's proposed accommodations would cause an undue hardship and whether plaintiff would pose a direct threat to others. Therefore, I recommend that defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's ADA claim be denied.
III. Retaliation Claims
Plaintiff alleges that defendants retaliated against her for engaging in protected activity. The ADA forbids retaliation against an employee for complaining of prohibited discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving (1) participation in a protected activity, (2) defendant's  [*54] knowledge of that activity, (3) an employment action disadvantaging the person engaged in protected activity, and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. See Sarno v. Douglas-Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 1999). Proof of a causal connection can be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment. DeCintio v. Westchester County Medical Center, 821 F.2d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 1987). Once a plaintiff has met this burden, the defendant must provide evidence of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. Quinn, 159 F.3d at 768; DeCintio, 821 F.2d at 115. Finally, if the defendant provides evidence of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the action, plaintiff must present evidence that would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to conclude that the employer's explanation is merely a pretext for retaliation. Quinn, 159 F.3d at 769.
Plaintiff alleges that the Medical Board recommended her involuntary retirement on September 11, 2003, following the filing of her application for restricted duty status on January 3,  [*55] 2003. See Pl.'s Mem. at 13; Jackson Decl., Exhs. I, J. Although more than eight months passed between the filing of the application for restricted duty and the Medical Board's recommendation for involuntary retirement, the NYPD surgeon's recommendation that plaintiff be surveyed for disability retirement bears the same date as plaintiff's application for restricted duty. This is, at best, thin evidence.
However, assuming that plaintiff has satisfied the elements of a prima facie case for retaliation, as discussed above, the defendants have articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for plaintiff's involuntary retirement. See Defs'. Reply Mem. at 5. In response, plaintiff has not submitted any evidence sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether defendants' justification is merely pretext for retaliation. That plaintiff was assigned to restricted duty for twenty months before the Medical Board recommended her involuntary retirement suggests that retaliation was not a factor. See Heer Decl., Exhs. N, II. Therefore, I recommend that plaintiff's retaliation claims be dismissed.
IV. Additional Arguments
A. Monell Liability
Defendants argue that plaintiff's Monell claims against  [*56] the defendants should be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to satisfy the pleading requirements to hold a municipal entity liable under § 1981. In order to impose municipal liability, plaintiff must demonstrate that a violation of her constitutional rights occurred as a result of a municipal policy or custom. See Patterson v. County of Oneida, N.Y., 375 F.3d 206 (2d Cir. 2004). Plaintiff, however, makes no specific allegation and provides no evidence that the actions taken herein were motivated by a policy or custom of the City of New York or NYPD. See Zahra v. Town of Southold, 48 F.3d 674, 685 (2d Cir. 1995) ("[t]he mere assertion ... that a municipality has such a custom or policy is insufficient in the absence of allegations of fact tending to support, at least circumstantially, such an inference"). Her claim of a policy or practice may very well be undermined by her references to instances where at least five other officers were treated differently. In any case, plaintiff has failed to respond to this argument, and therefore the plaintiff's claims under section 1981 should be deemed abandoned. See Taylor v. City of New York, 269 F. Supp. 2d 68, 75 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (stating  [*57] "[f]ederal courts may deem a claim abandoned when a party moves for summary judgment on one ground and the party opposing summary judgment fails to address the argument in any way.") Accordingly, for this additional reason, I recommend that the defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's section 1981 claims be granted.
B. The NYPD as a Suable Entity
Defendants argue that the claims against the NYPD must be dismissed because the NYPD, as an agency of the City of New York, may not be sued in its independent capacity. See Defs.' Mem. at 18. Section 396 of the New York City Charter states: "all actions and proceedings for recovery of penalties for the violation of any law shall be brought in the name of the City of New York and not in that of any agency, except where otherwise provided by law." Courts have uniformly understood this provision to mean that "[t]he New York City Police Department is an organizational subdivision of the City of New York, lacking independent legal existence and as such is not a suable entity." Rossi v. New York City Police Dep't, No. 94 Civ. 5113 (JFK), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1717, 1998 WL 65999, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1998); see Jenkins v. City of New York, 478 F.3d 76, 93 (2d Cir. 2007)  [*58] (stating the New York City Police Department is not a suable entity). Again, since plaintiff failed to oppose this aspect of defendants' motion, the Court should deem these claims abandoned. Accordingly, I recommend that the claims against the NYPD be dismissed.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, I recommend that defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted as to plaintiff's claims of race discrimination and retaliation and all claims against the New York City Police Department. I further recommend that the City's motion for summary judgment be denied as to plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination.
Any objections to this report and recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of the Court, with a copy to the Honorable Roslynn R. Mauskopf, on or before March 21, 2011. Failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b).
SO ORDERED.
