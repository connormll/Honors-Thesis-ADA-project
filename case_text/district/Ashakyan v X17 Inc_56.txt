Opinion



Order
[19,20]
The Court has considered Defendants' motion to strike, motion to dismiss, and motion for a more definite statement, together with the moving and opposing papers.
Plaintiffs Hakop Arshakyan, Maximiliano Lopes, Roberto Maciel, and Sandro Rodrigues [collectively the "Photographers"] sued Defendants X17, Inc., and Francois Navarre [collectively "X17"] seeking declaratory relief, as well as alleging copyright infringement and, alternatively, various employment claims, arising from the Photographers' work photographing, inter alia, celebrities for X17.
The Photographers allege that they took "thousands" of photographs for X17 for "years." The Photographers attached seven "[e]xamples" of the copyrighted photos to the Complaint. The Photographers refer to the seven examples as the "Copyrighted Works." The exhibits were attached "with the understanding that any judicial determination would likely be the same for thousands of additional photographs" that the Photographers took.
X17, allegedly, "required the Photographers to work extensive hours often around the clock to take" the photos referenced in the Complaint. Further, X17, allegedly, required the Photographers [*4]  to work with "no overtime or meal or rest breaks."
X17, also, allegedly, verbally harassed certain Photographers. For example, X17 allegedly called Lopes, Maciel, and Rodrigues — who are Brazilian — "monkeys" and told them to "go back to the jungle" and "eat bananas." X17 allegedly "refused to accommodate Arshakyan's diabetic medical condition by refusing to allow him to stop working to eat to accommodate his low blood sugar level."
X17 allegedly referred to the Photographers as "independent contractors," paid them a fixed amount, gave them annual 1099 tax forms, and did not require them to sign "work for hire agreements." The Photographers have received — within one year of the acts alleged in the Complaint — a "right to sue" letter from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing ["DFEH"].
Based on the foregoing, the Photographers assert thirteen claims: 1) Declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq., regarding the Photographers status as independent contractors or employees of X17, and the parties respective rights with respect to the Copyrighted Works; 2) Copyright infringement with respect to the Copyrighted Works; 3) Conversion with respect to all photographs "in the possession, [*5]  custody, and control" of X17; 4) Failure to pay minimum wage and for waiting time pursuant to California Labor Code § 1182.12 and California Labor Code § 200, et seq.,; 5) Failure to pay overtime wages pursuant to California Labor Code §§ 510, 1194, et seq.; 6) Failure to provide meal periods pursuant to California Labor Code §§ 226.7 and 512; 7) Failure to provide rest periods pursuant to California Labor Code § 226.7 and Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations § 11050; 8) Violation of California's Unfair Competition Law ["UCL"], Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.; 9) Harassment in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ["FEHA"], California Govt. Code § 12900, et seq.; 10) Failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment in violation of the FEHA, Govt. Code § 12900, et seq.; 11) Failure to accommodate disability in violation of the FEHA, Govt. Code § 12900, et seq.; 12) Failure to engage in a good faith interactive process regarding accommodation of disability in violation of the FEHA, Govt. Code § 12900, et seq.; and 13) Harassment in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act ["UCRA"], Cal. Civ. Code § 51, et seq.
X17, now, moves to strike various terms in the Complaint, dismiss all claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), or, in the alternative, for a more definite statement.

Motion to Strike
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f), the Court may strike from the complaint any language that is, inter alia, redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous. X17 moves to strike 1) references to photographs other than the Copyrighted Works, including references to "thousands [*6]  of" photographs taken by the Photographers, and 2) requests of "attorney's fees."
The references to other photographs — including the "thousands of" photographs allegedly taken by the Photographers — are material to the Photographers employment claims. Accordingly, the references to the non-Copyrighted Works photographs will not be stricken.
Generally, "[t]he UCL does not authorize an award of attorney fees." See People ex rel. City of Santa Monica v. Gabriel, 186 Cal. App. 4th 882, 891, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 574 (2010). The Photographers, however, note that they may seek attorney's fees under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1021.5, which allows attorney's fees in some instances. Nonetheless, attorney's fees under § 1021.5 are recovered pursuant to a special motion procedure. Angelheart v. City of Burbank, 232 Cal. App. 3d 460, 466, 283 Cal. Rptr. 676, 285 Cal. Rptr. 463 (1991). Thus, attorney's fees under § 1021.5 shuld not be included in a prayer for relief. Gonzales & Gonzales Bonds & Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Action Immigration Bonds & Ins. Servs., Inc., No. CV 13 6997 PA (MRWX), 2014 WL 12600146, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2014). Accordingly, references to attorney's fees will be stricken from the UCL (eighth) claim.
Further, the Photographers acknowledge that attorney's fees are not available for the sixth and seventh claims.
Therefore, the motion to strike references to "attorney's fees" will be granted as to the sixth, seventh, and eighth claims.

Motion to Dismiss
Dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is proper when a complaint exhibits [*7]  either a "lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). To sufficiently state a claim, a plaintiff must allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Further, all inferences must be drawn in favor of the plaintiff. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).

Claim 1: Declaratory Relief
The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that "[i]n a case of actual controversy . . . any court of the United States . . . may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration . . . ." 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). Jurisdiction over a Declaratory Judgment Act claim turns on a two-step test. See Principal Life Ins. Co. v. Robinson, 394 F.3d 665, 669 (9th Cir. 2005). First, the Court determines whether there is an actual case or controversy. Robinson, 394 F.3d at 669. "[T]he phrase 'case of actual controversy' in the [Declaratory Judgment] Act refers to the type of 'Cases' and 'Controversies' that are justiciable under Article III." MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2007). Second, if a case or controversy exists, the Court "must decide whether to exercise its jurisdiction by analyzing the factors set out in Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U.S. 491, 62 S. Ct. 1173, 86 L. Ed. 1620 (1942), and its progeny." Robinson, 394 F.3d at 669.
Here, the Photographers seek a judicial declaration as to their rights as either employees or independent contractors of X17. Relatedly, [*8]  the Photographers seek a judicial declaration of their intellectual property rights with respect to the photographs taken, allegedly, for X17. An actual controversy, thus, exists as to both the copyright and employment issues. Further, the Court will exercise jurisdiction over the declaratory relief claim. In determining whether to exercise jurisdiction, "the district court must balance concerns of judicial administration, comity, and fairness to the litigants." Robinson, 394 F.3d at 672 (quotations omitted). These concerns weigh in favor of extending jurisdiction over the declaratory relief claim in this case. Accordingly, the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for declaratory relief.

Claim 2: Copyright Infringement
"To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove two elements: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original." L.A. Printex Indus., Inc. v. Aeropostale, Inc., 676 F.3d 841, 846 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotations omitted). Allegations of an application for registration satisfy the first element. See Cosmetic Ideas, Inc. v. IAC/Interactivecorp., 606 F.3d 612, 619 (9th Cir. 2010).
Here, the Complaint sufficiently alleges a claim for copyright infringement with respect to the Copyrighted Works. Nonetheless, the claim for copyright infringement has two ambiguities. First, the Complaint asserts [*9]  the infringement claim as to the Copyrighted Works; however, at the same time, the Complaint avers that the Photographers "believe that . . . they [are] the owners of all . . . copyrights to each and every photograph they took." This statement appears to reference the "thousands of" photographs the Photographers allegedly took. Further, the Copyrighted Works are referred to as "examples" of copyrighted photos. The copyright infringement claim survives, however, because the Court accepts the Photographers' representation that the copyright infringement claim is asserted only as to the Copyrighted Works.
Second, the Complaint omits the dates of the alleged infringement. The Photographers represent that they can address this omission by adding "allegations concerning the dates X17 published the copyrighted material and by what means it published the material." Thus, as discussed below with respect to the motion for a more definite statement, a more definite statement of the copyright claim must include information regarding the dates and means of the alleged copyright infringement.
Accordingly, upon the addition of the information regarding the dates and means of the alleged copyright infringement, [*10]  the Complaint will sufficiently state the copyright infringement claim.

Claim 3: Conversion
"The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages." Burlesci v. Petersen, 68 Cal. App. 4th 1062, 1066, 80 Cal. Rptr. 2d 704 (1998). "A state law cause of action is preempted by the Copyright Act if two elements are present." Kodadek v. MTV Networks, Inc., 152 F.3d 1209, 1212 (9th Cir. 1998). "First, the rights that a plaintiff asserts under state law must be 'rights that are equivalent' to those protected by the Copyright Act." Kodadek, 152 F.3d at 1212. "Second, the work involved must fall within the "subject matter" of the Copyright Act as set forth in 17 U.S.C. §§ 102 and 103."Kodadek, 152 F.3d at 1212. "The second prong of the copyright preemption test often focuses on whether or not the state claim requires an additional element that is not encompassed within the Act." Worth v. Universal Pictures, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d 816, 821 (C.D. Cal. 1997). "A conversion claim generally involves an 'extra element' because it requires the plaintiff prove the defendant's wrongful possession or disposition of a particular piece of property. Patnaik v. Hearst Corp., No. CV 14 05158 BRO (EX), 2015 WL 12746704, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2015). Thus "where a plaintiff is only seeking damages from a defendant's reproduction of a work — and not the actual return of a physical piece of property — the [*11]  claim is preempted." Patnaik, 2015 WL 12746704, at *8.
Here, the Photographers seek "the return of their photographs" and allege that thousands of photographs are "in the possession, custody, and control of" X17. Accordingly, the conversion claim is not preempted, and is sufficiently pleaded.

Claim 4: Failure to Pay Minimum Wages and for Waiting Time
Generally, to sufficiently allege a claim for failure to pay minimum wage and waiting time under the California Labor Code, a plaintiff need only allege facts showing that she worked for the defendant and did not receive the minimum wage and waiting time compensation to which she was entitled. See, e.g., Muan v. Vitug, No. CV13 331 PSG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77107, 2013 WL 2403596, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 31, 2013). Here, the Photographers have done so. In addition to the general allegations regarding the Photographers' work for X17 — including an allegation that the Photographers were required to work "extensive hours" "around the clock" — the Photographers allege that X17 "failed to pay . . . compensation to which they were entitled" for their work as employees of X17. Accordingly, the Photographers have sufficiently alleged their claim for failure to pay minimum wages and for waiting time.

Claim 5: [*12]  Failure to Pay Overtime Wages
"[D]etailed factual allegations regarding the number of overtime hours worked are not required to state a plausible claim" for failure to pay overtime wages, but "conclusory allegations that merely recite the statutory language are [not] adequate." Landers v. Quality Commc'ns, Inc., 771 F.3d 638, 644 (9th Cir. 2014). "[I]n order to survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff asserting a claim to overtime payments must allege that she worked more than forty hours in a given workweek without being compensated for the overtime hours worked during that workweek." Landers, 771 F.3d at 644-45. Here, the Photographers merely allege that they worked "extensive hours often around the clock." While the inquiry is "context-specific" and a plausible claim may be sustained by "estimating the length of . . . [an] average workweek," the allegations in the Complaint still fall short. See Landers, 771 F.3d at 645. Accordingly, the Complaint fails to state a claim for failure to pay overtime wages.

Claims 6-7: Failure to Provide Meal and Rest Periods
Under California law, an employer satisfies its obligation to provide meal breaks "if it relieves its employees of all duty, relinquishes control over their activities and permits them a reasonable opportunity to take an uninterrupted 30-minute break, [*13]  and does not impede or discourage them from doing so." Brinker Rest. Corp. v. Superior Court, 53 Cal. 4th 1004, 1040, 139 Cal. Rptr. 3d 315, 273 P.3d 513 (2012). "[I]f an employer makes it difficult for employees to take a break . . . there are grounds to find a violation of the California Labor Code." Varsam v. Lab. Corp. of Am., 120 F. Supp. 3d 1173, 1179 (S.D. Cal. 2015)
Here, the Complaint alleges, inter alia, that the Photographers were required to "work around the clock," and that X17 failed "to provide required meal periods" and that the Photographers "regularly worked in excess of five . . . hours per day without being afforded a meal period of not less than 30 minutes as required[.]" Additionally, X17 "fail[ed] and refus[ed] to provide rest breaks." In this case, where the work alleged plausibly requires constant vigilance for brief opportunities to take photographs, these allegations sufficiently state a claim for failure to provide meal and rest periods.

Claim 8: Unfair Competition Law ["UCL"]
California's Unfair Competition Law ["UCL"] proscribes business practices that are unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. An action based on the UCL to redress an unlawful business practice treats violations under other laws as independently actionable unlawful competition practices. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Super. Court, 2 Cal. 4th 377, 383, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, 826 P.2d 730 (1992). Because the Photographers have sufficiently stated claims four, six, and seven, [*14]  they have sufficiently alleged a UCL claim. See Farmers Ins. Exch., 2 Cal. 4th at 383.

Claim 9: Harassment in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ["FEHA"]
To state a claim for harassment under the FEHA, a plaintiff must allege, inter alia, that (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his protected class; and (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with his work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Thompson v. City Of Monrovia, 186 Cal. App. 4th 860, 876, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 377 (2010). National origin is a protected class. Thompson, 186 Cal. App. 4th at 876. Here, Lopes, Maciel, and Rodrigues allege that they are Brazilian, that they were subjected to unwanted harassment by X17 — including being called "monkeys" and told to "go back to the jungle" — on the basis of, inter alia, their national origin, and that the harassment resulted in, inter alia, a hostile work environment. Thus, the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for harassment in violation of the FEHA.

Claim 10: Failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment in violation of the FEHA
"The FEHA makes it a separate unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination [*15]  and harassment from occurring." State Dep't of Health Servs. v. Superior Court, 31 Cal. 4th 1026, 1040, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 441, 79 P.3d 556 (2003) (quotations omitted). Generally, sufficiently stating a claim for harassment under the FEHA is sufficient to state a claim for failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment under the FEHA. See Mayfield v. Trevors Store, Inc., No. C 04 1483 MHP, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24576, 2004 WL 2806175, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2004). Thus, because the harassment claim was sufficiently stated, the claim for failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harassment has been sufficiently stated. See Mayfield, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24576, 2004 WL 2806175, at *7.

Claim 11: Failure to accommodate a disability in violation of the FEHA
"The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under the FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California Orange Cty., Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009).
Here, the Complaint alleges that Arshakyan "suffers from diabetes," which is a disability under the FEHA. See, e.g., Navarro v. DHL Glob. Forwarding, No. 215CV05510CASEX, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32663, 2017 WL 901880, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2017). Further, the Complaint alleges that Arshakyan took photos for X17 that X17 then sold; a fortiori, the Complaint alleges that Arshakyan was qualified to perform the essential functions of [*16]  the position. Lastly, the Complaint alleges that X17 failed to reasonably accommodate Arshakyan's disability by, inter alia, "refusing to allow him to stop working to eat to accommodate his low blood sugar." Thus, the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for failure to accommodate a disability in violation of the FEHA.

Claim 12: Failure to engage in a good faith interactive process regarding accommodation of disability in violation of the FEHA
Under California law, it is unlawful for "an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). An employer's obligation to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee to determine an effective reasonable accommodation is triggered either when an employee requests an accommodation or the employer "(1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, [*17]  or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation." See Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001).
The Complaint alleges that Arshakyan "suffers from diabetes," that Arshakyan made a "request for accommodation of his disability," and that X17 "refused to accommodate Arshakyan's diabetic medical condition." Accordingly, the Complaint sufficiently states a claim for failure to accommodate a disability in violation of the FEHA.

Claim 13: Harassment in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act ["UCRA"]
Employment discrimination is not actionable under the UCRA. Alcorn v. Anbro Eng'g, Inc., 2 Cal. 3d 493, 500, 86 Cal. Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216 (1970). Indeed, this includes actions against employers by both employees and independent contractors. See Alch v. Superior Court, 122 Cal. App. 4th 339, 393, 19 Cal. Rptr. 3d 29 (2004). Here, the Photographers exclusively seek recovery as either independent contractors or employees. As a result, the claim under the UCRA is not cognizable.

Motion for More Definite Statement
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e), "[a] party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response." Because the Court accepts the Photographers' representation that the FAC asserts the copyright infringement claim only as to the seven [*18]  Copyrighted Works, the remaining ambiguity in the Complaint, at this juncture, is the dates of the alleged infringement. The Photographers represent that they can add "allegations concerning the dates X17 published the copyrighted material and by what means it published the material." Thus, the motion for a more definite statement will be granted as to the copyright infringement claim such that the Photographers can add those allegations to the Complaint.
Accordingly,
It is Ordered that Defendants' motion to strike be, and hereby is, Granted as to references to "attorney's fees" in the sixth, seventh, and eighth claims.
It is Further Ordered that Defendants' motion to strike be, and hereby is, Denied as to all other requested terms.
It is Further Ordered that Defendants' motion to dismiss be, and hereby is, Granted as to claims five and thirteen without prejudice.
It is Further Ordered that Defendants' motion to dismiss be, and hereby is, Denied as to claims one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve.
It is Further Ordered that Defendants' motion for a more definite statement be, and hereby is, Granted as to claim two; Plaintiffs shall add allegations concerning [*19]  the dates Defendants published the copyrighted material and by what means Defendants published the material.
