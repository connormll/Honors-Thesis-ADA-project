Opinion



CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS: (IN CHAMBERS) ORDER: (1) GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 36) AND (2) DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, RULE 11 FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT $ 215,725.00 (Doc. 35)
Before the Court is (1) a Motion for Summary Judgment and (2) a Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 11 for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $ 215,725.00 filed by Defendants Newtek Business Service Corp. and Newtek Small Business Finance LLC (together, "Defendants" or "Newtek"). (Mot. for Monetary Sanctions, Doc. 35; Mem., Doc. 35-1; Mot. for Summary Judgment, Doc. 36; Mem., Doc. 36-1.) Plaintiff Michelle Louie opposed, and Newtek replied. (Opp., Doc. 37; Reply, Doc. 39.) After oral argument and review of the parties' briefs, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and DENIES the Motion for Monetary Sanctions in its entirety.

I. BACKGROUND
Since 2001, Plaintiff [*2]  has worked as an underwriter at various private companies. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 1, Doc. 37-1.) In June 2018, Plaintiff was hired by Newtek to work as a Vice President in a credit underwriting position. (Id. ¶ 6.) She was hired as an "[e]xempt employee with an annual salary of $ 120,000.00 based on a standard 40-hour work week." (Ex. 2 at PDF Page 2 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-4.) Consistent with her past positions, Plaintiff's responsibilities as an underwriter at Newtek included analyzing, underwriting, and preparing Small Business Administration "loan applications for credit approval." (Ex. 13 (Michelle Louie Resume) to the Declaration of Imbar Sagi-Lewboitz, Doc. 36-15; Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 9, Doc. 37-1.) Plaintiff's responsibilities also included recommending whether Newtek should underwrite a loan. (See Ex. 12 (Michelle Louie Apr. 26, 2022 Depo.) at 92:13-18, Doc. 36-14.) Like her previous underwriting jobs, Plaintiff's job at Newtek was a salaried position (as noted above) and was not entitled to overtime pay. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 7, Doc. 37-1; Ex. 12 (Michelle Louie [*3]  Apr. 26, 2022 Depo.) at 97:6-98:18, Doc. 36-14.)
On May 31, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Newtek that she would like to work from home as she had worked late to finish a work-related project, had "only got a few hours of sleep," and was "not feeling well." (Ex. 15 (5/31/19 email) to the Declaration of Imbar Sagi-Lebowitz, Doc. 36-17.) Later that day, Plaintiff visited a physician. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 12, Doc. 37-1.) The physician concluded that due to a medical disability Plaintiff was "unable to perform the functions of his/her job to maintain gainful employment." (Ex. 3 at PDF Page 4 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-5.) Plaintiff's physician described the medical disability as "[d]ecreased work output stemming from decreased functional capacity," i.e., an inability to sustain concentration. (See, e.g., Ex. 18 (Henry Johnson Apr. 20, 2022 Depo.) at 37:12-14, 54:1-55:2, Doc. 36-20.) Plaintiff emailed Netwek that day noting that she attached a notice from her physician to be placed on medical disability. (Ex. 3 at PDF Page 2 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-5.) It is undisputed that Newtek provided the time off as requested. (Plaintiff's [*4]  Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 15, Doc. 37-1.)
Plaintiff also requested and obtained additional time off in June, July, August, and October 2019. On June 22, 2019, Plaintiff sent an updated note to Newtek extending her medical leave through July 22, 2019. (Id. ¶ 16.) On July 18, 2019, Plaintiff again emailed Newtek that she "will not be in the office on July 22nd" because her physician still had not cleared her. (Ex. 4 at PDF Page 3 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-6.) On or around July 23, 2019, Plaintiff provided another note from her physician extending her leave through August 22, 2019. (Ex. 5 at PDF Page 3 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-7.) On August 20, 2019, Plaintiff provided another note from her physician extending her leave until October 9, 2019. (Ex. 7 at PDF Page 2 to the Declaration of Effie Delis, Doc. 36-9.) On October 8, 2019, Plaintiff once again emailed her employer noting that she had not been cleared to return to work. (Ex. 8 at PDF Page 2 to the Declaration of Effie Dellis, Doc. 36-10.)
Throughout this time, Plaintiff gave no indication when she would be returning to work or if she would return at all. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed [*5]  Facts ¶¶ 22-23, Doc. 37-1.) On October 15, 2019, Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment, after receiving 18 weeks of medical leave. (Id. ¶ 23.) As of October 15, 2019, Plaintiff was still disabled, and she was restricted by her doctors from working at all until June 22, 2020. (Id. ¶ 24.) Newtek contends that they terminated Plaintiff because she "did not inform Defendants when she was going to return to work, and there was no indication that she was returning at all." (Id. ¶ 23.)
On June 22, 2020, Plaintiff began a new position with Union Bank as an SBA Credit Executive performing the same duties she had at Newtek. (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiff interviewed for the Union Bank position in May 2020, and received a job offer for the underwriting position the following month. (Id. ¶ 28.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff coincided her release back to work on June 22, 2020 with the first day of her new employment with Union Bank. (Id. ¶ 30.) Plaintiff's salary at Union Bank was the same at Newtek; however, her job offer included an opportunity for a bonus of up to $ 20,500 for the year 2020 based on her performance. (Id. ¶ 31.) For the year 2020-2021, Plaintiff received a bonus of $ 13,000. ( [*6] Id. ¶ 32.)
On May 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed suit against Newtek asserting the following causes of action: (1) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (based on Newtek's purported violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA")); (2) Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; (3) Disability Discrimination in violation of FEHA; (4) Failure to Accommodate in violation of FEHA; (5) Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in violation of FEHA; and (6) violations of California Business & Professions Code Section 17200, et seq. based on an argument that Newtek misclassified her position as exempt. (Comp. ¶¶ 24-82, Doc. 2.) As to her failure to accommodate claim, Plaintiff contends that Defendant never accommodated her suggestions that she work fewer hours or that they hire more staff. (See, e.g., Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 52, Doc. 37-1.) However, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not make any of these suggestions prior to being placed on medical disability or prior to seeing her physician, on May 31, 2019. (Id.; see also Ex. 12 (Michelle Louie Apr. 26, 2022 Depo.) at 35:12-16, 78:17-79:14, Doc. 36-14.)
Newtek now seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's claims. (Mot., Doc. 36; Mem., Doc. 36-1.) [*7]  Newtek also seeks an award of attorneys fees under Rule 11 "for the attorneys fees incurred as a result of defending against frivolous allegations." (Mot., Doc. 35.)

II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

A. Legal Standard
Summary judgment shall be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). See also Fortyune v. American Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1079-80 (9th Cir. 2004) ("Summary judgment is appropriate 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'" (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c))). "A dispute about a material fact is genuine 'if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.'" Freecycle Sunnyvale v. Freecycle Network, 626 F.3d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A fact is "material" when its resolution "'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'" George v. Morris, 736 F.3d 829, 834 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248).
"If the moving party satisfies its initial burden of production, the nonmoving party must produce admissible evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists." Bernstein v. Virgin Am., Inc., 365 F. Supp. 3d 980, 984 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (citing Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000)). "If the nonmoving party fails to make this showing, [*8]  the moving party is entitled to summary judgment." Bernstein, 365 F. Supp. 3d at 984 (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). The non-moving party does not meet this burden by showing "some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The United States Supreme Court has held that "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party's position is not sufficient." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. Genuine factual issues must exist that "can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party." Id. at 250. When ruling on a summary judgment motion, the Court must examine all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. The Court cannot engage in credibility determinations, weighing of evidence, or drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts; these functions are for the jury. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Without specific facts to support the conclusion, a bald assertion of the "ultimate fact" is insufficient. See Schneider v. TRW, Inc., 938 F.2d 986, 990-91 (9th Cir.1991).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Plaintiffs' Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (First Cause of Action), Retaliation in Violation of FEHA (Second Cause of Action), and Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Third Cause of Action) Claims
Plaintiffs' Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public [*9]  Policy (First Cause of Action), Retaliation in Violation of FEHA (Second Cause of Action), and Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Third Cause of Action) claims are based on the allegation that Newtek retaliated against Plaintiff "because of and/or in retaliation for Plaintiff's disability" and for requesting accommodations for her disability. (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 35, 45, Doc. 2.) "When a plaintiff alleges retaliatory employment termination either as a claim under the FEHA or as a claim for wrongful employment termination in violation of public policy, and the defendant seeks summary judgment, California follows the burden shifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green (1973) 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 . . . to determine whether there are triable issues of fact for resolution by a jury." Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Internat., 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1108-09, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007). California courts also apply the McDonnell Douglas framework to disability discrimination claims under FEHA. Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 31, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021).
Under the first stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework, an employee "may raise a presumption of discrimination by presenting a prima facie case, the components of which vary with the nature of the claim, but typically require that (1) [the plaintiff] was a member of a protected class [or engaged in a protected activity], (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or [*10]  was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination . . . , and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory [or retaliatory] motive." Joaquin v. City of Los Angeles, 202 Cal. App. 4th 1207, 1220, 136 Cal. Rptr. 3d 472 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a plaintiff successfully establishes a prima facie case for her claims, the defendant may then rebut the plaintiff's case by providing a "legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action." Loggins, 151 Cal. App. at 1109. "If the employer produces evidence showing a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation drops out of the picture, and the burden shifts back to the employee to provide substantial responsive evidence that the employer's proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
As an initial matter, Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case for either of her claims. "The FEHA does not prohibit an employer from . . . discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability, . . . where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Scotch v. Art Inst. of California, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1002, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009) (internal quotation [*11]  marks omitted). Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff could not perform the essential duties of her position due to her disability. As noted in the record, Plaintiff was placed on total disability, i.e., she could not work in any capacity. (See, e.g., Ex. 18 (Henry Johnson Apr. 20, 2022 Depo.) at 54:1-56:4, Doc. 36-20; Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 24, Doc. 37-1.)
However, even if Plaintiff could establish a prima facie case for her claims, Plaintiff has failed to show that the reasons for her termination were pretextual. As an initial matter, Newtek has provided sufficient legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's termination. It is undisputed that Newtek accommodated Plaintiff's disability by extending her leave on at least five different occasions, and that throughout this time, Plaintiff gave no indication when she would return to work or if she would return at all. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 12, Doc. 37-1.) Under California law, "'[r]easonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected.'" See, e.g., Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-27 (1999) (holding that "the undisputed evidence shows that Lucky [Stores, [*12]  Inc.] attempted to reasonably accommodate Hanson, not once, but twice" and there was "no showing that at the time he began his leave, Hanson's prognosis for recovery was not good"). Moreover, as noted above, "[t]he FEHA does not prohibit an employer from . . . discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability, . . . where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with responsible accommodations." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1002 (internal quotation marks omitted). And here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was on total disability, i.e., she could not work in any capacity even with restrictions. (See, e.g., Ex. 18 (Henry Johnson Apr. 20, 2022 Depo.) at 54:1-56:4, Doc. 36-20; Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 24, Doc. 37-1.)
In the face of Newtek's legitimate reasons for termination, it was Plaintiff's burden "to provide substantial responsive evidence that the employer's proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual." Loggins, 151 Cal. App. at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet, Plaintiff failed to carry her burden here, as she offered nothing other than temporal proximity in support of her claim, which is insufficient in face of [*13]  Newtek's legitimate reasons for termination here. (Opp. at 8 ("After Plaintiff sent her last email on October 8, 2019 with the extension of her medical leave, Defendant decided, 7 days later, to terminate her."), Doc. 37.); Loggins, 151 Cal. App. 4th 1102, 1112, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 45 (2007) ("We agree . . . that temporal proximity, although sufficient to shift the burden to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, does not, without more, suffice also to satisfy the secondary burden borne by the employee to show a triable issue of fact on whether the employer's articulated reason was untrue and pretextual."). Indeed, the most obvious reason for Plaintiff's termination was the one proffered by Newtek. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine dispute of fact with respect to this issue.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Newtek as to Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy claim (First Cause of Action), Retaliation in Violation of FEHA claim (Second Cause of Action), and Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA claim (Third Cause of Action).

B. Plaintiffs' Failure to Accommodate (Fourth Cause of Action) Claim
Plaintiff also [*14]  asserts a failure to accommodate claim against Newtek under the FEHA. Under the FEHA, "it is an unlawful employment practice to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship." Wilson v. Cnty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The essential elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Id.
Here, the undisputed record evidence illustrates that no reasonably jury could find in favor of Plaintiff as to the failure to accommodate claim. The record evidence shows that Defendant did accommodate Plaintiff's medical disability by permitting her to take and extend her medical leave on at least five different occasions. See supra p. 2-3. And it is undisputed that throughout this time, Plaintiff gave no indication when she would be returning to work or if she would return at all given her total disability diagnosis. (Plaintiff's [*15]  Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 12, Doc. 37-1; Ex. 18 (Henry Johnson Apr. 20, 2022 Depo.) at 54:1-56:4, Doc. 36-20; Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 24, Doc. 37-1.) While Plaintiff may believe she should have been permitted to take medical leave indefinitely—indefinite leave is not a reasonable accommodation under California law. See, e.g., Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226-27 (1999) ("Reasonable accommodation does not require the employer to wait indefinitely for an employee's medical condition to be corrected." (internal quotation marks omitted); id. at 226 ("We hold that a finite leave can be a reasonable accommodation under FEHA, provided it is likely that at the end of the leave, the employee would be able to perform his or her duties.").
Plaintiff contends that Defendant should have accommodated her other suggestions that they reduce her working hours. (Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed/Undisputed Facts ¶ 7, Doc. 37-1.) However, Plaintiff made her suggestions prior to receiving her disability diagnosis on May 31, 2019 and prior to her making known to Newtek that she had a disability. (See, e.g., Ex. 12 (Michelle Louie Apr. 26, 2022 Depo.) at 35:12-16 (Q: "Is it fair to say at the time you asked for these [*16]  accommodations to Ali you had not been diagnosed with any type of medical condition or disability; right?" A: "No, I was not diagnosed."), 79:12-14 (Q: "Prior to May 31 of 2019, you didn't have any medical condition or disability; correct?" A: "Correct."), Doc. 36-14.)1 As a result, the only accommodation that Plaintiff made in connection with her disability diagnosis was medical leave, which Newtek granted on numerous occasions. With no end in sight, Newtek was not required to extend medical leave indefinitely, especially where Plaintiff's disability prevented her from performing any functions of her job even with restrictions.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Newtek as to Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate (Fourth Cause of Action) claim.

C. Plaintiffs' Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process (Fifth Cause of Action) Claim
The FEHA requires employers to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by the employee." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). Plaintiff alleges that Newtek failed to engage in the interactive process because "Defendants [*17]  terminated Plaintiff because of her disability and/or her requests for accommodations for her disability." (See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 53, Doc. 2.) As set forth above, the record illustrates that Newtek did accommodate Plaintiff's disability by granting and then extending leave on several occasions. See supra p. 2-3. The record further illustrated that Plaintiff's disability rendered her unable to carry out the essential functions of her job, and that there were no indications that Plaintiff's prognosis was improving. Id. In light of these undisputed facts and because California law does not require that Newtek extend medical leave indefinitely, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue as to her Fifth Cause of Action. See Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 829 n.5 (9th Cir. 2004) ("The fact that Ameripride reasonably accommodated Watkins' disability forecloses his allegation that Ameripride failed to engage in the interactive process." (citing Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 229)).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Newtek as to Plaintiff's Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process claim (Fifth Cause of Action).

D. Plaintiffs' Violation of California Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq. Claim
Next, Newtek seeks summary judgment as to Plaintiff's UCL claim premised on allegations that Newtek misclassified [*18]  Plaintiff as "exempt." (Mot. at 16-19, Doc. 36-1; Compl. ¶ 61, Doc. 2.) California wage and hours laws do "not apply to persons employed in administrative, executive, or professional capacities." Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 8, § 11040(1)(A). In this case, Newtek contends that Plaintiff's position was exempt under the administrative exception. (Mem. at 25, Doc. 36-1.) "Under California law, the administrative exemption applies to any employee (1) whose duties and responsibilities involve the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to management policies or general business operations; (2) who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment; and (3) who is primarily engaged in duties that meet the test of exemption." Childs v. Maxim Healthcare Servs., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204784, 2016 WL 11746003, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2016) (Staton, J.) (quoting Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 8, § 11040(1)(A)(2)(a)-(b), (f)). In addition, "an administratively exempt employee must earn a salary that is at least twice the state minimum wage for full-time employment." Id. As the argument that an employee is exempt from the overtime laws is an affirmative defense, "the employer bears the burden of proving the employee's exemption." Ramirez v. Yosemite Water Co., 20 Cal. 4th 785, 794-95, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 844, 978 P.2d 2 (1999).
Here, the Court finds that Newtek has failed to carry its burden. Newtek offers no argument that Plaintiff's "duties and responsibilities involve [*19]  the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to management policies or general business operations." Childs, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204784, 2016 WL 11746003, at *7. Newtek merely argues that Plaintiff exercises discretion in her role as an underwriter. However, whether Plaintiff exercises discretion as an underwriter says little to nothing about whether that work is "directly related to management policies or general business operations." Id. Under California law, to meet the "directly related" element, Newtek must show, among other things, that Plaintiff's responsibilities "directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment." Combs v. Skyriver Commc'ns, Inc., 159 Cal. App. 4th 1242, 1265 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). And Newtek has not made that showing here, noting only that Plaintiff recommended whether loans should be approved or declined with little or no supervision. (Mem. at 25, Doc. 36-1.) Newtek's reliance on McKeen-Chaplin v. Provident Savings Bank, 862 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 2017) is not to the contrary. (Mem. at 25, Doc. 36-1.)
In McKeen, the Ninth Circuit considered "whether a class of mortgage underwriters [were] entitled to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act." McKeen-Chaplin, 862 F.3d at 849. In the case, the Ninth Circuit [*20]  noted that the mortgage underwriters were "responsible for thoroughly analyzing complex customer loan applications and determining borrower creditworthiness in order to ultimately decide whether Provident [the defendant in the case] will accept the requested loan." Id. The underwriters could also "impose conditions on a loan application and refuse to approve the loan until the borrower satisfies those conditions." Id. However, despite these responsibilities, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the work performed by the underwriters did not constitute "work directly related to management or general business operations." Id. at 854 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit held "that where a bank sells mortgage loans and resells the funded loans on the secondary market as a primary font of business, mortgage underwriters who implement guidelines designed by corporate management, and who must ask permission when deviating from protocol, are most accurately considered employees responsible for production, not administrators who manage, guide, and administer the business." Id. McKeen does not stand for the proposition that an underwriter that exercises discretion with little supervision, [*21]  as a matter of law, does work "related to management or general business operations." To the extent that the Defendant argues Plaintiff cannot recover wages unlawfully withheld because of a purported misclassification, Defendant is incorrect. The California Supreme Court has ruled "that orders for payment of wages unlawfully withheld from an employee are also a restitutionary remedy authorized by" the UCL. Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Prod. Co., 23 Cal. 4th 163, 177, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 518, 999 P.2d 706 (2000). Finally, Newtek argues that Plaintiff may not recover civil penalties under the UCL. "In a suit under the UCL, a public prosecutor may collect civil penalties, but a private plaintiff's remedies are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution." Kasky v. Nike, Inc., 27 Cal. 4th 939, 950, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 296, 45 P.3d 243 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Newtek insofar as Plaintiff requests civil penalties under the UCL. In all other respects, summary judgment is DENIED as to the UCL claim.

IV. MOTION FOR RULE 11 SANCTIONS
Rule 11 sanctions are "an extraordinary remedy, [and] one to be exercised with extreme caution." Operating Eng'rs Pension Trust v. A-C Co., 859 F.2d 1336, 1345 (9th Cir. 1988). Conduct sanctionable under Rule 11 includes presenting to the court "claims, defenses, and other legal contentions . . . [not] warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument [*22]  for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law[.]" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2); see also Holgate v. Baldwin, 425 F.3d 671, 675-76 (9th Cir. 2005). Similarly, attorneys are subject to sanctions under Rule 11 when they (1) present anything to the Court "for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation[,]" or (2) submit "factual contentions [that] have [no] evidentiary support or . . . will [not] likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery[.]" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1), (3). It is within the Court's discretion whether to impose an award of monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 11. See, e.g., Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 400, 110 S. Ct. 2447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1990) ("[I]n directing the district court to impose an 'appropriate' sanction, Rule 11 itself indicates that the district court is empowered to exercise its discretion.").
In light of the Court's denial in part of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court finds that monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 are inappropriate.

V. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, Newtek's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as outlined above. Newtek's Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions is DENIED.
