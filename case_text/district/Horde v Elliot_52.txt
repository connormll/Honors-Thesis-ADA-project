ORDER AND REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. INTRODUCTION
The matter comes before the undersigned on: Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands's ("Sharing and Caring Hands") Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 52]; Defendants Officer Elliot,1 Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, Minneapolis City Attorney's Office, and Minneapolis Department of Police Internal Affairs's (collectively, the "Minneapolis Defendants") Motion to Dismiss [Doc. No. 84]; Plaintiff Steven M. Horde's ("Horde") Motion for Leave to File an Amend Complaint ("Motion to Amend") [Doc. No. 69]; Horde's Motion to Obtain a Fee Waiver for Documents [Doc. No. 77]; Horde's Motion to Amend the Parties on Complaint ("Motion to Amend Parties") [Doc. No. 79]; and Horde's Motion to Re-Write Complaint Properly and Amend and Add Assault & Battery (etc.) ("Motion to Re-Write Complaint") [Doc. No. 89].2 This matter was referred [*2]  to the undersigned pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and District of Minnesota Local Rule 72.1 for a report and recommendation. See (Order of Referral) [Doc. No. 45]. For the reasons stated below, this Court recommends that Horde's motions be denied, Sharing and Caring Hands's Motion for Summary Judgment be granted in part and denied in part,3 the Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted in part,4 the Court not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Horde's state law claims, and this case be dismissed. Furthermore, the Court denies Horde's Motion to Obtain a Fee Waiver for Documents.

II. BACKGROUND
Horde commenced this action on March 17, 2017, alleging that he was "[d]enied Equal Protection under the Bill of Rights" because Defendant Officer Elliot knowingly "made a false police report" on the basis of Horde's race, and due to "slander and libel in [a] court case." See (Compl.) [Doc. No. 1 at 4].5 Horde also requested that he be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis, which was granted. See (Appl. to Proceed in District Ct. Without Prepaying Fees or Costs) [Doc. No. 2]; (Order Dated Apr. 6, 2017) [Doc. No. 6]. In quick succession thereafter, Horde filed an Amended Complaint [Doc. No. [*3]  8] and a Revised Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 10]. The Amended Complaint and Revised Amended Complaint are materially the same with respect to their factual allegations and differ only in the claims asserted.6
Horde alleges that he was attacked by Phillip Wylie ("Wylie") at Sharing and Caring Hands "for no reason." (Revised Am. Compl. at 5, ¶ 1). Horde went to the Minneapolis Police station and filed a police report with Officer Elliot. (Id. at 5, ¶ 2). Horde alleges he "showed Officer Elliot [his] bruise on [his] neck, forearm and [his] face was swollen and lip busted." (Id.). Horde alleges that Office Elliot declined to pursue the matter because "everybody wanted something from [Sharing and Caring Hands] and that no one at that facility was going to testify" on Horde's behalf. (Id. at 5, ¶ 3). Horde asserts that Officer Elliot gave him a case number and referred Horde to the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office, but refused to send Horde back to Sharing and Caring Hands in a squad car. See (id. at 5, ¶ 5); (id. at 6, ¶ 8). Horde also alleges that Officer Elliot intentionally filed a false report when he listed the location as the Salvation Army and not Sharing and Caring Hands as Horde requested. (Id. at 6, [*4]  ¶ 7).
Horde asserts that it was not until he received a copy of the police report that he noticed Office Elliot's mistake. (Id. at 7, ¶ 1). Horde alleges that he brought the error to the attention of the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office and filed a corrected police report, but that the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office nevertheless conducted another investigation at the Salvation Army and not Sharing and Caring Hands. (Id. at 7, ¶¶ 2-3). Horde further alleges that it took the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office more than two weeks to get the report back from the Salvation Army investigation—and in the interim—Sharing and Caring Hands had destroyed video footage allegedly showing Wylie striking Horde "with [a] billy club." (Id. at 7, ¶ 5).
Horde then filed a complaint with the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights against Office Elliot. (Id. at 8, ¶ 1). Horde asserts that based on an investigation conducted by the Minneapolis Department of Internal Affairs, the Minnesota Department of Civil Rights informed Horde that he did not have a cause of action against Officer Elliot. (Id. at 8, ¶¶ 1-2). On this basis, Horde alleges that the Minneapolis Department of Internal Affairs unduly influenced the Minnesota Department of Civil [*5]  Rights because "to [his] knowledge, the [Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights] never made an investigation on my case." (Id. at 9, ¶ 7F).
On about June 22, 2015, Horde filed for a restraining order against Wylie pursuant to Minnesota Statutes section 609.748. See (Ex. A, "Pet. for Restraining Order," Affidavit of Phillip J. Wylie in Supp. of Defs. Phillip J. Wylie & Sharing & Caring Hands's Joint Mot. for Summ. J.) [Doc. No. 55-1 at 2].7 Horde's Petition for Restraining Order recited substantially similar facts to those in his pleadings filed with the Court. (Id. at 3). The Petition for Restraining Order outlined certain procedures that would guide the resolution of the petition. Specifically, that Horde "ha[s] a right to request a court hearing"; and "[i]f there is a hearing, [Horde] must attend the hearing and prove that the statements in [his] Petition & Affidavit are true." (Id. at 4). Horde elected to forgo an initial hearing, but requested one should the court determine that "there is no immediate and present danger of harassment." (Id. at 4-5).
On the basis of Horde's Petition for Restraining Order, a Temporary Restraining Order was issued. See (Ex. B, Attached to Wylie Aff.) [Doc. No. 55-1 at 10]. Furthermore, the Minnesota State District Court [*6]  conducted an evidentiary hearing before the Honorable Richard A. Trachy, District Court Referee for Minnesota's Fourth Judicial District, in which both Horde and Wylie were present. (Id. at 7). At the hearing, both Horde and Wylie testified and each called an additional witness. See (id. at 7, 8). In his findings of fact, Referee Trachy concluded that Horde "is found to have no credibility" and that Horde's witness "testified without any semblance of credibility." (Id. at 9). In sum, Referee Trachy concluded that Horde's "account of the event [lacks] any indicia of reliability." (Id.). Conversely, Referee Trachy found Wylie and his witness "basically credible" and "[t]heir descriptions of the event were logical and reasonably consistent." (Id.). Thus, Referee Trachy found this testimony to be "far more truthful and accurate." (Id.). Consequently, Referee Trachy concluded as a matter of law that Horde "completely failed to meet" his burden of proof that Wylie committed the alleged assault "by a fair preponderance of the evidence," vacated the court's temporary restraining order and dismissed Horde's Petition for Restraining Order. (Id. at 9-10).
In the instant action, Horde alleges various claims based on the above [*7]  incidents. Against Officer Elliot, Horde asserts fourteen counts: (1) violations of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) violations of "the Civil Rights Act of 1964"; (3) violations of "Ethical Standards of Conduct by a Law Enforcement Officer"; (4) violations of "the Omnibus Control of Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968"; (5) violations of "42 U.S.C. § 3789.d"; (6) violations of "Obstruction of Justice 18 U.S.C. [§] 1510"; (7) violations of "18 U.S.C. [§] 1505"; (8) violations of "U.S.C. Chapter 73"; (9) violations of "U.S.C. § 1592"; (10) fraud; (11) gross negligence; (12) discrimination under "color of law" in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242; (13) violations of "42 U.S.C. § 14141"; and (14) violations of "the False Claims Act: 31 U.S.C. § 3729." (Revised Am. Compl. at 6).
Horde asserts five counts against the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office: (1) violations of "19 U.S.C. [§] 1592"; (2) violations of "U.S.C. Title 18"; (3) violations of "U.S.C. 1510 chapter 73 title 18"; (4) "18 U.S.C. [§] 1519"; and (5) spoliation of evidence in violation of "Case Law Brookshire Brothers v/s Aldridge." (Id. at 7).
Horde asserts three counts against the Minnesota Department of Civil Rights: (1) violations of "42 U.S.C. § 14141"; (2) violations of "[s]ection 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act [('ADA')] which prohibits discrimination in programs and activities conducted by Federal [*8]  agencies"; and (3) "Sec 3(2) of Sense of Congress on Scientific Integrity." (Id. at 8).
Horde asserts six counts against the Minneapolis Division of Internal Affairs: (1) violations of "18 U.S.C. § 242 — deprivation of rights under Color of Law"; (2) violations of "U.S.C. § 1983";8 (3) violations of "the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution"; (4) violations of "Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"; (5) violations of the ADA; and (6) violations of "42 U.S.C. § 641." (Id. at 9).
Horde asserts nine claims against Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands based on Wylie's conduct: (1) violations of Horde's First Amendment Rights to Freedom of Speech; (2) violations of the "Postal Regulation Federal Law Title 18, Section 1705"; (3) violations of "42 U.S.C. § 3058"; (4) violations of the "Vulnerable Adults Act"; (5) "Obstruction of Justice 18 U.S. Code § 1510"; (6) violations of "18 U.S.C. § 1705"; (7) violations of "18 U.S.C. § 1703"; (8) violations of "18 U.S.C. § 1621"; and (9) violations of "18 U.S.C. § 1001." (Id. at 10).
On the basis of Horde's asserted claims, he seeks $17,000,000 from the Minneapolis Defendants and $1,000,000 from Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands. (Id. at 11).
On July 26, 2017, Horde moved for a temporary restraining order against Wylie during the pendency of Horde's lawsuit. See (Mot. for TRO) [Doc. No. 23]; (Mem. in Supp. of Issuance of a TRO) [Doc. No. 25]. The Honorable Wilhelmina [*9]  M. Wright, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, denied Horde's Motion for TRO because "Wylie is not a party to this lawsuit. Wylie is neither named as a defendant in Horde's amended complaint, nor has Wylie been served a summons or complaint. Thus, this Court has no authority to grant Horde's requested relief." (Order Dated Aug. 3, 2017) [Doc. No. 44 at 3].
On August 9, 2017, Sharing and Caring Hands filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. (Mot. for Summ. J.). In support, Sharing and Caring Hands asserts that Horde's claims against it are barred by the doctrines of issue and claim preclusion on the basis of the adjudication of Horde's petition for a restraining order that he filed in Minnesota state court. See (Def. Sharing & Caring Hands's Mem. of Law in Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J., "Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J.") [Doc. No. 54 at 4-5]. Specifically, Sharing and Caring Hands argues that
Each of the elements for issue and claim preclusion is met in this case. In connection with Plaintiff's Ex-Parte Petition for a Harassment Restraining Order, Plaintiff alleged the same facts that he has alleged in this case. Plaintiff and Wylie participated in an evidentiary hearing. [*10]  During the hearing, both parties testified and presented additional evidence. The Referee issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, on the merits. The Findings and Conclusions were approved by the District Court. Under Minn. Stat. § 484.70 (2017), "[t]he recommended findings and orders of a referee become the findings and orders of the court when confirmed by a judge. The order of the court shall be proof of such confirmation, and also of the fact that the matter was duly referred to the referee." Id. The decision in the Hennepin County case constitutes a final judgment on the merits issued by the Hennepin County District Court.
(Id. at 5). Alternatively, Sharing and Caring Hands asserts that Horde's Revised Amended Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted because none of the constitutional or statutory provisions under which Horde is seeking relief allows for private causes of action. (Id. at 6-9).
Horde argues that claim and issue preclusion do not apply because he is asserting claims of obstruction of justice against "Phillip J. Wylie of Sharing and Caring Hands, not a hearing for a restraining order based on the outcome of that hearing." (Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. [*11]  J. at 1). As a result, Horde asserts that "[r]es [j]udicata and estoppel do not apply to the [c]harge of [o]bstruction of [j]ustice because this is the actual [c]harge and has not been ruled on." (Id.). Horde also reiterates his claims under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001, 1501, and 1621 and alleges that the judge who presided over the state court proceeding "was biased and never looked at my medical records." (Id. at 2-3). Furthermore, Horde alleges—for the first time—that Sharing and Caring Hands's conduct vis-à-vis Wylie violated 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b), 1622, and 1623. See (Mot. to Deny Summ. J. at 2). Horde does not provide a rebuttal argument related to Sharing and Caring Hands's argument that Horde's asserted federal statutes do not provide for private causes of action. See generally (Mot. to Deny Summ. J.); (Mem. in Opp'n to Summ. J.). Sharing and Caring hands argues in reply that none of these statutes, even the ones Horde asserted for the first time in his Motion to Deny Summary Judgment "give rise to a private right of action." See (Sharing & Caring Hands's Reply Mem. in Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J.) [Doc. No. 67 at 1].
The Court received Horde's Motion to Amend on August 31, 2017. (Mot. to Amend). Horde asserts that he "does not seek to add additional [*12]  facts" but wishes to "include Phillip J. Wylie and Justice Turner of Sharing and Caring Hands" to the operative pleading. (Mot. to Amend at 1, 2); see also (New Am. Compl., "Proposed Am. Compl." Attached to Mot. to Amend) [Doc. No. 69-1 at 3].
The Proposed Amended Complaint differs marginally from the Revised Amended Complaint. In particular, Horde asserts three counts against the Minneapolis Division of Internal Affairs: (1) "[s]ection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973"; (2) "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d)"; and (3) "49 U.S.C. § 306." (Proposed Am. Compl. at 12). Horde also asserts two counts against Sharing and Caring Hands: (1) negligence because "the Video Camera System was not working properly to protect the General Public at large"; and (2) vicarious liability for the acts of Wylie. (Id.). Furthermore, Horde's Proposed Amended Complaint asserts five claims against Wylie: (1) "Mail Tampering"; (2) "Obstruction of Justice"; (3) "Assault on a vulnerable adult"; (4) "Perjury in a court of law during a criminal Proceeding"; and (5) "Conspiracy to perpetuate a Fraud." (Id.). Horde also asserts three claims against Justice Turner ("Turner"): (1) "Perjury"; (2) "Conspiracy to Perpetuate a Fraud"; [*13]  and (3) "Collusion." (Id.).
In support of his Motion to Amend, Horde argues that the amendments would be neither prejudicial nor futile. (Mot. to Amend at 1); see also (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Amend) [Doc. No. 71] (citing Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the standard articulated in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)). Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands and Minneapolis Defendants both opposed Horde's Motion to Amend asserting that Horde's amendments would be futile. See (Sharing & Caring Hands's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Amend at 2); (Def. City of Minneapolis' Mem. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. to Am. the Compl., "Minneapolis's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Amend") [Doc. No. 75 at 2].
As it relates to claims in the Proposed Amended Complaint, Sharing and Caring Hands argues that it does not owe Horde or the public at large a duty which "is a threshold legal question for a negligence claim." See (Sharing & Caring Hands's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Amend at 2-3). Sharing and Caring Hands also asserts that Horde's claims against Wylie for "mail tampering, obstruction of justice and perjury in a court of law during a criminal proceeding" are futile because
Plaintiff has already asserted these claims against Sharing and Caring Hands. As discussed in Sharing and Caring [*14]  Hands's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 37) and Reply Memorandum (Doc. No. 43), there is no private right of action for these claims. Therefore, Plaintiff's amendment to assert these claims against Wylie would be futile.
(Id. at 3). With respect to the remaining claims Sharing and Caring Hands asserts that "Wylie is not a mandated reporter" under the Vulnerable Adults Act codified at Minnesota Statutes section 626.557. See (id. at 3-4). With respect to Horde's fraud claim, Sharing and Caring Hands asserts that Horde failed to plead fraud with the required level of specificity because "Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint contains no specific material facts demonstrating an agreement between Wylie and another party to injure Plaintiff. Therefore, Plaintiff's proposed amendment to assert conspiracy to perpetrate a fraud is futile." (Id. at 4). Finally, Sharing and Caring Hands argues that because Horde has otherwise failed to substantiate claims against Wylie, Horde's vicarious liability claim necessarily fails because "[v]icarious liability is not a claim. Since Plaintiff has not asserted any viable claims against Wylie, Sharing and Caring Hands has no vicarious liability. Plaintiff's proposed amendment [*15]  asserting vicarious liability is futile." (Id. at 5).
Minneapolis Defendants assert that many of Horde's claims are directed at entities that cannot be sued under the Minneapolis charter and that Horde has "failed to allege sufficient facts that would give rise to any constitutional or tort claim against Officer Elliot or the City." See (Minneapolis's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Amend at 5). In particular, Minneapolis Defendants argue that only Officer Elliot can be sued. See (id. at 6-7) ("Because the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office, the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, and Internal Affairs Division of the Minneapolis Police Department are not suable entities, all counts against these Defendants are not legally cognizable.").
For Horde's claims against Officer Elliot, Minneapolis Defendants assert multiple rationales as to why Horde's claims are futile: (1) Office Elliot is entitled to qualified immunity for alleged violations of Horde's Due Process Rights; (2) Horde has failed to plead facially a violation of his Equal Protection Rights; (3) application of official immunity bars Horde's tort claims for gross negligence and fraud; and (4) Horde's claims arising under various federal statutes fail [*16]  because some of Horde's claims rely on ambiguous recitations of statutory provisions; Horde has not alleged sufficient facts to support violations of the asserted federal statutes; and the statutes at issue do not give rise to private causes of action. (Id. at 8-20).
Regarding 18 §§ U.S.C. 241, 242, 1505, 1501, Minneapolis Defendants assert "[t]hese criminal statutes are not enforceable by private parties." (Id. at 14). With respect to 42 U.S.C. § 3789d, Minneapolis Defendants assert that "Plaintiff does not make any allegations that Officer Elliott prevented him from benefiting from, or subjected him to discrimination under, any program or activity funded by the Safe Streets Act" and even if he did, Horde failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. § 3789d. (Id. at 15-16). Furthermore, Minneapolis Defendants assert that 42 U.S.C. § 3789d does not allow for the award of monetary damages. (Id. at 16).
With respect to Horde's claims arising under 42 U.S.C. § 14141, Minneapolis Defendants assert "[t]hese claims are not properly before the Court because there is no private cause of action for violations of this statute" because "the exclusive power to bring a civil action [is granted] to the Attorney General." (Id. at 16). Minneapolis Defendants also assert that Horde's alleged violations [*17]  of the False Claims Act ("FCA"), codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3729, are facially deficient because he "has not pled any facts relating to Officer Elliott or anyone else falsely claiming right to payment by the United States." (Id. at 17). Furthermore, Minneapolis Defendants argue that claims under the FCA must be brought as "a qui tam action in the name of the United States" and Horde "has not brought this action in the prescribed manner." (Id.).
Minneapolis Defendants also assert that Horde's alleged violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are facially deficient because Horde only "makes conclusory allegations that he was a victim of discrimination, but never ties his statements to his race, color, or national origin, the only classifications prohibited by Title VI. Plaintiff also fails to support his allegations of discrimination with any relevant factual allegations." (Id. at 18). Finally, with respect to statutory provisions "U.S.C. Chapter 73," "U.S.C. [§] 1592," and "U.S.C. Title 18," Minneapolis Defendants assert these alleged violations "cannot give rise to a plausible claim that Defendants are liable" because Horde "has not identified which statutes the Defendants allegedly violated." (Id. at 18-19). Likewise, Minneapolis Defendants [*18]  argue that Horde's allegations of violations of "Ethical Standards of Conduct by a Law Enforcement Office" is not cognizable because it is unclear what law—if any—is alleged to have been violated. (Id. at 19).
As it relates to their Motion to Dismiss, Minneapolis Defendants assert the same arguments that it raised in its opposition to Horde's Motion to Amend—namely, that the Minneapolis Police Department, Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, and Minneapolis Department of Police Internal Affairs (collectively, the "Minneapolis Entities") are not suable entities and claims directed thereto should be dismissed. See (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 6-7). Also, Minneapolis Defendants again argue: (1) Office Elliot is entitled to qualified immunity for alleged violations of Horde's Due Process Rights; (2) Horde has failed to plead facially a violation of his Equal Protection Rights; (3) application of official immunity bars Horde's tort claims for gross negligence and fraud; and (4) Horde's claims arising under various federal statutes fail because some of Horde's claims rely on ambiguous recitations of statutory provisions; Horde has not alleged sufficient facts to support violations of the [*19]  asserted federal statutes; and the statutes at issue do not give rise to private causes of action. (Id. at 11-20).

III. DISCUSSION
The issues raised by Horde's Motions to Amend and Defendants' respective dispositive motions are interrelated and dispositive of the issues before the Court. For example, if this Court determines that Horde should be granted leave to amend his operative pleading, it arguably impacts this Court's recommendation with respect to the dispositive motions before it. See Pure Country, Inc. v. Sigma Chi Fraternity, 312 F.3d 952, 956 (8th Cir. 2002) ("If anything, Pure Country's motion to amend the complaint rendered moot Sigma Chi's motion to dismiss the original complaint."); Gay-Lesbian-Bisexual-Transgender Pride/Twin Cities v. Minneapolis Park & Recreation Bd., No. 10-cv-2579 (JRT/JJG), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36794, 2011 WL 1300381, at *2 (D. Minn. Apr. 4, 2011) (Tunheim, J.) (finding that an amended complaint would render "the original complaint without legal effect" and therefore denying a motion for summary judgment directed to the original complaint as moot). This Court, therefore, makes recommendations with respect to Horde's Motions to Amend and Defendants' dispositive motions, rather than issue an order on the Motions to Amend.
That being said, because most of the claims in the Revised Amended Complaint (which is the operative [*20]  pleading) are included in the Proposed Amended Complaint (which is the subject of the Motion to Amend), the Court first addresses the Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Sharing and Caring Hands's Motion for Summary Judgment before addressing Horde's Motion to Amend. Under this analysis, the Court recommends that the dispositive motions be granted as described herein and concludes that nothing in the Motions to Amend cure the myriad deficiencies identified in the Revised Amend Complaint, rendering any amendments subject to the Motions to Amend futile. The Court, therefore, also recommends that Horde's Motions to Amend be denied.

A. Motion to Dismiss

1. Legal Standard

To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

2. Analysis
The Court recommends that the Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted to the extent that Horde's federal [*21]  constitutional and statutory claims fail to state a claim for relief. Furthermore, the Court sua sponte recommends that the Court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, and further recommends dismissing those claims as well.

a. Claims Against the Minneapolis Entities
The Minneapolis City Attorney's Office, Department of Civil Rights, and Division of Internal Affairs are not suable entities under the Minnesota Charter and are therefore are not proper defendants. In particular, "Minneapolis is a home rule charter city, whose charter provides that the City may sue or be sued. However, the Civil Rights Department . . . [is] only an operational department[]" and not a separate legal entity "that may sue or be sued." Corbett v. City Ctr., No. 01-cv-200 (MJD/JGL), 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27490, 2001 WL 1640108, at *1 (D. Minn. July 16, 2001) (Davis, J.) (citations omitted). Like the Civil Rights Department, the Division of Internal Affairs and the City Attorney's Office are not separate legal entities that may sue or be sued—unlike other entities established by the Minneapolis Charter. Compare Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordnances tit. 16, ch. 426, § 426.90 (2017) (establishing the Minneapolis Indian Housing Authority and expressly granting it [*22]  the power to sue or be sued), with id. tit. 9, ch. 172 (establishing a department of internal affairs, but failing to give it the right to sue or be sued), id. tit. 2, ch. 25 (establishing the City Attorney's Office, failing to give it the right to sue or be sued, and specifying that its duties are circumscribed by the determinations of the City Council). "Dismissal against [these] entities is therefore appropriate." Corbett, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27490, 2001 WL 1640108, at *1.
Even if Horde's Revised Amended Complaint is construed to raise claims against suable entities, such as the City of Minneapolis (the "City"), Horde's claims would still fail to state a claim for relief, for various reasons now described.9

i. Constitutional Claims
Horde asserts a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. See (Revised Am. Compl. at 9). "The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Thus, the first step in an equal protection case is determining whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that [he] was treated differently than others who were similarly situated to [him]." Klinger v. Dep't of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir. 1994). That is, "[a]bsent [*23]  a threshold showing that [he] is similarly situated to those who allegedly receive favorable treatment, the plaintiff does not have a viable equal protection claim." Id. Horde has failed to allege that he was treated differently than others similarly situated to him. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.). Specifically, Horde's Revised Amend Complaint fails to assert that any group (let alone one similarly situated) received favorable treatment. See generally (id.). Because Horde has not pleaded sufficient facts to establish disparate treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment, his claims directed thereto cannot support a claim for relief and should be dismissed. See Klinger, 31 F.3d at 733; see also Johnson v. City of Minneapolis, 152 F.3d 859, 862-63 (8th Cir. 1998).

ii. Claims Under Federal Statutes
Horde asserts a long list of federal statutes in his claims against the City: (1) 19 U.S.C. § 1592; (2) "U.S.C 18"; (3) "U.S.C. 1510 chapter 73 title 18"; (4) 18 U.S.C. § 1519; (5) 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 12601); (6) Section 504 of the ADA;10 (7) 18 U.S.C. § 242; (8) 42 U.S.C § 1983; (9) and Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000d); and (10) "42 U.S.C. § 641." See (Revised Am. Compl. at 7-9).
"[P]rivate rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress." Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001). For laws enacted by Congress, "[t]he judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it [*24]  displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy." Id. In general, courts first look to the plain language of the statutory text to determine congressional intent. See United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1997) (stating that when statutory language is clear "there is no reason to resort to legislative history" to determine its meaning).
As an initial matter, it is unclear what statutory provisions Horde is asserting when he references "U.S.C. 18."11 See (Revised Am. Compl. at 7). Thus any amendments related to "U.S.C. 18" are improperly pleaded and claims directed thereto should be dismissed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 (requiring "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief"); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 687 (finding that the operative pleading failed "to plead sufficient facts to state a claim" on the basis of failures to comply with Rule 8).
The Court is also mindful that it must construe Horde's filings liberally. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976); Spencer v. Haynes, 774 F.3d 467, 471 (8th Cir. 2014); Stone v. Harry, 364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir. 2004); Miller v. Norris, 247 F.3d 736, 739 (8th Cir. 2001). Thus, for example, while Horde's assertion of "U.S.C. 1510 chapter 73 title 18" is not a model of clarity, it appears as if he is attempting to assert one or more statutes under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 73, which addresses issues related to obstruction of justice. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501-21. [*25]  The Court will analyze this particular claim under that assumption.
Importantly, under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 73—including 18 U.S.C. § 1519, which Horde asserts—there is no private right of action under these statutes. See, e.g., Townsend v. Pub. Storage Inc., No. 1:13-cv-01600, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60088, 2014 WL 1764432, at *4-5 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2014) (stating "Plaintiff may not bring her action as a claim for obstruction of justice under any of the statutes in the section on obstruction of justice" and citing cases); Hopson v. Aguair Law Office, No. 3:12CV-722-M, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56372, 2013 WL 1703862 at *2 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 19, 2013) (holding "[t]he federal obstruction of justice statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501 et seq., do not provide for a private cause of action or civil remedies" and citing cases). As a result, there is no relief to be granted on these claims.
As it relates to 19 U.S.C. § 1592, Horde's claim under this statute is defective for a number of reasons. 19 U.S.C. § 1592 defines penalties for fraud, gross negligence, and negligence regarding the collection "of any lawful duty, tax, or fee." Horde has failed to plead sufficient facts to establish that the United States was deprived "of any lawful duty, tax, or fee" as required under this statute. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.). Even if he had, Horde's assertion of this statute cannot state a claim for relief because no private cause of action or private [*26]  remedy exists under 19 U.S.C. § 1592. Specifically, enforcement of this statute is given exclusively to the Customs Service, which may issue "written notice of its intention to [seek] a claim for a monetary penalty." See 19 U.S.C. § 1592(b). In other words, there is nothing to suggest from the language of 19 U.S.C. § 1592 that Congress intended to confer a private right of action or a private remedy under 19 U.S.C. § 1592. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286. Thus, any claims premised on 19 U.S.C. § 1592 fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted.
As it relates to Horde's alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 12601), these claims are defective for similar reasons. In particular, 34 U.S.C. § 12601 makes it unlawful for law enforcement agents "to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct . . . that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States." Horde has failed to allege any facts that would suggest that Minneapolis Defendants have engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that has deprived Horde of his constitutional rights. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.). Even if he had—like 19 U.S.C. § 1592-34 U.S.C. § 12601 does not provide for a private right of action or private remedy because only the Attorney General may bring a civil action under the statute. [*27]  See 34 U.S.C. § 12601(b). Thus, there is no claim for which relief can be granted under 34 U.S.C. § 12601.
Horde's claims arising under "Section 504 of the ADA" fare no better. "Section 504 of the ADA" is presumed to be section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 12204. See Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, § 504, 104 Stat. 327, 370 (1990). Section 12204 specifies that guidelines must be established "to ensure that buildings, facilities, rail passenger cars, and vehicles are accessible, in terms of architecture and design, transportation, and communication, to individuals with disabilities." See 42 U.S.C. § 12204(b). On its face, there is nothing to suggest that this statutory provision has any relationship to the factual allegations in Horde's Revised Amended Complaint. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.). Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss should be granted in this respect.12
Horde's claims arising under 18 U.S.C. § 242 also necessarily fail to state a claim because it is well-settled that 18 U.S.C. § 242 does not provide a private right of action. See, e.g., Davis v. Norwood, 614 F. App'x 602, 605 (3d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) ("The Magistrate Judge correctly concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 242 . . . does not provide a private right of action."); Houck v. Gurich, 515 F. App'x 724, 724 (10th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) ("The district court dismissed Houck's complaint for failure to state a claim because 18 U.S.C. § 242 provides no private right of action. The district court is [*28]  correct."); Moore v. Potter, 47 F. App'x 318, 320 (6th Cir. 2002) ("Finally, the district court properly dismissed Moore's claim pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 242 because Moore has no private right of action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 242, a criminal statute.").
Horde's claims arising under alleged "Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964," codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, are also facially defective. "To establish the elements of a prima facie case under Title VI, a complaining party must demonstrate that his/her race, color, or national origin was the motive for the discriminatory conduct." Thompson v. Bd. of the Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 144 F.3d 574, 581 (8th Cir. 1998); see also Mumid v. Abraham Lincoln High Sch., 618 F.3d 789, 794 (8th Cir. 2010) (stating "Title VI prohibits only intentional discrimination"). Horde has failed to support his allegations in his Revised Amended Complaint beyond conclusory allegations that the City's conduct was based on racial animus. See (Revised Am. Compl. at 7-9). In fact, discrimination of any kind is hardly mentioned in the assertions against the City. See (id. at 8) (alleging that "even though it was apparent that [Horde] had been discriminated [against] by Officer Elliot," the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights did not conduct an investigation). These conclusory allegations fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted and the Motion to Dismiss should be granted in this respect. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
Horde's [*29]  allegations arising under "42 U.S.C. § 641" cannot support a claim for relief because this statutory provision does not exist.13 Furthermore, the Court is unable to determine which of the statutory provisions in the U.S. Code Horde intended to assert. Thus, Horde's claim under "42 U.S.C. § 641" should be dismissed.
Finally, Horde's 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim cannot sustain a claim for relief for at least two reasons. First, to the extent that Horde is asserting 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as an independent basis for relief, his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim fails as a matter of law because 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is not an independent source of substantive rights. See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n.3, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979) ("It is for violations of such constitutional and statutory rights that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 authorizes redress; that section is not itself a source of substantive rights, but a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred by those parts of the United States Constitution and federal statutes that it describes."). Second, to the extent that Horde is asserting his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim as a means to vindicate his federal constitutional and statutory rights, this too fails to support a claim for relief. Specifically, as described throughout this Order and Report and Recommendation, Horde has failed to allege a cognizable federal constitutional or statutory violation. [*30]  Consequently, "[h]aving been deprived of no rights secured under the United States Constitution, [Horde has] no claim cognizable under § 1983." Id. at 146-47.

iii. Other Claims
Horde also asserts claims on the basis of alleged "violations" of "Brookshire Brothers[, Ltd.] v. Aldridge [438 S.W.3d 9 (Tex. 2014)]" and "Sec 3(2) of Sense of Congress on Scientific Integrity[, S. 338, 115th Congress (2017), available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/338/text]." See (Revised Am. Compl. at 7, 8). Neither of these assertions state a claim for which relief can be granted.
As it relates to Horde's claim arising under Brookshire Brothers, there are a number of problems. Specifically, to the extent that Horde is asserting that the City be held liable for tortuous spoliation, spoliation is a state-law issue. See Wilson v. Beloit Corp., 921 F.2d 765, 767 (8th Cir. 1990). Importantly, Minnesota courts do not recognize an independent tort for spoliation of evidence. See Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v. Litchfield Precision Components, Inc., 456 N.W.2d 434, 436-37 (Minn. 1990); see also Spaise v. Dodd, No. A03-1430, 2004 Minn. App. LEXIS 607, 2004 WL 1191942 at *11 (Minn. Ct. App. June 1, 2004) ("Minnesota courts have specifically rejected the invitation to adopt spoliation as a separate tort." (citing Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 456 N.W.2d at 436-37)). Instead, spoliation of evidence is typically addressed through a discovery sanction. Patton v. Newmar Corp., 538 N.W.2d 116, 119 (Minn. 1995); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 37. Thus, there is no independent claim for relief for spoliation and [*31]  this claim should be dismissed.14
With respect to Horde's allegations arising under Senate Bill 388 §3(2), this bill has not been enacted and does not carry with it the force of law. See generally S. 388. Furthermore, it is unclear how a bill designed to "protect scientific integrity in Federal research and policymaking" is in any way relevant to Horde's allegations that the City discriminated against him in the manner in which it conducted its investigations. See id.; see also (Revised Am. Compl. at 8). As a result, Horde's allegation that the City violated "Sec 3(2) of Sense of Congress on Scientific Integrity" fails to state a claim for relief.

b. Claims Against Officer Elliot

i. Constitutional Claims
Horde alleges that Officer Elliot violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. See (Revised Am. Compl. at 6). The Fourteenth Amendment includes protections of both due process and equal protection rights. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Horde's alleged violations of either his due process or his equal protection rights fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted.
Under the Due Process Clause, Horde must not be denied a protected liberty interest without due process of law. See id. The Due Process Clause "has two components: the procedural due process and the substantive due process [*32]  components." Singleton v. Cecil, 176 F.3d 419, 424 (8th Cir. 1999) (citing County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998)). "Analysis of either a procedural or substantive due process claim must begin with an examination of the interest allegedly violated." Dover Elevator Co. v. Ark. State Univ., 64 F.3d 442, 445-46 (8th Cir. 1995). To that end, the Fourteenth Amendment circumscribes deprivations of "life, liberty, or property." Id.; see also Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972) ("The requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of liberty and property."). Horde appears to be asserting that Officer Elliot's failure to conduct a proper investigation infringed on his protected liberty interests. See (Revised Am. Compl. at 6). The Fourteenth Amendment's protections do not extend this far. "[T]he Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual." DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989). "Thus, there is no constitutional violation where the government refuses to investigate a crime . . . ." Bernstein v. New York, 591 F. Supp. 2d 448, 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Likewise, there is no constitutional violation because Horde is dissatisfied with the manner in which the Minneapolis Defendants conducted their investigation. Cf. DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 196; Bernstein, 591 F. Supp. 2d at 460. That being said, the Due Process Clause may be asserted where there are protected liberty interests created by a state. [*33]  See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 226, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1976); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). Horde does not allege that a Minnesota state statute confers a protected liberty interest in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing. See generally (Rev. Am. Compl.). Because Horde has not asserted a cognizable protected liberty interest that was infringed, he has failed to state a claim for relief and allegations under the Due Process Clause should be dismissed.15
As it relates to Horde's equal protection claim, the Court has already discussed this in relation to claims asserted against the City. Specifically, Horde has failed to allege that he was treated differently than others similarly situated. See Klinger, 31 F.3d at 733 (stating "the [*34]  first step in an equal protection case is determining whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that [he] was treated differently than others who were similarly situated to [him]"). Because Horde has not pleaded sufficient facts to establish disparate treatment under the Equal Protection Clause, his claim directed thereto against Officer Elliot fails as a matter of law and should be dismissed. See Klinger, 31 F.3d at 733; see also Johnson, 152 F.3d at 862-63.

ii. Claims Under Federal Statutes
Horde asserts claims under multiple federal statutes: (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) the Omnibus Control of Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968; (3) 42 U.S.C. § 3789d (now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 10228); (4) 18 U.S.C. § 1510; (5) 18 U.S.C. § 1505; (6) "U.S.C. Chapter 73"; (7) "U.S.C. § 1592"; (8) 18 U.S.C. § 241; (9) 18 U.S.C. § 242; (10) 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 12601); and (11) "The False Claims Act" (codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3729). See (Revised Am. Compl. at 7-9). None of these statutes provide claims for relief.
First, the Court addresses Minneapolis Defendants' argument that Horde's allegations arising under "U.S.C. Chapter 73" and "U.S.C. § 1592" are indeterminable. See (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 19). The Court disagrees. In light of a liberal construction of the pleading generally, it is reasonable to believe that Horde intended to assert 18 U.S.C. Chapter 73 and 19 U.S.C. § 1592. See (Revised Am. [*35]  Compl. at 7) (asserting those statutes). Nevertheless, this liberal construction does not save Horde's claims. In particular, the Court has already addressed these statutory claims above and found them lacking for various reasons, including that the statutes asserted do not provide for private causes of action. See, e.g., Townsend, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60088, 2014 WL 1764432, at *4-5 (stating "Plaintiff may not bring her action as a claim for obstruction of justice under any of the statutes in the section on obstruction of justice" and citing cases); Hopson, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56372, 2013 WL 1703862, at *2 (holding "[t]he federal obstruction of justice statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501 et seq., do not provide for a private cause of action or civil remedies" and citing cases); see also 19 U.S.C. § 1592 (unequivocally establishing that enforcements is given exclusively to the Customs Service); Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286.
Likewise, the Court has already determined that Horde's claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000d), 18 U.S.C. §§ 242, 1505, 1510, and 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 12601) fail to state a claim for relief.16 The same reasons that support a finding that Horde's claims against the City fail to state a claim for relief are equally determinative as it relates to Horde's claims against Officer Elliot. For brevity, therefore, the Court will not repeat itself here. Furthermore, for similar reasons, [*36]  Horde cannot assert a claim for relief under 18 U.S.C. § 241. Specifically, it is well-settled that 18 U.S.C. § 241 does not provide for a private cause of action. See, e.g., Storm-Eggink v. Gottfried, 409 F. App'x 426, 427 (2nd Cir. 2011); United States v. Wadena, 152 F.3d 831, 845 (8th Cir. 1998); Cok v. Cosentino, 876 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam).
Horde's remaining statutory claims against Office Elliot also fail to state a claim for relief. The Omnibus Control of Crime and Safe Streets Act is codified in multiple titles in the U.S. Code, making review somewhat more challenging than other acts that Horde asserts. See Pub. L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197,, available at https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Omnibus%20 Crime%20Control%20And%20Safe%20Streets%20Act%20Of%201968.pdf (inclusive of all amendments to the act, including the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017, Public Law 115-76 (2017)). The only loosely relevant statutory provision that the Court could independently identify is 34 U.S.C. § 10228,17 which generally addresses the prohibition against discrimination against programs "funded in whole or in part . . . under this chapter."
Horde's allegations under 34 U.S.C. § 10228 do not state a claim for relief for various reasons. First, because Horde "has not identified any program funded by the Safe Streets Act connected to the discrimination [he] has alleged, there is no plausible basis for claims under this statute." Suber-Aponte v. Borough of Pottstown, No. 15-1314, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130197, 2016 WL 5341299, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 23, 2016). [*37]  Second, even if Horde had properly pleaded his allegations under 34 U.S.C. § 10228, a civil action may only be brought after "after exhaustion of administrative remedies." See 34 U.S.C. § 10228 (c)(4)(A). In order to exhaust administrative remedies under the statute an "administrative complaint [must be] filed with the Office of Justice Programs or any other administrative enforcement agency." Id. Here, there is no suggestion that Horde exhausted his administrative remedies, which would preclude the Court from granting relief sought under 34 U.S.C. § 10228. See Nash v. City of Oakwood, 541 F. Supp. 220, 223 (S.D. Ohio 1982) (dismissing claims under 42 U.S.C. § 3789, now codified at 34 U.S.C. § 10228, for failure to exhaust administrative remedies).
Finally, Horde's allegations of violations under the False Claims Act, codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733 also fail to state a claim for relief. Under the False Claims Act, actions by private actors can only be brought as a qui tam action. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b). In other words, Horde cannot bring a private cause of action under the False Claims Act unless he brought those claims "in the name of the Government." See id. He has not done so here, and the Court cannot create a new private cause of action absent Congressional intent. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-87. Consequently, the Court cannot grant relief for Horde's claim asserting violations under the False Claims Act [*38] , and this claim should be dismissed.

iii. State Law/Other Claims
Horde's claim asserting a violation of the "ethical standards of conduct by a law enforcement officer" is facially defective. See (Rev. Am. Compl. at 6). He points to no statute that would provide relief for the alleged violations and this claim should be dismissed.
To the extent that Horde is asserting claims for fraud or gross negligence, these claims should be dismissed for various reasons. First, Horde's state-law fraud claim arguably fails under the heightened pleading standards espoused in Rule 9. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9. In particular, Horde "must plead the time, place and contents of the false representations, the identity of the individual who made the representations and what was obtained thereby." E-Shops Corp. v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n, 795 F. Supp. 2d 874, 877 (D. Minn. 2011) (Doty, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, even construed liberally, Horde has failed to specify what was obtained by Officer Elliot on the basis of his alleged fraudulent misrepresentations. As a result, Horde's fraud claim against Office Elliot is improperly pleaded and should be dismissed. See id.
Furthermore, to the extent that Horde is asserting state-law fraud and gross negligence claims, the Court should decline supplemental [*39]  jurisdiction over these claims and dismiss them.18 Specifically, because the Court has determined that none of Horde's federal claims provide grounds for which relief can be granted, retaining supplemental jurisdiction over the purely state-law issues is not appropriate. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) (stating that a court may decline supplemental jurisdiction where there is no "claims over which it has original jurisdiction"); United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966) (stating a court should consider "judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants" as well as matters of comity when determining whether a court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims.)
In general, where no federal claims survive before trial, the four-factor test in Gibbs strongly weighs in favor of declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988) (stating "in the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine—judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity—will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims"); see also Gregoire v. Class, 236 F.3d 413, 420 (8th Cir. 2000) ("We stress the need to exercise judicial restraint and avoid state law issues wherever [*40]  possible." (internal quotation marks omitted)); Ivy v. Kimbrough, 115 F.3d 550, 552-53 (8th Cir. 1997) (stating "when federal and state claims are joined and the federal claims are dismissed . . ., the pendent state claims are dismissed without prejudice to avoid '[n]eedless decisions of state law . . . as a matter of comity'" (quoting Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726)). The mere act of asserting federal statutes does not save Horde in this regard; federal statutes that do not contemplate a private right of action fail to confer federal jurisdiction. Johnson v. Parker Hughes Clinics, No. 04-cv-4130 (PAM/RLE), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2 (D. Minn. Jan. 13, 2005) (Magnuson, J.) (stating Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 808, 106 S. Ct. 3229, 92 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1986), "stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction cannot be based on a federal statute that does not provide a private cause of action").
Here, there is nothing unique with respect to the state-law claims that Horde raises and matters of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity strongly weigh in favor of declining supplemental jurisdiction in this instance. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7. Furthermore, the Court "may, sua sponte, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a pendent state-law claim if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." Thill v. Olmstead County Housing & Redevelopment Authority, No. 08-cv-5404 (RHK/AJB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28949, 2010 WL 1257676, at *3 (D. Minn. Mar. 26, 2010) (Kyle, [*41]  J.) (citing Johnson v. City of Shorewood, 360 F.3d 810, 819 (8th Cir. 2004)). As a result, the Court should sua sponte dismiss the state-law claims and not address the state-law questions. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 419-20; Thill, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28949, 2010 WL 1257676, at *3.
In sum, Horde's federal claims against the Minneapolis Defendants should be dismissed for failure to state a claim and the Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Horde's remaining state law clams. The Court therefore recommends that Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be granted in part and all claims against the Minneapolis Defendants be dismissed.

B. Motion for Summary Judgment

1. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In other words, "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (emphasis omitted). "[A] dispute about a material fact is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of either party." White v. Farrier, 849 F.2d 322, 325 (8th Cir. 1988). The court views the evidence and makes all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. [*42]  Sallis v. Univ. of Minn., 408 F.3d 470, 474 (8th Cir. 2005).
To support its argument, the moving party must cite to record materials or show "that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). "Once the moving party has made and supported their motion, the nonmoving party must proffer admissible evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute as to a material fact." Holden v. Hirner, 663 F.3d 336, 340 (8th Cir. 2011).

2. Analysis
The Court should dismiss all claims against Sharing and Caring Hands, granting in part and denying in part its Motion for Summary Judgment. Specifically, Sharing and Caring Hands is entitled to judgment as a matter of law regarding Horde's First Amendment claim and various claims under federal statutes.19 The Motion for Summary Judgment should be denied in part because the Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Horde's remaining state-law claim, and the state-law claim should be dismissed.

a. First Amendment Claim
The First Amendment only attaches to governmental action. See United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 833, 103 S. Ct. 3352, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1983); see also Montano v. Hedgepeth, 120 F.3d 844, 848 (8th Cir. 1997) (stating "the First Amendment . . . erects a shield exclusively against governmental misconduct. It provides no protection against private behavior, no matter how egregious" (citation omitted)). As [*43]  such, it is necessary for Horde "to prove that the state was somehow involved in" his denial of rights protected by the First Amendment. See Scott, 463 U.S. at 833. Horde has not—and cannot—make this showing. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.).
In general, the court must
consider two factors for determining whether state action is present. First, the action violating the rights of the claimant must have been caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible. Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor. This may be because he is a state official, because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the State.
Federer v. Gephardt, 363 F.3d 754, 759 (8th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Neither of these factors suggests any action Sharing and Caring Hands took could be considered state action; Horde does not assert facts that could reasonable lead to the conclusion that Sharing and Caring Hands's conduct was one of state action. See generally (Revised Am. Compl.). Furthermore, there is nothing [*44]  to suggest that Sharing and Caring hands is a state actor. They are a private non-profit corporation.20 See Business Records Details, Office of the Minn. Sec'y of State, https://mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us/Business/SearchDetails?filingGuid=9f538a6b-b3d4-e011-a886-001ec94ffe7f (listing Sharing and Caring Hands, Inc. as a "Nonprofit Corporation (Domestic)"). As a result, Sharing and Caring Hands is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to Horde's claim under the First Amendment.

b. Claims Under Federal Statues
Horde asserts claims arising under: (1) 18 U.S.C. § 1705;21 (2) 42 U.S.C. § 3058; (3) 18 U.S.C. § 1510; (4) 18 U.S.C § 1703; (5) 18 U.S.C. § 1621; and (6) 18 U.S.C. § 1001. (Revised Am. Compl. at 10). These statutes do not provide private causes of action and, as such, Sharing and Caring Hands is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, a person "shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both" for making a false statement before any of the three branches of the Unites States government. Under this statutory language, multiple courts have concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 1001 provides no private right of action. See, e.g., Patil v. Minn. State Univ., Mankato, No. 12-cv-1052 (JRT/JSM), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187279, 2012 WL 7807608, at *13 (D. Minn. Dec. 10, 2012) [*45]  (Mayeron, Mag. J.) (citing cases), adopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43321, 2013 WL 1249220 (Mar. 27, 2013) (Tunheim, J.), aff'd 533 F. App'x 698 (8th Cir. 2013); Williams v. McCausland, 791 F. Supp. 992, 1001 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (citing cases). Horde's other claims under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1510, 1621, 1703, and 1705 fare no better. See, e.g., Gage v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 555 F. App'x 148, 151 (3d Cir. 2014) (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 1510 is a criminal statute that "do[es] not unambiguously confer a private right of action" and citing Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283-84, 122 S. Ct. 2268, 153 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2002)); Durso v. Summer Brook Pres. Homeowners Ass'n, 641 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1268 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (holding 18 U.S.C. § 1705 does not confer a private right of action and citing cases); Faraldo v. Kessler, No. 08-cv-0261, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5367, 2008 WL 216608, at *6 (E.D.N.Y Jan. 23, 2008) (holding 18 U.S.C. § 1621 does not confer a private right of action and citing cases); Woods v. McGuire, 954 F.2d 388, 391 (6th Cir. 1992) (stating "federal courts uniformly have held that there is no private right of action under [18 U.S.C. § 1703]" and citing cases).
Horde's claim under 42 U.S.C. § 3058 also fails as a matter of law. 42 U.S.C. § 3058 states "[t]he Assistant Secretary, acting through the Administration, shall establish and carry out a program for making allotments to States to pay for the cost of carrying out vulnerable elder rights protection activities" and is part of the Older American Act ("OAA"). See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3001-3058ff. Nothing in the statutory framework suggests that OAA intended to create a private right of action or a private remedy. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-87. Furthermore, while the amount of litigation surrounding the OAA is limited, the cases are in accord with this Court's determination that there is no private right of [*46]  action under the OAA. See, e.g., Legal Servs. of N. Ca., Inc. v. Arnett, 114 F.3d 135, 138-39 (9th Cir. 1997); City of Chicago v. Lindley, 66 F.3d 819, 826-27 (7th Cir. 1995).
In addition to the federal statutes asserted in Horde's Revised Amended Complaint, Horde also asserts claims under 18 U.S.C §§ 1503, 1505, 1512(b), 1622, and 1623 in his Motion to Deny Summary Judgment. (Mot. to Deny Summ. J. at 2). Horde's allegations in this respect fail for at least two reasons. First, it is procedurally improper to raise new issues in the briefing of Sharing and Caring Hands's Motion for Summary Judgment. See, e.g., Morgan Distrib. Co. v. Unidynamic Corp., 868 F.2d 992, 995 (8th Cir. 1989) (stating "a complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Bohner v. LHR, Inc., No. 10-cv-4621 (DWF/LIB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183380, 2012 WL 6755275, at *8 (D. Minn. Dec. 10, 2012) (Brisbois, Mag. J.) ("A memorandum is not the appropriate place to attempt to amend a pleading to raise a new claim." (internal quotation marks omitted)), adopted by 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 293, 2013 WL 25073 (Jan. 2, 2013) (Frank, J.); Alexander v. Hedback, No. 11-cv-3590 (ADM/JSM), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77394, 2012 WL 2004103, at *5 (D. Minn. June 5, 2012) (Montgomery, J.) ("Parties cannot raise new causes of action in their briefing of issues.").
Second, even if Horde had properly brought these claims through a timely filed motion to amend, they would nevertheless be improperly before the court. For example, as described above, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, and 1512(b) are part of the obstruction of justice framework and do not provide for private causes [*47]  of action. See, e.g., Townsend, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60088, 2014 WL 1764432, at *4-5 (stating "Plaintiff may not bring her action as a claim for obstruction of justice under any of the statutes in the section on obstruction of justice" and citing cases); Hopson, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56372, 2013 WL 1703862, at *2 (holding "[t]he federal obstruction of justice statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501 et seq., do not provide for a private cause of action or civil remedies" and citing cases). Furthermore, it is well-settled that there is no private right of action under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1622-1623. See, e.g., Fuller v. Unknown Officials from the Justice Dep't Crime Div., 387 F. App'x 3, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (stating "there is no private cause of action for . . . subornation of perjury, 18 U.S.C. § 1622; [or] false declarations before a grand jury or court, 18 U.S.C. § 1623"); D'Amato v. Rattoballi, 83 F. App'x 359, 360 (2d Cir. 2003) (affirming dismissal of claims arising under 18 U.S.C. § 1622 because the criminal statute does not provide for civil remedies).
For the reasons set forth above, Sharing and Caring Hands is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and summary judgment should be granted in this respect. See Christenson v. St. Mary's Hosp., 835 F. Supp. 498, 501 (D. Minn. 1993) (Doty, J.) (granting a motion for summary judgment because the plaintiff "failed to establish a cause of action under [the asserted federal] statutes and defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law").

c. State Law Claims
Horde's only remaining claim against Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands [*48]  is his claim under the "Vulnerable Adults Act." See (Revised Am. Compl. at 10). The Court understands this claim to assert a violation of Minnesota Statutes Section 626.557. Nevertheless, as described elsewhere, because none of Horde's federal claims remain, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7. Because the Court does not reach the merits of Horde's state-law claims, summary judgment is not appropriate. Walker, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98160, 2011 WL 3837122, at *1 (stating that an issue decided collateral to the merits "is not appropriate for summary judgment"). As a result, the Court should sua sponte dismiss Horde's "Vulnerable Adults Act" claim without prejudice and not address the state-law question. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; Thill, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28949, 2010 WL 1257676, at *3.

C. Motions to Amend
Horde's Motions to Amend should be denied because the amendments he seeks are futile. In particular, the amendments in Horde's Proposed Amended Complaint fail to cure the various deficiencies outlined above with respect to the Court's analysis of Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Sharing and Caring Hands Motion for Summary Judgment. In addition, Horde's Motion to Amend Parties and Motion to Re-Write Complaint do not comport with the Local Rules and should be denied.22

1. Legal Standard
"A party [*49]  may amend its pleading once as a matter of course . . . . In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (emphasis added). Under Rule 15(a), a court should "freely give leave" to amend a pleading when justice so requires. See id. Nonetheless, leave to amend should not be given when there is "undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of amendment[.]" Foman, 371 U.S. at 182.
If a claim or theory of recovery advanced in a motion to amend a complaint cannot survive under a motion to dismiss analysis pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), it is considered futile and a court does not abuse its discretion for denying leave to submit such amendments. See, e.g., DeRoche v. All Am. Bottling Corp., 38 F. Supp. 2d 1102, 1106 (D. Minn. 1998) (Erickson, Mag. J.); see also Lunsford v. RBC Dain Rauscher, Inc., 590 F. Supp. 2d 1153, 1158 (D. Minn. 2008) (Doty, J.). That is, "[d]enial of a motion for leave to amend on the basis of futility means the district court has reached the legal conclusion that the amended complaint could not withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." Zutz v. Nelson, 601 F.3d 842, 850 (8th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).
To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint [*50]  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

2. Analysis
As stated elsewhere, many of Horde's claims in his Proposed Amended Complaint are the same as those in his Revised Amended Complaint. Compare (Revised Am. Compl.), with (Proposed Am. Compl.). Horde, however, does assert new or different claims against the Minneapolis Department of Internal Affairs and Sharing and Caring Hands, and seeks to add claims against Wylie and Turner. See (Proposed Am. Compl. at 12) (asserting claims against Minneapolis Department of Internal Affairs under section 504 of the rehabilitation Act of 1973 and 49 U.S.C. § 306);23 (id.) (asserting claims against Wylie for mail tampering, obstruction of justice, assault on a vulnerable adult, perjury in a court of law during a criminal proceeding, and conspiracy to perpetuate a fraud); (id.) (asserting claims against Turner for perjury, conspiracy to perpetuate a fraud, and collusion); [*51]  (id.) (asserting claims against Sharing and Caring Hands for negligence and vicarious liability). For the reasons stated below, attempts to amend the Revised Amended Complaint are futile because the amendments cannot survive scrutiny under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Zutz, 601 F.3d at 850.

a. Claims Against the Minneapolis Entities
As described above, the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office, Department of Civil Rights, and Division of Internal Affairs are not suable entities under the Minnesota Charter and are therefore are not proper defendants. See Corbett, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27490, 2001 WL 1640108, at *1. Even if the Court were to view the proposed amendments as against the City, it would not change the Courts analysis. In particular, "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act" and "49 U.S.C. § 306" do not provide for private rights of action for Horde's claims as asserted and are therefore futile.

i. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
Horde's claims asserting violations of "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973" are problematic for a number of reasons. First, "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973" is codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794. This statutory provision seeks to prevent employment discrimination of an "otherwise qualified individual . . . solely by reason of her or his disability." 29 U.S.C. § 794; see also 29 U.S.C. § 701(b) (stating the purpose of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [*52]  is "to empower individuals with disabilities to maximize employment" so as to effectuate "economic self-sufficiency, independence, and inclusion and integration into society"). Horde has alleged no facts that would suggest that the City's conduct has impeded him from access to employment opportunities. Again, his failure to plead specific facts that would demonstrate he is entitled to relief is fatal under Rule 8. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. Second, and relatedly, the only private right of action under 29 U.S.C. § 794 relates to "a complaint alleging employment discrimination." Again, Horde's cause of action is not based on employment discrimination. That is, there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to create a private right of action under 29 U.S.C. § 794 that would encompass Horde's allegations against the City related to its conduct in investigation the alleged assault that occurred at Sharing and Caring Hands. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-87 ("Statutory intent . . . is determinative. Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute." (citations omitted)).24 Consequently, Horde's claims under "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973" [*53]  are futile and leave to add these claims should be denied.

ii. 49 U.S.C. § 306
Horde's claims under 49 U.S.C. § 306 are also defective. First, Horde's allegations under 49 U.S.C. § 306 do not comport with the pleading standards under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. 42 U.S.C. § 306 states that no person shall
be subject[ed] to discrimination under . . . any . . . project, program of activity financed through financial assistance under section 332 or 333 or chapter 221 or 249 of this title, section 211 or 216 of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 721, 726), or title V of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 U.S.C. 821 et seq.).
49 U.S.C. § 306(b). Horde has not asserted that any of the alleged discrimination at issue implicates a "project, program, or activity" financed pursuant to the enumerated provisions. See id.; see also (Proposed Am. Compl. at 4-8, 12). For example, 49 U.S.C. § 332 is directed to bonding assistance provided by the Minority Resource Center and 49 U.S.C. § 333 is directed to "unification or coordination projects for rail transportation." See 49 U.S.C. §§ 332-333. None of Horde's allegations reasonably relate to any statutory provisions recited in 49 U.S.C. § 306, and he has failed to plead with any specificity how the Minneapolis entities' conduct could have violated any of these statutes.  [*54] See generally (Proposed Am. Compl.). Horde's failure to meet the applicable pleading standards is sufficient, by itself, to support dismissal of his 49 U.S.C. § 306 claims. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 687 (finding that the operative pleading failed "to plead sufficient facts to state a claim" on the basis of failures to comply with Rule 8).
For purposes of completeness, however, there is a second reason that these claims should be dismissed. 49 U.S.C. § 306 does not suggest that Congress intended to create a private right of action or a private remedy. Specifically, after providing reasonable notice the Secretary of Transportation
shall take at least one of the following actions:
(1) direct that no more Federal financial assistance be provided the person.
(2) refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that a civil action be brought against the person.
(3) carry out the duties and powers provided by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.).
(4) take other action provided by law.
49 U.S.C. § 306(d). This provides a straightforward statutory framework whereby the Secretary of Transportation is tasked with the enforcement of this statute—with the aid of the Attorney General in certain circumstances. Such language would generally be determinative of legislative [*55]  intent. See Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1 at 6, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 ("Given the straightforward statutory command, there is no reason to resort to legislative history.").
That being said, Allstate Transportation Co. v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, No. 971482, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16638, 1997 WL 666178 at *13 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 20 1997), held that 49 U.S.C. § 306 included an implied private cause of action. Allstate however, was extending a holding in Mikkilineni v. United Engineers & Constructors, Inc., 485 F. Supp. 1292, 1297 (E.D. Pa. 1980). Allstate Transp. Co., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16638, 1997 WL 666178 at *13. Mikkilineni was decided using a four-prong test articulated in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 85, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975) to "determine whether a private cause of action should be implied." See Mikkilineni, 485 F. Supp. at 1295-97. While not specifically overruled, the four-prong test in Cort is arguably no longer good law. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286-87 ("Statutory intent . . . is determinative. Without it, a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute." (citations omitted)); Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1 at 6, 117 S. Ct. 1032, 137 L. Ed. 2d 132 ("Given the straightforward statutory command, there is no reason to resort to legislative history."); see also Buntin v. City of Boston, 857 F.3d 69, 75 n.6 (1st Cir. 2017) (discussing Cort in view of subsequent decisions); Wisniewski v. Rodale, Inc., 510 F.3d 294, 299-301 (3d Cir. 2007) (discussing Cort in view of subsequent decisions and finding Cort to have been altered "virtually beyond recognition"). As a result, the decision in Allstate is premised on legal reasoning that is no longer sound.
Under Sandoval, the plain language of 49 U.S.C. § 306 is clear and provides neither a private right of action nor a private [*56]  remedy and that the sole means of enforcement is entrusted to the United States Government through some combination of actions by the Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General. See 49 U.S.C. § 306(d)-(e); see also Wisniewski, 510 F.3d at 301 ("After Sandoval, the relevant inquiry for determining whether a private right of action exists appears to have two steps: (1) Did Congress intend to create a personal right?; and (2) Did Congress intend to create a private remedy? Only if the answer to both of these questions is 'yes' may a court hold that an implied private right of action exists under a federal statute."); cf. Gonzales, 520 U.S. at 6. As a result, the better view in light of Sandoval and the plain language of 49 U.S.C. § 306 is that Horde's claims premised on 49 U.S.C. § 306 cannot sustain a claim for relief and claims directed thereto are futile.

b. Claims Against Wylie
It is unclear from Horde's Proposed Amended Complaint under what basis the claims against Wylie are brought. In other words, Horde has not specifically articulated whether he is asserting a federal-statutory or state-common-law basis for the claims against Wylie. This on its own is arguably fatal to Horde's amendments because it does not provide "fair notice of the claims and the grounds upon which [*57]  the claims rest." See Eckert v. Titan Tire Corp., 514 F.3d 801, 807 (8th Cir. 2008).
Even construed liberally, Horde has not pleaded these claims sufficiently under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (stating "a plaintiff's obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do" (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original)). Here, Horde does not even provide a formulaic recitation of the elements; his claims for relief are grounded solely on labels and conclusions. For example, with respect to Horde's allegations of conspiracy, Horde "must allege with sufficient particularity and demonstrate with specific material facts that the parties reached some agreement and conspired together" to cause his alleged injury. See Gometz v. Culwell, 850 F.2d 461, 464 (8th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). Horde's claims are devoid of any assertions that would allow the Court to infer reasonably that an agreement was reached. Furthermore, to the extent that Horde is asserting claims of fraud against Wylie, these have an even higher pleading standard under Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which Horde has also not met. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9; see also E-Shops Corp., 795 F. Supp. 2d at 877 (stating the elements of a fraud claim that must [*58]  be pleaded).
Horde's claims against Wylie are futile for other reasons as well. Specifically, Horde alleges claims against Wylie for: (1) "mail tampering"; (2) "obstruction of justice"; (3) "assault on a vulnerable adult"; (4) "perjury in a court of law during a criminal proceeding"; and (5) "conspiracy to perpetuate a fraud." (Proposed Am. Compl. at 12). The Court is unsure of the legal basis under which Horde asserts these claims, but his Revised Amended Complaint is informative. For example, Horde asserted claims against various defendants for mail tampering under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1705, obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. § 1510, vulnerable adults under 42 U.S.C. § 3058 and Minnesota Statutes section 626.557, and perjury and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001, 1510, 1621. See, e.g., (Revised Am. Compl. at 10). Construing Horde's Proposed Amended Complaint liberally, the Court assumes that he is asserting similar claims against Wylie in his proposed amendments.
First, to the extent that Horde asserts federal statutes against Wylie, none of the asserted statutes provide for private causes of action. As described above with respect to the dispositive motions, none of the federal statutes asserted by Horde against Wylie meet the test of whether Congress intended to create a private right of [*59]  action. See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 286; see also Gage, 555 F. App'x at 151 (holding that 18 U.S.C. § 1510 is a criminal statute that "do[es] not unambiguously confer a private right of action"); Arnett, 114 F.3d at 138-39 (stating there is no private right of action under 42 U.S.C § 3058); Lindley, 66 F.3d at 826-27 (same); Woods, 954 F.2d at 391 (stating "federal courts uniformly have held that there is no private right of action under [18 U.S.C. § 1703]" and citing cases); Patil, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187279, 2012 WL 7807608, at *13 (no private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and citing cases); Durso, 641 F. Supp. 2d at 1268 (holding 18 U.S.C. § 1705 does not confer a private right of action and citing cases); Faraldo, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5367, 2008 WL 216608, at *6 (holding 18 U.S.C. § 1621 does not confer a private right of action and citing cases); Williams, 791 F. Supp. at 1001 (no private cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and citing cases).
Second, to the extent that Horde's claim for assault of a vulnerable adult implicates Minnesota Statutes section 626.557, that claim should be litigated, if anywhere, in state court. Because the Court has determined that none of Horde's federal claims provides grounds for which relief can be granted, retaining supplemental jurisdiction on a purely state-law issue is not appropriate under the circumstances of this case. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; see also Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; Ivy, 115 F.3d at 552-53; Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2. The Court should not address the state-law questions. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; cf. Rickmyer v. ABM Sec. Servs., Inc., No. 15-cv-4221 (JRT/FLN), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41700, 2016 WL 1248677, at *5 (D. Minn. Mar. 29, 2016) (Tunheim, J.) ("Overall, given that all of the claims in Rickmyer's proposed amended complaint either fail to [*60]  state a claim upon which relief may be granted or are claims over which the Court would decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, Rickmyer's motion to amend is futile and warrants denial.").

c. Claims Against Turner
For the same reasons that claims against Wylie are futile, so are the claims against Turner. Specifically, Horde asserts three claims against Turner: (1) perjury; (2) conspiracy to perpetuate a fraud; and (3) collusion. See (Proposed Am. Compl. at 12). Again, Horde has not sufficiently pleaded these causes of action under Rules 8 and 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, to the extent that Horde seeks to assert federal statutes for perjury, conspiracy, or collusion, none of the asserted statutes confer private rights of action. See Gage, 555 F. App'x at 151; Faraldo, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5367, 2008 WL 216608, at *6; Williams, 791 F. Supp. at 1001. Lastly, the Court lacks original jurisdiction on the basis of all federal claims failing to state claims for relief. To the extent that Horde is raising state law claims against Turner, the Court should not address these state-law questions. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; Ivy, 115 F.3d at 552-53; Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2; cf. Rickmyer, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41700, 2016 WL 1248677, at *5.

d. Claims Against Sharing and Caring Hands
In his Proposed Amended Complaint, Horde asserts two claims against Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands: (1) negligence; and (2) vicarious liability on the basis of the [*61]  conduct of Wylie and Turner. See (Proposed Am. Compl. at 12). Neither of these claims state claims for which the Court can grant relief.
Here, Horde's negligence claim is premised on the argument that Sharing and Caring Hands owed him a duty as the member of the public to ensure that its video camera system was "working properly." See (id.). To the extent there is any negligence claim under these facts, it is a state-law issue. See, e.g., Domagala v. Rolland, 805 N.W.2d 14, 22 (Minn. 2011) (discussing elements of negligence under Minnesota law); see also Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2 (finding that the plaintiff's state-law negligence claim was insufficient to give rise to federal subject matter jurisdiction). Even if Horde's Proposed Amended Complaint could be construed to incorporate elements of federal law in his state-law negligence claim (which Horde does not seem to allege), this would not change this Court's analysis. See Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2 (stating "[t]he Supreme Court held that a state-law cause of action for negligence that merely incorporates federal law as an element of the cause of action does not arise under federal law for the purposes of federal jurisdiction" in Merrell Dow). The Court should not address this state-law question. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; Ivy, 115 F.3d at 552-53; Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2; cf. Rickmyer, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41700, 2016 WL 1248677, at *5.
Vicarious liability [*62]  is also a state-law question. See Sutherland v. Barton, 570 N.W.2d 1, 5 (Minn. 1997) (stating "vicarious liability is the imposition of liability on one person for the actionable conduct of another, based solely on a relationship between the two persons" (internal quotation marks omitted)). As a result, the Court lacks original jurisdiction over Horde's claims against Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands as pleaded in the Proposed Amended Complaint, and the Court should not address the state-law question. See Cohill, 484 U.S. at 350 n.7; Gregoire, 236 F.3d at 420; Ivy, 115 F.3d at 552-53; Johnson, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 741, 2005 WL 102968, at *2; cf. Rickmyer, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41700, 2016 WL 1248677, at *5.
Horde's claim for vicarious liability is problematic for at least one other reason. Vicariously liability only arises on the basis of actionable conduct of another. See Sutherland, 570 N.W.2d at 5. As discussed above, there is no actionable conduct against Wylie or Turner for which the Court has original jurisdiction. In other words, Horde's allegations of vicarious liability fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted and are futile.
In addition, Horde's submissions with the Court regarding his Motion to Amend Parties or Motion to Re-Write Complaint also fail to justify that leave to amend is warranted. Importantly, Horde has failed to submit proposed amendments with either his Motion to Amend Parties or Motion to Re-Write Complaint [*63]  as required under the Local Rules. See LR 15.1. "It is 'inappropriate' to grant leave to amend a complaint when the plaintiff has not submitted a proposed amendment." Lindsey v. City of Minneapolis, No. 15-cv-1202 (WMW/BRT), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79331, 2016 WL 3360485, at *5 (D. Minn. June 16, 2016) (Wright, J.). "Here, [these] omission[s] [are] fatal to [Horde's] motion[s]" and his Motion to Amend Parties and Motion to Re-Write Complaint should be denied. Id. Furthermore, given the multiple amendments that Horde has filed that have failed to cure the various deficiencies in light of the Defendants' respective dispositive motions, there is nothing to suggest that giving Horde another opportunity to amend his operative pleading would be any more fruitful.
In sum Horde's Motions to Amend should be denied.

D. Motion for Fee Waiver
Horde also requested a fee waiver for the state courts as a means of obtaining documents related to the state court proceeding upon which the instant lawsuit is based. See (Mot. to Obtain Fee Waiver at 1). The Court is recommending the Minneapolis Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Defendant Sharing and Caring Hands's Motion for Summary Judgment be granted for reasons that do not involve the veracity of Horde's factual assertions. That is, the Court assumes [*64]  true Horde's allegations, but his claims are not premised on theories of recovery that entitle him to relief against the Minneapolis Defendants, and Horde's asserted claims against Sharing and Caring Hands warrant a finding that Sharing and Caring Hands is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, even if the Court could grant Horde's requested relief, the documents requested by Horde are irrelevant to the Court's determination and his Motion for Fee Waiver is denied.
