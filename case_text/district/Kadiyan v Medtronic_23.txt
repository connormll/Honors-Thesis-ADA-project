Opinion


ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
On August 13, 2009, Armine Kadiyan commenced this action in Los Angeles Superior Court.1 Defendant Medtronic, Inc. removed the case to this court on August 10, 2010, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction.2 The complaint pleads five claims related to plaintiff's employment with defendant Medtronic: (1) violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"); (2) breach of express and implied employment contract; (3) disability discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and (5) failure to pay wages in violation of California Labor Code § 200 et seq.3 On December 21, 2010, Medtronic moved for summary judgment.4 Plaintiff opposes the motion.5

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Kadiyan began working for Medtronic in approximately [*2]  January 2002 as a temporary employee; she became a regular, full-time employee on May 20, 2002.6 On December 20, 2001, Kadiyan signed an Application for Employment in which she certified that she understood her employment with Medtronic would "at all times be 'at-will."7 On May 20, 2002, when Kadiyan became a full-time employee, she signed an offer letter stating that "[t]he terms and conditions set forth in [the] offer letter, regarding the subject of your employment, if accepted by you, shall be the entire agreement between Medtronic MiniMed and you," and that "no manager or representative of the company has any authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specific period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the 'at will' nature of the employment relationship."8 Also on May 20, 2002, Kadiyan signed an acknowledgment that she had received an employee handbook. The acknowledgment stated: "I have entered into my employment relationship with [Medtronic] voluntarily and acknowledge that my employment with [Medtronic] is 'at will' and not for any guaranteed or specified period of time. This means that either I or [Medtronic] may end the employment relationship at [*3]  will at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice."9
Kadiyan never received anything in writing from Medtronic stating that her employment would be terminated only for cause.10 Sometime before May 20, 2002, however, when Kadiyan was still a temporary employee, she spoke with her supervisor, Jennifer Cardenas, about applying for a full-time position. Cardenas told Kadiyan that Medtronic was "looking for[ ] people like"11 Kadiyan, that it "looks for long-term employees and that [it] only fire[s] for a good cause if [the employee has received] progressive warnings. . . ."12
Commencing May 20, 2002, Kadiyan's job title was Commercial Biller.13 She remained a Commercial Biller until mid-2008, when she became a Medicare Biller.14 At that time, she was one of only five Medicare Billers who worked for Medtronic at its Northridge location.15 Kadiyan spent two to three months training to become a Medicare Biller.16
On October 30, 2008, Kadiyan applied for intermittent leave under the CFRA to care for her mother.17 Medtronic granted her request on November 3, 2008, and approved leave from October 28, 2008 to April 20, 2009.18 Kadiyan testified that "three to five times" beginning in [*4]  November 2008, her supervisor, Jing Mageary, asked Kadiyan "if [she] ha[d] to leave right [then,] when [they] ha[d] a high volume of work," and also asked whether she "really need[ed] to take the time off[?]"19 She asserts that Mageary also commented that she "need[ed] [Kadiyan] to do [her] job [t]here, not take care of [her] mother," and asked if anyone else, like Kadiyan's sister, could help take care of Kadiyan's mother for her.20
On January 13, 2009, Kadiyan took time off work as a result of psychiatric symptoms diagnosed as bipolar disorder.21 On January 29, 2009, she applied for full-time CFRA leave, citing her psychiatric disorder.22 Medtronic granted this application on February 3, 2009, and approved leave from January 13 to March 1, 2009.23 On March 9, 2009, Kadiyan's psychiatrist submitted a Physician Statement of Disability to Medtronic's leave administrator, stating that she needed additional leave to address her psychiatric issues.24 On March 9, 2009, Medtronic approved leave from March 2 to April 28, 2009.25 Although Kadiyan's twelve weeks of protected leave, under CFRA ended on March 24, 2009,26 she remained out of work. On April 22, 2009, Kadiyan's psychiatrist submitted an Attending [*5]  Physician Statement of Continued Disability to Medtronic's leave administrator, stating that Kadiyan required additional leave to treat her psychiatric issues.27 On April 23, 2009, Medtronic approved leave through May 24, 2009.28 Kadiyan did not return to work after May 24, 2009.29
Beginning in June 2009, while While Kadiyan was on leave, her supervisor, Mageary, had trouble covering Kadiyan's regular duties.30 Mageary shifted several of the Billing Unit's nonbilling responsibilities to another unit to free up employees in the Billing Unit to cover Kadiyan's day to day billing responsibilities.31 Employees in the other unit fell behind completing their normal tasks and were required to work longer hours as a result.32
On June 1, 2009, Medtronic sent Kadiyan a letter advising that it could no longer hold her position open.33 The letter stated that Kadiyan had exhausted all of her FMLA and CFRA leave. It then noted:
"We have held the position during your leave of absence so far to date, but because of business needs and the unavailability of FMLA or CFRA time, we can no longer hold the position open for you. If the position is still available when you are released to return to work by your physician[,] [*6]  you may report back to your same position. In the event that your position is no longer available upon your release back to work, you will be granted an unpaid personal leave of absence up to 30 calendar days maximum to apply for another position within the company. If you secure other employment with Medtronic during those 30 days, your personal leave of absence will end. If you do not secure another position within those 30 days of the personal leave of absence, your employment with Medtronic Diabetes will end."34
Kadiyan asserts that on June 25 or 26, 2009, she spoke by telephone with Ken Short, a Principal Human Resources Generalist at Medtronic, regarding her employment.35 During the conversation, Short "said that [Kadiyan was] terminated from the company[,] [that her] position ha[d] been terminated and [that] [she was] no longer an employee with Medtronic."36 Kadiyan contends that Short explained she had been terminated because she had "passed [her] 12 weeks allowed time."37 He then noted that she could "reapply within 30 days for another position with Medtronic but there's no guarantee[ ] . . . [she] would get a job." He also purportedly said "that the company wasn't able to hold [*7]  on to [her] position any longer and legally [it] didn't have to do so."38 Short advised Kadiyan that "[t]he termination [was] final so [she should] . . . arrange a time to come [in and] pick up [her] items."39
Following her conversation with Short, Kadiyan contacted Rebecca Wiesel, one of her supervisors, by telephone "to arrange to pick up [her] personal items. [Wiesel] informed [Kadiyan] that [she] would not be able to go upstairs by [her]self since [she] was no longer an employee, and [asked her] to meet at 5:30 p.m., after hours, so that no one would see [her]. She also told [Kadiyan] that security would escort [her] because [she] was not an employee."40 In late June or early July,41 "[Kadiyan] arrived at the [Medtronic] facility to pick up [her] belongings. [She] went with [her] sister, Sonia Aladzhyan. . . . [They] were escorted to [Kadiyan's] desk by a security guard."42
On June 30, 2009, Kadiyan faxed documentation to Medtronic's leave administrator that substantiated her need for leave through June 12, 2009, for psychiatric reasons.43 On the form Kadiyan submitted, her physician estimated that she would be able to return to work on June 29, 2009.44 On July 2, 2009, Medtronic [*8]  retroactively approved Kadiyan's leave from May 24 to June 12, 2009.45 On July 2, 2009, Kadiyan submitted a Release to Return to Work to Medtronic's leave administrator, stating that she had been cleared to return to work effective July 1, 2009.46 On July 8, 2009, Medtronic retroactively approved Kadiyan's leave for the period from June 12 to June 30, 2009.47
Kadiyan did not return to work on July 1, 2009,48 nor did she request a 30-day unpaid leave of absence to find another position with the company.49 Medtronic, however, has adduced evidence that Kadiyan is still considered a Medtronic employee. Kadiyan continued to receive paystubs from January 2009, when she first took full-time leave, until as recently as December 2010, when Medtronic's motion for summary judgment was filed.50 During her approved full-time leave between January 13 and June 30, 2009, Kadiyan received salary continuation benefits.51 Kadiyan has not received salary continuation benefits since June 30, 2009, nor has she requested them.52 In addition to salary payments, Kadiyan received, without interruption from January 1, 2009 to December 2010, medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance benefits from Medtronic.53 In July [*9]  2010, Kadiyan received a bonus, which was used to offset a portion of the medical, dental, vision, and basic life insurance premiums she had not been paying.54 In 2010, Kadiyan received new I.D. cards for these medical benefits.55 Without interruption from January 1, 2009 to October 22, 2010, Kadiyan also continued to accrue vacation time.56 In October 2010, Kadiyan reached the maximum total hours of vacation time an employee with her years of service can accrue and the accrual stopped.57 On July 24, 2009, after Kadiyan had been on full-time leave for more than seven months, Mageary completed an annual performance review for her.58 Kadiyan never received anything in writing from Medtronic stating that she was terminated.59 She also never received information stating that her benefits would be terminated or advising her of her COBRA rights.60 In July and August 2009, Kadiyan's name appeared on Medtronic's Active Employee Chart and Complement Report; these items are generated once a month by Medtronic's human resources department.61
On July 10, 2009, Kadiyan filed an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH"), charging that Medtronic with wrongful [*10]  conduct, including "termination[,]" "harassment[,]" "failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation[,]" and "retaliation."62 On August 13, 2009, she commenced this action.
On September 23, 2009, Short and another Medtronic manager, Stephen Burdell, signed a letter to Kadiyan, in care of her attorney, that unconditionally offered her the opportunity to return to her position at the same rate of pay.63 Kadiyan did not respond to this letter; on November 23, 2009, however, her lawyer sent Medtronic's counsel a letter observing that the offer of "reemployment [was] a good tactical move."64 On May 21, 2010, Short and Burdell sent Kadiyan, in care of her attorney, a second letter unconditionally offering to have her return to her position at the same rate of pay. Kadiyan did not respond.65

II. DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard Governing Motions for Summary Judgment
A motion for summary judgment must be granted when "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56(c). A party seeking summary [*11]  judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery responses that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) ("[T]he substantive law will identify which facts are material. Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. . . . [S]ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is 'genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party").
Where the moving party will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact could find other than for the moving party. On an issue as to which the nonmoving party will have the burden of proof, however, the movant can prevail merely by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323. If the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, "specific facts showing [*12]  that there is a genuine issue for trial." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 250; Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56(e)(2).
Evidence presented by the parties at the summary judgment stage must be admissible. Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 56(e)(1). In reviewing the record, the court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. Rather, it draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987). Conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. See Falls Riverway Realty, Inc. v. Niagara Falls, 754 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir. 1985); Thornhill Pub. Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).

B. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Breach of Employment Contract Claim
Medtronic seeks summary judgment on Kadiyan's second claim for breach of employment contract, asserting that her employment was expressly "at will" or, alternatively, that she was never terminated.66 To prevail on this claim, Kadiyan must prove the existence of a valid employment contract, her performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, Medtronic's breach, and resulting damage. See Coprich v. Superior Court, 80 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1092, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 884 (2000); Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel, 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 822 (1999); Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College District, 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1545, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 725 (1998). See also Kremen v. Cohen, 99 F.Supp.2d 1168, 1171 (N.D. Cal. 2000).
California Labor Code § 2922 provides that "[a]n employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other." CAL. LABOR CODE § 2922. At-will employment "is terminable at any time without cause," Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 680, and is [*13]  not subject to any procedural requirements except statutory notice, see, e.g., Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 335.
While the statutory presumption of at-will employment is strong, it may be rebutted by evidence of the parties' contrary intent. This includes evidence of an express contract "limiting the employer's right to discharge the employee." Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 665 (internal citations omitted). It also includes evidence of an implied-in-fact contract arising from conduct that shows a mutual intent to limit the at-will doctrine. Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 336 (citing Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 680). See also Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 677 ("The absence of an express written or oral contract term concerning termination of employment does not necessarily indicate that the employment is actually intended by the parties to be at-will, because the presumption of at-will employment may be overcome by evidence of contrary intent").
In Foley, the California Supreme Court identified several factors that are relevant in determining whether an implied agreement limiting the employer's right to terminate an employee exists. These include "'the personnel policies or practices of the employer, the employee's longevity of service, actions or communications by the employer reflecting assurances of continued employment, and the practices of [*14]  the industry in which the employee is engaged.'" Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 680 (quoting Pugh v. See's Candies, Inc., 116 Cal.App.3d 311, 327, 171 Cal. Rptr. 917 (1981)). "[T]he totality of the circumstances determines the nature of the contract," the Foley Court stated, and "'the acts and conduct of the parties [should be] interpreted in the light of the subject matter and of the surrounding circumstances.'" Id. at 681 (quoting Pugh, 116 Cal.App.3d at 329); Estes v. AlliedSignal, Inc., C 97-1810 MHP, C 97-3102 MHP, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18206, 1998 WL 814638, *12 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 1998) ("The existence of an implied contract of employment turns on the intent of the parties. Courts look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding a plaintiff's employment to determine the intent of the parties and the existence of an implied contract. Factors to be considered are: (1) the employer's personnel policies and procedures; (2) the employee's longevity of service; (3) the employer's communications or actions 'reflecting assurances of continued employment'; (4) apparent lack of criticism; and (5) practices of the industry in which the employee is engaged" (citations omitted)).
Kadiyan bears the burden of proving that the parties entered into an implied contract that she would only be terminated for good cause. Foley, 47 Cal.3d at 682 (stating that the party relying on an implied contract not to terminate absent good cause [*15]  carries the burden of proving its existence at trial). To survive Medtronic's motion for summary judgment, therefore, Kadiyan must adduce evidence showing that there are triable issues of fact regarding the existence of such a contract. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250.
Kadiyan contends she has raised triable issues of fact regarding the existence of an implied contract to terminate only for good cause, citing defendant's oral assurances and Medtronic's "practice and policy" of issuing warnings before terminating a worker's employment.67 Although she asserts that Medtronic's general practice was to terminate only for cause, she has adduced no evidence of such a practice or policy. Nor does it appear that she could, since Medtronic's policy manual contains language explicitly advising employees of their at-will status.68 Rather, Kadiyan relies on the statements purportedly made by Cardenas that Medtronic was "looking for[] people like"69 Kadiyan, that it "look[ed] for long-term employees and that [it] only fire[d] for a good cause if [the employee had received] progressive warnings. . . ."70
Medtronic asserts that, despite Cardenas' statement, there can be no finding of an implied in fact contract as a matter of law [*16]  because Kadiyan's at-will employment status was memorialized in a fully executed offer letter that is the parties' final expression of their employment agreement. The offer letter, which was signed by a Medtronic human resources officer and Kadiyan, states, in pertinent part:
"We are pleased to send you an offer of employment with Medtronic MiniMed, Inc. . . . Listed below are the terms of our offer:
Position: Billing Specialist
Reporting to: Jennifer Cardenas-Romero
Start Date: May 20, 2002
Base Salary: $13.50 hourly ($28,080.00 annually)
Benefits: In addition to your compensation, Medtronic MiniMed offers a comprehensive employee benefit package. Enclosed is a summary sheet describing the Medtronic MiniMed benefits package for your review. . . .
This offer is conditioned upon the following: . . .
Return of Offer Letter and Report to Work: You are required to return the signed original of this letter to Wandala Craig no later than Friday, May 17, 2002; you also must report to work no later than Monday, May 20, 2002. . . .
'At Will' Employment: You agree to conform to the rules and regulations of Medtronic and Medtronic MiniMed. You further agree that this agreement and compensation offer can [*17]  be terminated, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time, at the option of either the Company or yourself. You understand that no manager or representative of the company has any authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specific period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the 'at will' nature of the employment relationship. . . .
The terms and conditions set forth in this offer letter, regarding the subject of your employment, if accepted by you, shall be the entire agreement between Medtronic MiniMed and you. Thus this offer letter shall supersede any prior agreements or representations of any kind, whether made orally, in writing or otherwise, with regard to the subject of your employment."71
Kadiyan signed the letter, below an acknowledgment stating that "I have carefully read and understand all of the terms of the above offer letter and freely and voluntarily accept and agree to all of its terms. I represent that, in agreeing to this offer letter, I am not relying on any representations or promises of any kind other than as expressly set forth in this letter."72
"[M]ost cases applying California law, both pre- and post-Foley, have held [*18]  that an at-will provision in an express written agreement, signed by the employee, cannot be overcome by proof of an implied contrary understanding." Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 339 n. 10 (emphasis original). See Starzynski v. Capital Pub. Radio, Inc., 88 Cal.App.4th 33, 39, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 525 (2001) (holding that the existence of integrated at-will employment agreement precludes reliance on contrary parol evidence); Halvorsen v. Aramark Unif. Servs., Inc., 65 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1387-89, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 383 (1998) ("Halvorsen attempts to show there was an implied-in-fact agreement not to terminate him except for good cause. . . . The flaw in Halvorsen's argument, however, is that the factors cited in Pugh [regarding implied in fact agreements] have no relevance when there is an express contract of employment which states the term of employment. 'There cannot be a valid express contract and an implied contract, each embracing the same subject, but requiring different results'" (citations omitted)). See also, e.g., Cruey v. Gannett Co., 64 Cal.App.4th 356, 362-63, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 670 (1998); Haggard v. Kimberly Quality Care, Inc., 39 Cal.App.4th 508, 516-22, 46 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16 (1995); Camp v. Jeffer, Mangels, Butler & Marmaro, 35 Cal.App.4th 620, 629-30, 41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329 (1995); Tollefson v. Roman Catholic Bishop, 219 Cal.App.3d 843, 849-52, 855-57, 268 Cal. Rptr. 550 (1990); Anderson v. Savin Corp., 206 Cal.App.3d 356, 360, 363-64, 254 Cal. Rptr. 627 (1988); Gerdlund v. Electronic Dispensers Int'l, 190 Cal.App.3d 263, 267-68, 270-76, 235 Cal. Rptr. 279 (1987); Malmstrom v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 187 Cal.App.3d 299, 309, 313-18, 231 Cal. Rptr. 820 (1986). See also Gianaculas v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 761 F.2d 1391, 1394 (9th Cir. 1985); Baker v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp., 608 F.Supp. 1315, 1320-21 (N.D. Cal. 1984); Crain v. Burroughs Corp., 560 F.Supp. 849, 851-52 (C.D. Cal. 1983); Crossen v. Foremost-McKesson, Inc., 537 F.Supp. 1076, 1077 (N.D. Cal. 1982).
Here, the fully executed offer letter set forth the terms of Kadiyan's employment, including her position, supervisor, salary, start date, and benefits. It also specified that her employment "can be terminated, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time, at the option of either the Company or [her]self," and that "no manager or representative [*19]  of the company has any authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specific period of time, or to make any agreement contrary to the 'at will' nature of the employment relationship."73
Moreover, the offer letter contained an integration clause. "In contract law, 'integration' means the extent to which a writing constitutes the parties' final expression of their agreement." Esbensen v. Userware Int'l, Inc., 11 Cal.App.4th 631, 636, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 93 (1992). Here, the letter states that "[t]he terms and conditions set forth in this offer letter, regarding the subject of your employment, if accepted by you, shall be the entire agreement between Medtronic MiniMed and you. Thus this offer letter shall supersede any prior agreements or representations of any kind, whether made orally, in writing or otherwise, with regard to the subject of your employment."74 California courts have held that this kind of language constitutes an express integration. See Anderson, 206 Cal.App.3d at 360 (holding that an employment agreement was integrated where the contract expressly stated that it was the "entire arrangement between the parties" and could "not be modified except by written approval").
Accordingly, the court concludes that Kadiyan had an express employment contract with Medtronic, stating that [*20]  her employment was at-will. Because, under California law, an oral representation to terminate only for good cause cannot contradict a contractual at-will provision, Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment on Kadiyan's breach of contract claim.75

C. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claim
Medtronic also seeks summary judgment on Kadiyan's third claim for relief to the extent it alleges discrimination due to physical disability.76

1. Legal Standard Governing FEHA Actions
FEHA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on certain enumerated grounds, including physical disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). In relevant part, the statute defines "physical disability" as "any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that . . . affects one or more of the following body systems: neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine [and] . . . limits a major life activity. . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(k)(1); see generally Cassista v. Community Foods, Inc., 5 Cal. 4th 1050, 1053-61, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 287, 856 P.2d 1143 (1993) (providing a detailed overview of the law of "physical handicap"/"physical [*21]  disability" discrimination in California), superseded by statute as recognized in Bagatti v. Department of Rehabilitation, 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 443 (2002).
In evaluating discrimination claims under FEHA, California looks to federal precedent governing analogous federal discrimination laws. See Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 354 ("Because of the similarity between state and federal employment discrimination laws, California courts look to pertinent federal precedent when applying our own statutes. . . . In particular, California has adopted the three-stage burden-shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court for trying claims of discrimination . . . based on a theory of disparate treatment" (citations omitted)); Caldwell v. Paramount Unified School District, 41 Cal.App.4th 189, 195, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 448 (1995); Mixon v. FEHC, 192 Cal. App. 3d 1306, 1317, 237 Cal. Rptr. 884 (1987).77
Accordingly, under FEHA, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination either by adducing direct evidence of discriminatory intent, or by satisfying the first prong of the burden-shifting test outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, 349 F.3d 634, 640 (9th Cir. 2004) ("For a prima facie case, Vasquez must offer evidence that 'give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination,' either through the framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green or with direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent"); Guz, 24 Cal.4th at 354 ("This so-called McDonnell Douglas test reflects the principle that direct [*22]  evidence of intentional discrimination is rare, and that such claims must usually be proved circumstantially").78
The McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting test proceeds as follows: Plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of improper discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. If plaintiff succeeds in proving a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. Should defendant carry this burden of production, the burden of proof shifts back to plaintiff to demonstrate that defendant's asserted reason is pretextual. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802, 804. See also St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).
Thus, a plaintiff seeking to defeat summary judgment must establish a prima facie case and, once defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action, raise triable issues of fact as to [*23]  whether the articulated reason is pretextual. Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Community College District, 934 F.2d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir. 1991), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Dominguez-Curry v. Nev. Transp. Dep't, 424 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 917-918 (9th Cir. 1997) ("[t]o . . . survive summary judgment, [plaintiff] must produce enough evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude either: (a) that the alleged reason for [plaintiff's] discharge was false, or (b) that the true reason for his discharge was a discriminatory one").

2. Whether Kadiyan Has Adduced Direct Evidence of Discrimination
Direct evidence is "evidence which, if believed, proves the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption." Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 640 (quoting Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998) (alterations original)). See also Walton v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 167 F.3d 423, 426 (8th Cir. 1999) (direct evidence is "'evidence of conduct or statements by persons involved in the decision-making process that may be viewed as directly reflecting the alleged discriminatory attitude . . . sufficient to permit the fact finder to infer that that attitude was more likely than not a motivating factor in the employer's decision,'" quoting Radabaugh v. Zip Feed Mills, Inc., 997 F.2d 444, 449 (8th Cir. 1993)).
"When the plaintiff offers direct evidence of discriminatory motive, a triable issue as to the actual motivation of the employer is created even if the evidence is not substantial." Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221. Stated differently, when a plaintiff relies on direct [*24]  evidence of discrimination, courts "require very little evidence to survive summary judgment." E.E.O.C. v. Boeing Co., 577 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 2009); see also McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1124 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[A]ny indication of discriminatory motive may suffice to raise a question that can only be resolved by a fact-finder," quoting Schnidrig v. Columbia Mach., Inc., 80 F.3d 1406, 1409 (9th Cir.1996)).
Kadiyan asserts that Mageary's comments regarding her request for leave constitute direct evidence that she suffered discrimination on the basis of her disability. Kadiyan testified that "three to five times" beginning in November 2008, when she was on intermittent leave to care for her mother, Mageary asked Kadiyan "if [she] ha[d] to leave right [then,] when [they] ha[d] a high volume of work." Mageary also purportedly asked whether Kadiyan "really need[ed] to take the time off."79 Mageary said she "need[ed] [Kadiyan] to do [her] job . . . , not take care of [her] mother" and asked if anyone else, like Kadiyan's sister, could care for Kadiyan's mother.80
Plaintiff likens these comments to remarks that have been found to constitute direct evidence of discrimination.81 Unlike the cases Kadiyan cites, however, no reasonable jury could find that Mageary's comments "prove[ ] the fact [of discriminatory animus] without inference or presumption." Vasquez, 349 F.3d at 640. First, Mageary's [*25]  comments concern Kadiyan's leave to care for her mother, not the disability that is the subject of Kadiyan's FEHA disability discrimination claim.82 While Mageary's comments suggest she would have preferred that Kadiyan take less time off work to care for her mother, they do not suggest that Mageary harbored discriminatory animus toward Kadiyan on the basis of her psychiatric disability. Indeed, the comments were allegedly made in November 2008, two months before Kadiyan first informed Medtronic that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Because no reasonable jury could find that Mageary's comments constitute direct evidence of disability discrimination, she must establish a prima facie case of discrimination through circumstantial evidence under the three-part test articulated in McDonnell Douglas.

3. Whether Kadiyan Has Established a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination Under the McDonnell Douglas Framework
As noted, under McDonnell Douglas' burden-shifting scheme, the amount of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case at the summary judgment stage is minimal, and need not even rise to a preponderance of the evidence. Wallis, 26 F.3d at 889. Rather, plaintiff [*26]  need only adduce proof that "'gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.'" Id. This requires "very little" evidence. Caldwell, 41 Cal.App.4th at 197 (quoting Sischo-Nownejad, 934 F.2d at 1111).
McDonnell Douglas, a refusal to hire case, held that a plaintiff could establish a prima facie case "by showing (i) that he belong[ed] to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications." McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. The Court cautioned against rigid application of this test, however, noting that "facts necessarily will vary in [discrimination] cases, and the specification above of the prima facie proof required from [plaintiff] is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations." Id. at 802 n. 13.
Courts evaluating discriminatory discharge claims have thus made various adjustments to the McDonnell Douglas formulation. In Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, 150 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir. 1998), for example, the Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff had established a prima facie case of sex discrimination under FEHA by showing that "(1) she belong[ed] to a protected [*27]  class, (2) she [had been] performing according to her employer's legitimate expectations, (3) she [had] suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) other employees with qualifications similar to her own were treated more favorably." Id. at 1220.
The California Supreme Court synthesized these formulations into a generalized test in Guz. It held that "plaintiff must provide evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Id. at 355 (citations omitted).
Medtronic does not appear to dispute that, as a person with a disability, Kadiyan was a member of a protected class. Nor does it dispute that she was performing competently in the position she held prior to taking CFRA leave.83 Medtronic contends, however, (1) that it took no adverse employment action against Kadiyan because she remains a Medtronic employee to this day; and (2) that, even if she had been terminated, it was not on the basis of her disability.
While Medtronic adduced [*28]  substantial evidence that Kadiyan was never formally terminated — e.g., her continued presence on the active employee lists and her continued receipt of health benefits — Kadiyan has proffered sufficient evidence to raise triable issues concerning the fact that she was terminated. Kadiyan asserts that she had a telephone conversation with Short, a human resources director at Medtronic and the person who sent a June 1, 2009 letter notifying her that Medtronic could "no longer hold [her] position open. . . ." Short purportedly told Kadiyan that she had been "terminated," that she could "re-apply" for a position with Medtronic, but that her termination was "final." Kadiyan also maintains that Short told her to schedule a time to collect her belongings from the office because she no longer had a job.84 She asserts that she then spoke with Wiesel, her former supervisor, by telephone to arrange a time to pick up her personal belongings. Wiesel purportedly told Kadiyan that she would not be able to go to her office by herself and that she would need a security escort since she was no longer an employee.85 If a jury were to credit this testimony, it could reasonably find that Kadiyan had been [*29]  terminated, despite the fact that she was not formally removed from Medtronic's employee roles, remained enrolled in Medtronic's health benefits plans, and was received salary continuation payments. The court, therefore, cannot grant summary judgment in favor of Medtronic on the ground that plaintiff suffered no adverse employment action.
As respects the causal connection between her disability and the alleged termination, Kadiyan contends that the timing of the termination, soon after she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, coupled with Mageary's comments, demonstrates a causal nexus between her disability and her termination. It is undisputed that Kadiyan first requested full-time CFRA leave due to her psychiatric disability on January 29, 2009.86 She remained on protected CFRA leave as a result of her disability through March 24, 2009.87 On June 1, 2009, Medtronic advised Kadiyan that she had exhausted her CFRA leave, and that it could no longer hold her position open. Thereafter, on June 25 or 26, 2009, Short purportedly told Kadiyan she had been terminated.88
Assuming Kadiyan was actually terminated on June 25 or 26, 2009, that termination occurred six months after Kadiyan first advised [*30]  Medtronic of her disability. This fact, without more, is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. See generally Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (per curiam) ("The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be 'very close'" (citation omitted)). See Buie v. Quad/Graphics, Inc., 366 F.3d 496, 506-07 (7th Cir. 2004) ("[Plaintiff] did, however, present circumstantial evidence, namely the short time period between his suspension and the decision to fire him (they occurred on October 15 or 17 and December 1, respectively) and his announcement on October 15 that he had AIDS. In Buie's view, the timing of these events was suspicious and would allow a jury to conclude that Quad/Graphics acted as it did because of Buie's disability. Suspicious timing is a type of circumstantial evidence. . . . However, a 'temporal sequence analysis is not a magical formula which results in a finding of a discriminatory cause.' . . . By itself, temporal proximity would not normally create an issue of material fact as to causation. . . , although it could suffice where the [*31]  adverse action followed on the heels of the employer's discovery of the employee's disability").
The Ninth Circuit has held that periods as short as four months are too attenuated to prove causation for purposes of the prima facie case. See Swan v. Bank of America, 360 Fed. Appx. 903, 906 (9th Cir. Dec. 30, 2009) (Unpub. Disp.) (noting, in a case alleging termination in retaliation for taking FMLA leave, that "BOA terminated Swan four months after her return from leave, which is too remote in time to support a finding of causation premised solely on temporal proximity"); Williams v. Tucson Unified School Dist., 316 Fed. Appx. 563, 564 (9th Cir. Dec. 4, 2008) (Unpub. Disp.) (holding that a nine-month time period between applicant's complaint and district's decision not to hire him was insufficient to establish causation); Tungjunyatham v. Johanns, No. 1:06-cv-1764-SMS, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105937, 2009 WL 3823920, *17 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 2009) ("Plaintiff does not have any direct evidence of a causal connection between her EEO complaint and her assignment to retraining. Plaintiff apparently relies on the timing. However, the six-month period is not a reasonable period of time with respect to inferring a retaliatory intent"); Keifer v. Hamilton Engine Sales, Inc., No. CIV. S-04-2077 LKK/DAD, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68373, 2006 WL 2620926, *7 (E.D. Cal. September 13, 2006) ("In other words, even when the court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff and construes the Lowart comment as an extension of [*32]  plaintiff's protected activity, this comment was made at the very least seven months prior to the time plaintiff was fired. In short, the temporal proximity present in this case is insufficient to establish the causation element of plaintiff's prima facie case"); see also Breeden, 532 U.S. at 273-74 (2001) (holding that a twenty month period suggested "no causality at all," citing Richmond v. ONEOK, Inc., 120 F.3d 205, 209 (10th Cir. 1997) (three month period insufficient); Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992) (four month period insufficient)); Pascual v. Lowe's Home Centers, Inc., 193 Fed. Appx. 229, 233 (4th Cir. Aug. 2, 2006) (Unpub. Disp.) (holding that plaintiff had failed to establish a causal connection through temporal proximity alone when "at least three to four months" separated the allegedly protected activities and the termination of plaintiff's employment); Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Coop. Extension of Schenectady County, 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that an interval of four months was not sufficient to support a finding of causal connection for purposes of plaintiff's discrimination claim); Mahomes v. Potter, 590 F.Supp.2d 775, 785 (D.S.C. 2008) ("The magistrate judge found that the plaintiff had last engaged in protected activity on May 31, 2005 (the date she filed a charge of discrimination) and that her notice of termination on December 8, 2005, some six months later, was too attenuated in time to show causation. The Court agrees with the magistrate judge's conclusion"). The fact that Kadiyan was allegedly terminated [*33]  six months after she informed her employer of her disability, standing alone, is thus insufficient to make out a prima facie case of disability discrimination.
The additional evidence Kadiyan cites in support of her prima facie case of discrimination are Mageary's comments regarding her intermittent CFRA leave. Kadiyan asserts that these comments were made in November 2008.89 As noted, this was two months before Kadiyan was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and requested full-time leave to address her psychiatric disability. The comments, therefore, were unrelated to plaintiff's disability, which is the basis of her FEHA claim. As a result, no reasonable jury could find that Mageary's statements raise triable issues of fact as to whether Kadiyan was terminated because of her disability.
The court's conclusion that Kadiyan has failed to show a causal connection between her disability and her termination is reinforced by the fact that she has adduced no evidence that other, non-disabled employees were treated more favorably than she was. Despite having conducted significant discovery prior to removal, Kadiyan has proffered no evidence that non-disabled employees who failed to return to work [*34]  after a similar period of leave were not terminated. See Nicholson v. Federal Exp. Corp., No. CV 09-00761 MMM (RZx), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38860, 2010 WL 1607832, *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2010) ("It is undisputed on the present record that . . . plaintiff admitted that he does not know of any non-disabled employees who were treated differently; and that FedEx has adduced evidence of similarly situated non-disabled employees who were given warnings under similar circumstances, i.e., for tardiness violating company guidelines, for dropping containers, and for abusive language directed at co-workers. . . . As a consequence, plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of discrimination"); Gomes v. California Dept. of Corrections, No. C97-1072 MJJ, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13567, 1998 WL 556578, * 3-4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 31, 1998) ("As the Supreme Court noted in McDonnell Douglas, 'especially relevant to such a showing' would be evidence that other employees who failed to provide clearance from their treating physician had nevertheless been granted light duty. Such a showing would indicate that the CDC's true motivation for denying plaintiff light duty was based on discrimination. No such evidence has been adduced by plaintiff in this case" (citation omitted)); cf. Chatman v. U.S. Steel Corp., 425 F.Supp. 753, 760 (N.D. Cal. 1977) ("Without more, Huffman's allegation is simply insufficient to withstand defendants' motion for summary [*35]  judgment. Huffman stakes his entire claim of discrimination upon the allegedly differential treatment accorded a white employee in a similar situation. However, the paucity of facts adduced concerning this white employee's experience would seem to preclude Huffman from drawing any valid inference that the two situations were truly comparable").
Because Kadiyan has failed to adduce evidence of the elements of a prima face case of disability discrimination even under the minimal standard that applies at summary judgment, Medtronic is entitled to summary judgment on the claim as a matter of law.

D. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim
Medtronic next argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Kadiyan's third cause of action to the extent it alleges that the company retaliated against her in violation of FEHA. Under FEHA, it an unlawful employment practice for an employer "to discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under [FEHA] or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under [FEHA]." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). To establish a prima facie case [*36]  of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected her to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the employer's action. Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 287, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (2009) (citing Miller v. Department of Corrections, 36 Cal.4th 446, 472, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 115 P.3d 77 (2005)).
State and federal courts in California have found that the following are protected activities under FEHA: (1) filing an administrative complaint or grievance, see Barefield v. Board of Trustees of CA State University, Bakersfield, 500 F.Supp.2d 1244, 1253 (E.D. Cal. 2007) (discrimination grievance filed with the California Faculty Association); McRae v. Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 142 Cal.App.4th 377, 386, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313 (2006) ("It is not contested that Dr. McRae engaged in 'protected activity' — the filing of DFEH claims"); (2) making informal complaints to supervisors, see Garcia v. Los Banos Unified School Dist., 418 F.Supp.2d 1194, 1224 (E.D. Cal. 2006) ("Plaintiff alleged and provided evidence reasonably warranting an inference that she complained to Elliott, Heid's superior, about Heid's sexually derogatory 'ass wiping' remark and his having yelled at her and raised his fist in a physically threatening way"); and (3) serving as a witness in a co-worker's FEHA proceeding, see Steele v. Youthful Offender Parole Bd.,162 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1252, 76 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632 (2008) ("Kaslar filed a complaint with the DFEH based, in part, on the YOPB retaliating against her for her report of the kissing incident involving Galindo and Lisa. Lisa was a 'potential witness' in such proceeding. Thus, Lisa was engaged [*37]  in a protected activity so as to meet the first requirement for a claim of retaliation").
Plaintiff has cited no FEHA case, and the court can find none, where the protected activity in which plaintiff allegedly engaged was taking medical leave under the CFRA. Presumably, this is because a plaintiff who alleges that he or she suffered retaliation as a result of taking CFRA leave can assert a retaliation claim under the CFRA. Kadiyan, in fact, has asserted such a claim here. California Government Code § 12940(h) is FEHA's anti-retaliation provision.90 See Scott v. Solano County Health and Social Services Dept., 459 F.Supp.2d 959, 966 (E.D. Cal. 2006) (discussing the differences between "FEHA's antidiscrimination provision," Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), and the "retaliation provision of FEHA," Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h)). California Government Code § 12945.2(l) is the CFRA's anti-retaliation provision.91 See Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 260-61, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001) (discussing the "elements of a cause of action for retaliation in violation of CFRA," under "subdivision (l)(1) of Government Code section 12945.2").
Although the CFRA is a part of FEHA, California courts have interpreted § 12940(h) in light of § 12945.2(l), and concluded that it does not provide a cause of action for retaliation claims based on the taking of protected medical leave. See Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 875, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) ("Plaintiff's third cause of action is for retaliation in tort and in violation of FEHA. Plaintiff has not alleged that he engaged in any activity protected [*38]  under Govt. Code § 12940(h) — opposing any practice prohibited by FEHA of filing, participating in or testifying in a FEHA-related proceeding. To the extent it is based upon Plaintiff requesting a medical leave of absence (which is not protected under § 12940), Defendant has established a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Plaintiff" (emphasis added)); Bishop v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., Nos. A122517, A123449, 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1264, 2011 WL 576571, *14 (Cal. App. Feb. 18, 2011) (noting that "[b]oth the FEHA and the CFRA retaliation provisions were initially invoked by Bishop, but the FEHA retaliation claim was resolved against him on summary adjudication. We . . . restrict our consideration of Bishop's medical leave retaliation claim under the CFRA provision (§ 12945.2, subd. (l)), rather than under the FEHA provision (§ 12940, subd. (h)).").
Given the California courts' interpretation of the statute, and the fact that Kadiyan has asserted a separate claim for violation of § 12945.2(l) of the CFRA, the court concludes that she cannot base a cause of action under § 12940(h) on defendant's alleged retaliation against her for taking medical leave under the CFRA. Since plaintiff has proffered no evidence of any other protected activity in which she engaged, she has failed to raise triable issues of fact [*39]  regarding her FEHA retaliation claim. Defendant is therefore entitled to have summary judgment entered in its favor on this aspect of the FEHA claim.

E. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate Claims

1. Failure to Exhaust
Medtronic contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on Kadiyan's third claim for violation of FEHA to the extent it alleges that Medtronic failed to engage in the interactive process and to accommodate her disability because Kadiyan did not assert such claims in the administrative complaint she filed with the DFEH. Under California law, a plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies "deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to resolve claims arising pursuant to the FEHA." Riggins v. City of Pasadena Fire Dep't, No. B144445, 2002 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2454, 2002 WL 479752, *10 (Cal. App. Mar. 29, 2002) (Unpub. Disp.);92 see, e.g., Rojo v. Kliger, 52 Cal.3d 65, 83, 276 Cal. Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373 (1990) ("We agree that exhaustion of the FEHA administrative remedy is a precondition to bringing a civil suit on a statutory cause of action"); see also Garcia v. Los Banos Unified School District, 418 F.Supp.2d 1194, 1214-15 (E.D. Cal. 2006) ("It is generally a plaintiff's burden to plead and prove timely exhaustion of administrative remedies, such as filing a sufficient complaint with the Department [*40]  of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and obtaining a right-to-sue letter. . . . Failure to exhaust warrants defense summary judgment" (citations omitted)); Chambers v. City of Berkeley, No. C 00-3845 SI, C 00-4037 SI, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4637, 2002 WL 433606, *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2002) ("A plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the DFEH and receiving a right to sue letter before bringing a suit on a cause of action under the FEHA. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a jurisdictional, not procedural, defect, and may be a ground for summary judgment" (citations omitted)); Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal.App.4th 1718, 1724, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994) ("We have recognized, in the context of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, that '[t]he failure to exhaust an administrative remedy is a jurisdictional, not a procedural, defect,' and thus that failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a ground for a defense summary judgment," quoting Miller v. United Airlines, Inc., 174 Cal.App.3d 878, 890, 220 Cal. Rptr. 684 (1994)).
On July 10, 2009, one month before she commenced this action, Kadiyan filed an administrative complaint with the DFEH alleging that Medtronic had engaged in wrongful conduct described as "termination[,]" "harassment[,]" "failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation[,]" "retaliation."93 Notably, she did not check [*41]  boxes for "denial of accommodation" or "denial of family or medical leave[.]"94 Medtronic contends that because Kadiyan failed to assert the denial of an accommodation in her DFEH complaint, she is barred from pursuing claims for failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process.
Kadiyan counters that it would be improper to grant summary judgment on failure to exhaust grounds because "claimants are not required to specify the charges [in a DFEH complaint] with 'literary exactitude' and the absence of a 'perfect fit' between an administrative claim and a civil complaint is not necessarily fatal."95 Ramirez v. Silgan Containers, No. CIV F 07-0091 AWI DLB, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34825, 2007 WL 1241829, *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2007). "A civil complaint filed in court can include the precise unlawful practices identified in the administrative complaint and can also contain claims that are like or reasonably related to those identified in the administrative complaint and that would necessarily be uncovered in the course of a DFEH investigation." Id.
An entirely new basis for relief alleged in an employee's complaint, however, that differs from those asserted before the DFEH, runs afoul of FEHA's exhaustion requirement. See, e.g., Okoli v. Lockheed Technical Operations Co., 36 Cal.App.4th 1607, 1615, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57 (1995) (holding that there had been [*42]  a failure to exhaust "when the difference between the charge and the complaint is a matter of adding an entirely new basis for the alleged discrimination," since "a complaint alleging race discrimination is neither 'like or related to' nor likely to be discovered in a 'reasonable' investigation of a charge of sex discrimination" (internal citations omitted)). As a result, in evaluating whether a complainant has exhausted administrative remedies as required by FEHA, courts must carefully examine the factual allegations contained in the administrative complaint in assessing whether a DFEH investigation would have uncovered events or claims that are not specifically detailed. See, e.g., Noel v. City of Oroville, No. 2:07-CV-00728 WBS EFB, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80704, 2007 WL 3034815, *5 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 16, 2007) ("In determining whether a plaintiff has exhausted allegations that she did not specify in her administrative charge, it is appropriate to consider such factors as the alleged basis of the discrimination, dates of discriminatory acts specified within the charge, perpetrators of discrimination named in the charge, and any locations at which discrimination is alleged to have occurred," quoting B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dep't, 276 F.3d 1091, 1100 (9th Cir. 2002)); Coggins v. Gap, Inc., No. A095580, 2002 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 11730, 2002 WL 31831656, *9 (Cal. App. Dec. 18, 2002) (Unpub. Disp.) ("The crucial element [*43]  of a charge of discrimination is the factual statement contained therein. . . . If the new claims are not so related that they would not have been pursued by a reasonably thorough DFEH investigation of the original charge, then the district court must dismiss these claims to allow the DFEH an opportunity to pursue them first. . . . The claims are not alike or reasonably related unless there is a factual relationship between them. This means that the administrative charge and the complaint must, at minimum, describe the same conduct and implicate the same individuals" (emphases original; citations and punctuation omitted)).
Applying this precedent, the court concludes that Kadiyan's DFEH complaint was sufficient to exhaust administrative remedies on her failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to accommodate claims. Kadiyan's complaint in this action alleges that Medtronic failed to engage in the interactive process and failed to accommodate her disability at the time she was terminated. She asserts that instead of accommodating her or engaging in an interactive process to determine her continued need for medical leave through July 1, 2009, Medtronic simply discharged [*44]  her.96 A reasonable investigation of her wrongful termination claim, which was alleged in the DFEH complaint, would have revealed Medtronic's alleged failure to accommodate and engage in the interactive process. See Ramirez v. Silgan Containers, No. CIV F 07-0091 AWI DLB, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34825, 2007 WL 1241829, * 5 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 26, 2007) ("Assuming that the allegations in the proposed amended complaint are true, a DFEH investigation of a termination based on physical disability and medical leave and requested FMLA leave, would have uncovered the refusal to allow Ramirez to return to his job or refusal to accommodate Ramirez's disability despite his requests and expressed intent to return to his job. Accordingly, Ramirez's failure to accommodate and failure to engage in an interactive process causes of action are reasonably like and related to the conduct identified in the administrative charge (termination) and these additional claims would have been uncovered during the course of a DFEH investigation" (record citations omitted)); Creswell v. HCAL Corp., No. 04cv388 BTM (RBB), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9724, 2007 WL 628036, *4 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 12, 2007) ("Defendant's failure to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's disability, which includes its failure to engage in the required interactive process, can reasonably be expected to grow out of any investigation [*45]  into Plaintiff's stated charge of harassment and discriminatory firing because of his disability"). Consequently, the court denies Medtronic's motion for summary judgment on these claims to the extent it is based on Kadiyan's alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

2. Merits of Kadiyan's Claims for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate

a. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Medtronic next contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on Kadiyan's failure to engage in a good faith, interactive process because it "actively engaged in the interactive process with Kadiyan by granting her several extensions of her medical leave based on the documentation she provided to Medtronic's leave administrat[or]." Medtronic notes that "[e]ven after Kadiyan's protected CFRA leave was exhausted, Medtronic granted her three extensions of her leave [and] held Kadiyan's position for her for more than two months after her protected CFRA leave was exhausted[.]"97
Under FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process to determine effective, reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for [*46]  accommodation by an employee "with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). As interpreted in Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal.App.4th 34, 61 n. 21, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006), "FEHA's reference to a 'known' disability . . . mean[s] a disability of which the employer has become aware, whether because it is obvious, the employee has brought it to the employer's attention, it is based on the employer's own perception — mistaken or not — of the existence of a disabling condition, or . . . the employer has come upon information indicating the presence of a disability." If an employee requests accommodation, and his employer fails to engage in the interactive process, the employee may file a civil action complaining of the failure.98 A "reasonable accommodation" includes "[j]ob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(n)(2); CAL.CODE REGS tit. 2, § 7293.9(a)(2).
The elements of a claim [*47]  for failure to engage in the good faith interactive process are as follows:
"[An] employee triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process by requesting an accommodation. [Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n).] Although it is the employee's burden to initiate the process, no magic words are necessary, and the obligation [to engage in the interactive process] arises once the employer becomes aware of the need to consider an accommodation. Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." Gelfo, 140 Cal.App.4th at 62 n. 22 (citing, inter alia, Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)).
Medtronic does not appear to dispute that Kadiyan had a "known disability" that triggered obligations under FEHA. All parties agree, in fact, that Kadiyan told Medtronic of her psychiatric condition. The question is whether Medtronic failed to engage in a good faith, interactive process with Kadiyan after receiving the information.
Plaintiff's [*48]  opposition addresses this issue in a single paragraph. It states that "[a]fter being given notice of Kadiyan's disability, defendant[ ] never engaged in . . . an interactive process, as [it] never contacted Kadiyan or offered any accommodation for her return to work; instead, she was surprised when defendant[ ] suddenly and unilaterally removed her from her position and terminated her employment."99 This assertion contradicts much of the evidence in the record. It is undisputed that Kadiyan received all of the leave she requested from January 2009, when she first notified Medtronic of her disability, through March 24, 2009, when her 12 weeks of protected CFRA leave ended.100 It is also undisputed that Medtronic then extended Kadiyan's leave through May 24, 2009.101 Although she had not asked for additional leave at that point, Kadiyan did not return to work after May 24, 2009.102
Medtronic also alerted Kadiyan twice that she had exhausted her protected leave as of March 24, 2009.103 In its June 1, 2009 letter, which also advised Kadiyan that the company could no longer hold her position open, Medtronic stated that "[i]f the position is still available when [she] [is] released to return to work by [*49]  [her] physician, [she could] report back to [her] same position," and that "[i]n the event that [her] position [was] no longer available upon [her] release . . . back to work, [she would] be granted an unpaid personal leave of absence up to 30 calendar days maximum to apply for another position within the company."104 Medtronic asked that, if Kadiyan "ha[d] any further questions," she "contact" Short directly.105
Despite Medtronic's June 1, 2009 letter stating that it could "no longer hold the position open[,]" it is undisputed that Kadiyan did not contact Short until almost a month later, on June 25 or 26, 2009. It is also undisputed that she never requested 30 days personal leave to seek another position at Medtronic.106 "'[T]he interactive process requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees' with the goal of 'identify[ing] an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively.'" Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal.App.4th 952, 984, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114 (9th Cir.2000), vacated on other grounds by US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002)). "[F]or the process to work '[b]oth sides must communicate directly, exchange essential information and neither side can delay or obstruct the process.' When a claim is brought [*50]  for failure to reasonably accommodate the claimant's disability, the trial court's ultimate obligation is to 'isolate the cause of the breakdown . . . and then assign responsibility' so that '[l]iability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown.'" Id. at 1115 (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal.App.4th 245, 261, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000) (quotation marks and citations omitted)). As California courts have recognized, FEHA requires than an "employer engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Milan v. City of Holtville, 186 Cal. App. 4th 1028, 112 Cal.Rptr.3d 408, 413 (2010), review denied (Sept. 29, 2010) (emphasis original). "By the statute's terms Subdivision (n) 'requires that the employee initiate the process.'" Kelley v. Corrections Corp. of America, 750 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 2010 WL 3853182, *7 (E.D. Cal. 2010). Kadiyan has proffered no evidence that at the time of her alleged termination she had requested any additional accommodation.107 Kadiyan has thus failed to raise triable issues of fact regarding defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process.

b. Failure to Accommodate
Medtronic also asserts it is entitled to summary [*51]  judgment on Kadiyan's failure to accommodate claim. Government Code § 12940(m) makes it unlawful "[f]or an employer . . . to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee. Nothing in this subdivision or in . . . subdivision (a) shall be construed to require an accommodation that is demonstrated by the employer or other covered entity to produce undue hardship to its operation."
"In order to establish a FEHA claim for failure to make reasonable accommodat[ion], a plaintiff must show that, at the time of the alleged failure, (1) he had a disability of which the employer was aware, (2) he was able to perform the essential functions of the job at issue with or without accommodation, i.e., that he was qualified individual, and (3) . . . the employer failed to reasonably accommodate . . . his disability." Jadwin v. County of Kern, 610 F.Supp.2d 1129, 1175-76 (E.D. Cal. 2009). "Unlike . . . a claim for employment discrimination, a plaintiff need not establish that an adverse employment action was caused by the plaintiff's disability because, as stated, a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate is an independent cause of action." Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F.Supp.2d 1034, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2005).
The reasonableness of an accommodation is generally a question of fact for the jury. Hanson, 74 Cal.App.4th at 228 n.11 ("the reasonableness [*52]  of an accommodation is generally a factual question"); Prilliman v. United Air Lines, 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 953-54, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997) ("Ordinarily, the reasonableness of an accommodation is an issue for the jury"). "The law and its regulations make clear that the term 'reasonable accommodation' is to be interpreted flexibly. The regulations provide a non-exhaustive list of accommodations that includes not only making premises accessible but also '[j]ob restructuring, assignment or transfer, [and] part-time or modified work schedules. . . .' Cal. Code Reg. § 7293.9. The law and the regulations clearly contemplate not only that employers will remove obstacles that are in the way of the progress of the disabled, but that they will actively re-structure their way of doing business in order to accommodate the needs of their disabled employees. Sargent, 841 F.Supp. at 961.
As noted, Kadiyan has adduced no evidence that Medtronic refused any accommodation she requested. Medtronic granted Kadiyan's request for intermittent leave on November 3, 2008,108 full time leave through March 1, 2009,109 an extension of leave through April 28, 2009,110 another extension of leave through May 24, 2009, even though her protected CFRA leave had been exhausted two months earlier,111 another extension of leave through June 12, 2009, [*53]  which was requested and granted after Kadiyan's alleged termination, and a final extension of leave through June 30, 2009,112 which was also requested and granted after the alleged termination.113 Plaintiff has thus failed to raise triable issues of fact regarding Medtronic's failure to accommodate her disability.

F. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's CFRA Discrimination Claim 114
The CFRA, California Government Code § 12945.2, addresses employees' need to balance work and family, and entitles them to "[l]eave to care for a parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition," or to address "an employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of that employee. . . ." CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12945.2 (c)(3)(B)-(C). Under the CFRA, any employee "with more than 12 months of service with the employer, and who has at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous 12-month period [is entitled] to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave." Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(a).
It is unlawful for an employer "to refuse to hire, or to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, or discriminate against" an individual exercising his or her right to family care and medical [*54]  leave. Id., § 12945.2(l). To make out a prima facie case of retaliation115 in violation of the CFRA, a plaintiff must show that: "(1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Dudley, 90 Cal.App.4th at 261; see also Houston v. Regents of Univ. of California, C 04-4443 PJH, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27644, 2006 WL 1141238, *33 (N.D. Cal. May 1, 2006) (reciting the elements set forth in Dudley). "Once an employee 'establishes a prima facie case, the employer is required to offer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action, the presumption of retaliation 'drops out of the picture,' and the burden shifts back to the employee to prove intentional retaliation." Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 885, 58 Cal. Rptr. 3d 729 (2007) (citing Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005)).
Medtronic does not appear to dispute that it is an employer covered by the CFRA, that Kadiyan was an employee eligible for leave, and that she took leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose.116 Medtronic contends, however, (1) that it took no adverse employment [*55]  action against Kadiyan because she remains a Medtronic employee to this day; and (2) that even if she had been terminated, it was not in retaliation for her protected CFRA leave. For reasons already stated, a reasonable jury could find that Kadiyan had been terminated by Medtronic. As a result, the court cannot grant summary judgment in Medtronic's favor on the basis that Kadiyan suffered no adverse employment consequence.
The court must, however, consider whether Kadiyan has adduced sufficient evidence of a causal connection between the fact that she exercised her right to take CFRA leave and her alleged termination. Plaintiff cites two pieces of evidence to support her contention that she was terminated because she took CFRA leave: (1) the the timing of her termination soon after the end of her CFRA leave; and (2) the comments of her supervisor, Mageary, about the heavy workload and whether she really needed to take leave.
It is undisputed that Kadiyan first requested intermittent CFRA leave on October 30, 2008, to care for her mother; this was granted on November 3, 2008.117 On January 13, 2009, Kadiyan took time off work due to psychiatric symptoms diagnosed as bipolar disorder;118 on [*56]  January 29, 2009, she applied for full-time CFRA leave due to her psychiatric disorder.119 Medtronic granted this application on February 3, 2009, approving leave from January 13 through March 1, 2009.120 On March 9, 2009, Kadiyan's psychiatrist submitted a Physician Statement of Disability to Medtronic's leave administrator stating that Kadiyan needed additional leave to address her psychiatric issues.121 On March 9, 2009, Medtronic approved leave for Kadiyan from March 2 through April 28, 2009.122 Kadiyan's twelve weeks of protected leave under the CFRA ended on March 24, 2009.123 On April 22, 2009, her psychiatrist submitted an Attending Physician Statement of Continued Disability to Medtronic's leave administrator, which stated that Kadiyan needed additional leave to treat her psychiatric issues.124 On April 23, 2009, Medtronic approved leave through May 24, 2009.125 Kadiyan did not return to work after May 24, 2009.126 She received a letter on June 1, 2009, stating that she had exhausted her CFRA leave on March 24, 2009, and that Medtronic could no longer hold her position open. Kadiyan asserts she was terminated in a telephone conversation with Short on June 25 or 26, 2009. Assuming plaintiff was terminated [*57]  on June 25 or 26, 2009, that was eight months after she first requested intermittent leave, six months after she took full-time leave, and three months after the end of her protected CFRA leave.
As noted, temporal proximity can be circumstantial evidence of a causal relationship between the exercise of rights under the CFRA and an adverse employment action. See Satterlee v. Allen Press, Inc., 274 Fed. Appx. 642 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 2008) (Unpub. Disp.) ("'[P]rotected conduct [under the FMLA] closely followed by an adverse action' may be evidence of causation," quoting Marx v. Schnuck Markets, 76 F.3d 324, 329 (10th Cir. 1996)).127 The fact that plaintiff was allegedly terminated eight months after beginning intermittent CFRA leave, and five months after beginning full-time CFRA leave, without more, however, is not sufficient to raise triable issues of fact regarding retaliation for the exercise of rights under the CFRA. See Zsenyuk v. City of Carson, 99 Fed. Appx. 794, 796 (9th Cir. May 21, 2004) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Zsenyuk has not met his burden of establishing a genuine issue on causation. He presented no direct evidence of causation, and the only circumstantial evidence offered is the temporal proximity between his assertion of FMLA rights and the first three instances of alleged interference listed in his complaint. . . . Zsenyuk presented no other evidence that the other adverse actions were [*58]  causally connected to his FMLA leave in late 1998, instead of being the legitimate disciplinary actions. . . . We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the City, because Zsenyuk failed to demonstrate that material issues of fact exist on the question of causation"); see also Skrjanc v. Great Lakes Power Serv. Co., 272 F.3d 309, 317 (6th Cir. 2001) (""[S]uch temporal proximity is insufficient in and of itself to establish that the employer's nondiscriminatory reason for discharging an employee was in fact pretextual"); Carey v. ODW Logistics Inc., No. C2-08-CV-0581, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13059, 2010 WL 596503, *4 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 16, 2010) ("The only evidence that Carey has put forth in support of his claim of FMLA interference is that there was temporal proximity (somewhere between a week and a few days) between his FMLA leave request for shoulder surgery and his termination. Carey provides no other evidence to support his argument. . . . Without more, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dist-Trans used Carey's FMLA leave request in his termination").
This is particularly true here, where it is undisputed that Medtronic granted every request Kadiyan made for medical leave, without question, and even extended her leave for two to three months after she had exhausted her protected [*59]  CFRA leave. Medtronic has proffered evidence that Kadiyan was told her position could no longer be held for her on June 1, 2009, after she had exhausted her CFRA leave and been out on unprotected leave for more than two months.128 Numerous courts have held that an employer does not violate the CFRA or FMLA by terminating an employee who does not return to work at the conclusion of the twelve-week period of statutory leave. See Burnett v. Southwestern Bell Telephone, L.P., 471 F.Supp.2d 1121, 1134-35 (D. Kan. 2007) ("In this case, plaintiff does not dispute that at the time she made the request on March 6, she was ineligible for FMLA leave. Defendant informed plaintiff of that fact, yet she did not report to work. On this record, plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact whether her request for FMLA leave — as opposed to her taking of unprotected leave — motivated defendant's decision to terminate her employment."); cf. Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal.App.4th 509, 519, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006) (affirming a trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's CFRA claim in a case where an at-will employee was terminated after she did not return to work at the end of her twelve weeks of CFRA leave); Cehrs v. Northeast Ohio Alzheimer's Research Center, 155 F.3d 775, 784-785 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that there had been no FMLA violation because the undisputed evidence showed that the employee would not have been able to return to work [*60]  by the statutory deadline); Wilson v. AZ Automotive Corp., No. 05-72722, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23906, 2007 WL 1017097, *9 (E.D. Mich. March 30, 2007) (granting summary judgment in favor of an employer that terminated a plaintiff who overstayed her FMLA leave, and noting that "[p]laintiff has failed to present evidence to create a question of fact as to whether her discharge was causally connected to her protected activity. Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she was treated differently than a similarly situated employee or that there was a close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action. More importantly, because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that she was able or released to return to work at the termination of her FMLA leave period, she cannot demonstrate that she would not have been subject to the adverse action, discharge, had she not engaged in the protected activity, applying for and taking FMLA leave"); Meadows v. Texar Federal Credit Union, No. 5:05CV158, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4456, 2007 WL 192942, *26 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 22, 2007) ("The FMLA does not protect an employee who fails to return to work on or before the date her FMLA leave expires"), citing Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., 277 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir. 2002); Felder v. Winn-Dixie Louisiana, Inc., No. 03-1438, 2003 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 22535, *15 (E.D. La. Dec. 15, 2003) (if an employee fails to return to work on or before the date the FMLA leave expires, the right to reinstatement also expires); Fleece v. BFS Diversified, LLC, 618 F.Supp.2d 929, 935-36 (S.D. Ind. 2008) (noting that "[t]he FMLA does not create an entitlement to [*61]  more than twelve weeks of family and medical leave in any twelve-month period," but finding that factual issues precluded summary judgment because it was unclear whether plaintiff had exhausted her twelve weeks of FMLA leave); Austin v. Fuel Systems, LLC, 379 F.Supp.2d 884, 902-04 (W.D. Mich. 2004) ("Defendant argues that it had [a] legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason[ ] for terminating Plaintiff: . . . Plaintiff had exhausted her FMLA leave entitlement without reporting back to work. . . . An employee may be terminated for failing to return to work after her FMLA leave has expired. An employee who exceeds the permitted FMLA leave time has no right to be restored to her job. . . . In summary, although Plaintiff may be able to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination, Defendant has provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, which Plaintiff has failed to rebut").
The only other evidence Kadiyan cites in support of her retaliation claim are the comments made by her supervisor, Mageary, regarding her intermittent leave. As noted, Kadiyan testified that "three to five times" beginning in November 2008, while she was on intermittent leave to care for her mother, Mageary asked Kadiyan "if [she] ha[d] to leave right [then,] [*62]  when [they] ha[d] a high volume of work." Mageary also purportedly asked whether Kadiyan "really need[ed] to take the time off."129 Mageary said she "need[ed] [Kadiyan] to do [her] job . . . , not take care of [her] mother," and asked if anyone else, like Kadiyan's sister, could care for Kadiyan's mother.130
The Ninth Circuit has "repeatedly held that a single discriminatory comment by a plaintiff's supervisor or decisionmaker is sufficient to preclude summary judgment for the employer." Dominguez-Curry, 424 F.3d at 1039 (citing Chuang, 225 F.3d at 1128 (holding that a decisionmaker's remark that "two Chinks in the pharmacology department were more than enough was an egregious and bigoted insult . . . that constitutes strong evidence of discriminatory animus on the basis of national origin"); Cordova, 124 F.3d at 1149 (holding that an employer's reference to an employee as a "dumb Mexican" "could be proof of discrimination against [plaintiff] despite their reference to another agent and their utterance after the hiring decision")). On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that mere "stray remarks," unrelated to the decisional process, are insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. See Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Group, 892 F.2d 1434, 1438-39 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that "stray remarks," particularly [*63]  when "unrelated to the decisional process, are insufficient to demonstrate that the employer relied on illegitimate criteria, even when such statements are made by the decisionmaker"); see also Navarrete v. Nike, Inc., 332 Fed. Appx. 405, 406 (9th Cir. June 10, 2009) (Unpub. Disp.) ("The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Nike on Navarrete's disparate treatment based on race, color, and national origin claim. . . . Although Navarrete cites two remarks regarding Spanish-speaking people and Mexicans, 'stray' remarks are insufficient to establish discrimination"); Magsanoc v. Coast Hotels & Casinos, Inc., 293 Fed. Appx. 454, 455 (9th Cir. August 13, 2008) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Hunter's 'white people' comment and 'joke' about shooting black people, while racist and insensitive, are 'stray remarks' 'not tied directly to [Magsanoc's] termination' and are insufficient to create a triable issue of fact); Charlton v. Marley Pump Co., 205 F.3d 1350 [published in full-text format at 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 33662], 1999 WL 1253347, *1 (9th Cir. 1999) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Charlton's only evidence of animus was the 'fresh face' comment. Although this statement was related to the hiring decision, it was equivocal and cannot be characterized as more than a 'stray remark' that is insufficient to show discrimination by Marley Pump. . . . Charlton failed to raise a triable issue that Marley Pump's actions were motivated by age discrimination"); Nidds, 113 F.3d at 919 (holding that a comment by a supervisor that [*64]  he intended to get rid of all the "old timers" was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact because "the comment was not tied directly to [the] layoff"); Snider v. Greater Nevada, LLC, No. 3:07-CV-00583-RCJ-RAM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95749, 2009 WL 3319802, *9 (D.Nev. Oct. 14, 2009) ("At the other end of the spectrum, mere stray remarks that are ambivalent, not acted upon, or that do not give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus, are insufficient to establish pretext").
Here, in light of the context in which Mageary made the remarks, they fail to raise a triable issue of fact regarding plaintiff's claim of retaliation. First, "[t]iming is important in the context of a stray remark, because it tends to make the inference of discriminatory intent[ ] stronger; the closer in time to the adverse action, the easier the inference that the comment is linked to the motive behind the action." Kogucki v. Metropolitan Water Reclamation Dist. of Greater Chicago, 698 F.Supp.2d 1026, 1041 (N.D. Ill. 2010). Mageary made the remarks approximately eight months before Kadiyan's termination. It is undisputed that over the course of the intervening eight months Medtronic granted every request Kadiyan made for medical leave without question.131 Additionally, Kadiyan testified that from the time she began her full-time leave in January 2009 to her alleged termination at [*65]  the end of June 2009, no one "at Medtronic [gave her] a problem with [her] leave or [her] extensions or interfere[d] in any way."132
Finally, unlike the cases cited in Dominguez-Curry, there is no indication that Mageary's comments were related to the decisional process. In Chuang, the decision-maker's comment that "two Chinks in the pharmacology department were more than enough" was undoubtedly related to the hiring decision at issue. Mageary's comments were made months before Kadiyan's alleged termination and no reasonable jury could find that they were intended to suggest Kadiyan's job was at risk due to her request for leave. See Parker v. Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., 309 Fed. Appx. 551, 559 (3d Cir. Feb. 4, 2009) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Assuming that the remarks [such as "this is a call center and if you can't take calls then we have nothing for you to do" and "if you're not taking calls there's no work for you to do here so you must be telling me that you're resigning"] by [his supervisors] were made as [plaintiff] alleges, the remarks occurred seven months before his termination and did not directly relate to the decision. Additionally, three other Verizon managerial employees were involved in the decisionmaking process with [the supervisors] and there is no evidence that [*66]  these three managerial employees demonstrated discriminatory animus. In the months after the remarks and before [plaintiff]'s termination, the record shows that Verizon continued to accommodate [plaintiff]'s disability and his need for intermittent FMLA leave. For example, Verizon allowed [plaintiff] to take intermittent leave, transferred him to the Washington office, permitted reduced work hours and provided an off-line position for him while maintaining his rate of pay and benefits. Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to [plaintiff], we decline to depart from the principle that such stray remarks are rarely given great weight when made temporally remote from the decision to terminate [plaintiff]"); Lucas v. PyraMax Bank, FSB, 539 F.3d 661, 667 (7th Cir. 2008) (stating, with regard to plaintiff's FMLA claim, that "[w]e recognize that Lucas highlights some rather unfortunate remarks made by PyraMax, such as Murphy's comment that news about her poor health was the 'kiss of death' for most employees. But none of these comments were made contemporaneously or in connection with either the demotion or discharge. Therefore, they fall in the category of 'stray remarks'"); Saellam v. Norfolk Southern Corp., Civil Action No. 06-0123, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103207, 2008 WL 5286836, * 8 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 19, 2008) ("Here, even if I consider Hamilton and/or Keller to be decisionmakers [*67]  with respect to Plaintiff's discharge, either because they influenced Young's decision or, in Hamilton's case, because he denied Plaintiff's first appeal of Young's decision, the alleged comments were entirely unrelated to the decision process and were made well prior to the date of the termination decision. Thus, the comments are at best classic 'stray remarks' and are not adequate evidence of national origin discrimination"); cf. Kogucki, 698 F.Supp.2d at 1041 ("When the adverse action is directly linked to the statement of prohibited animus within the statement itself — 'you'll never be promoted because of your complaints' — timing is not so significant").133
Kadiyan has thus failed to raise triable issues as to whether her alleged termination was retaliation for her decision to take twelve weeks of protected CFRA leave, or the result of her decision to take three additional months of unprotected leave. Because Kadiyan has failed to demonstrate that her protected activity caused her termination, defendant is entitled to have summary judgment entered in its favor on her CFRA retaliation claim.

G. Whether Medtronic is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy [*68]  Claim
Medtronic next seeks summary judgment on Kadiyan's wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. It first contends that Kadiyan was not terminated; alternatively, it asserts that she was terminated for reasons unrelated to any public policy. "An employer may not discharge an at will employee for a reason that violates fundamental public policy." Stevenson v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 16 Cal.4th 880, 887, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997). Claims of wrongful termination in violation of public policy generally fall into one of four categories: the employee was terminated because (1) he refused to violate a statute; (2) he performed a statutory obligation; (3) he exercised a constitutional or statutory right or privilege; or (4) he reported a statutory violation for the public's benefit. See Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., 19 Cal.4th 66, 76, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998) (internal citations omitted).
The cause of action is not limited to these situations, however; rather, it will lie "wherever the basis of the discharge contravenes a fundamental public policy." Soules v. Cadam, Inc., 2 Cal.App.4th 390, 401, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 6 (1991). The claimed public policy must be "tethered to" a specific constitutional or statutory provision. Green, 19 Cal.4th at 76. Additionally, "in order to provide an exception to section 2922's at-will mandate, the policy must be public in that it affects society at large rather than the individual, must have been articulated [*69]  at the time of discharge, and must be fundamental and substantial." Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "This limitation recognizes an employer's general discretion to discharge an at-will employee without cause under section 2922, and best serves the Legislature's goal to give law-abiding employers broad discretion in making managerial decisions." Id. at 79-80.
The complaint alleges that Kadiyan was terminated in violation of public policy because "a motivating factor in the termination of her employment . . . was her medical and disability leaves."134 It identifies no public policy other than the "fundamental public policy protecting an employee's right to medical and disability leave."135 Because, as discussed, plaintiff has failed to raise triable issues of fact regarding her CFRA claim, Medtronic is entitled to have summary judgment entered on Kadiyan's wrongful termination claim as well. See, e.g., DeHorney v. Bank of Am. Nat'l Trust & Savings Assoc., 879 F.2d 459, 465 (9th Cir. 1989) (affirming summary judgment on plaintiff's her wrongful discharge claim because she failed to prove a prima facie case of race discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and her wrongful termination claim was based on the same conduct); see also Foley-Eckhart v. Richard-Allan Med. Indus., Inc., No. CV 95-0818 DT (AJWx), 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20663, 1995 WL 861589, *13 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 1995) ("For the [*70]  same reasons set forth . . . in Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action for age discrimination, this Court finds that RAMI is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy").136

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, the court grants Medtronic's motion for summary judgment on all claims.
