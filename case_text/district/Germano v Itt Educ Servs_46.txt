CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (in chambers): ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 21]
This matter comes before the Court on Defendants ITT Educational Services, Inc.; ITT Educational Services, Inc. d/b/a ITT Technical Institute; and ITT Technical Institute's (collectively, "ITT" or "Defendants") Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment ("Motion"), filed on November 17, 2015. Plaintiff Anthony Germano ("Germano") and Bankruptcy Trustee Brad D. Krasnoff ("Trustee") (collectively, "Plaintiff" or "Germano") filed his Opposition on November 30, 2015.1 Defendants filed their Reply on December 3, 2015. The Court found this matter suitable for disposition without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for December 21, 2015. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Defendants' Motion.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A. Germano's Employment: 2001-2007
In 2001, [*2]  Germano was employed as a Recruiting Representative ("Representative") at ITT's Sylmar campus. (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Additional Material Facts ("Defs.' Resp.") ¶¶ 61, 64-65, ECF No. 33.) Germano was 52 years old when he was hired. (Defs.' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts & Conclusions of Law in Supp. of Mot. ("Defs.' Facts") ¶ 1, ECF No. 22.) As a Representative, Germano's duties included contacting potential students by telephone using "leads," which were supplied by ITT. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 2.)
At all relevant times, Germano claims to have "perceived and/or physical disability(s), including, but not limited to, hearing loss, associated conditions and others . . . . " (FAC ¶ 9.) Germano alleges he frequently had to speak louder and ask others to speak louder. (FAC ¶ 14.) Germano does not and has never worn a hearing aid. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 46.)
When Germano was first employed by ITT in 2001, each Representative, including Germano, shared an office with another Representative. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 27.) In April 2003, Germano sent the District Manager, Nader Mojtabai ("Mojtabai"), an e-mail stating that he was having difficulty hearing and understanding people on the telephone in his shared office, [*3]  that the shared office "has been detrimental to my ability to perform my duties," that he submitted an audiological report documenting his hearing loss on April 4, 2003, and that he has "brought this problem up on several occasions and to date there has been no attempt made to resolve it." (See Decl. of Meghan E. George in Supp. of Opp'n ("George Decl.") ¶ 2, ECF No.29-2, Ex. A.) In or about 2003, Germano requested his supervisor, Kelly Lishman2 ("Lishman") to allow him to have his own office. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 28.) ITT complied with his request and provided Germano with his own office.3 (Defs.' Facts ¶ 2.)
On January 11, 2007, the Sylmar Campus Director, Dana Martin ("Martin") sent an e-mail to the Sylmar Representatives about a new campus policy requiring Representatives to keep their office doors open (the "Open Door Policy"). (Defs.' Facts ¶ 31.) Germano sent an e-mail to Martin, requesting that Germano be allowed to keep his door closed when he is making phone calls and conducting students due to his hearing issues. (See generally Decl. of John L. Viola in Supp. of Mot. ("Viola Decl.") ¶ 2, ECF No. 24, Ex. D Dep. of Anthony Germano ("Defs.' Germano Dep."),4 Ex. 5 ("Open [*4]  Door Email").) Germano told Martin that the management has "been very considerate in helping me deal with this [hearing] disorder. They have made special arrangements in the past so that I can do my job with as little interference as possible. I have been able to cope with this problem because of these arrangements and it has been successful." (See generally Open Door Policy Email.) Germano never complained to the Human Resources Department about ITT's alleged failure to accommodate his disability, (Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Dispute of Material Facts ("Pl.'s Facts") ¶ 33, ECF No. 29-1), because "I was afraid to lose my job . . . . Dana Martin is a very stern director" and "was not very accommodating at times."5 (Defs.' Germano Dep. 39:1-8.)
At the beginning of each year, the Representatives signed a document indicating that they received and agreed to the performance requirements for the position (the "Performance Plan").6 (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 6.) The Representatives are formally evaluated through an annual Performance Planning and Evaluation Statement (the "PP&E"). (Decl. of Erica Bisch in Supp. of Mot. ("Bisch Decl.") ¶ 3, ECF No. 23.) The performance rating system for [*5]  evaluating Representatives was as follows: 1-significantly exceeded expectations, 2-exceeded expectations. 3-met expectations, 4-failed to meet expectations, 5-significantly failed to meet expectations. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 7.) ITT uses a progressive discipline policy. (Defs.' Resp. ¶¶ 138-39, 144.) The policy would typically begin with counseling, followed by a written warning, a final warning, then termination. (Viola Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. E Dep. of Kelly Lishman ("Defs.' Lishman Dep.") 26:11-20, Ex. 4.)
From January 2002 to February 2007, Germano received five letters of concern and written warnings for poor performance and failure to meet goals, and a PP&E rating of "4" in 2002. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 8.) Germano signed each document. (See Defs.' Germano Dep. 94:17-95:11; 103:1-18; 111:3-13; 113:9-22; 119:19-120:6; Exs. 10, 12, 13, 15, 18.) On February 20, 2007, Lishman sent Germano a letter of concern stating that his production over the March quarter had fallen below the goals, and that his "work quality needs to improve immediately." (Defs.' Germano Dep., Ex. 18.) On June 5, 2007, Germano sent his supervisors a letter of resignation, in which he thanked Mojtabai, Lishman, and [*6]  Martin for their support. (Defs.' Germano Dep. Ex. 20 1.) Germano's resignation was effective June 8, 2007. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 9.) Germano admits that he resigned because he was concerned about being demoted.7 (Defs.' Germano Dep. 122:2-22.) Upon leaving ITT, Germano began working at DeVry Institute ("DeVry"). (Defs.' Facts ¶ 13.)
B. Germano's Employment: 2008-2013
Three months later, in March 2008, Germano returned to work at ITT; he was 58 years old. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 15.) At this time, the Representatives were no longer working in shared offices; instead, they were working in cubicles in a large room. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 34.) Germano mentioned to Lishman that he was having a hard time communicating on the telephone due to his hearing loss and requested that ITT purchase a telephone headset to assist him. (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 36-37.) Germano stated that he and the marketing secretary looked at the catalog and Germano chose a headset he thought "look[ed] good," which ITT purchased in March. (Defs.' Germano Dep. 79:18-24.) No ITT employee complained about Germano using the headset or about noises emitting from the headset. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 47; Defs.' Germano Dep. 89:5-9, 89:25-90:10.)
Sometime [*7]  after August 6, 2008, Germano provided ITT with a medical report (the "Audiology Report"). (Defs.' Facts ¶ 38.) In the Audiology Report, the audiologist concluded that Germano suffers from some hearing loss and "significantly disturbing tinnitus," among other conditions. (George Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C Audiology Report 1.) It is undisputed that Germano suffers from a hearing problem, of which ITT was aware: Germano provided the Audiology Report to Lishman and had email correspondence with Mojtabai and Martin documenting the limitations his hearing problem placed on his work. (Defs.' Resp. ¶ 80.) Germano was never denied the ability to take a rest break and was able to use sick days to deal with his hearing problems. (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 56-57.)
In or about August 2010, the Representatives were moved to a smaller room with cubicles. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 39.) Around this time, Germano reported that the headset was not working well, and ITT purchased a new headset for him. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 41.) There is a material dispute regarding the new headset.
Germano contends that the new headset "didn't work out," (Defs.' Germano Dep. 80:16-18), and he talked to Lishman on several occasions that he was experiencing [*8]  some difficulty due to too much background noise. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 40.) Lishman failed to respond, and management never asked Germano if there was something they could do to help him. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 40.) According to Germano, ITT had numerous interview rooms and could have accommodated him in one of the rooms, but "that was never offered to me." (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 110; Pl.'s Germano Dep. 179:11-14.) Germano never asked for an interview room because he was "afraid to lose my job. I didn't want to be . . . singled out as a complainer." (Pl.'s Germano Dep. 179:18-19.)
ITT contends the following. According to Lishman, when she asked Germano how the new headset was working and if he was happy, Germano replied, "Yes, they are great." (Defs.' Lishman Dep. 50:25-51:2.) It is undisputed that Germano did not try to get another headset. (Defs.' Germano Dep. 80:16-18.) Further, Lishman did not receive any complaints from Germano after Germano received the second headset, such that Lishman believed there was "no need to find a private office or another solution because a solution, as I understood it from Anthony, was found." (Defs.' Lishman Dep. 50:7-51:11.) ITT claims that at no time during his employment [*9]  did Germano bring the issue of background noise or request further disability accommodation to the attention of Martin, Mojtabai, or the Human Resources Department, as required in the Employee Handbook (the "Handbook"). (Defs.' Facts ¶ 45.) Germano acknowledged receipt of and access to a copy of the Handbook. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 26.) At all relevant times, the Handbook provided that employment discrimination or harassment based on any legally-protected status of employees will not be tolerated, that employment and related decisions are made without regard to legally-protected status, and that ITT will provide reasonable disability accommodation upon request to one's supervisor or the Human Resources Department. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 25.)
In May 2012, Germano voluntarily elected to self-promote. (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 18, 21.) Government regulations prevent ITT from paying its employees based on performance; rather, Representatives may elect to "self-promote" even if they are not performing satisfactorily, and the Representative's supervisor has no input into the Representative's election for self-promotion. (Lishman Dep. 30:10-31:6, 35:16-36:8; Viola Decl. ¶ 4 Ex. F Dep. of Dana Martin ("Defs.' Martin [*10]  Dep.") 33:20-35:1.) Germano acknowledged that a higher level of performance and performance requirements were required by the higher level position. (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 20-21.)
In January 2013, Claudia Fimbres ("Fimbres") became the Director of Recruitment at the Sylmar Campus, replacing Lishman. (Defs.' Resp. ¶¶ 70-73.) Germano was supervised by and reported to Fimbres and Martin. (Defs.' Resp. ¶ 73.)
From 2008 to 2013, Germano received eight disciplinary actions for poor performance in the form of counseling and written warnings. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 16.) Germano received a rating of 3—met expectations in 2009, 2010, and 2011, a 4-failed to meet expectations in 2012, and a 5-significantly failed to meet expectations in 2013.8 (Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 16, 60.) From January 2013 through July 2013, Germano did not receive any written or oral warnings about his production. (See Defs.' Facts ¶ 16.)
In or around April 2013, Martin questioned Germano about an allegation that Fimbres had employees sign blank forms for their respective quarterly observation (the "QO") and then completed the observation documentation after the fact. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 117; George Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. G.) The QO is used to [*11]  document that the Director of Recruitment, Fimbres, observed the Representative's performance. (Pl.'s Martin Dep. 66:6-15.) During this meeting, Martin showed Germano one of Germano's QO forms, and Germano told Martin that the signature on the form was not his signature and that it had been copied to look like his. (Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 120-21.) An investigation ensued, and Fimbres admitted that she had several Representatives sign a blank QO form, which she filled out later, and that she had forged Germano's signature on his QO. (Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 124-25.) Fimbres remains the Director of Recruitment. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 126.)
C. Germano's Termination
ITT claims Germano was terminated pursuant to ITT's Performance Based Termination (the "PBT").9 (Defs.' Facts ¶ 49.) On July 2, 2013, an email was sent from "Chad Carter at HQ" to "Julia Gasaway at HQ" ("Gasaway"), the Human Resources Partner (the "Gasaway Email'). (See George Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. F.) The email stated that "employees that will have had two consecutive years of performance that was rated as less than expected or unacceptable will be terminated . . . next week with the employee being notified during their review." (Gasaway Email 1; Pl.'s Facts [*12]  ¶ 137.) The email also stated that if "we have employees to be terminated that have not had any progressive discipline administered, you need to address this lack of engagement as a disciplinary action with the functional manager and/or college [ ]ctor." (Gasaway Email 1.)
On July 11, 2013, Germano was terminated. (FAC ¶ 8; Defs.' Facts ¶ 53.) Germano was 63 years old. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 63.) Germano's termination memorandum stated that ITT made its decision to terminate him "for issues related to your performance." (George Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. E 1.) It is undisputed that nobody at ITT told Germano specifically what performance issues he was being terminated for. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 130.) Another Representative from the Sylmar campus, Felicia Bagneris ("Bagneris"), was also terminated at that time. (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 133.) Germano and Bagneris were replaced with two individuals in their 20s.10 (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 150.) ITT claims that Germano was terminated pursuant to the PBT, a corporate decision to reduce its employee staff by terminating poor performers—i.e. those whose PP&Es reflected ratings of "4" or "5" for the two immediately preceding years, 2012 and 2013. (See Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) ITT [*13]  claims that Lishman, Fimbres, Martin, and Mojtabai had no input into and were not consulted regarding the decision to terminate Germano. (Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) ITT did not look at any data concerning employees' personal characteristics—including disability or age—in making the PBT. (Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) Exceptions were made only when termination would lower staffing levels at a particular campus below 33% or the individuals had increased their individual conversion rates in the most recent quarter to meet expectations for their position. (Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) The PBT applied nationally, resulting in the termination of 106 Representatives, including four in the Southern California District and two at the Sylmar campus, where Germano worked. (Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) Lishman testified that it "became a practice of ITT" where a person receiving two "underperforming" performance reviews two years in a row could be subject to termination, but there was no such written policy at ITT. (Defs.' Resp. ¶ 142; see Pl.'s Lishman Dep. 19:1-9.) Germano contends that ITT's justification was a pretext. (See Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 50-54.) Germano further contends that despite ITT's progressive discipline policy, he was terminated [*14]  "suddenly and with no warning."11 (Pl.'s Facts ¶ 138; George Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. G.)
D. Procedural History
On March 21, 2014, Germano filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a notice of right to sue pursuant to California Government Code section 12965(b). (See generally FAC Ex. A.) Germano initiated this action in Superior Court for Los Angeles County on March 5, 2015. (See Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.) ITT removed the action to this Court on April 15, 2015 based on diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1332.12 (See Notice of Removal.) On July 17, 2015, Germano filed his FAC, alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of perceived and/or physical disability and age in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the "FEHA"); and retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy for conduct between January 2013 and July 11, 2013. (FAC ¶¶ 8, 20, 44; FAC Ex. A 2, ECF No. 19-1.) Germano seeks declaratory relief, medical expenses, loss of earnings, attorneys' fees and costs, permanent injunction, prejudgment interest, punitive and exemplary damages, and costs of suit. (See FAC 20-21.) ITT filed its First Amended Answer on July 17, 2015. [*15]  (See First Am. Answer, ECF No. 20.)
ITT moves for summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) ITT accommodated Germano's disability to his satisfaction such that his claims for disability discrimination, harassment, and retaliation fail as a matter of law; (2) ITT did not discriminate, harass, or retaliate against Germano based on his age; (3) Germano's claims for retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy is predicated entirely on his disability and age claims and fail along with them; (4) Germano's claim for declaratory relief fails as a matter of law; and (5) Germano's claim for punitive damages fails as a matter of law. (See generally Mot.)
II. DISCUSSION
Rule 56(a) mandates that "the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). But if the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party need not produce any evidence or prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. [*16]  See id. at 325. Rather, the moving party's initial burden "may be discharged by 'showing'—that is, point out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id.
Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the "party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986); accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986) ("[O]pponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."). Further, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit . . . will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment [and] [f]actual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; see also Sanders v. Douglas, 565 F. Supp. 78, 80 (C.D. Cal. 1983) (disregarding conclusory allegations of affidavit because "legal conclusions are totally ineffectual, and are not to be given consideration or weight whatsoever" on summary judgment).13 At the summary judgment stage, a court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. A court [*17]  is required to draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.
A. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation and Engage in Interactive Process
Germano alleges that ITT failed to: (1) determine the extent of Germano's disability and how it could be accommodated; and (2) engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with Germano to determine effective reasonable accommodations. (See FAC ¶ 20.) ITT argues that it accommodated Germano to his satisfaction.
Independent of the general prohibition against unlawful disability discrimination, it is unlawful for an employer to fail to provide a reasonable accommodation for the known physical disability of an employee who is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position.14See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m); Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10 (2009). "Reasonable accommodation" may include "making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities" and "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices." Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). The employer need not provide such accommodation if the employer demonstrates that the accommodation will "produce undue hardship to its operation." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). An employer cannot prevail on summary judgment on [*18]  a claim of failure to reasonably accommodate unless:
it establishes through undisputed facts that reasonable accommodation was offered and refused, that there simply was no vacant position within the employer's organization for which the disabled employee was qualified and which the disabled employee was capable of performing with or without accommodation, or that the employer did everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation, but the informal interactive process broke down because the employee failed to engage in discussions in good faith.
Dept. of Fair Employment & Housing v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
Similar reasoning applies to a claim for an employer's failure to engage in a good faith interactive process with the employee to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1003 (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n)). "Once an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation . . . to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). The employer's obligation "extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when [*19]  the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013. Once the litigation process has commenced, "to prevail, the employee must be able to identify an available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." Id. at 1018 (citing Nadar-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 984 (2008)). Both employer and employee must participate in good faith and "undertake reasonable efforts to communicate [their] concerns . . . . " See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1014. The "trial court's ultimate obligation is to . . . assign responsibility so that liability for failure to provide reasonable accommodations ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for the breakdown." Nadar-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 985 (citations, quotation marks, and formatting omitted).
1. Analysis
First, it is undisputed that Germano has a "physical disability" within the meaning of the FEHA.15 Second, ITT was aware of Germano's hearing disability and the limitations it placed on his job as early as April 2003, when Germano notified Mojtabai that his hearing problems have been "detrimental" to his job performance. (See George Decl., Ex. A.) Third, Germano requested reasonable accommodations on at least four occasions, which triggered [*20]  ITT's obligation to engage in an interactive process to determine the appropriate accommodations. The Court finds that ITT cannot prevail on summary judgment on either claim because there is a material factual dispute with respect to Germano's four requests for accommodations, namely, his request for his own office in 2003; his request to keep his door closed after the implementation of the Open Door Policy in 2007; and his requests for a headset in 2008 and 2010. (See Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 2, 36-37, 41; Open Door Email.)
As to the claim for failure to accommodate, the undisputed facts do not indicate that "reasonable accommodation was offered and refused" upon each request or that ITT did "everything in its power to find a reasonable accommodation." See Lucent, 642 F.3d at 743. Although ITT provided Germano with reasonable accommodation on several occasions, (see Defs.' Facts ¶¶ 2, 36-37, 41), there is a triable issue of whether ITT permitted Germano to close his door upon being aware of the Open Door Policy's adverse effect on his hearing problem, and ITT did not demonstrate that such an accommodation would "produce undue hardship to its operation." See Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m).
As to the claim for failure to engage in the interactive [*21]  process, "the fact that an employer took some steps to work with an employee to identify reasonable accommodations does not absolve the employer of liability under section 12940(n). If the employer is responsible for a later breakdown in the process, it may be held liable." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 985 (citation omitted). Although ITT worked with Germano to provide him with a separate office and two headsets—and Germano expressed satisfaction on several occasions—there are triable issues as to whether ITT was responsible for the breakdown in the process. For instance, although Germano did not request an interview room at the time, he now identifies it as an "available accommodation the interactive process should have produced." See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that ITT failed to meet its continuing obligation to provide reasonable accommodation. See Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 952 n.6 (8th Cir. 1999) (finding factual dispute even though employer provided some accommodations); see also Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1388 (2000) (finding that where triable issues exist as to whether employer knew initial accommodation was ineffective, employer may be liable for failing to provide further accommodation).
Accordingly, ITT's Motion as to Germano's claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodation and failure [*22]  to engage in interactive process are DENIED.
B. Discrimination
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer, "because of the physical disability . . . [or] age . . . to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). An employee can prove his FEHA claim of employment discrimination either by direct or circumstantial evidence. DeJung v. Super. Ct., 169 Cal. App. 4th 533, 549 (2008).
"Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption. Comments demonstrating discriminatory animus may be found to be direct evidence if there is evidence of a causal relationship between the comments and the adverse job action at issue." Id. at 550. "[V]ery little" direct evidence of discriminatory animus is required. Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998). Showing that "a significant participant in an employment decision exhibited discriminatory animus is enough to raise an inference that the employment decision itself was discriminatory, even absent evidence that others in the process harbored such animus." DeJung, 169 Cal. App. 4th at 551.
Where a plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, California courts adopt a three-stage burden-shifting test (the "McDonnell Douglas test"). See Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354 (2000) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) (adopting pertinent federal precedent [*23]  in interpreting FEHA). Under the McDonnell Douglas test, generally the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Then, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a "legitimate business purpose" behind the adverse employment action. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 224 (1999). Finally, the burden returns to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's reasons are pretextual, "either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Raad v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1196 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 248, 256 (1981)). A "plaintiff's burden to raise a triable issue of pretext is hardly an onerous one." Earl v. Nielsen Media Research, Inc., 658 F.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.
In the context of a defense motion for summary judgment against a claim of employment discrimination, several California decisions have suggested that the burdens of the McDonnell Douglas test are reversed "because a plaintiff opposing summary judgment need not demonstrate triable issues until the moving defendant has made an initial no-merit show[ing]." See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356-57 (collecting [*24]  cases). Under this view, the defendant bears the initial burden to show either that the plaintiff cannot establish one of the elements of its prima facie claim or that there is a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. See Lucent, 642 F.3d at 745. If the defendant meets this burden, the defendant will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff demonstrates that the employer's explanation is pretextual. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356.
Germano alleges that he suffers from a hearing disability and was over the age of 40 at the time of his alleged wrongful termination, and that ITT treated more favorably less experienced, less senior, non-disabled, and/or substantially younger individuals. (FAC ¶¶ 9, 42.) The Court discusses Germano's disability and age discrimination claims in turn.
1. Disability Discrimination
a. Direct Evidence of Disability Discrimination
Germano claims that Fimbres, Lishman, and his coworkers made the following derogatory comments about his disability: "Even [Germano] made that many calls," "Hey, did you hear what I said," and "You [have] got to speak louder because he actually doesn't—he doesn't hear it." (Opp'n 14, ECF No. 29); Defs.' Facts ¶ 55.) Lishman stated that she recalled employees making comments [*25]  to the effect that "you had to go—be next to him so that he could hear." (Defs.' Lishman Dep. 50:2-3.) Germano argues that these comments constitute direct evidence of disability discrimination. This argument fails.
The Ninth Circuit has held that "stray remark[s] . . . uttered in an ambivalent manner and [ ] not tied directly to [the plaintiff]'s termination" are insufficient to establish discrimination, even when such statements are made by the decision maker. See Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221; Merrick v. Farmers Ins. Grp., 892 F.2d 1434, 1438 (9th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted) (finding that hiring executive's comment that he chose "a bright, intelligent, knowledgeable young man" over appellant was merely stray remark and insufficient to establish age discrimination).
Here, Germano stated that these purported jokes and comments "would just sort of happen occasionally." (Defs.' Germano Dep. 88:18-19.) They also appear to have been uttered in an ambivalent manner, as there was "nothing inherent' in these comments that would make them aimed at his hearing disability. See Haley v. Cohen & Steers Capital Mgmt., Inc., 871 F. Supp. 2d 944, 958 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (finding comments were not gender harassment because they "might be stated in reference to a male employee just as easily as they may be stated to a female employee"). Cf. Cordova v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 124 F.3d 1145, 1149 (9th Cir. 1997) ("Calling someone a 'dumb Mexican' [*26]  is an egregious and bigoted insult, one that constitutes strong evidence of discriminatory animus on the basis of national origin."). According to the Gasaway Email, individuals at ITT's headquarters determined Germano's termination, and Germano failed to show that the comments related, directly or indirectly, to his termination. See Medina v. Multaler, Inc., 547 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1107 n.13 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (citation omitted) ("As a 'stray comment' that is unrelated to the decision-making process, [the comment's] probative value falls short of establishing age discrimination."). In sum, the comments Germano complains of do not "directly suggest[ ] the existence of bias" on the basis of disability. See Godwin, 150 F.3d at 1221. Accordingly, the comments do not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. Where there is no evidence of discriminatory animus without inference or presumption, the McDonnell Douglas test applies. See Lucent, 642 F.3d at 745 n.22. The Court now turns to the circumstantial evidence.
b. Circumstantial Evidence of Disability Discrimination
Under the McDonnell Douglas test, the plaintiff must first make a prima facie case of physical disability discrimination by showing that: "(1) he suffers from a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to do his job; and (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of [*27]  his disability." Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 343 (citation omitted). Germano established that he suffers from a disability, was performing competently, and was terminated.16 ITT's decision to hire a Representative to replace Germano, coupled with its purported failure to accommodate his disability and engage in the interactive process, give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus.
The burden now shifts to ITT to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. ITT claims that Germano was terminated as part of its nationwide PBT to reduce staff, which was implemented by ITT's headquarters, and that Germano's supervisors were not involved in the decision. Downsizing alone may not be a sufficient nondiscriminatory explanation, under FEHA, for the termination of a protected worker. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358 (citing Matthews v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 128 F.3d 1194, 1195 (7th Cir. 1997) ("Even if the employer has a compelling reason wholly unrelated to the disabilities of any of its employees to reduce the size of its work force, this does not entitle it to use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its disabled workers.")). On balance, ITT's proffered justification and evidence are suspect for the following reasons.
First, ITT alleges that 106 Representatives nationwide were terminated [*28]  under the PBT, which is a sizable pool of employees that could have weighed in ITT's favor. But ITT failed to show that non-disabled Representatives whose PP&Es reflected "4" or "5" ratings in 2012 and 2013 constituted a portion of those terminated along with Germano. See Earl, 658 F.3d at 1114 (citation omitted) (stating that employees are "similarly situated" to plaintiff when they "have similar jobs and display similar conduct"). Additionally, the PBT was subject to certain "exceptions," such as in the situation where the PBT would reduce staffing levels at a particular campus below 33%, (Bisch Decl. ¶ 6), but ITT does not address whether, under those scenarios, it "rationally and fairly arrived at" its decision. See Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1733 (1994). It was ITT's burden to address these issues, and it failed to do so.17See Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 224 (citation and quotation marks omitted) ("The employer must show that the procedure by which the employee was terminated was validly and fairly devised and administered to serve a legitimate business purpose.").
Second, the forgery allegations surrounding Fimbres undercut the legitimacy of ITT's justification, notwithstanding the fact that Fimbres assumed the Director of Recruiting position only several months before [*29]  Germano's termination. Fimbres admitted to having employees sign blank QO forms before she completed her observations of them and admitted to forging Germano's signature on his March 2013 QO form. The QO forms are used to document that the Director of Recruitment observed the employee's performance, and the PP&E takes into account "critical behaviors," which, according to ITT, are based on the Director of Recruiting's subjective observations of the Representative. (See Bisch Decl. ¶ 3; Bisch Decl. Ex. A.) Thus, ITT's reliance on Germano's PP&Es as the reason for his termination appears less legitimate. Finally, ITT's modification of Germano's 2013 PP&E from a "4" to a "5" after he was terminated and its failure to produce the original PP&E further weaken the credibility of ITT's justification.
Even if ITT did meet its burden, Germano shows pretext—or that ITT's proffered reason "had no basis in fact, the proffered reason did not actually motivate the discharge, or the proffered reason was insufficient to motivate discharge." See id. (citation omitted); see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256 (finding pretext where employer's explanation is "unworthy of credence"). ITT proffers only two pieces of evidence supporting [*30]  its justification: the Gasaway Email, which does not specify the PBT by name, and the Spreadsheet, which is inadmissible for lack of authentication and foundation. ITT does not provide the policy, practice, or other evidence from ITT's headquarters regarding how the PBT was administered, relying solely on the Bisch Declaration. Further, a plaintiff "may raise a triable issue of pretext through evidence that an employer's deviation from established policy or practice worked to her disadvantage." Earl, 658 F.3d at 1117 (citations omitted). In this case, ITT deviated from its progressive discipline policy. In the year leading up to his termination, Germano received one written warning in March 2012, a counseling in June 2012, a rating of 4 on his 2012 PP&E, and a 5 on his corrected 2013 PP&E. (See Defs.' Facts ¶ 16.) The record indicates that Germano received no progressive disciplinary actions in 2013, and that ITT's headquarters was concerned about terminating employees who had not received progressive discipline. (See Gasaway Email 1.) ITT contends—without supporting facts—that Germano was provided with at least weekly counseling, or verbal "weekly coachings," while employed by ITT. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 17; [*31]  Pl.'s Fimbres Dep. 21:11-19.) Even if Germano did receive these coachings, Fimbres herself stated that she did not think they constituted progressive discipline. (See Pl.'s Facts ¶¶ 147-48.) Further, Fimbres never completed a review of Germano's performance during her tenure as Director of Recruitment. (Defs.' Facts ¶ 58.)
Although "[i]t is not enough . . . to disbelieve the employer" to form an inference of discrimination, "evidence that the employer's proffered reasons are pretextual is significant: Thus, a plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated." Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 343 (collecting cases). Germano has provided requisite "specific" and "substantial" evidence to establish a triable issue as to his claim for disability discrimination. See Bergene v. Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement & Power Dist., 272 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir. 2001).
Accordingly, ITT's Motion as to Germano's claim for disability discrimination is DENIED.
2. Age Discrimination
Germano does not offer direct evidence of age discrimination, relying only on circumstantial evidence. To meet the prima facie case, Germano must show that (1) at the time of the adverse action, [*32]  he was at least 40 years old; (2) he was satisfactorily performing his job; (3) an adverse employment action was taken against him; and (4) some other circumstance suggesting a discriminatory motive was present, "such as his replacement by a significantly younger worker with similar qualifications." Holtzclaw, 795 F. Supp. 2d at 1010 (citing Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355). As with his disability discrimination claim, Germano makes a prima facie case. He was 63 years old, was satisfactorily performing his job, and was terminated. The fact that Germano was replaced by a substantially younger individual in her 20s, (see Pl.'s Facts ¶ 150), permits an inference of unlawful discrimination. Further, Germano claims that Fimbres "wanted a younger team" and was "buddybuddy" with the younger people in the office. (Pl.'s Germano Dep. 166:7-13.)
Next, the burden shifts to ITT to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. ITT claims that the PBT was a corporate decision to reduce the staff by terminating poor performers. (See Bisch Decl. ¶ 6.) The California Supreme Court discussed terminations in reduction-in-force cases:
[D]ownsizing alone is not necessarily a sufficient explanation, under the FEHA, for the consequent dismissal of an age-protected [*33]  worker. An employer's freedom to consolidate or reduce its work force, and to eliminate positions in the process, does not mean it may use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its [older] workers. Invocation of a right to downsize does not resolve whether the employer had a discriminatory motive for cutting back its work force, or engaged in intentional discrimination when deciding which individual workers to retain and release. Where these are issues, the employer's explanation must address them.
Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 358 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As discussed in Section II.B.1.b, supra, ITT's reduction-in-force justification is insufficient to demonstrate a legitimate nondiscriminatory action. ITT fails to address the particular issue of whether younger Representatives were also terminated as part of the PBT, such as what the median age of the terminated employees was. Further, Fimbres' forgery allegations and the modification of Germano's 2013 PP&E weaken the legitimacy of ITT's justification. Even if ITT met its burden, Germano raises a triable issue of pretext by showing that ITT's justification is "unworthy of credence," for the same reasons discussed in connection [*34]  with the disability discrimination claim in Section II.B.1.b, supra. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.
Accordingly, ITT's Motion as to Germano's age discrimination claim is DENIED.
C. Harassment
Germano alleges that he was subjected to harassment and a "hostile working environment" based on his perceived and/or physical disability(s) and his age. (FAC ¶ 20.)
Under the FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer "because of . . . physical disability . . . medical condition . . . [or] age . . . to harass an employee . . . . An entity shall take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(j)(1). A prima facie case of harassment requires the plaintiff to show that: "the harassing conduct was severe enough or sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a work environment that qualifies as hostile or abusive to employees because of their [protected characteristic]. There is no recovery for harassment that is occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial." Nielsen v. Trofholz Techs., Inc., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1167-68 (E.D. Cal. 2010). Harassment includes "verbal harassment," including "epithets, derogatory comments or slurs"; "physical harassment," including physical interference with normal work or movement; and "visual harassment," including "derogatory posters, cartoons, [*35]  or drawings." See Haley, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 957 (quoting Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 7287.6, subd. (b)(1)(A), (B) & (C)). "'[M]erely offensive' comments in the workplace are not actionable." Lyle v. Warner Bros. Tel. Prods., 38 Cal. 4th 264, 283 (2006). A hostile working environment exists "when the incidents of harassment occur in concert or with a regularity that can reasonably be termed pervasive." Etter v. Veriflo Corp., 67 Cal. App. 4th 457, 463 (1998); see Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993). "The environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive." Nielsen, 750 F. Supp. 2d at 1168.
In his Opposition, Germano argues that "it is well established that Plaintiff was subjected to a hostile working environment on the basis of his disability and age," citing his discussions on disability- and age-based discrimination as factual support. (Opp'n 23.) Germano claims that ITT "created a quid pro quo and hostile working environment in which harassment, discrimination and retaliation based on sex, and perceived and physical/mental disabilities were permitted and tolerated, evidencing a cultural bias." (Opp'n 18.) This boilerplate argument fails.
Germano provides no facts suggesting that he was subject to a hostile working environment, let alone one on the bases of disability and age.18See F.T.C. v. Publ'g Clearing House Inc., 104 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir. 1997) ("A conclusory, self-serving affidavit, lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact."). First, [*36]  Germano claims that the alleged comments—such as "Hey, did you hear what I said"—were based on his disabilities; he does not allege any facts with respect to age-based harassment. This argument is unpersuasive, as there is "nothing inherent" in these comments that would make them disability-based. See Haley, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 958. As ITT points out, "the referenced 'jokes' are not 'jokes,' but simply reflect that people needed to speak louder in Plaintiff's vicinity," and there is no evidence that the "jokes . . . relate in any way to Plaintiff's disability, as opposed to his poor performance." (Defs.' Resp. ¶¶ 82-83.) Germano admitted that nobody ever complained about his use of the headset, (Defs.' Germano's Dep 89:5-9), which suggests an absence of evidence of a hostile working environment.
Second, even if a reasonable person in Germano's position would have found the comments offensive, they occurred only "occasionally," (Defs.' Germano Dep. 88:18-19), which also weakens an inference that this was a workplace "permeated with [age-based or disability-based] intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the [plaintiff's] employment and create an abusive [*37]  working environment.'" Haley, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 958 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Further, because Germano offers no evidence of an accompanying physical threat, his claim is defective as a matter of law. See Haley, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 957 (stating that comments alone are not "sufficiently severe to constitute [ ] harassment, as a matter of law").
Finally, Germano's laundry list of purported harassing conduct is unhelpful, as the "general collective nature of additional purported incidents" do not fall within the scope of "harassment" under the FEHA.19See Haley, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 958 ("Plaintiff's reliance on [his employer's] . . . treatment of plaintiff on conference calls, his performance-related statements and emails, and his decisions with respect to plaintiff's transfer and commission decisions, do not constitute qualifying verbal, physical, or visual harassment with respect to plaintiff's gender or disability.").
Accordingly, ITT's Motion as to Germano's harassment claim are GRANTED.
D. Retaliation
"In assessing the viability of FEHA retaliation claims in the context of motions for summary judgment, California courts apply the same burden-shifting analysis" used for discrimination claims, as discussed in Section II.A., supra. See Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1176 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citations omitted).
For [*38]  a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must establish that: "(1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action." Akers v. Cnty. of San Diego, 95 Cal. App. 4th 1441, 1453 (2002). First, a protected activity includes the plaintiff's informal complaints about his employer, "such that actions taken against [him] after these initial complaints are appropriately the subject of [his] retaliation claim." Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., 212 F.3d 493, 506 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Second, an adverse employment decision must have "a substantial and material adverse effect on the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment." Akers, 95 Cal. App. 4th at 1455; see also Xing Xing Lin v. Potter, No. CV 10-03757 LB, 2011 WL 1522382, at *13 (N.D. Cal. April 21, 2011) (requiring a lower standard than for a discrimination claim—"what matters is whether [the decision] might dissuade a reasonable employee from complaining about discrimination"). Third, "[e]ssential to a causal link is evidence that the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity" and "the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision." See Cohen, 686 F.2d at 796; Yartzoff, 809 F.2d at 1376. The plaintiff must show "by a preponderance of the evidence that engaging in the protected activity [*39]  was one of the reasons for [his] firing and that but for such activity [he] would not have been fired." Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1064-65 (9th Cir. 2002).
Germano alleges that he engaged in protected activity by "requesting reasonable accommodations, and time off for his disabilities, throughout his employment," that he was subjected to an adverse employment action by being terminated, and that the close temporal proximity between the protected activity and termination establishes a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a causal link exists. (Opp'n 17.)
Germano cannot make a prima facie case of retaliation. First, requesting reasonable accommodations and time off is not a "protected activity" within the meaning of FEHA. Under the language of California Government Code section 12940(h), "the protected activity must have some element of express opposition to an action or policy or practice of the employer." Kelley v. Corrections Corp. of Am., 750 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1144 (E.D. Cal. 2010) ("The interpretation of 'protected activity' that Plaintiff urges would significantly blur and perhaps obliterate the distinction between an action for failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process and retaliation."). Even if Germano's requests constituted "protected activity," he failed to show the necessary causal link with respect to his termination. [*40]  Germano made requests "throughout his employment," as early as 2003, of which ITT was aware, yet Germano was terminated only in July 2013. Germano does not allege any other facts indicating causation.20
Because Germano cannot establish a prima facie case, the Court need not analyze the remaining burdens, which would nevertheless yield the same result. Germano relies only on an argument of temporal proximity for his retaliation claim, which is insufficient. See Arteaga, 163 Cal. App. 4th at 357 ("Where the employee relies solely on temporal proximity in response to the employer's evidence of a nonretaliatory reason for termination, he or she does not create a triable issue as to pretext, and summary judgment for the employer is proper."
Accordingly, ITT's Motion with respect to retaliation is GRANTED.
E. Violations of Public Policy
Germano alleges that ITT's actions constituted retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of the public policy set forth in the FEHA. (FAC ¶ 58.)
Disability and age discrimination claims "can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." City of Moorpark v. Super. Ct., 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1160-61 (1998) (citation omitted) ("[W]e think discrimination based on disability, like sex and age discrimination, violates a 'substantial and fundamental' [*41]  public policy and can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim."). The public policy against discrimination as reflected in FEHA is sufficient to form the basis of a common-law wrongful termination claim. See McCullough v. Xerox Corp., No. CV 13-04596 HSG, 2015 WL 5769620, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2015) (citations omitted). "The elements of a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are: (1) an employer-employee relationship; (2) termination or other adverse employment action; (3) the termination of the plaintiff's employment was in violation of public policy; (4) the termination was a legal cause of the plaintiff's damages; and (5) damages." Gardner v. Fed. Express Corp., No. CV 14-01082 TEH, 2015 WL 4192588, at *11 (N.D. Cal. July 10, 2015) (citation omitted).
Here, it is undisputed that Germano's public policy claims are derivative of his FEHA discrimination claims. (See Opp'n 24) (citing to discrimination discussions). Because there are triable issues of material fact for his predicate discrimination claims, the Court DENIES ITT's Motion with respect to Germano's claims for retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
F. Declaratory Relief
Germano seeks a declaration that ITT committed acts of harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or other similar acts as prohibited by the FEHA, as well as a permanent injunction against ITT [*42]  as to said conduct. (FAC ¶¶ 68-74.)
To fall within the Declaratory Judgment Act,21 "'the case of actual controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests,' and it must be 'real and substantial and admi[t] of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.'" McCullough, 2015 WL 5769620, at *11 (quoting MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007)). "The propriety of the application of summary judgment to declaratory relief lies in the trial court's function to render such a judgment when only legal issues are presented for its determination." Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor & Assocs., 98 Cal. App. 4th 1388, 1401-02 (2002) (citations, quotation marks, and formatting omitted). "The grant or denial of a permanent injunction rests within the trial court's sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion." Contra Costa Cnty. v. Pinole Point Props., LLC, 235 Cal. App. 4th 914, 925 (2015). Injunctive relief will be denied if, "at the time of the order of judgment, there is no reasonable probability that the past acts complained of will recur . . . ." In re Tobacco Cases II, 240 Cal. App. 4th 779, 802 (2015) (citation omitted).
Because Germano's request is predicated on his harassment, discrimination, and retaliation claims, and Germano failed to raise a triable issue of material fact [*43]  on his harassment and retaliation claims, summary judgment is proper as to his request for declaratory relief. See Gafcon, 98 Cal. App. 4th at 1402 (stating that plaintiff is not entitled to declaratory relief if the undisputed facts do not support the premise for the relief). While declaratory relief and a permanent injunction may be appropriate if ITT's conduct was "serious, pervasive, and continuous," see Fed. Trade Com'n v. John Beck Amazing Profits LLC, 888 F. Supp. 2d 1006, 1015 (C.D Cal. 2012), Germano offers no evidence warranting a permanent injunction.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS ITT's Motion as to Germano's request for declaratory relief and a permanent injunction.
G. Punitive Damages
Under California law, a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages where she can show by "clear and convincing evidence[ ] that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294. Where the defendant is a corporation, the evidence must show that an officer, director or managing agent of the defendant committed, authorized or ratified an act of malice, oppression or fraud. See McCullough, 2015 WL 5769620, at *12 (adding that "supervisory employees" are not considered managing agents unless they have "substantial discretion" in their decision-making capability). See id. Here, because Germano's FEHA and wrongful termination claims survive [*44]  summary judgment, it would be premature to dismiss his request for punitive damages. Thus, ITT's Motion as to Germano's request for punitive damages is DENIED.
III. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART ITT's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment. The Court GRANTS the Motion with respect to Germano's claims for harassment and retaliation and his request for declaratory relief and a permanent injunction. The Court DENIES the Motion with respect to Germano's claims for failure to provide reasonable accommodations and engage in interactive process; discrimination based on disability and age; retaliation and wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and punitive damages.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
