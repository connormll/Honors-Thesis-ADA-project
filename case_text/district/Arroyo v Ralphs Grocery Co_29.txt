ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION [DKT. 24]; DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [DKT. 25]; AND DECLINING SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION OVER PLAINTIFF'S UNRUH ACT CLAIM

RULING
Before the court are Defendant Ralphs Grocery Company's ("Defendant" or "Ralphs") Motion for Summary Judgment, Or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication ("Defendant's Motion" or "Def. MSJ"), Dkt. 24, and Plaintiff Rafael Arroyo's ("Plaintiff") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("Plaintiff's Motion" or [*2]  "Pl. MSJ"), Dkt. 25. On May 7, 2021, the court found these matters appropriate for resolution without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for May 14, 2021. Dkt. 33; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Local Rule 7-15.
For the reasons set forth below, the court GRANTS Defendant's Motion and DENIES Plaintiff's Motion.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff is a paraplegic, cannot walk, and uses a wheelchair for mobility. Dkt. 30-6 (Def. Resp. re: PSS), ¶ 1. Defendant Ralphs is the tenant and operator of the Food 4 Less grocery store (the "Store"), which is located at or about 7810 Norwalk Blvd., in Whittier, California. Id. ¶¶ 2-3. The Store is a facility open to the public and a business establishment. Id. ¶ 4. Plaintiff went to the Store on March 12, 2020. Id. ¶¶ 2, 5. As he approached the meat section, Plaintiff saw there was a ticket dispenser for customers to take a ticket to get in line to place an order. Id. ¶ 6. The ticket dispenser was placed on top of the meat counter, behind a display rack, and was out of Plaintiff's reach. Id. According to Plaintiff, investigations conducted on March 19, 2020 and November 4, 2020, revealed the top of the meat counter was 55 inches high and the ticket dispenser, placed on top of the meat counter, was [*3]  approximately 61 inches high. Id. ¶¶ 8-9.
Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this action on March 27, 2020, alleging causes of action for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and California Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act"), Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f). Dkt. 1 (Compl.). Plaintiff specifically alleged the ticket dispensers were not "in conformance with the ADA standards as it relates to wheelchair users like the plaintiff." Id. ¶ 12. Plaintiff further alleged as follows regarding Defendant's customer restrooms: "Even though the plaintiff did not confront the barrier, on information and belief the defendants currently fail to provide wheelchair accessible restrooms. Plaintiff seeks to have these barriers removed as they relate to and impact his disability." Id. ¶ 17.
Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on February 19, 2021, and Plaintiff filed his motion for partial summary judgment, as to the Unruh Act claim only, on February 22, 2021. Dkts 24, 25. The court took the motions under submission on May 7, 2021. Dkt. 33. On August 31, 2021, the court ordered Plaintiff to show cause ("OSC") why the court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act Claim. Dkt. 35. Plaintiff timely responded on September [*4]  13, 2021. Dkt. 36.

RULING

DISCUSSION

I. Legal Standards
Summary judgment is appropriate where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each claim upon which the moving party seeks judgment. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Facts are "material" only if dispute about them may affect the outcome of the case under applicable substantive law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. Id.
If the moving party meets its initial burden, the opposing party must then set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial to defeat the motion. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), (e). Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The court must decide whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a [*5]  matter of law in light of the facts presented by the nonmoving party, along with any undisputed facts. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 & n. 3 (9th Cir. 1987). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).
When deciding a motion for summary judgment, "the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." Id. at 587. "If the nonmoving party produces direct evidence of a material fact, the court may not assess the credibility of this evidence nor weigh against it any conflicting evidence presented by the moving party. ... Inferences from the nonmoving party's 'specific facts' as to other material facts, however, may be drawn only if they are reasonable in view of other undisputed background or contextual facts and only if such inferences are otherwise permissible under the governing substantive law." T.W. Elec., 809 F.2d at 631-32. "[S]ummary judgment should not be granted where contradictory inferences may reasonably be drawn from undisputed evidentiary facts...." Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal Co. v. Turley, 622 F.2d 1324, 1335 (9th Cir. 1980). The nonmoving party, however, must not simply rely on the pleadings and must do more than make "conclusory allegations [in] an [*6]  affidavit." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.

II. Analysis

A. ADA Claim
The ADA prohibits discrimination "on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). To prevail on a Title III discrimination claim, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) defendant discriminated against plaintiff by denying him public accommodations because of his disability. Lopez v. Catalina Channel Express, Inc., 974 F.3d 1030, 1033 (9th Cir. 2020). "If a particular architectural feature of a place of public accommodation is inconsistent with the [ADA Accessibility Guidelines], a plaintiff can bring a civil action claiming that the feature constitutes a barrier that denies the plaintiff full and equal enjoyment of the premises in violation of the ADA." Oliver v. Ralphs Grocery Co., 654 F.3d 903, 905 (9th Cir. 2011). "Because a private plaintiff can sue only for injunctive relief (i.e., for removal of the barrier) under the ADA, ... a defendant's voluntary removal of alleged barriers prior to trial can have [*7]  the effect of mooting a plaintiff's ADA claim." Id. at 905.
Here, Plaintiff acknowledges that the Store's ticket dispenser no longer violates the ADA. Dkt. 31 (Pl. MSJ Reply) 1. Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant's request to dismiss Plaintiff's first claim for violation of the ADA as moot and DENIES Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. See Dkt. 24-1 at 6-8; Dkt. 25-1 at 1; see also, e.g., Whitaker v. BOP FIGAT7TH LLC, Case No. 2:18-cv-1360-RSWL (Ex), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37086, 2019 WL 1081207, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2019) (finding plaintiff's ADA claim moot where defendant removed noncompliant transaction counter).

B. Unruh Act Claim
In an action over which a district court possesses original jurisdiction, that court "shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution." 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). A court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims, however, when it "has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction" or "in exceptional circumstances" where "there are ... compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction." 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3)-(4).
As the court has dismissed Plaintiff's ADA claim as moot, it has disposed of the only claim [*8]  over which it had original jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3). The court, thus, has discretion whether to maintain its supplemental jurisdiction over the state claim, which "lies in considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to the litigants." United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966); see also Executive Software N. Am. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for Cent. Dist. of Cal., 24 F.3d 1545, 1557 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds by Cal. Dep't of Water Res. v. Powerex Corp., 533 F.3d 1087 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting a court should consider the values of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity when deciding to maintain supplemental jurisdiction). The Supreme Court has also recognized that "in the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine—judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity—will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims." Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988).
Here, judicial economy will not be aided by retaining the Unruh Act claim, as none of the material issues in this case have been decided. As of yet, the court also has not expended significant judicial resources as to this action, and no date for trial is currently set. See Dkt. 15. Nor would retaining jurisdiction over the state-law claim be fair to Defendant, as it appears Plaintiff may have filed this lawsuit in federal [*9]  court to skirt the special restrictions applicable to high-frequency litigants bringing construction-related accessibility claims in California courts.1See Arroyo v. Rosas, 19 F.4th 1202, 1212-14 (9th Cir. 2021) (recognizing Arroyo's filing of actions in federal court to avoid the procedural strictures that California put in place establish exceptional circumstances). Finally, regarding comity, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that "retention of supplemental jurisdiction over ADA-based Unruh Act claims threatens to substantially thwart California's carefully crafted reforms in this area and to deprive the state courts of their critical role in effectuating the policies underlying those reforms." Id. at 1213.
Moreover, given the court's concerns about Plaintiff's circumvention of fees and additional procedural requirements imposed on construction-related accessibility claims by high-frequency litigants filed in California state courts, the court also finds there are "other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(4). See id. at 1211-14.
In sum, the court concludes that the factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity do not favor retaining supplemental jurisdiction over the Unruh Act claim. Several courts within the district have reached [*10]  the same conclusion on similar facts involving other high-frequency litigants represented by the same law firm as Plaintiff.2See, e.g., Eye Phone City, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186281, 2020 WL 7065831, at *3 (denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and dismissing complaint where plaintiff alleged he used a wheelchair and needed a lowered counter); BOP FIGAT7TH LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37086, 2019 WL 1081207, at *4 (same); see also Oliver, 654 F.3d at 911 (district court did not abuse discretion in dismissing state law claims after granting summary judgment to defendants on ADA claim where the district court concluded that "the factors of 'judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity' did not 'tip in favor of retaining the state-law claims' after the dismissal of the ADA claim").
The court, therefore, DECLINES supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim and DISMISSES this claim without prejudice to its refiling in state court.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and GRANTS Defendant's Motion and request to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claim as moot. Plaintiff's first cause of action under the ADA is DISMISSED as moot. The court further declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the second cause of action under the Unruh Act, DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff's Motion [*11]  as to his Unruh Act claim, and DISMISSES the claim without prejudice to its refiling in state court. The court need not address Defendant's evidentiary objections. See Dkt. 30-5.
This Order shall constitute notice of entry of judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. Pursuant to Local Rule 58-6, the court ORDERS the Clerk to treat this order, and its entry on the docket, as an entry of judgment.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
