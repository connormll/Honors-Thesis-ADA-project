Opinion



ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
(Docket No. 30)
On October 20, 2014, Plaintiff Jungoak Cha filed this lawsuit pro se against Defendant, "The Kaiser Permanente,"1 alleging various legal wrongs stemming from Cha's dismissal from her employment as a registered nurse. Docket No. 1 (Complaint). On January 15, 2015, this Court held a hearing on Defendant's first motion to dismiss. Docket No. 25. The Court granted the motion in its entirety, but allowed Cha an opportunity to file an amended complaint. Docket No. 26 (Order on MTD). Cha filed her amended complaint on February 26, 2015. Docket No. 28 (FAC).
Defendant now moves to dismiss Cha's amended complaint. Docket No. 30 (Motion to Dismiss). Many of the same defects this Court identified in its order granting Defendant's previous motion to dismiss remain present in Cha's amended complaint. Namely, Cha pleads insufficient facts to support her claims of age or racial discrimination, nor does she plead sufficient facts to proceed on her workplace injury, retaliation, or federal labor law claims. Because Plaintiff has had an opportunity to amend these claims, and provided no indication that she could plead additional facts to state a plausible claim, these claims will be dismissed with prejudice.
That said, Cha has successfully stated a claim for disability discrimination. Moreover, Cha has pleaded sufficient facts to demonstrate that she could be eligible for equitable tolling of the limitations period for her federal ADA claim, which would otherwise be time-barred. Thus, the Court will permit Cha's lawsuit to proceed on her federal and state disability discrimination claims.

I. BACKGROUND
Cha was employed as a registered nurse at Kaiser for over 30 years. FAC at ¶5. Around February 6, 2011, Cha began suffering various physical ailments. [*3]  Id at ¶ 10. For instance, she reports feeling "left leg numbness," experiencing headaches, and being unable to sleep. Id. She also reports that she "noticed brown spots and burnt skin, [and suffered] dry eyes, ear pain . . . kidney damage and nerve dysfunction." Id. According to Cha, these ailments can be traced to "cadmium exposure at her workplace that Defendant KAISER PERMANENTE knew or reasonably should have known about." Id. See generally Cadmium, United States Dept. of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/cadmium (last accessed, January 9, 2015) (describing cadmium as a "highly toxic" metal "known to cause cancer" and other serious ailments).
Cha intermittently took time off of work between February 2011 and May 2011 as a consequence of her ailments. FAC at ¶ 10. Unfortunately, her disability would worsen whenever she returned to work. Id. Thus, Cha requested Defendants provide her with a "reasonable accommodation," such as allowing her to "do her job as an advice nurse at home, work at an alternative job site and/or work reduced hours." Id. at ¶ 21. According to Cha, no reasonable accommodation was offered. Id. at ¶ 22. Cha went on formal medical leave on August 28, [*4]  2011. Id. at ¶ 9.
On January 22, 2012, Cha submitted a doctor's note "in support of extending her medical leave of absence until March 22, 2012." FAC at ¶ 5. But on March 7, 2012, Defendant sent Cha a formal termination letter, informing her that her employment at Permanente was terminated as of March 8, 2012. Id. at ¶ 6; see also id. at Exhibit 2 (Termination Letter). According to Cha, Defendants terminated her employment despite her verbal and written requests that Permanente "modify her employment conditions to accommodate her disabilities." Id. at ¶ 35. Cha further contends that her firing violated a provision in the collective bargaining agreement governing her employment that requires employees be given at least two weeks notice of any termination. See id. at ¶ 62.
Immediately after she was terminated, Cha contacted a representative from her union, the California Nurses Association (CNA). FAC at ¶ 13. In an email Cha attached to her complaint, a union representative writes that a "Step 2 grievance" was filed on her behalf on March 16, 2012. Id. at Exhibit 4. Cha alleges that the union "violated its duty to fairly represent me as its member in failing to timely file a grievance [*5]  and in its failure to file a grievance at all."2 Id. at ¶ 14.
Sometime in 2013, Cha filed a discrimination complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). See FAC Ex. 6 (DFEH Notice of Case Closure and Right to Sue). The DFEH sent a "Notice of Case Closure and Right to Sue" letter to Cha on October 25, 2013. Id. A copy of the right to sue letter is appended to this Order as Appendix A.3 According to DFEH, Cha's complaint was "Investigated and Dismissed: Insufficient Evidence." Id. The letter [*6]  informs Cha that any "civil action [brought under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act or related state statutes] must be filed within one year from the date of this letter." Id. The letter says nothing about the statute of limitations for federal law causes of action which, instead of one year, is only 90 days from issuance of a right to sue letter. Id. The letter simply states that " [y]our complaint is dual filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)." Id. In her First Amended Complaint, Cha avers that she went to the EEOC office where she spoke to a "male employee" who informed her that "she just needed to follow the DFEH Right to Sue letter and that it is not necessary to fill out any EEOC application." FAC at ¶ 15. Cha further claims that she "relied on the EEOC representative to give me reliable advice as to the deadline for the filing of a federal action." Id.
The operative complaint pleads seven enumerated causes of action: (1) disability discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); [*7]  (2) racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); (4) disability, race, and age discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA); (5) breach of the collective bargaining agreement, in violation of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA); (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED); and (7) negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). See FAC at ¶¶ 18-74. While not explicitly styled or enumerated as separate causes of action, Cha's complaint also appears to allege a violation of California Labor Code section 132(a), which prohibits employers from discharging an employee "because he or she has filed . . . a claim for [worker's] compensation." Cal. Lab. Code 132(a); FAC at ¶ 8. Finally, Cha's complaint also appears to allege an unenumerated tort claim stemming from Cha's alleged exposure to cadmium in the workplace. See FAC at ¶ 10. According to Plaintiff, Defendant "knew or reasonably should have known about" her cadmium exposure, and Plaintiff further alleges that Permanente "knowingly concealed from her the presence of cadmium at her workplace." Id.

II. [*8]  DISCUSSION
A. Applicable Legal Standard
To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 681, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (holding that conclusory allegations are not entitled to the presumption of truth). When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the Court will consider the pleadings, exhibits attached to the complaint, and matters properly subject to judicial notice. See Akhtar v. Mesa, 698 F.3d 1202, 1212 (9th Cir. 2012). This Court has "an obligation where the [plaintiff] is pro se . . . to construe the pleadings liberally and to afford the [plaintiff] the benefit of any doubt." Id. (citation omitted).
A claim may be dismissed as untimely pursuant to a 12(b)(6) motion only when the running of the statute of limitations is apparent on the face of the complaint. See U.S. ex rel. Air Control Technologies, Inc. v. Pre Con Indus., Inc., 720 F.3d 1174, 1178 (9th Cir. 2013).
B. Cha Has Adequately Pleaded Disability Discrimination
Cha's complaint appears to allege three distinct forms of disability discrimination under the ADA and FEHA: (1) Permanente declined to accommodate Cha's disability; (2) failed to engage in the interactive process to determine possible accommodations for her disability; and (3) wrongfully terminated her on the basis of her disability. [*9]  See FAC at ¶¶ 18-30; 52-58. The Court discusses the sufficiency of each type of disability claim below.
1. Failure to Accommodate
Failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's known disability can violate both the ADA and FEHA. See U.S. Airways v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 396, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002) ("discrimination" under ADA includes "not making reasonable accommodations"); Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). To establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA, Cha must show that "(1) she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) she is a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation; and (3) she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability." Samper v. Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, 675 F.3d 1233, 1237 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal modifications omitted). The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are nearly identical under FEHA. See Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 784 F.3d 495, 2015 WL 1591368, at *2 (9th Cir. 2015). Namely, a plaintiff must show that she: (1) "'has a disability under FEHA'"; (2) "'is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position'"; and (3) "'the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability.'" Id. (quoting Scotch v. Art Inst. of California-Orange Cnty., Inc., 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338, 358, 173 Cal. App. 4th 986 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009)).
Here, Cha adequately pleaded the [*10]  first element of a failure to accommodate claim: she alleges that she was legally disabled from August 2011 onward.4 FAC at ¶ 19; see also id. at ¶ 17 (alleging that the Social Security Administration adjudged Cha permanently disabled as of August 2011). Indeed, Defendant does not dispute Cha's disability status. See Mot. at 4.
Cha also adequately pleaded the second element of a failure to accommodate claim. According to Cha, "she could do her job as an advice nurse at home, work at an alternative job site and/or work reduced hours." FAC at ¶ 21. This allegation that "she could do her job" with certain requested accommodations, such as working from home or for fewer hours, is sufficient at the pleading stage to demonstrate that Cha was "a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation." Samper, 675 F.3d at 1237; see also Scotch, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 358.
Finally, Cha also adequately pleaded the final element of a [*11]  failure to accommodate claim, namely that her "employer failed to reasonably accommodate [her] disability." Nigro, 784 F.3d 495, 2015 WL 1591368, at *2. According to Cha, she made "numerous written and verbal requests for reasonable accommodation," FAC at ¶ 53, but Permanente "fail[ed] to provide reasonable accommodation to her." Id. at ¶ 23; see also id. at ¶ 22 (alleging Defendant "refused Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation"); ¶ 25 (alleging that failure to accommodate violated the ADA). This is all Cha needed to plead in order to survive a motion to dismiss her failure to accommodate claim, especially in light of the Court's obligation to liberally construe Plaintiff's complaint given her pro se status. See Akhtar, 698 F.3d at 1212.
2. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
Under both the ADA and FEHA, "an employer has a mandatory obligation to engage in the interactive process" when an employee requests an accommodation for a disability. Ludovico v. Kaiser Permanente, 57 F. Supp. 3d 1176, 2014 WL 3725720, at *18 (N.D. Cal. 2014); see also U.S. E.E.O.C. v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 620 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir. 2010). "This interactive process requires: (1) direct communication between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable [*12]  and effective." UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 620 F. 3d at 1110 (citation omitted).
Defendant does not specifically argue in its motion to dismiss that Cha failed to adequately plead an interactive process claim.5 Hence, the Court need not spend much time analyzing this claim, which has not been directly challenged. In any event, it seems clear that Cha has alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate a potential violation of the interactive process requirement. Cha alleges that she frequently and repeatedly requested accommodation for her disability throughout 2011 and again in early 2012. See FAC at ¶¶ 5, 9, 21-25. In spite of these requests, Cha alleges that "no modified work was offered." Id. at ¶ 9; see also id. at ¶ 22 ("Without any significant basis, Defendant KAISER PERMANENTE refused Plaintiff's requests for reasonable accommodation."). This is enough to get past the pleading stage on this claim.
3. Wrongful Termination [*13]  on the Basis of Disability
To state a claim under either the ADA or FEHA for wrongful termination on the basis of her disability, Cha must establish that (1) she suffers from a disability; (2) she was otherwise qualified to do her job; and (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. See Nigro, 784 F.3d 495, 2015 WL 1591368, at *1. In order to determine whether an adverse employment action occurred "because" of an individual's disability, this Court may apply the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting test. See Kasperzyk v. Shetler Sec. Servs., No. C-13-3358 EMC/TEH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2015); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 52-54, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 (2003) (applying McDonnell Douglas test to ADA disability discrimination claim). The Plaintiff must first come forward with some evidence "from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such [adverse employment] actions were based on a prohibited discriminatory criterion." Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *6 (citation omitted). If, the plaintiff provides such evidence, the burden shifts to the employer to provide evidence supporting a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse employment action. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, [WL] at *7. If the employer provides such evidence, the burden shifts back to the Plaintiff to show discrimination. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, [WL] at *8. One way an [*14]  employee can satisfy this burden is to show that the employer's proffered reason for the adverse employment action is "unworthy of credence." 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, [WL] at *8 (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000)).
As noted above, Cha has adequately alleged the first two factors of her wrongful termination claim — she apparently suffered from a disability, and alleges that she was capable of performing the essential tasks of her advice nurse position with certain accommodation(s). According to Defendant, however, Cha has not pleaded sufficient facts to show that she was terminated "because of her disability." Mot. at 4.
Admittedly, Cha's is not a model pleading, and a number of her accusations are conclusory and thus not entitled to the presumption of truth at the 12(b)(6) stage. See Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 681 (holding that conclusory allegations are not entitled to the presumption of truth). For instance, Cha's bare allegation that she was "terminated from her employment . . . because of her disabilities" is not sufficient to defeat Defendant's Rule 12 motion. FAC at ¶ 39. However, other facts considered in the light most favorable to Cha indicate that she has stated a sufficiently plausible claim for relief. Specifically, Cha attached correspondence from Defendant indicating [*15]  that Cha was being terminated because Permanente "cannot extend your medical leave of absence indefinitely." FAC, Ex. 1. This sentence alone indicates that the reason Cha was fired was not because of poor job performance or some other plainly legitimate factor unrelated to Cha's condition, but because she was disabled and unable to return to work (without accommodation).6 Moreover, the same email indicates that Defendant had requested Cha to "provide us with a doctor's note that indicated your current work status no later than March 6th." Id. Despite the fact that Permanente itself had apparently agreed to give Cha until the 6th of March to provide appropriate documentation in support of her continued leave of absence, Defendant fired Cha on the 6th — at 2 p.m. PDT. Id. Evidence that Permanente fired Cha for allegedly failing to submit a doctor's note, but failed to wait for its own deadline to expire before conducting the termination, could show that the proffered reason(s) for the termination (e.g., Cha failed to provide a doctor's note) was pretextual. See Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *7. This is particularly true in light of Cha's allegation that she had in fact submitted a doctor's note in January 2012 that [*16]  was supposed to extend her leave through March 22. FAC at ¶ 5. Taken together, Cha has sufficiently pleaded a plausible claim that she was terminated because of her disability.
C. Cha Has Pleaded Sufficient Facts to Be Eligible for Equitable Tolling of the Federal Statute of Limitations
Under the ADA, a plaintiff has ninety days to file a lawsuit after the receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the DFEH.7 See Marshall v. City and Cnty. of S.F., No. C-14-4409 WHA, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4079, 2015 WL 216748, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2015) (citations omitted). This limitations period is enforced strictly against pro se and represented litigants alike. [*17]  Payan v. Aramark Management Services Ltd. P'ship, 495 F. 3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Baldwin Cnty. Welcome Cntr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 150, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 80 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1984) (dismissing a pro se Title VII complaint filed outside of limitations).
While the statute of limitations is a defense, where the complaint states facts that facially demonstrate an action is time-barred, dismissal on such grounds is appropriate. See Air Control Technologies., 720 F.3d at 1178; Marshall, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4079, 2015 WL 216748, at *1. Here, Cha's complaint attaches a copy of her DFEH right-to-sue letter, which is dated October 25, 2013. FAC, Ex. 6. Cha's ADA claim, however, was not filed until October 20, 2014. Docket No. 1. Thus, Cha's ADA claim is plainly untimely.
Nevertheless, the "'90-day filing period is a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling in appropriate circumstances.'" Marshall, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4079, 2015 WL 216748, at *1 (quoting Valenzuela v. Kraft, 801 F.2d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir. 1986)); see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (holding that equitable tolling "is read into every federal statute of limitations") (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This Court previously gave Cha an opportunity to amend should she be able to plead facts that would support the equitable tolling of the federal limitations period. The operative complaint contains just such allegations.
Cha alleges that she went to the EEOC office (at least in part) to obtain "reliable advice as to the deadline for the filing of a federal action," but that a "male employee told Plaintiff that she just needed to follow the DFEH Right to Sue letter." [*19]  FAC at ¶ 15. As this Court previously observed in this case, however, the DFEH letter Cha was supposed to "follow" was "arguably ambiguous or misleading: The letter clearly states that Ms. Cha has one year to file an action under California law, but says absolutely nothing about the relevant limitations period under Federal law." Cha v. Kaiser Permanente, No. C-14-4672 EMC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12036, 2015 WL 434983, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2, 2015). The letter also states that the complaint was dual-filed with the EEOC, and thereby seems to indicate to a lay individual that no separate action vis-a-vis the EEOC is required. See Appendix A. Indeed, under such circumstances even a legally sophisticated recipient might read the DFEH letter to imply that the federal and state procedures are largely the same, and that no additional action was required to preserve the recipient's federal rights. Put simply, it seems highly likely that the DFEH letter affirmatively misled Plaintiff into believing she had one year to file both her federal and state law claims.8
The Ninth Circuit has explained that equitable tolling requires the district court to "balanc[e] the equities in the particular case." Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, 265 F.3d 890, 901 (9th Cir. 2002). In cases where an individual was allegedly misled by an administrative agency while attempting to exhaust a claim, the circuit has "set forth some factors meriting consideration" regarding equitable tolling. Id. Specifically, the "equities favor a discrimination plaintiff who (1) diligently pursued his claim; (2) was misinformed or misled by the administrative agency responsible for processing his charge; (3) relied in fact on the misinformation or misrepresentations of that agency . . .; and (4) was acting pro se at the time." Id. at 902 (citations omitted). All four of the relevant factors appear to favor equitable tolling of the limitations period here.
First, Cha diligently pursued her claim. Her California discrimination claims are indisputably timely filed, and Cha alleges that she sought out guidance from the EEOC before [*21]  filing suit. See FAC at ¶ 15. Second, Cha claims that she was misinformed or misled by the administrative agency responsible for processing her charge. Indeed, Cha was likely misinformed or misled by both the DFEH and the EEOC. The DFEH letter itself is misleading, and according to Plaintiff, a "male employee" of the EEOC further advised her that she could simply follow the (misleading) procedures laid out in that letter. Id. He apparently did not tell Cha that she had to file her federal claim significantly earlier than her FEHA claims, or face probable dismissal. Id. Third, Cha explicitly pleaded that she "relied on the EEOC representative to give me reliable advice as to the deadline for the filing of a federal action." Id.9 And fourth, Cha was (and still is) acting pro se at the time she was allegedly misled by both the DFEH and EEOC. In light of these facts, and in light of the further fact that even a reasonable and diligent litigant would not typically expect a cause of action to be subject to such an exceedingly short limitations period as the ninety-day ADA limitations period here, the Court finds that Cha has pleaded sufficient facts to demonstrate a plausible entitlement [*22]  to equitable tolling. See Rodriguez, 265 F.3d at 902 (suggesting that factors relevant to the tolling determination, such as whether a plaintiff was actually misled by the administrative agency, are questions of fact typically reserved for jury determination).
In sum, Cha has adequately stated a claim for disability discrimination under both the DFEH and the ADA. Cha's DFEH claims are timely,10 and her ADA claims may be timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling.
D. Cha's Remaining Claims are Insufficiently Pleaded and Are Dismissed With Prejudice
With the exception of the disability discrimination claims discussed above, all of Cha's other claims remain insufficiently pleaded, and are dismissed from this case with prejudice.
1. Race Discrimination Claim
Cha alleges that she was discriminated against, and ultimately fired, because of her race. FAC at ¶¶ 31-44. Ms. Cha is of Korean decent. Id. at ¶ 32. The only facts Cha pleaded in her complaint that support her race discrimination allegation are contained in paragraph 38 of her amended complaint:
From before February 6, 2011 to March 8, 2012, some managers at Defendant KAISER PERMANENTE complained about Plaintiff's English accent despite the fact that Plaintiff, who has lived in the United States for over 38 years, has strong English skills. Said unfair and [*24]  wrongful criticism was racially motivated and constituted a hostile work environment.
FAC at ¶ 38. These allegations do not appear sufficient to successfully state a claim for racial discrimination in violation of Title VII. While accent-based discrimination can be actionable under Title VII, Cha does not causally connect these alleged comments about her accent to her firing. Cha was employed at Kaiser for 30 years, and during that time her accent apparently had never been seen as a barrier to her ability to successfully work as a nurse. Cha does not plead any facts (e.g., a new and racist manager was hired) to explain why her accent would, after 30 years, surface as a cause for adverse employment action. There are no allegations which would render her claim sufficiently plausible. Cha has previously obtained leave to amend this claim. Further leave to amend is denied.
2. Age Discrimination Claim
Cha's claim for age discrimination under the ADEA is even more inadequately pleaded. For the second time, Cha has pleaded no facts to support her claim. The only relevant allegation in her amended complaint in support of her ADEA claim reads as follows: "Plaintiff was terminated from her employment [*25]  of over 30 years as a registered nurse at Defendant KAISER PERMANENTE because of her age." FAC at ¶ 48. This type of conclusory allegation cannot be credited at this stage under Twombly and Iqbal, and so dismissal is appropriate.
That said, Cha includes additional facts in her opposition brief in an effort to stave off dismissal. Here, Cha claims that certain unidentified "managers" at Kaiser had advised her to "retire if possible," and another manager "advised her that if she was suffering with environmental conditions . . . retirement would be a good solution." Docket No. 38 at 7. Of course, this Court cannot consider these additional facts not contained in the complaint for the purposes of deciding the instant motion. Schneider v. California Dept. of Corrections, 151 F.3d 1194, 1197 n.1 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding a court may not look beyond the complaint to a plaintiff's moving papers in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion). The Court observes, however, that even if these allegations are true, they would not support a plausible claim that Cha was terminated because of her age.11 Hence, this claim is dismissed with prejudice.
3. Breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement
Cha's fifth cause of action alleges that she was wrongfully terminated pursuant to her collective bargaining agreement with Permanente. FAC at ¶¶ 60-64. Specifically, she claims she was not given the required 2-weeks notice of her termination. Id. at ¶ 62.
Cha's claim is governed by section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA). See Stallcop v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, 820 F.2d 1044, 1048 (9th Cir. 1987); see also DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 165, 103 S. Ct. 2281, 76 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1983) (a suit against an employer for breach of a collective bargaining agreement "rests on § 301" and thereby arises under federal law). In order to prevail on her LMRA claim against Permanente for breach of the collective bargaining agreement, Cha would also need to prove that her union violated its duty of fair representation to her. DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 165.
Here, Cha's claim fails because she has not shown that her union breached its duty of fair representation. As the Supreme Court has explained, the "duty of fair representation is of major importance, but a breach occurs only when a union's conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith." United Steelworkers of America v. Rawson, 495 U.S. 362, 372, 110 S. Ct. 1904, 109 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1990). Thus, "mere negligence, even in the enforcement of a collective-bargaining agreement, [*27]  would not state a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation . . . ." Id. at 372-373. Indeed, the duty of fair representation has been characterized as a "purposefully limited check" on the arbitrary exercise of union power, because a "wide range of reasonableness must be allowed for a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents." Id. at 374 (citation omitted).
Here, Cha claims the union violated its duty of fair representation because she made "numerous" requests for the union to "file a grievance for her" but the union failed to "timely file a grievance" and/or failed to "file a grievance at all." FAC at ¶ 13. While allegations in a complaint are typically taken as true on a motion to dismiss, Cha's complaint here attaches emails which clearly indicate that the union did file a timely grievance with Permanente. Specifically, Exhibit 4 to the FAC contains an email sent from Karen Chan, of Plaintiff's union, to three individuals with Kaiser Permanente email addresses, stating that "CNA [California Nurses Association] is hereby filing a Step 2 grievance on behalf of Jung Cha who was issued termination in violation of para 312 (no discrimination) and para 4021 (just cause) [*28]  of the Collective Bargaining Agreement." The email is dated March 16, 2012; just one week after Ms. Cha was terminated from her employment. Additionally, the same exhibit also contains an email from Ms. Chan to the Plaintiff, sent in May 2012, that appears to attach a copy of the union grievance for the Plaintiff's records/review. And in an attached email dated January 7, 2015, Cha writes to her sister that she "found that [t]he cna filed grievance in other [e]mail. I will show you LATER." Docket No. 42 at 9. Simply put, the attachments to Cha's complaint disprove the allegations made therein that the union failed to file a grievance, thereby breaching its duty of fair representation to her. Thus, Ms. Cha's fifth cause of action is dismissed with prejudice.
4. Worker's Compensation Retaliation Claim
Although Cha did not specifically plead a separate cause of action for an alleged violation of section 132(a) of the California Labor Code, her complaint does fairly appear to claim that Defendant violated this code section.
Section 132(a) prohibits employers from discharging an employee "because he or she has filed . . . a claim for [worker's] compensation." Cal. Lab. Code 132(a). The extent of Cha's section 132(a) claim reads as follows:
Plaintiff was terminated from KAISER PERMANENTE while [*29]  a pending worker's compensation case (ADJ7460710 (Oakland District Office)) that Plaintiff had filed in November 2008 was ongoing at the time. Labor Code Section 132(a) prohibits employees from discrimination and from retaliation against employees who pursue workers' compensation benefits.
FAC at ¶ 8. These conclusory facts are insufficient to state a claim under section 132(a). Notably, Cha does not properly plead that Defendant possessed a retaliatory motive. Absent other evidence, a causal connection between Cha's termination and her worker's compensation case cannot be inferred here; there is a four-year period between Cha's filing her worker's compensation claim and her termination. Such a "lengthy passage of time precludes any reasonable inference that the discharge was the result of Plaintiff filing a worker's compensation claim." Gilliland v. Safeway Inc., No. 2:08-cv-1134 MCE, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80354, at *16 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2008) (dismissing section 132(a) claim where only evidence of retaliatory motive was four-year time lapse between employee's worker's compensation claim and his termination); see also Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) (recognizing that while "causation can be inferred from timing alone" in certain cases where an adverse [*30]  employment action "follows on the heels of protected activity" a "nearly 18-month lapse between protected activity and an adverse employment action is simply too long, by itself, to give rise to an inference of causation"). This claim is dismissed.
5. Workplace Tort Claim
Cha's operative complaint similarly does not list a separate cause of action alleging a workplace injury claim against Permanente. That said, Cha's complaint does contain an allegation that Defendant "knew or reasonably should have known about" cadmium at Plaintiff's workplace. FAC at ¶ 10. The FAC also contains an allegation made "on information and belief that Defendant KAISER PERMANENTE knowingly concealed from [Plaintiff] the presence of cadmium at her workplace."
In this Court's order dismissing Cha's first complaint filed in this action, the Court noted that worker's compensation typically provides the exclusive remedy for workplace injury claims. Cha, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12036, 2015 WL 434983, at *4 (citing Marsh & McLennan, Inc. v. Superior Ct., 49 Cal. 3d 1, 5, 259 Cal. Rptr. 733, 774 P.2d 762 (Cal. 1989)). The Court observed, however, that a narrow exception to the exclusive remedy provision may apply where a workplace injury is aggravated by an employer who fraudulently conceals from the employee a known exposure to a toxic chemical. See Johns-Manville Prods. Corp. v. Suprerior Ct., 27 Cal. 3d 465, 467, 165 Cal. Rptr. 858, 612 P.2d 948 (Cal. 1980) (holding that an asbestos [*31]  company could be held liable in an action at law for aggravating an employee's lung cancer where the employer fraudulently concealed the condition and its cause from the employee). The Court instructed Cha to "include all facts regarding her exposure to cadmium, including any knowledge Permanente may have had of such poisoning" in her complaint. Cha, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12036, 2015 WL 434983, at *5.
Cha's amended complaint does not plead sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that Permanente knowingly and fraudulently concealed Plaintiff's cadmium exposure from her, thereby aggravating her illness. Cha's conclusory statements, pleaded on "information and belief" that Permanente did engage in knowing concealment is insufficient to survive Defendant's motion to dismiss. No specific supporting facts are alleged. Because Cha has already had an opportunity to plead sufficient facts to take her cadmium poisoning claim outside the exclusive remedy provision of worker's compensation, this claim is dismissed with prejudice.
6. IIED and NIED Claims
Cha's sixth and seventh causes of action allege intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. FAC at ¶¶ 65-74. The predicate acts that form the basis of the IIED and NIED claims [*32]  are those described above (i.e., disability discrimination, cadmium exposure, etc...). Id. Obviously, to the extent that Cha's only remaining substantive claim is for disability discrimination, this is the only behavior that can form the basis of Cha's IIED and NIED claims. Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *12 (holding that a plaintiff may not pursue emotional distress claims predicated on conduct alleged in other substantive causes of action that were dismissed by the court).
Permanente argues that both claims for emotional distress are time barred because Cha brought suit after the two-year statute of limitations expired. See Soliman v. CVS RX Servs., Inc., 570 F. App'x 710, 711 (9th Cir. 2014) ("Under California law, there is a two-year statute of limitations for intentional infliction of emotional distress claims"); Umar v. Storlie, No. C12-6071 HRL, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118176, 2013 WL 4483377, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2013) ("The statute of limitations for claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress is two years"); see also Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 335.1. The statute of limitations for IIED and NIED claims "begins to run when the plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of the outrageous conduct by the defendant." Soliman, 570 F. App'x at 711 (citing Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp., 4 Cal. App. 4th 857, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 151 (1992)).
It appears that Cha's emotional distress claims are time barred. She was terminated in March [*33]  2012, filed her original complaint in October 2014, and filed her emotional distress claims for the first time in 2015 — outside the limitations period assuming she began to "suffer severe emotional distress" upon her termination (a reasonable assumption absent contrary facts). See Soliman, 570 F. App'x at 711. See Air Control Technologies., 720 F.3d at 1178.
In any event, her emotional distress claims may be dismissed for an additional reason: failure to adequately plead "outrageous conduct beyond the bounds of human decency." See Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *12 (citing Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (Cal. App. 1996)). As this Court explained in Kasperzyk, following the California Court of Appeal holding in Janken, "'personnel management decisions [which] are improperly motivated' do not involve outrageous conduct sufficient to support an IIED claim." Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *12 (quoting Janken, 46 Cal. App. 4th at 80). Put simply, "personnel management activity is insufficient to support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, even if improper motivation is alleged," absent extraordinary circumstances. Janken, 46 Cal. App. 4th at 80; see also Kasperzyk, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37953, 2015 WL 1348503, at *12. Because Cha has not pleaded any facts that would show her alleged termination on the basis of her disability amounted to "outrageous conduct" sufficient to support an emotional distress claim, her sixth and seventh causes of action will be dismissed with prejudice. [*34] 

III. CONCLUSION
Cha's claims for disability discrimination, brought under both the ADA and FEHA, are sufficiently pleaded to survive Defendant's motion to dismiss. Moreover, Cha may be eligible for equitable tolling, which could render her otherwise untimely ADA claim timely. None of Cha's remaining claims are adequately pleaded, however, and are hereby dismissed with prejudice.
This order disposes of Docket No. 30.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
