Opinion



ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
THIS CAUSE came before this Court upon Defendant Akima Global Services, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (the "Motion"), (ECF No. 104). This Court has reviewed the Motion, pertinent portions of the record, and applicable law and is otherwise fully advised of the premises. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth herein, the Motion, (ECF No. 104), is GRANTED.

I. Brief Factual Background
The following pertinent facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. When the facts are in dispute, they are taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Plaintiff. See Chapman v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 861 F.2d 1515, 1518 (11th Cir. 1988).
Since July 2014, Defendant has provided management and security services at the Krome North Service Processing Center ("Krome") pursuant to a contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (Def.'s [*2]  Statement Material Facts ("Def.'s SOMF") ¶ 1, ECF No. 105.) Krome serves as a detention facility that holds undocumented adult male detainees awaiting deportation or asylum hearings. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.) Some detainees have been convicted of criminal offenses, including violent offenses. (Id. ¶ 3.) In fact, the Parties agree that Krome can become a dangerous to detainees and Defendant's employees if not managed and staffed properly. (Id. ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff was employed with Defendant from July 1, 2014, to November 18, 2016, as a detention officer. (Id. ¶ 6.) Before then, Plaintiff worked in the same role for Doyon-Akal, Joint Venture, which held the contract for Krome from DHS before Defendant. (Id. ¶ 7.) As part of Plaintiff's employment, Defendant provided Plaintiff with a Job Analysis for the detention officer position, Defendant's Fitness for Duty Policy, and Defendant's Employee Handbook. (Id. ¶ 8.)
The Job Analysis expressly outlined a Detention Officer's "Essential Duties:"
The incumbent's duties are performed in a detention facility environment; working with a wide variety of people from different cultures, backgrounds and speaking various languages, while performing multiple functions. [*3] 
PHYSICAL DEMANDS: The incumbent is required to work the majority of hours in an indoor/outdoor detention center environment, standing and walking the majority of time, while maintaining a degree of physical fitness to manage the firefighting equipment and other equipment, lift heavy objects and respond quickly to changes in work demands, emerging situations and emergencies.
(Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 23.) The frequency attributed to the Essential Duties outlined is "100%." (Id.) The Job Analysis also details the "Physical Demands" imposed on Defendant's Detention Officers. (Id. at 24.) Pertinent to this case, Plaintiff was expected to bend, climb, crawl, stand, and twist for up to four hours; kneel for up to six hours; and sit and walk for up to eight hours a day. (Id.) Moreover, the Job Analysis required that Detention Officers frequently lift or carry weight up to fifty pounds. (Id. at 25.) Plaintiff does not dispute that she knew that she had to meet the physical demands to work as a Detention Officer. (Def.'s SMF Ex. 1, at 111:5-25.)
The Fitness for Duty Policy requires that Detention Officers "be physically and mentally fit to perform regular duties." (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, [*4]  ECF No. 153-2, at 16.) Moreover, it provides that "to provide a safe environment, employees must be physically and mentally able to perform their job duties in a safe, secure, and effective manner; and remain able to do so throughout the entire time they are working." (Id.) The Fitness for Duty Policy warns that "Employees who are not fit for duty may present a safety hazard to themselves or others in the facility, offsite post locations, or during transport of detainees." (Id.) The Fitness for Duty Policy went on to require that
"[alt a minimum, all detention and transportation officers must be able to perform the following activities:
. . . .
• Perform a full range of security duties including work requiring moderate and arduous exertion under normal or emergency situations.
• Stand for more than 4 hours at a time.
• Ascend and descend at least three flights of stairs.
• Push wheelchair bound individuals weighing up to 350 pounds.
• Work on slippery and uneven surfaces.
• Assist in the movement of an incapacitated adult in the event of an emergency or evacuation.
• Physically protect themselves and others in the event of an emergency.
(Id. at 16.)
Pertinent to this case, Defendant's Employee [*5]  Handbook details Defendant's Family Medical Leave Act (the "FMLA") and Leave policies. (Id. at 13-14.) The Employee Handbook states that, consistent with the FMLA, a "qualified employee" is eligible to "take up to 12 weeks of time off for the . . . serious health condition of the employee . . . ." (Id. at 13.) Moreover, the Employee Handbook states that the "FMLA requires coordination of the employer-provided paid leave options, and overlaps to some degree with laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of . . . handicap status." (Id.) Defendant goes on to state that "[w]ith early notice from the employee, AGS will be in a better position to accommodate essential leave requests, even where FMLA does not strictly apply. In any case where the employee needs time off for reasons that are defined above, the employee should promptly contact HR with questions." (Id.)
During Plaintiff's employment, the Parties were subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement, which provides inter alia the negotiated and agreed-upon policies for various types of leave. (Id. at 31-33.) Relevant portions of Article 11 Leaves of Absence reads as follows:
SECTION 11.1 LIMITATIONS
Personal leaves of absence for [*6]  non-medical emergencies may be granted at the sole discretion of the Employer without loss of seniority to the Employee. Such leaves, if granted, are not to exceed 30 days, unless a special extension is approved by the Employer. An employee on any unpaid leave of absence will be required to use available vacation or personal leave time in full before beginning the unpaid leave. Length of service with the Employer shall not accrue for purposes of vacation, holiday, or other accrued benefits for any unpaid leave of absence over thirty (30) days. The Employer will make every reasonable effort to maintain an Employee's position while on a non-statutory unpaid leave of absence. Unpaid leaves of absence may be taken only with written approval of the Employer or in a case of verified personal emergency. Failure to report for scheduled shifts without Employer permission will Supervisor to disciplinary action.
Any full-time employee who uses more than two (2) days of leave without pay (LWOP) per Government contract year for absences not covered by Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), Worker's Compensation, or whose absence is not a company approved accommodation and/or leave, will face [*7]  discontinuance of employment.
All unpaid leaves of absence under this article are without pay, benefits, or allowance.
SECTION 11.2 MEDICAL LEAVE
A. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is incorporated herein.
B. The Company agrees to honor the FMLA for all eligible Employees.
C. During medical leave, the Employee shall be required to furnish a report from the doctor when requested periodically by the Employer. Upon the expiration of said leave, the Employee shall furnish the Employer with a statement, signed by the doctor, which establishes the fitness of the Employee to return to the Employee's previously held work. Any Employee who is not able to return to work with a medical clearance from a licensed physician at the end of a maximum medical leave shall be terminated from Employment.
D. If the Employee files for medical leave on false pretext or works for another employer without pre-authorization from the company, the Employee will be removed from the DO program and from employment with Employer.
. . . .
SECTION 11.6 SICK LEAVE
Each full-time Employee shall be eligible to use a maximum of six (6) days of sick leave per 12-month year worked. Sick leave shall accrue at the rate [*8]  of 1 day for each 2 months worked.
Sick leave will be payable for full days of absence due to illness commencing on the first (1st) consecutive day of illness, and will not be paid for more than eight (8) hours at the employee's regular straight time rate for each day the employee is eligible to receive sick pay. Sick leave will not be considered as time worked for purposes of computing overtime. The Employer may require proof of disability or evidence of sickness after three (3) consecutive days of absence. Unused Sick leave shall not accrue from year to year. Any Sick Leave unused at the end of each anniversary year shall be cashed out, payment shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the anniversary date.
B. [sic] Employees who work less than forty (40) hours per week average will have their Sick pay pro-rated based on average hours worked per week over the prior year.
SECTION 11.7 PROCESSING UNPAID LEAVES OF ABSENCE
The Employer will consider requests for unpaid leaves of absence and may grant them at its sole discretion. An unpaid leave of absence must be processed in the following manner:
A. All requests for unpaid leaves of absence shall be submitted in writing to the Project [*9]  Manager at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date the leave will take effect, except in cases of verified personal emergencies, and include: 1. The reasons for such leave; 2. The effective dates of such leave; 3. The estimated date of return to work.
B. The Company will respond to the request within three (3) working days.
C. The written request for leave of absence shall be submitted to the Contract Manager by the Site Supervisor for final approval. I f the request for the leave of absence is approved by the Contract Manager, a copy of the approved leave of absence will be given to the Employee involved.
D. Extensions of the leave of absence may be granted at the sole discretion of the Employer, upon written request by the Employee within ten (10) calendar days prior to the expiration of the leave of absence. Extensions, when granted, shall not total more than thirty (30) days
(Id.) This Court highlights that Plaintiff does not dispute that "[a]n essential function of a Detention Officer is to be present at work[,]" (Def.'s SMF ¶ 23, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s Resp. Statement Material Facts ("Pl.'s SMF") ¶ 23, ECF No. 109), and "[b]eing physically fit, being able to lift over 50 pounds, [*10]  and being able to repeatedly bend and kneel are essential functions of a Detention Officer position[,]" (Def.'s SMF ¶ 24, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 24, ECF No. 109).
Plaintiff has suffered from spinal problems since 2010. (Id. ¶ 26.) In January 2011, Plaintiff underwent a nerve-blocking procedure for back pain; in January 2012, Plaintiff underwent a fusion surgery; and thereafter received treatment for her back pain. (Id. ¶ 25.) In 2015, Plaintiff requested intermittent medical leave from April 30, 2015, to October 29, 2015, under the FMLA due to her back pain. (Id.) Defendant Approved Plaintiff's April 2015 request, and Plaintiff took approximately 200 hours of intermittent leave from June 15, 2015, to September 15, 2015. (Id. ¶ 27; Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 44 (outlining Plaintiff's FMLA leave allowance from June 15, 2015, to November 6, 2015).)
On November 11, 2015, Plaintiff was retroactively approved for continuous FMLA leave from September 22, 2015, to December 13, 2015, due to her back pain. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 105.) There is no dispute that Plaintiff ultimately took FMLA leave from September 22, 2015, to January 20, 2016. (Id. ¶ 28; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 109.) [*11]  It is also undisputed that, from September 2015, to September 2016, Plaintiff used 904 hours of FMLA leave, exceeding Plaintiff's FMLA leave entitlement by 424 hours. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 109; Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 40-41 (listing FMLA hours Plaintiff used from September 2015, to September 2016).)
On May 18, 2016, Plaintiff again requested FMLA leave for her back pain. (Def.'s SMF 30, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 30, ECF No. 109.) Plaintiff's request was for leave to start (retroactively) on May 1, 2016, and end on December 31, 2016. (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 1053, at 47.) In Plaintiff's Request for Leave of Absence Form, Plaintiff stated that the reason for her absence was the "[n]eed to continue treatment for my condition of my lower back." (Id.) On the form, Plaintiff marked a box that states that "[t]he following is the reason I am requesting this time away from work: A serious health condition that makes me unable to perform the essential functions of my job." (Id.)
On May 31, 2016, Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter via certified mail, which stated that her May 18, 2016, request for FMLA leave was denied because Plaintiff had exhausted [*12]  her FMLA leave, for which "an employee is eligible for up to 12 weeks (480 hours) . . . in a 12 month period measured backwards from the date of any FMLA leave usage." (Id. at 43.) The May 31, 2016, letter stated that Plaintiff had exhausted her FMLA leave as of November 2015. (Id.) Plaintiff argues that this letter was inaccurate but provides no evidentiary proof of its inaccuracy. (Pl.'s SMF In 31-32, ECF No. 109.)
On July 22, 2016, Plaintiff again requested FMLA leave from August 1, 2016, to "December 2016." (Def.'s SMF ¶ 33, ECF No. 105.) The July 22, 2016, request, however, was for intermittent leave. (Id.; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 33, ECF No. 109.) In the July 22, 2016, Request for Leave of Absence Form, Plaintiff stated that the reason for her absence was "Requesting FMLA." (Id.) On the form, Plaintiff again marked a box that states that "[t]he following is the reason I am requesting this time away from work: A serious health condition that makes me unable to perform the essential functions of my job." (Id.) In any event, Plaintiff does not dispute that she took more than 420 hours of FMLA leave than to which she was entitled. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 109.)
On August 11, 2016, Defendant's [*13]  former Leave Administrator, Sania Gul, sent Plaintiff a letter granting the July 22, 2016, leave request. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 34, ECF No. 105.) Defendant states that the August 11, 2016, letter was sent by mistake. (Id.) Plaintiff contends that the letter was not a mistake. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 34, ECF No. 109.) Defendant states that after learning of Plaintiff's second request and approval for FMLA leave and, Defendant's Human Resources Manager, Karen Sinanan, questioned whether Plaintiff qualified for additional leave. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 35, ECF No. 105-3.) Thereafter, an internal audit revealed that Plaintiff worked 1,083.21 hours in the relevant twelve-month period, and Plaintiff had exceeded her 480-hour FMLA leave allowance. (Id. ¶¶ 3637.) Plaintiff disputes this fact but provides no specific evidentiary support for her position that Plaintiff was eligible for excess FMLA leave or that Ms. Sinanan believed Plaintiff was eligible. (See Pl.'s SMF ¶ 36, ECF No. 109.) Ms. Sinanan testified at her deposition that her email contained a scrivener's error in the form of a double-negative and that Plaintiff was ineligible for further FLMA leave. (Sinanan Dep. 81:5-82:24, Pl.'s SMF Ex. 1, ECF No. 109-1, [*14]  at 83-84; see also Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 55 ("We need to send her a letter rescinding her FML so that she is aware.").)
Following the audit, Ms. Sinanan directed Ms. Gul to rescind Plaintiff's approved FMLA leave for the period between August 1, 2016, and December 2016. (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 55.) Plaintiff contends that Ms. Gul's approval was for the May 18, 2016, request and not the July 22, 2016, request, but neither the record evidence nor Plaintiff's understanding of the leave rescission letter supports Plaintiff's contention. (See, e.g., Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 1053, at 68-69.)
In September 2016, Defendant's Human Resources Director, Michael Burklow, sent Plaintiff a letter informing Plaintiff that her prior leave approval was erroneous. (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF no. 105-3, at 40-41.) The September 2016 letter, sent via FedEx and email to Plaintiff, states in pertinent part as follows:
Dear Ms. Cruz:
This Letter is to notify you that after an audit of your FMLA records, it has been determined that you are no longer eligible to continue any form of intermittent or continuous FLMA leave. The timeline indicated below is the result of the audit and will explain [*15]  the reason for denial of further FMLA leave.
• On June 3, 2015, you were approved for intermittent FMLA from April 30, 2015 to October 29, 2015.
• On November 11, 2015, you were approved for continuous FMLA from September 22, 2015 to December 13, 2015. However, the actual time you were on FMLA was 9/22/15 to 1/20/16.
• In May 2016, you made another leave request and that request was denied on May 31, 2016 as you had exhausted your 480 hours of FMLA leave in a 12-month rolling period. This was explained in the May 31, 2016 letter that was sent via certified mail.
• On August 8, 2016, you made a request for intermittent FMLA starting August 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016. We discovered in the course of our audit, that this leave was approved on August 11, 2016 in error. This leave request should have been denied as you had exhausted your allowed FMLA hours.
• The total number of FMLA hours that you have taken from September 9, 2015, to September 8, 2016 is 904 hours. You have used 424 hours of FMLA leave over the maximum of 480 hours allowable under FMLA regulations in a rolling 12-month period.
Ms. Cruz, at this time you do not have any FMLA leave available to you. You will become eligible [*16]  again in December, 2016. If you decide to apply for FMLA in December, you will need to submit another leave request for approval.
(Id. at 40.) Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant sent this letter nor that she received this letter, but without providing any specific evidentiary support, Plaintiff alleges that the facts contained in the letter are erroneous. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 38, ECF No. 109.) Instead, Plaintiff states that the approval was actually for Plaintiff's May 18, 2016, request for leave; however, the record does not support Plaintiff's contention; Plaintiff received notice on May 31, 2016, that her May 18, 2016 request was denied. (Id. at 43.) Moreover, Plaintiff does not offer any evidentiary proof of the May 31, 2016, letter's inaccuracy. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 43, ECF No. 109.) The September 2016 letter included the following breakdown of Plaintiff's used FMLA leave:

(Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 41.) [*17]  While Plaintiff challenges the breakdown's accuracy, she does not provide any specific evidentiary support of the breakdown's inaccuracy. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 39, ECF No. 109.) Ultimately, however, Plaintiff does not contest that she used 904 hours of FMLA leave from September 2015 to September 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶¶ 28, 43, ECF No. 109; Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 40-41 (listing FMLA hours Plaintiff used from September 2015, to September 2016).) Plaintiff also did not keep records of how many FMLA leave hours she accumulated. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 42, ECF No. 109.)
On September 4, 2016, Plaintiff was absent from work and was issued a written warning. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 41, ECF No. 105.) On October 12, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Confidential Grievance Form in response to having received the written warning for her absenteeism on September 4, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 41, ECF No. 105; Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 68-69.) In Plaintiff's own words, the reason for Plaintiff filing the Confidential Grievance Form is as follows:
In response to the written warning (PAR) issued to me on Thursday, September 22, 2016, citing "chronic lateness/absenteeism," on Sunday, September 4, 2016, [*18]  I called-out utilizing Family Medical Leave (FMLA) due to illness. On August 12, 2016, I received notification from the FMLA Coordinator (Sania Gill) via email advising me of my approved leave request. Base don the documentation received, my leave request is approved until December 31, 2016, therefore my absence on September 4, 2016, was authorized in accordance with the FMLA policy. On Monday, September 5, 2016, upon returning home from a scheduled medical appointment, I received a Federal Express envelope containing a letter dated September 2, 2016, advising me that an error was made by the Company (Akima) in approving my request for leave under Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and my leave request is denied effective September 2, 2016. The person stated that according to their record, I have exceeded my entire leave. Prior to receiving the letter on September 5, 2016, I had no knowledge of my leave denial, therefore, at the time of my absence on September 4, 2016, I was authorized. Based on the company's failure to properly notify me of their error in processing my leave request, I request that the action being taken against me be rescinded and marked invalid. Please see attached approved FMLA documentation.
(Def.'s [*19]  SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 68-69.) Plaintiff does not dispute that she received notification of the rescission of her August to December 2016 FMLA leave request in September 2016. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 41, ECF No. 109.)
On October 7, and October 27, 2016, Plaintiff was absent from work without leave and received a written warning for each absence. (Def.'s SMF ¶¶ 45-46, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶¶ 45-46, ECF No. 109.) From November 3, 2016, to November 7, 2016, Plaintiff was again absent from work without leave. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 47, ECF No. 105.) Plaintiff alleges that each of these absences were FMLA leave rather than unexcused absences, but the record reflects-and Plaintiff does not contest-that she had already exceeded her allotted FMLA leave for the twelvemonth period preceding her leave by 424 hours. (Id. ¶ 28; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 28, ECF No. 109; Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 40-41 (listing FMLA hours Plaintiff used from September 2015, to September 2016).)
On November 7, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note to Ms. Sinanan stating that Plaintiff was scheduled for an outpatient surgical procedure on her spine on November 8, 2016, and that Plaintiff would return to work on November 22, 2016, [*20]  with the "same work status," and Plaintiff would have a follow up appointment on November 21, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 48, ECF No. 105.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not provide Defendant with advance warning for her leave request nor waited for approval. (Id. ¶ 49.) Plaintiff, alleges that she did provide notice, but she provides no more than a conclusory statement without pointing to specific facts to support her allegation. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 49, ECF No. 109.) In any event, Plaintiff proceeded with a lumbar spinal injection procedure. (Def.'s SMF¶ 50, ECF No. 105.)
On November 9, 2016, the day after Plaintiff's spinal procedure, Plaintiff's doctor, Dr. Andres Vega, diagnosed Plaintiff with lumbar post-laminectomy and sciatica issues, as outlined in the Attending Physician's statement of Short-Term Disability filed with Lincoln Financial Group. (Id. ¶ 60; Def.'s SMF Ex. 5, at 1, ECF No. 105-6.) Dr. Vega further remarked that Plaintiff was not to lift more than thirty pounds, bend, or kneel if she would return to work on a "trial" basis. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 60, ECF No. 105; Def.'s SMF Ex. 5, at 1, ECF No. 105-6.) Dr. Vega, however, stated that Plaintiff could not return to work until November [*21]  26, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 60, ECF No. 105; Def.'s SMF Ex. 5, at 1, ECF No. 105-6.)
While Plaintiff was absent from work in November 2016, Defendant's Human Resources Department recommended terminating Plaintiff's employment due to her chronic unexcused absence and the consensus that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of the Detention Officer position, including being present for work. (Id. ¶ 51.) Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant's reason for terminating her was her absenteeism. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 51, ECF No. 109.) Defendant's President, Laura Mitchell, therefore, decided that Plaintiff should be terminated. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 52, ECF No. 105.)
On November 18, 2016, Mr. Burklow, sent Plaintiff another letter on Defendant's behalf informing Plaintiff that Defendant was terminating her employment due to her "history of chronic absenteeism . . . ." (the "Termination Letter"). (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 76-77.) The Termination Letter details that, "since October 7, 2016[, Plaintiff] called out sick on the following days: 10/7/16 [Plaintiff] received a verbal [sic] warning [and on] 10/27/16 [Plaintiff] received a Written Warning . . . ." (Id. at 76.) The Termination [*22]  Letter continues by stating that Plaintiff "continued to call out sick on: 11/3/16[,] 11/4/16[,] 11/5/16[,] 11/6/16[, and] 11/7/16 . . . ." (Id.) The Termination Letter also states that Defendant reviewed Plaintiff's "doctor's note [that] indicates that [Plaintiff's] condition is 'chronic' and [that Plaintiff is] not able to perform the essential functions of [her] position as a Detention Officer in the foreseeable future." (Id.) Moreover, it states that Plaintiff's "situation continues to prevent [Plaintiff] from being present . . . which is an essential function of [her] job [and her] job is not protected as [she has] exhausted all FMLA eligibility." (Id. at 77.) Plaintiff disputes only that Plaintiff's absences were unexcused. (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 53, ECF No. 109.) Plaintiff also did not challenge her termination. (Id. ¶ 54.)
On November 29, 2016, Dr. Vega found that Plaintiff (1) had "not improved with conservative management," (2)"continues with such pain that she cannot manage activities of daily living," and (3) was, "[a]t the present time[,] . . . permanently disabled." (Def.'s SMF Ex. 6, ECF No. 105-7, at 5.) Dr. Vega went on to state that Plaintiff "cannot work because of her ongoing [*23]  issues and the inability to improve with conservative management." (Id.) Plaintiff disputes that she could not have worked, but states that "Dr. Vega's records speak for themselves." (Pl.'s SMF ¶ 61, ECF No. 109.) Plaintiff provides no evidentiary support other than her own affidavit to support that she was able to work. (Id.)
Following her termination, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. (See generally Compl., ECF No. 1-3.) In the operative complaint, the Second Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 94), Plaintiff alleges five counts against Defendant under the Florida Civil Rights Act (the "FCRA") (Counts I and II); Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA") and Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (the "ADAAA") (Counts III and IV), and Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Count V) due to Defendants' allegedly discriminatory termination. Now, Defendant moves for summary judgment as to each of those Counts.

II. Summary Judgment Standard
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a court must grant summary judgment if "the depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations . . . , or other materials . . . show . . . that there is no genuine dispute as to any material [*24]  fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. Rs. Civ. P. 56(a), (c). "The moving party bears the initial burden to show, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial." Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991); accord Kol B 'Seder, Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London Subscribing to Certificate No. 154766 Under Cont. No. B0621MASRSWV15BND 766 F. App'x 795, 798 (11th Cir. 2019). "Only when that burden has been met does the burden shift to the non-moving party to demonstrate that there is indeed a material issue of fact that precludes summary judgment." Clark, 929 F.2d at 608.
When the moving party has carried its burden, the party opposing summary judgment must do more than show that there is "metaphysical doubt" as to any material fact. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Indeed, Rule 56 "requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and, by her own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (emphasis added) (cleaned up); Kol B 'Seder, Inc., 766 F. App'x at 798. While non-conclusory, self-serving affidavits based on personal knowledge could create genuine disputes of material fact, conclusory affidavits do not defeat summary judgment. United States v. Stein, 881 F.3d 853, 857-59 (11th Cir. 2018); Rodda v. Univ. of Mia., 542 F. Supp. 3d 1289, 1295 (S.D. Fla. 2021). "[C]onclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value." Myers v. Bowman, 713 F.3d 1319, 1327 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Evers v. Gen. Motors Corp., 770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir. 1985)).
At summary judgment, this Court must view the evidence [*25]  and draw inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus., 475 U.S. at 586; Chapman, 861 F.2d at 1518. "All reasonable inferences arising from the undisputed facts should be made in favor of the nonmovant." Chapman, 861 F.2d at 1518. "However, an inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable." Id. (citing Blackston v. Shook & Fletcher Insulation Co., 764 F.2d 1480, 1482 (11th Cir. 1985)). "Speculation does not create a genuine issue of fact; instead, it creates a false issue, the demolition of which is a primary goal of summary judgment." Cordoba v. Dillard's, Inc., 419 F.3d 1169, 1181 (11th Cir. 2005). "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.' See Matsushita Elec. Indus., 475 U.S. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Servs. Co., 391 U.S. 253, 270, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). The inquiry is, therefore, whether "reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [party with the burden of proof] is entitled to a verdict . . . ." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Chapman, 861 F.2d at 1518.

III. Discussion
Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment as to all Counts of the Complaint because (1) Plaintiffs claims fail as she was not a "qualified individual" under the FCRA, ADA, ADAAA, and Rehabilitation Act; (2) even were Plaintiff a "qualified individual," Plaintiff was not discriminated against on the basis of her disability as the record does not show that Defendant terminated Plaintiff because [*26]  of her disability, Defendant had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason to terminate Plaintiff, and the record does not show that Defendant's reason for termination was pretextual; (3) even were Plaintiff a "qualified individual," Plaintiffs failure to accommodate claims fail because Defendant had granted Plaintiff reasonable accommodation, Plaintiffs leave requests were unreasonable, and Plaintiff scuttled the interactive process; and (4) Plaintiff s Rehabilitation Act claim fails because Defendant does not receive federal financial assistance for the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. (See generally Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 104.) Plaintiff argues in opposition that she (1) was a "qualified" individual under the FCRA, ADA, ADAAA, and Rehabilitation Act; (2) was discriminated against on the basis of her disability; (3) was not granted a reasonable accommodation nor an opportunity to engage in the interactive process required under the ADA and ADAAA; and (4) states a claim under the Rehabilitation Act because Defendant, as a government contractor, receives federal funding to employ Detention Officers at Krome. (See generally Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 108.)
Preliminarily, all of Plaintiff's claims are governed by the [*27]  same standards. See, e.g., Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007) ("[D]iscrimination claims under the FCRA are analyzed using the same framework as ADA Claims." (citing D'Angelo v. Conagra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1224 n.2 (11th Cir. 2005)); Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) ("Discrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards used in ADA cases . . . ." (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(d))); Solloway v. Clayton, 738 F. App'x 985, 987 (11th Cir. 2018) ("The Standard for determining liability under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as that under the [ADA] . . . ; thus, cases involving the ADA are precedent for those involving the Rehabilitation Act."); Rabb v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., 590 F. App'x 849, 850 n.2 (11th Cir. 2014) ("[D]disability discrimination claims under the FCRA are analyzed unde the same standards as ADA claims."); Ramos v. Univ. of Mia., No. 21-cv-22151-BLOOM/McAliley, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204652, 2021 WL 4949160, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 25, 2021) (analyzing ADA and ADAA discrimination claims under same standards); see also Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255 ("Under controlling law in this Circuit, [t]he burden-shifting analysis of Title VII employment discrimination claims is applicable to ADA claims." (citing Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 30, 2000))). Therefore, this Court takes Plaintiff's FCRA, ADA, ADAAA, and Rehabilitation Act claims together.
Hence, to state prima facie claims of disability discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must demonstrate that she (1) is disabled; (2) is a "qualified individual;" and (3) was subject to unlawful discrimination because of her disability. See, e.g., Cramer v. State of Fla., 117 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997)); Ramos, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204652, 2021 WL 4949160, at *2. Similarly, to prevail on a failure to accommodate claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate [*28]  that she (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was discriminated against because Defendant failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Holton v. First Coast Serv. Options, Inc., 703 F. App'x 917, 920-21 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing Lucas v. WW Grainger Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)).
The Parties do not dispute that Plaintiff satisfies the first prong—whether Plaintiff is disabled—so this Court turns to the second prong. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. Title 42, section 12111, United States Code expressly defines "qualified individual" as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). Section 12111 further defines the term "reasonable accommodation" to include
(A) making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individual with disabilities; and
(B) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
Id. § 12111(9). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job without accommodation, or, failing [*29]  that, . . . [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job with a reasonable accommodation." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citing D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir. 2005)). "An employer must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with known disabilities unless such accommodations would result in undue hardship to the employer." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. "An accommodation is reasonable . . . only if it allows the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Id. (citing LaChance v. Duffi.'s Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998)).
"If an individual is unable to perform an essential function of [her] job, even with an accommodation, he is, by definition, not a 'qualified individual' and, therefore, not covered under the ADA." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256. "In other words, the ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." Fornes v. Osceola Cnty. Sheriffs Off., 179 F. App'x 633, 635 (11th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up) (citing Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000)). "Even a relatively infrequent inability to perform a job's essential functions is enough to render a plaintiff not a qualified individual under the ADA." Billups v. Emerald Coast Utilities Auth., 714 F. App'x 929, 936 (11th Cir. 2017) (cleaned up) (citing Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1528). "'Essential functions' are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)). In determining what functions are deemed essential, the ADA provides that
[f] or the purposes of this subchapter, consideration [*30]  shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "A job function also may be essential if there are a limited number of employees among whom performance of the job can be distributed." Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(ii); Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526. Similarly, a job "function may be essential because the reason the position exists is to perform that function . . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i). "Also considered are factors such as the amount of time spent on the job performing the function and the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function." Ivey v. First Quality Retail Serv, 490 F. App'x 281, 285 (11th Cir. 2012).
To satisfy the second prong, Plaintiff must prove that she could have performed the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodations. See U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm 'n v. St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc., 842 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1255-56). Turning to the Motion, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because "she could not perform the essential functions of her job"—namely, attending work, bending, kneeling, walking for up to eight hours, standing, and lifting up to fifty pounds—"regardless of the only accommodation [*31]  she requested—a leave of absence from November 8, 2016[,] to November 22, 2016." (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 104.) In response, Plaintiff states that she "does not dispute the job functions . . . [and] she met her job functions when she was at work. (Pl.'s Resp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 5, ECF No. 108.) To that end, Plaintiff argues that the question whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual "and was able to perform her job with or without an accommodation is an issue for the trier of fact." (Id.)
Here, there is no dispute that Defendant expressly provided Plaintiff with the essential job functions associated with the Detention Officer position at Krome in Defendant's Job Analysis, Performance Work Statement, Fitness for Duty Policy, and Employee Handbook. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 8, ECF No. 105.) There is also no dispute that those essential junctions required Plaintiff to (1) regularly attend work, (2) bend, (3) kneel, (4) walk for up to eight hours, (5) crawl, (6) stand, and (7) lift up to fifty pounds. Those essential functions are commensurate with what can be expected of the position: Detention Officers at Krome are largely in charge of the extensive monitoring and detention of individuals [*32]  who are awaiting deportation (for some, after having committed violent offenses) or seeking asylum, which can be—as Plaintiff admits—dangerous if Defendant fails to properly staff and manage Krome. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.) As the essential functions of the Detention Officer position is undisputed, the inquiry is whether Plaintiff could perform those essential functions at the time of her termination: This Court finds based on the undisputed record evidence at summary judgment that Plaintiff could not.
In this Circuit, where an employee's regular attendance is an essential function of her job and the employee's absences are serial and sporadic, the employee is not a "qualified individual" for the purposes of a discrimination or failure to accommodate claim. E.g., Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279-80 (11th Cir. 1994); Hartwell v. Spencer, 792 F. App'x 687, 692 (11th Cir. 2019); Austal USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. at 1267-68. In Jackson, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed summary judgment in the defendant's favor because the plaintiff's serial absenteeism prevented plaintiff from performing the essential functions of his job. The court went on to hold that no accommodations would "address the heart of the problem: the unpredictable nature of [the plaintiff's] absences." Id. at 279. The Jackson court reasoned that requiring an employer "to accommodate such absences would place upon [*33]  [the employer] the burden of making last-minute provisions for [the employee's] work to be done by someone else" and "[s]uch a requirement would place an undue hardship on the [employer]." Id. Similarly, in Hartwell, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in the defendant's favor because the plaintiff was not a qualified individual due to his serial tardiness at the time of his termination. Hartwell, 792 F. App'x at 692. While Hartwell involved a plaintiff who was terminated for serial tardiness due to his disability, its holding is nevertheless instructive. Pertinent to this discussion, the plaintiff argued that the defendant could have offered the plaintiff continued leave, as had been done in the past, as a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed the plaintiff to continue performing the essential functions of his job. Id. The court held that '"prior accommodations do not make an accommodation reasonable.' . . . And just because an employer has, in the past, done more than required to accommodate an employee who cannot fulfill all the requirements of his job does not mean that the employer must continue to do so." Id. (citations omitted) (first citing Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003); and then citing Boyle v. City of Pell City, 866 F.3d 1280, 1289 (11th Cir. 2017)). In Austral [*34]  USA, the Southern District of Alabama granted summary judgment in the defendant's favor because the plaintiff was unable to perform the essential functions of his job (regular attendance) and the defendant could not have provided the plaintiff with any reasonable accommodation that would have allowed him to perform the essential requirements of his job. Austal USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. at 1268. The court went on to note that "[a]n employer is not required to 'create and fund a position as an accommodation.' Id. (citing Medearis v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc., 646 F. App'x 891, 896 (11th Cir. 2016)).
Here, Plaintiff adduces no specific evidentiary support (outside her own conclusory declarations) that would help carry her burden of proving she is a qualified individual. See Rodda, 542 F. Supp. 3d at 1297 (finding summary judgment in defendant's favor where plaintiff could not show specific facts that support her arguments that she was able to perform her job's essential functions). Rather, the undisputed record on summary judgment confirms that Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job, at least intermittently, between August 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, and especially between November and December 2016—the very period within which Plaintiff was terminated due to her absenteeism. Of course, if Plaintiff could [*35]  show that she could have performed the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodations, Plaintiff would satisfy the second prong. See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. But the only accommodation requested or otherwise at issue in this case—leave from work—does not allow Plaintiff to perform any of the essential functions of her job as being present at work is necessary to perform all other essential functions. And the law does not require an employer to eliminate an essential function, especially not one like attending work, to accommodate an employee. See Fornes v. Osceola Cnty. Sheriffs Off, 179 F. App'x 633, 635 (11th Cir. 2006) ("The ADA does not require the employer to eliminate an essential function of the plaintiff's job." (cleaned up)).
For instance, on May 18, 2016, Plaintiff requested continuous FMLA leave due to her back pain for the period between May 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 30, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 30, ECF No. 109.) This request was denied because Plaintiff had exhausted her FMLA leave allowance in the preceding twelve-month period. (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 43.) On July 22, 2016, Plaintiff-again-requested FMLA leave, only this request was for intermittent FMLA leave due to her back pain for the period between August 1, 2016, [*36]  and December 31, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 33, ECF No. 105.) This request was-again denied, as Plaintiff herself admitted, (Def.'s SMF Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-3, at 68-69), because she had already exceeded her FMLA leave allowance by over 420 hours in the preceding twelve-month period, (id. at 40-41). In both requests for FMLA leave, Plaintiff certified that she was requesting leave because she had "[a] serious health condition that makes me unable to perform the essential functions of my job." (Def.'s SMF ¶¶ 30, 33, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶¶ 30, 33, ECF No. 109.) The record also notes that Plaintiff was absent from work on September 4, October 7, October 27, November 3-17, 2016. (Def.'s SMF ¶¶ 41, 45-48, ECF No. 105.) Without counting Plaintiff's September 4, 2016, absence,1 Plaintiff was absent without leave for over fifteen days separate days in the months before her termination because Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job.2 The day immediately following her back procedure (and about ten days before her termination), Plaintiff's doctor, Dr. Vega, diagnosed Plaintiff with lumbar post-laminectomy and sciatica issues in the Short-Term Disability statement Plaintiff filed [*37]  with Lincoln Financial Group. (Def.'s SMF¶ 50, ECF No. 105; Def.'s SMF Ex. 5, at 1, ECF No. 105-6.) In the statement, Dr. Vega stated that Plaintiff could not return to work unless it was on a trial basis after November 26, 2022; lift more than thirty pounds; bend; or kneel. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 60, ECF No. 105; Def.'s SMF Ex. 5, at 1, ECF No. 105-6.) On November 26, 2016, just over one week after Plaintiff's termination, Dr. Vega found that Plaintiff was permanently disabled and that she "continues with such pain that she cannot manage activities of daily living . . . ." (Def.'s SMF Ex. 6, ECF No. 1057, at 5.) Dr. Vega also stated that Plaintiff "cannot work because of her ongoing issues and the inability to improve with conservative management." (Id.)
Essentially, the problem here is that the undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiff could not follow any work schedule on a regular basis, as evinced by her unpredictable, serial absences from work. Further, there is no suggestion that Defendant could have accommodated Plaintiff by changing or cutting back on her hours to alleviate the problem. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Austal USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. 3d 1252, 1267-68 (S.D. Ala. 2020). Neither is there a suggestion that Plaintiff requested transfer to, nor that [*38]  Defendant had available, an alternative position for which regular attendance was not an essential function of the job. See Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 284 (11th Cir. 1997) ("Reassignment to another position is a required accommodation only if there is a vacant position available for which the employee is otherwise qualified."); Formosa v. Mia. Dade Cmty. Coll., 990 F. Supp. 1433, 1436 (S.D. Fla. 1997) (granting summary judgment in defendant's favor where plaintiff was not a "qualified individual with a disability" and plaintiff made no showing that there existed, or that plaintiff qualified, for an alternative position). This is further supported by the Government's contractual limitation on how many employees Defendant could hire to staff Krome. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 5, ECF No. 105; Pl.'s SMF ¶ 5, ECF No. 109.) If Plaintiff could not perform the essential function of regularly attending work, Defendant was left without a Detention Officer who could perform Plaintiff's duties whenever she did not attend work. See Austal USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. at 1268 ("[The defendant] could not be expected to hire an additional employee to be on standby to perform [the plaintiff's] duties whenever [the plaintiff] could not come in."). Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff argues that granting her more leave than allowed under the FMLA—as Defendant has done to the tune [*39]  of approximately 420 more FMLA leave hours than Plaintiff was entitled to or Defendant's internal leave policies would have been a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed Plaintiff to perform the essential functions of the job, this Court finds that additional leave would not have been a reasonable accommodation because it would "not have addressed the heart of the problem: the unpredictable nature of Plaintiff's absences and Plaintiff's documented inability to perform the other pertinent essential functions of her job. See Jackson, 22 F.3d at 279.
Therefore, this Court finds that the undisputed record evidence establishes that Plaintiff was not a "qualified individual" as a matter of law at the time she was terminated because (1) Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination and (2) there was no reasonable accommodation that Defendant could have provided Plaintiff that would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her job, namely, being regularly present at work. See, e.g., id. at 279-80; Hartwell, 792 F. App'x at 692; Austal USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 1267-68; Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cal., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994) ("An employee who cannot meet the attendance requirements of the job at issue cannot be considered a 'qualified' individual protected by the ADA."); [*40]  Dibauda v. Thaxton Inv. Corp., No. 18-cv-102, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 252695, 2020 WL 1800117, at *3 n.4 (S.D. Ga. Jan. 27, 2020). Because this Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual for the purposes of her claims for discrimination and failure to accommodate under the FCRA, ADA, ADAAA, and Rehabilitation Act, summary judgment in Defendant's favor is appropriate on all of Plaintiff's claims, and this Court need not address Defendant's remaining arguments.
