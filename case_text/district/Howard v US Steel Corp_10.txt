Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
In this action, Plaintiff Avis Howard brings claims against her former employer, Defendant United States Steel Corporation, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.; and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. (Doc.1 1 ("Complaint" or "Compl.")). The action is assigned to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to the general order of reference dated May 8, 1998, as amended July 27, 2000. The cause comes to be heard for a report and recommendation, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1), on Defendant's  [*2] respective motions for summary judgment (Doc. 38) and to strike a declaration and a portion of an amended brief that Plaintiff filed in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 47). Upon consideration, it will be recommended that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted and that its motion to strike be denied as moot.

I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, party is authorized to move for summary judgment on all or part of a claim or defense asserted either by or against the movant. Under that rule, the "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(a). The party moving for summary judgment "always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion," relying on submissions "which it believes demonstrate the absence  [*3] of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also United States v. Four Parcels of Real Property in Greene and Tuscaloosa Counties, 941 F.2d 1428, 1438 n. 19 (11th Cir. 1991) (en banc); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991); Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving party must "go beyond the pleadings" and show that there is a genuine issue for trial. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324.
Both the party "asserting that a fact cannot be," and a party asserting that a fact is genuinely disputed, must support their assertions by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record," or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c)(1)(A), (B). Acceptable materials under Rule 56(c)(1)(A) include "depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials."  [*4] In its review of the evidence, a court must credit the evidence of the non-movant and draw all justifiable inferences in the non-movant's favor. Stewart v. Booker T. Washington Ins., 232 F.3d 844, 848 (11th Cir. 2000). At summary judgment, "the judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).

II. BACKGROUND2
Plaintiff is an African-American woman. She was 42 years old when she began working for Defendant at its Fairfield Works facility in July 2006. (Deposition of Plaintiff Avis Howard, DX 3 1, Doc. 42-1 ("Pl. Dep."),  [*5] at 9-10). Her first job there was wrapping and preparing steel coils for shipment in the warehouse. (Pl. Dep. at 28; see also Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Charge of Discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), PX N, Doc. 42-19 at USS581-82 ("EEOC Response")). While in that capacity, Plaintiff was given two disciplinary notices on December 3, 2007. One advised that she was going to be suspended for one day for hitting a steel coil with her "ram tractor" on her shift on November 30, 2007. (DX F, Doc. 39-6, at USS943 4). The other advised that she was going to be suspended for one day for failing to report that collision to management. (Id. at USS942). In January 2008, Plaintiff took a higher paying position on the "dualine," where employees operate equipment in a process that adds a zinc or zinc/aluminum coating to a continuously fed strip of steel sheet. (Pl. Dep. at 36-38, 148-50; EEOC Response).
In February 2008, Plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a bilateral mastectomy and an initial reconstructive surgery on March 28, 2008. (Id. at 37-38). She was off work from that date until about June 8, 2008.5 (See id. at 114; PX R, Doc. 42-; PX Q at USS478). Due to complications from her condition, however, she was off work again from about September 21, 2008 until about October 24, 2008.6 (See Pl. Dep. at 115-16; PX R, Doc. 42-23; PX Q, Doc. 42-22, at USS1097). It is undisputed that, for the entirety of both of those periods Plaintiff applied for and received paid medical leave under the Defendant's Sickness and Accident ("S&A") plan, which functions as a form of short-term disability insurance for Defendant's employees. (See DX L; DX M; PX O; PX R; Deposition of Jodi Watson, DX B, Doc. 39-2 ("Watson Dep.") at 23-24).
On the morning of July 15, 2008, Plaintiff's shift manager, Bryan Heaton, sent an email to the Labor Relations Department documenting an incident in which Plaintiff allegedly "manually split a coil on the exit end [of the dualine]" and "forgot to cut the daughter split off," which caused the exit end to stop and produced a "scrap coil" weighing 7,110 pounds. (DX F at USS941). Later that same day, Plaintiff was issued a disciplinary notification stating that she was suspended for three days for "unsatisfactory work" for allegedly "fail[ing] to operate the exit end correctly" and "producing over 7,000 pounds of scrap as a result." (Id.  [*8] at USS940). Plaintiff's suspension was later reduced to a single day, with the understanding that the discipline would be removed from her file after 90 days if there were no further issues. (Pl. Dep. at 205-06).
On November 7, 2008, a different shift supervisor, Jonathan Mahaffey, documented another incident involving Plaintiff's work on the dualine, as follows:
[Plaintiff] was taking a coil off the exit end and did not pay attention to the sample that did not drop and allowed the sample table to come back down on top of the sample which required her to open the sample table back up. She never called anyone to slowdown which caused the accumulator to fill up shutting the line down resulting in a 4.06 ton scrap coil and a one minute delay.
(DX F at USS939). Several days later, on November 12th, Plaintiff was presented with a disciplinary notice, electronically signed by her Area Manager, David Worthen, stating that she was "suspended for 5 days subject to discharge" for "unsatisfactory work" based on an allegation that she "failed to operate the exit end correctly," thereby "causing the line to stop and producing over 4 tons of scrap." (Id. at USS 938). Plaintiff complained about this  [*9] discipline to her union representative, and on November 25, 2008, Plaintiff, her union, and Defendant entered into a settlement whereby it was agreed that Plaintiff's suspension would be reduced to three days and no party would file a grievance over the discipline. (Id. at USS935).
On December 1, 2008, Heaton drafted another email to the Labor Relations Department requesting the preparation of a disciplinary notice for Plaintiff. (DX F at USS934). According to Heaton's email, while Plaintiff was working on the "second turn"7 shift on November 25, 2008, she "welded a piece of scrap onto the strip, which caused it to break when it hit the levelers," resulting in "a 79 minute delay and 5,000 pounds of [scrap]." (Id.) On December 9, 2008, Plaintiff was given a disciplinary notice stating similarly that she was "suspended for 5 days subject to discharge" for "unsatisfactory work when [she] welded a piece of scrap onto the strip causing the strip to break at the levelers resulting in the production of over 5,000 pounds of scrap and a 70 minute delay." (Id. at USS933).
On December 11, 2008, Heaton wrote another email to the Labor Relations Department asking for a write-up imposing "appropriate discipline" for another incident involving Plaintiff. (Id. at USS931). Heaton alleged that, while working on the "first turn" the day prior, December 10, 2008, Plaintiff "made an offset weld that also had a piece of scrap welded to it" and that she "sent the weld on through the line." (Id.) Heaton further stated, "We had to stop and cut the piece of scrap off and trim the offset part of the weld back," which "resulted in a 17 minute delay and a three ton scrap coil." (Id.) Plaintiff admits that she made an "offset weld" on that occasion that caused the line to stop. (Pl. Dep. at 151, 210-11). Plaintiff insists, however, that the problem arose because of a mechanical problem with the equipment she was operating, not because she did anything wrong. (Id. at 67, 210-12). In any event, Plaintiff states that, on the day of the incident, Heaton told her that she was being moved off the dualine and reassigned to her former wrapping position, which paid less. (Id. at 65-67, 151).
Shortly afterwards, Plaintiff learned  [*11] that she would be having another breast reconstruction surgery. On December 23, 2008, she went into the supervisor's office and presented a doctor's note to Heaton and Mahaffey, advising that she needed to be off work for scheduled surgery on December 30, 2008. (Pl. Dep. at 65-69). Plaintiff says that about 15 minutes later, she was summoned from her duties back to the office and presented with a disciplinary notice advising that she was suspended for five days subject to discharge for "unsatisfactory work" stemming from the "offset weld" line stop that occurred on December 10th, which allegedly caused "the line to have to stop and cut out the scrap resulting in a 17 minute day and 6000 pounds of scrap." (Id. at 66, 212; DX F at USS926). Plaintiff was further told at that time there was going to be a disciplinary hearing on December 29, 2008. (Pl. Dep. at 157, 212). Plaintiff says that she asked Heaton and Mahaffey at that time why the December 10th incident was not subject to further discipline until 13 days later, and she was told simply that she would have to ask about that at the hearing. (Id. at 212-13).
On the morning of December 29, 2008, Plaintiff attended and gave testimony  [*12] at the scheduled disciplinary "9(b) hearing."8 (Pl. Dep. at 64-65; PX V at USS929-30). According to the handwritten minutes or notes of that hearing, it related to the episode for "discipline issued" on December 9, 2008, rather than to the more recent incident occurring on December 10th, for which Plaintiff received a disciplinary notice on December 23rd. (See PX V at USS929). Plaintiff's appearance at the 9(b) hearing also turned out to be her last day at the plant. (Pl. Dep. at 64-65). The next day, December 30, 2008, she commenced medical leave and underwent her scheduled breast reconstruction surgery. (Id. at 45-46, 120). Shortly after being released from the hospital in early January 2009, Plaintiff received a "Supplemental Disciplinary Notification" electronically signed by Worthen, advising that, following the hearing on December 29, 2008, her five-day suspension had been converted to a discharge effective January 5, 2009. (Pl. Dep. at 45-47; DX F at USS927). That notice also stated that the discharge was the incident that was the subject of the December 9th disciplinary notice, i.e., for "unsatisfactory work when [Plaintiff] welded a piece of scrap onto the strip causing the  [*13] strip to break at the levelers resulting in the production of over 5000 pounds of scrap and a 70-minute delay." (DX F at USS927; see also id. at USS933).
In anticipation of her surgery on December 30, 2008, Plaintiff had applied to Defendant for a third period of S&A benefits, with the expected period of disability to run from the date of the surgery through the end of January 2009. (Id. at 175-76; DX N, Doc. 40 at 4-19, at Oliver21-22 9). Following the surgery, however, Plaintiff claimed that she suffered complications that caused her to remain totally disabled and unable to work thereafter, and she filed multiple additional applications with Defendant for continuing S&A benefits. (See DX N at Oliver23-36; see also Pl. Dep. at 176-77). Despite having advised that Plaintiff had been terminated effective January 5, 2009, Defendant granted all of Plaintiff's additional S&A applications and provided her with paid medical leave for 12 continuous months from her December  [*14] 30, 2008 reconstruction surgery until December 29, 2009, at which time her S&A benefits automatically expired under the terms of the program. (See Pl. Dep. 98-99, 120, 128-31; Watson Dep. at 56-57; DX P, Doc. 39-16, at USS1226; DX Q, Doc. 39-17, at USS3467; DX D at 106; DX H, DX I, DX J; PX R). While continuing to receive S&A benefits, Plaintiff also applied for Social Security disability insurance ("SSDI") benefits in March 2009. (Pl. Dep. at 219-20, DX R, Doc. 39-18, at USS1147). Her application was initially denied. However, she sought review of that denial, and an Administrative Law Judge issued a decision in November 2009 that awarded Plaintiff SSDI benefits retroactively based on her claim that she had been disabled since January 1, 2009. (DX S, Doc. 39-19; DX T, Doc. 39-20).
Meanwhile, Plaintiff had filed a union grievance contesting her termination effective January 5, 2009. (Pl.  [*15] Dep. at 213-14; see also PX V, Doc. 42-27 at 10). More than a year-and-a-half later, on August 23, 2010, Defendant mailed Plaintiff another Supplemental Disciplinary Notification, stating that, effective that day, Plaintiff's five-day suspension related to the incident on December 10, 2008, for which she received a disciplinary notice on December 23, 2008, had also been converted to a discharge. (PX V at 15; see also PX H, Doc. 42-12, at 10, Response to Interrogatory 14; PX R). That notice acknowledged that in January 2009 the parties had "agreed to a 'reasonable' extension of timelines" in connection with holding hearing on the disciplinary action. (PX V at 15). Defendant asserted, however, that since the union had not responded to the company's request "to move forward" on the matter by August 20, 2010, any further extension was deemed to be "unreasonable." (Id.)
After exhausting administrative remedies at the EEOC, Plaintiff filed this action in March 2011. (Doc. 1). In Count I of her Complaint, she asserts that Defendant is liable for discrimination because of sex in violation of Title VII, based on allegations that she had been "subjected to a continuing and on-going campaign of  [*16] sexual harassment and discrimination." (Compl. ¶ 16). She further alleges that Defendant discriminated in connection with disciplining her, including by terminating her employment, and by allegedly terminating her medical insurance prior to the conclusion of her grievance on her discharge. (Id., ¶¶ 16, 21).
In Count II, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated by the ADA by discriminating against her because of a disability, namely, her condition arising from her breast cancer and related treatment. (Compl., ¶¶ 23-34). Plaintiff complains that Defendant "wrongfully terminated her" and "has repeatedly refused to allow [her] to return to work" despite that fact that she is "ready, willing and able to return to work or some equivalent position subject to the conditions ... prescribed by her medical doctors." (Id. ¶¶ 25-26). Plaintiff also alleges that after she was diagnosed with cancer, she requested unspecified "reasonable accommodations" that were "summarily and arbitrarily refused by the defendant." (Id. ¶ 27).
In Count III, Plaintiff claims that Defendant is liable under the FMLA. (Compl. ¶¶ 35-40). In support, Plaintiff alleges that after she was diagnosed with cancer, she repeatedly  [*17] requested leave protected under the FMLA. (Id. ¶ 37). While Plaintiff acknowledges that she "was allowed to take said leave," she claims that she "was later disciplined, suspended and terminated ... for taking said leave." (Id.) In her fourth and final count, Plaintiff claims that Defendant also discriminated against her because of age, which she cites as a violation of Title VII. (Compl., Count Four).
Following discovery, Defendant filed its instant motion for summary judgment on all claims (Doc. 38), accompanied by a supporting evidentiary submission (Doc. 39) and brief (Doc. 39-1 ("Dft. Brief"). Plaintiff thereafter filed a response in opposition that included her own evidentiary submission (Doc. 42) and brief (Doc. 43). Defendant then filed a timely reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 44). On the same day Defendant filed that reply brief, Plaintiff moved for leave to amend or substitute her submission in opposition to summary judgment. (Doc. 45). Stating that he had inadvertently filed the "wrong version" of Plaintiff's opposition brief, Plaintiff's counsel asked for permission to file a corrected version of the brief, along with an additional declaration,  [*18] from the Grievance Committee Chairman of Plaintiff's union, William Jackson, that was omitted from Plaintiff's original evidentiary submission. (Id.; Doc. 45-1). After the court granted Plaintiff's motion (Unnumbered docket entry dated 11/06/12), she formally filed her amended opposition brief (Doc. 46 at 1-38 ("Pl. Brief")) and Jackson's declaration (PX Y, Doc. 46 at 39-42 ("Jackson Declaration" or Jackson Decl.")). Defendant then filed its amended reply brief (Doc. 48), along with its instant motion to strike, which is addressed to most of the Jackson's Declaration and a portion of Plaintiff's amended opposition brief which references it. (Doc. 47). The undersigned now turns to consider Defendant's respective motions for summary judgment and to strike.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination
Section 102(a) of the ADA prohibits "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Further, unlawful discrimination because of a disability includes
not  [*19] making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise individual with a disability ... unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the [employer's] business ....
42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a). Accordingly, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's known disability itself constitutes an unlawful employment practice under the ADA, so long as the employee is otherwise qualified, unless the employer can show undue hardship. Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262. At summary judgment, Plaintiff argues that Defendant is liable under the ADA for discriminating against her on the basis of a disability, namely, her breast cancer, both by terminating her employment and by allegedly failing to accommodate her disability prior to her discharge. (See Pl. Brief at 30-35).

1. Termination
In order to recover on her ADA claim alleging that she was terminated on the basis of her disability, Plaintiff is required to prove, among other things, that she is a "qualified individual," which is defined as a person "who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform  [*20] the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). See Holly v. Clairson Industries, LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1256 (11th Cir. 2007). Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot make that showing because she has been unable to perform any work since before she was terminated. In support, Defendant contends that it fired Plaintiff on January 5, 2009, but she has been receiving SSDI benefits after having successfully argued to the Social Security Administration ("SSA") that she has been disabled since January 1, 2009. (See DX R, DX S, DX T). Defendant further points out that Plaintiff also received benefits under the company's S&A plan, including paid medical leave, based on representations that she has been totally disabled and unable to work from December 30, 2008, until at least December 29, 2009. (See DX N). In fact, Plaintiff expressly admits that during the periods she received S&A benefits, she was "totally disabled ... so as to be prevented from performing the duties of her job." (Pl. Brief at 14, ¶ 2).
Defendant's argument has its roots in Cleveland v. Policy Management Systyems Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999). In that case, the Supreme  [*21] Court held that where a plaintiff files suit alleging that her employer subjected her to adverse action on the basis of a disability in violation of the ADA, that claim may be defeated by the plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits founded on a claim that she was disabled at the time the employer took the adverse action. See Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 806-07. The Court explained that the fact that a plaintiff has successfully argued to the SSA that she was disabled for purposes of SSDI benefits does not itself judicially estop her from later claiming that during that same period she was also a "qualified individual" who could, "with or without reasonable accommodation, ... perform the essential functions" of her job, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8), as required to recover under the ADA. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 797; see also Taylor v. Food World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419, 1423 (11th Cir. 1998); Talavera v. School Bd. of Palm Beach County, 129 F.3d 1214, 1219-21 (11th Cir. 1997). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court recognized that "in some cases an earlier SSDI claim may turn out genuinely to conflict with an ADA claim," and that "a plaintiff's sworn assertion in an application for disability benefits that she is,  [*22] for example, 'unable to work' will appear to negate an essential element of her ADA case—at least if she does not offer a sufficient explanation." Id. at 805-06. "That explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation." Id. at 807. In other words,
an ADA plaintiff may not, simply by disavowing a prior claim of total disability, perform an about-face and assert that he is a "qualified individual" who is capable of working. Rather, . . . the plaintiff must proceed from the premise that his previous assertion of an inability to work was true, or that he in good faith believed it to be true, and he must demonstrate that the assertion was nonetheless consistent with his ability to perform the essential functions of his job.
* * * *
Explanations of the sort Cleveland requires are, in short, contextual - they resolve the seeming discrepancy between a claim of disability and a later claim of entitlement to work not by contradicting what the plaintiff told the Social  [*23] Security Administration, but by demonstrating that those representations, understood in light of the unique focus and requirements of the SSA, leave room for the possibility that the plaintiff is able to meet the essential demands of the job to which he claims a right under the ADA.
Detz v. Greiner Industries, Inc., 346 F.3d 109, 118 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting Lee v. City of Salem, Ind., 259 F.3d 667, 674-75 (7th Cir. 2001)); see also Kurzweg v. SCP Distribs., LLC, 424 Fed. Appx. 840, 843-44 (11th Cir. April 21, 2011); Frederick v. Kirby Tankships, Inc., 205 F.3d 1277, 1288 (11th Cir. 2000); Flowers v. City of Tuscaloosa, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19730, 2013 WL 625324, at *15 (N.D. Ala. Feb. 14, 2013).
Plaintiff does not directly confront Defendant's argument that her applications for and receipt of SSDI and S&A benefits show that she was not a qualified individual at the time of her termination. The closest Plaintiff comes to disputing the point is her argument that she was actually fired on December 23, 2008, and that, as a result, she lost pay for a six-day period, from December 24 to December 29, 2008. (See Pl. Brief at 37; see also id. at 13, ¶ 51; id. at 26, 28-29). It is assumed that if Plaintiff could prove  [*24] she was fired on December 23, 2008, that would preclude an application of Cleveland because that date is shortly before the beginning of the period that she became disabled according to her representations to the SSA and Defendant.
Plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence, however, that she was discharged on December 23, 2008, rather than January 5, 2009, as Defendant claims. Plaintiff seems to argue that she was terminated on December 23rd primarily on the basis that the evidence supports that such was "her last date of work." (Pl. Brief at 14, ¶ 1). In particular, she relies upon pay sheets that have the handwritten date "12/23/08" on a line next to the notation "LDW." (See PX U at USS1105, USS1108). It is fair to infer from the context that such is an abbreviation for "Last Date Worked" and refers to the period preceding the commencement of Plaintiff's medical leave on December 30, 2008 for her reconstruction surgery. However, even if the pay sheets are credited as showing that Plaintiff never worked a shift after December 23, 2008, it cannot be reasonably inferred from that evidence that her employment was terminated on that date. Indeed, Defendant's work schedules submitted  [*25] by Plaintiff support that no one in her department worked between December 24 and 29, 2008. (See PX I, Doc. 42-14 at 12-13). They indicate, rather, that for the first three of those days, employees were off for the Christmas holiday, while December 27 and 28 fell on the weekend, and employees were given vacation for the following week. (Id.; see also Heaton Dep. at 50-54). Plaintiff commenced medical leave for her reconstruction surgery on December 30, 2008, and she never returned to work afterwards and has admittedly been unable to do so. Despite that, Defendant continued paying her S&A benefits until December 29, 2009. The paysheet record showing Plaintiff's last date worked was December 23, 2008, does not support she was fired before January 5, 2009.
It is true that Plaintiff was also presented with a notice of discipline on December 23, 2008. (DX F at USS926). However, that notice provided only that she was "suspended for 5 days subject to discharge" (id. (emphasis added)), and Plaintiff confirmed that such notice imposed only a five-day suspension that might be converted to a discharge at some point in the future, not that it worked an immediate termination. (Pl. Dep. at 65, 66,  [*26] 69, 136). Further, regardless of whether Plaintiff "worked" on December 29th, she attended a 9(b) disciplinary hearing that morning, and she does not hint that she understood to have been terminated prior to that. (Pl. Dep. at 64-65). Indeed, Plaintiff unambiguously testified that she was terminated by virtue of the supplemental disciplinary notice she received in early January 2009 stating that, as a result of the hearing on December 29th, a five-day suspension had been converted to a discharge effective January 5, 2009. (See DX F at USS927; Pl. Dep. at 45-47, 52, 136, 164, 176, 213-14). There is no genuine dispute that Defendant did not terminate Plaintiff's employment until January 5, 2009.10
In light of Plaintiff's representations to both  [*27] Defendant and to the SSA that she was totally disabled and unable to work since shortly before she was terminated, under Cleveland Plaintiff must present evidence tending to explain how she was nonetheless a qualified individual under the ADA who was able to perform the essential duties of her position, with or without accommodation, at the time of her discharge. Plaintiff has not even attempted to do so. Because Defendant has negated the "qualified individual" element, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim founded upon her termination.

2. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff also claims that Plaintiff violated the ADA by allegedly failing to accommodate her disability. While the ADA requires an employer to make "reasonable accommodations" for an employee's known disability, "an employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997)). Rather, an "accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA ... only if it enables the employee to perform the essential  [*28] functions of the job." Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001); LaChance v. Duffy's Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 835 (11th Cir. 1998); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(1)(ii)). Thus, a plaintiff "(1) as part of her burden of production, must identify an accommodation that would allow her to perform her job duties and (2) as part of her burden of proving her case, must establish that such an accommodation is reasonable." Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 283 (11th Cir. 1997). Moreover, "the duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Gaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). Instead, the plaintiff must show that she actually demanded an accommodation of her disability from the employer and was refused. Gaston, 167 F.3d at 1363-64; Branscomb v. Secretary of Navy, 461 Fed. App'x 901, 905 (11th Cir. 2012); Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 Fed. App'x 833, 835-36 (11th Cir. 2012); see also Schwarz v. City of Treasure Isl., 544 F.3d 1201, 1219 (11th Cir. 2008) ("The duty to make a reasonable accommodation does not simply spring  [*29] from the fact that the [plaintiff] wants such an accommodation made." (quoting Prindable v. Association of Apt. Owners, 304 F. Supp. 2d 1245, 1258 (D. Hawaii 2003)).
The only accommodation that Plaintiff raises is that she says that following each instance when she returned from medical leave in 2008 for the treatment of her breast cancer, Defendant should have reinstated her to the identical job on the dualine that she occupied before going on leave and that she should have been retrained on the duties of that position. (Pl. Brief at 35). She complains that while her supervisors had initially agreed to such an arrangement, on what appears to have been the two or three occasions that she returned from medical leave, her supervisors instead had her retrained and placed on a new job on the dualine. (See Pl. Dep. at 117, 142-155; see also Jackson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 11). In considering this claim, it is assumed without deciding that Plaintiff's breast cancer gave rise to a disability under the ADA.
To the extent that Plaintiff's claim rests on Defendant's failure to abide by an alleged "agreement" to afford her a particular accommodation, the ADA is not a vehicle by which any such "agreement" might be enforced. Even if Plaintiff's supervisors indicated a willingness to allow her upon return from leave to assume her same job on the dualine and receive retraining on that job, the employer's accommodation obligations under the ADA cannot be expanded by what the employer might have consented to do voluntarily. See Lucas, 257 F.3d 1249, 1257 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2001); Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1998); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997); see also Owens v. Quality Hyundai, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10455, 2007 WL 495248, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 15, 2007) ("Defendant's alleged assurances to Plaintiff  [*31] that he could return after his medical leave do not create a reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA."). Thus, the question is not what Defendant might have said it would do but rather whether the ADA itself required Defendant provide the accommodation sought.
Turning to the substance of the claim, Plaintiff seems to characterize her sought accommodation as concerning primarily Defendant's failure to retrain her on the duties of her same position upon coming back from leave. (See Pl. Brief at 35; Pl. Dep. at 145). But given that Plaintiff also complains that Defendant failed to reinstate her to the same position as a substantive matter, any failure to retrain her for what amounted to a job that she was no longer doing is beside the point. Therefore, the accommodation to which Plaintiff must logically first demonstrate a right under the ADA is reinstatement to the identical position following her leave. This she cannot do under the circumstances of the instant case.
Plaintiff may have generally preferred the continuity or security of returning to a familiar job. However, the fact that an employee has a disability does not generally insulate her from a non-punitive transfer to another  [*32] position whose duties she is able to perform. See Doe v. Dekalb County School Dist., 145 F.3d 1441, 1452 (11th Cir. 1998); Prickett v. Amoco Oil Co., 31 Fed. App'x 608, 610 (10th Cir. March 11, 2002). Plaintiff concedes that her reassignments to other jobs on the dualine came with no loss of pay, and she does not claim that they otherwise amounted to an adverse employment action. (See Pl. Dep. at 149-50). More importantly as it relates to a failure-to-accommodate theory, Plaintiff acknowledges that the symptoms associated with her breast cancer and its treatment did not prevent her from being able to perform any of the duties of any of the positions she worked on the dualine during the periods in 2008 that she was cleared to work. (See Pl. Dep. at 158). "An accommodation that does not enable the employee to perform an essential function of his position is facially unreasonable and is not required by the ADA." Holly, 492 F.3d 1262 n.16. Plaintiff is not at this point claiming she was entitled to any modification of the duties of any position she ever worked on the dualine nor that Defendant should have been required to keep a particular position open as an accommodation on the theory  [*33] that her disability prevented her from being able to perform the essential duties of other jobs to which she was reassigned after leave. Rather, she claims only that Defendant should have reinstated her to her same position just as she had performed it previously. However, "an employee who requests only the opportunity to return to an unmodified, previously-held position fails to state a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)." Burch v. Coca-Cola Co., 119 F.3d 305, 314 (5th Cir. 1997). Defendant's motion for summary judgment is due to be granted as it pertains to Plaintiff's ADA failure-to-accommodate claim.

B. Sex Discrimination
Title VII makes it an "unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's ... sex." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Plaintiff raises two types of claims under this provision. First, she asserts that Defendant treated her less favorably than male employees in connection with discrete, tangible adverse employment actions. Specifically, Plaintiff complains that Defendant did  [*34] so in the imposition of discipline, including her discharge, and by allegedly terminating her health insurance while her union grievance over her discharge remained pending. (Compl. ¶ 21).12 Plaintiff also claims that she was allegedly subjected "to a continuing and on-going campaign of sexual harassment," (id. ¶ 16), which suggests that she is seeking to recover under a hostile work environment theory. See generally National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114-16, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002) (discussing the difference between "hostile environment claims" and claims based on "discrete acts" of discrimination). These claims are addressed in reverse order.

1. Hostile Work Environment
A plaintiff may establish liability under Title VII where she can show that she was subjected to sexual harassment that was so severe or pervasive that it altered the conditions of employment and created an abusive work environment. See Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986). To that end, Plaintiff's pleading alleges  [*36] that she was subjected to a "campaign of sexual harassment." However, Plaintiff has since admitted that she was not subjected to sexual harassment. (Pl. Dep. at 160). Defendant argues that it is thus entitled to summary judgment on any claim for a hostile environment based on sexual harassment. (See Dft. Brief at 5, ¶ 16; id. at 15 n. 3). Plaintiff has not contested that in her brief. (See Pl. Brief at 5 (failing to dispute ¶ 16 of Defendant's Statement of Facts; see also id. at 35-36). As such, Plaintiff's hostile environment claim has been abandoned. See Iraola & CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 325 F.3d 1274, 1284-85 (11th Cir. 2003); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995); Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. Independent Sprinkler Corp., 10 F.3d 1563, 1568 (11th Cir. 1994).

2. Tangible Employment Actions

a. Discontinuation of Health Insurance Coverage
Plaintiff has also alleged that Defendant subjected her to tangible, adverse employment actions because of sex. Plaintiff asserts that one way that Defendant did so was by terminating her health insurance coverage prior to the conclusion of her union grievance over her discharge while allegedly  [*37] continuing insurance for similarly situated male employees. (Compl. ¶ 21(c)). Plaintiff similarly insisted at her deposition that Defendant had discontinued her health insurance relatively soon after she was told that she was terminated in early January 2009. (See Pl. Dep. at 52-53, 120-24). It is assumed without deciding that the sexually discriminatory termination of an employee's health insurance is an adverse employment action cognizable under Title VII.
Defendant has argued and presented evidence, however, that it continued Plaintiff's health insurance along with her paid leave until her S&A benefits were terminated automatically once they were exhausted under the terms of that program on December 29, 2009, twelve months following the date she had told the company she became unable to work: December 30, 2008. (Dft. Brief at 9, ¶¶ 40-41). Plaintiff has failed to dispute those allegations in her brief. (See Pl. Brief at 12 (failing to contest ¶¶ 40 and 41 from Defendant's Statement of Facts as it relates to continued insurance coverage)). As a result, under this court's uniform initial order, Defendant's material allegations on that matter are deemed admitted. (See Doc. 10 at 16-17);  [*38] see also Mullinax v. McElhenney, 817 F.2d 711, 717 n.3 (11th Cir. 1987); Burch v. City of Florence, Ala., 913 F. Supp. 2d 1221, 1230-31 (N.D. Ala. 2012). Plaintiff has also failed to identify any male employee who was treated more favorably with respect to continued health insurance coverage or any other evidence indicating that the termination of Plaintiff's coverage was motivated by sex.13 Therefore, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this Title VII claim.

b. Discriminatory Discharge
Plaintiff's next claims that Defendant terminated her employment because of sex. Plaintiff does not claim that she possesses direct evidence to that effect. Nor does she present evidence that any decisionmaker made statements indicative  [*40] of animus against women generally. Nonetheless, Plaintiff contends that she can establish discriminatory intent on these claims through other types of circumstantial evidence. As such, Plaintiff's claim is subject to the familiar burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), and Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). See also Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 109 S. Ct. 2363, 105 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1989). Under that framework, the plaintiff has the initial burden to prove a prima facie case of discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-53. "Under the McDonnell Douglas scheme, 'establishment of the prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee.'" St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254). This presumption "places upon the defendant the burden of producing an explanation to rebut the prima facie case- i.e., the burden of 'producing evidence' that the adverse employment actions were taken 'for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.'" Id., 509 U.S. at 506-07 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S., at 254). Once the defendant  [*41] produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision, the plaintiff must be afforded the "opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. "Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, '[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.'" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253).
A Title VII plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment because of sex by showing the following: (1) that she is female; (2) that she suffered an adverse job action; (3) that she was qualified for the job; and (4) that the employer treated a similarly situated male employee more favorably. See Ramirez v. Secretary, U.S. Dep't of Transp., 686 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir. 2012). Where a plaintiff complains that she was discharged or demoted because of sex, she may alternatively satisfy the fourth  [*42] element by proof that she was replaced in her former position by a male. See Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., 402 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir. 2005); Cuddeback v. Florida Bd. of Educ., 381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir. 2004); Rioux v. City of Atlanta, 520 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2008).
While conceding that Plaintiff is female, Defendant contends that she cannot prove any of the other elements of a prima facie case with regard to her termination claim. While at least some of those arguments have potential merit, it is assumed without deciding that Plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, and the undersigned will thus proceed to the second step of the McDonnell Douglas framework. See, e.g., Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1265 (11th Cir. 2010); Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., 482 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir. 2007); Scott v. Suncoast Beverage Sales, Ltd., 295 F.3d 1223, 1228 (11th Cir. 2002). Defendant has met its burden at that stage to produce evidence that it discharged Plaintiff for a lawful reason. Specifically, Defendant has pointed to the supplemental disciplinary notice stating that, following the hearing on December 29, 2008, a previously-issued five-day  [*43] suspension had been converted to a discharge effective January 5, 2009. (DX F at USS927). That notice states that the converted suspension was from the disciplinary notice issued December 9, 2008, alleging "unsatisfactory work when [Plaintiff] welded a piece of scrap onto the strip causing the strip to break at the levelers resulting in the production of over 5000 pounds of scrap and a 70-minute delay." (DX F at USS927; see also id. at USS933). Defendant further argues that the December 9th notice corresponds to an incident described almost identically in the email dated December 1, 2008, that Heaton sent to the Labor Relations Department on December 1, 2008. (DX F at USS934). Specifically, Heaton's email asked for a disciplinary notice for Plaintiff because while she was working on the "second turn" on November 25, 2008, she "welded a piece of scrap onto the strip, which caused it to break when it hit the levelers," resulting in "a 79 minute delay and 5,000 pounds of [scrap]." (Id.)
The inquiry now heads to the third and final step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, at which Plaintiff must point to evidence sufficient from which to infer that Defendant's proffered justification is  [*44] a pretext to hide an unlawful motive. "[The plaintiff] may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the [defendant's] proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256. "[A] plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence that the [defendant's] asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the [defendant] unlawfully discriminated." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. "If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot recast the reason but must meet it head on and rebut it." Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir. 2004). In reviewing a summary judgment motion, " 'the district court must evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.' " Jackson v. Alabama State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)).
The  [*45] only evidence of sex discrimination that Plaintiff discusses in the argument section of her brief, whether in support of a prima facie case or pretext, relates to a claim that Defendant was allegedly more lenient to several male employees. (See Pl. Brief at 36). The Supreme Court has recognized that even if a plaintiff is guilty of wrongdoing for which an employer might legitimately take adverse action, the plaintiff may establish a claim of unlawful discrimination if the employer treated other employees outside of his protected class more favorably despite knowing that they engaged in the same or sufficiently similar misconduct. See McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 282-83, 96 S. Ct. 2574, 49 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1976). Likewise, proof that the employer treated similarly situated employees outside of the plaintiff's protected class more favorably may also be circumstantial evidence of pretext. See Rioux, 520 F.3d at 1276-77. However, when undertaking such an evaluation, courts require the plaintiff to establish that an alleged comparator is "similarly situated to the plaintiff in all relevant respects." Id. at 1280. In that inquiry, "[t]he most important factors in disciplinary context are the nature  [*46] of the offenses committed and the nature of the punishment imposed." Maynard v. Board of Regents of Div. of Univ. of Fla. Dep't of Educ., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting Silvera v. Orange County Sch. Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir. 2001) (ellipses omitted)). Both "the quantity and quality of the comparator's misconduct" must be sufficiently similar "to prevent courts from second-guessing employer's reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges." McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir. 2008).
Plaintiff identifies seven male employees whom she says "received more disciplinary action for poor workmanship than [she did]" but were not terminated. (Pl. Brief at 36; see also id. at 7, ¶ 12; id. at 15, ¶ 6; PX E). However, the only consideration that Plaintiff discusses is the sheer number of times that those male employees were disciplined for some form of alleged "poor workmanship." That is not enough to support that any of those other employees were similarly situated to Plaintiff, as to her termination or anything else. An accusation that an employee exhibited "poor workmanship" encompasses an almost impossibly large swath of potential acts, omissions,  [*47] potential resulting harm, and other underlying circumstances. It is entirely unclear from the record just what the other employees were alleged to have done; what harm did or might have potentially resulted; the strength of the employer's evidence of guilt; the tenure, work history, or position of the other employees when they were disciplined; or who made the relevant employment decisions. Plaintiff's perfunctory showing that seven male employees were not fired despite being disciplined a greater raw number of times then she was has little to no probative value in the pretext analysis. See Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., 447 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir. 2006) (evidence that county terminated minority correctional officers for fraternization with inmates over 90% of the time but retained white correctional officers over 60% of the time for the same violation failed to support that the plaintiff's termination was motivated by racial animus; such evidence that "merely describe[d] ... employees as minority or non-minority and disclose[d] whether  [*48] they were fired or disciplined less severely proves nothing without more information about the particular circumstances involved in each situation.").
Although not raised in the argument section of her brief, Plaintiff does set forth several other points in the section discussing the background facts that can be construed as maintaining that other pieces of proof support a finding of pretext. Most notably, while Defendant claims that it fired Plaintiff based upon the disciplinary notice issued on December 9, 2008, for an incident that occurred on November 25, 2008, Plaintiff now claims that she "was never disciplined for a November 25, 2008 incident." (Pl. Brief at 5, ¶ 6). Plaintiff acknowledges that operations records for the dualine indicate that there were two production stops on November 25th. (See id. (citing Deposition of Bryan Heaton ("Heaton Dep."), DX C, Doc. 39-3, at 57-59)). However, she says that those operations records further disclose that the stops occurred during the "second turn," while her department work schedule indicates she was scheduled to work the "first turn" on that date. (See Heaton Dep. at 57-59; PX I, Doc. 42-14, at 7). Plaintiff also emphasizes that in  [*49] its response to the EEOC, Defendant stated that her disciplinary notice issued on December 9th was for an incident that occurred on December 1st, not on November 25th. (See EEOC Response at USS582).
The Eleventh Circuit has indicated that an employer's claim that it fired the plaintiff for a violation of work rules may be "arguably pretextual" when the plaintiff "submits evidence ... that she did not violate the cited work rule." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999). However, that Plaintiff was formally slated to work the first turn on November 25th does not establish that she did not engage in the alleged misconduct that formed the basis of the disciplinary notice dated December 9th that was later converted to a discharge. More importantly to the pretext analysis, it does not support that Defendant did not believe that Plaintiff engaged in that misconduct. At the outset, the language of the December 9th notice describing the charged infraction ("you welded a piece of scrap onto the strip causing the strip to break at the levelers resulting in the production of over 5000 pounds of scrap and a 70 minute delay") clearly mirrors that of Heaton's  [*50] email dated December 1st ("she welded a piece of scrap onto the strip, which caused it to break when it hit the levelers" and "resulted in a 79 minute delay and 5,000 pounds of scrap"). That fact, plus the subject matter of the email, i.e., a request for the issuance of discipline, and temporal proximity are such that it cannot be reasonably doubted that Heaton's email and the disciplinary notice dated December 9th are meant to refer to the same incident. Heaton states in the email that Plaintiff committed the error on the second turn on November 25th and caused a line stop that lasted for 79 minutes. The operations records upon which Plaintiff now relies also indicate there was a production stop for that length of time on the second turn that date. (See Heaton Dep. at 58-59). While Plaintiff argues that the department schedule supports that she was not working at that time, she has never actually denied involvement in the incident at issue. When Plaintiff was asked at her deposition about the December 9th disciplinary notice and Heaton's December 1st email, she essentially said that she could not recall anything about them. (Pl. Dep. at 207-10). More importantly, the notes summarizing  [*51] the testimony at Plaintiff's 9(b) hearing on December 29th show that when Plaintiff was asked by Defendant's managers about the incident underling the December 9th notice, she did not claim to have been off work; rather she answered by seeking to explain her actions and decisionmaking. (PX V at USS929-USS930). Thus, Defendant's decisionmakers were thus entirely justified in believing that Plaintiff was involved in the incident that caused them to discharge her, whenever that incident might have actually occurred.14
Turning to Defendant's EEOC Response, Defendant indicated there that Plaintiff's discharge was based on the incident described in the disciplinary notice dated December 9th. (See EEOC Response at USS582). Plaintiff emphasizes, however, that Defendant further stated to the EEOC that such incident "occurred on December 1, 2008." (Id.) Plaintiff contends that such statement supports that the incident for which she was terminated did not occur on November 25, 2008, contrary to Defendant's current claim. Plaintiff also attempts to call into question Defendant's explanation to the EEOC by pointing out that Defendant's records show that the dualine was not operating on December 1, 2008, so she could not have been guilty of the misconduct on that date.
Evidence that an employer has provided shifting or inconsistent reasons for taking adverse action may be evidence of pretext. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1194-95 (11th Cir. 2004); Tidwell v. Carter Products, 135 F.3d 1422, 1428 (11th Cir. 1998). However, that Defendant's  [*54] EEOC response ascribed December 1, 2008, as the date of the infraction at issue will not bear the weight that Plaintiff seeks to place upon it. Defendant has consistently maintained that Plaintiff was terminated when her five-day suspension for the incident described in the December 9th disciplinary notice was converted to a discharge. Defendant's EEOC response is fully aligned with that explanation. A plaintiff does not show pretext by discrediting minor details of the employer's explanation that do not reasonably call into question its proffered motive for an employment decision. See Combs, 106 F.3d at 1534-35. For purposes of furnishing an explanation for why Plaintiff was terminated, all that really mattered was that Plaintiff was determined to have committed the offense, not the precise date she committed it. See Oglesby v. Hy-Vee, Inc., 214 Fed. App'x 829, 836 n.2 (10th Cir. Jan. 30, 2007) ("[T]he actual date of the [plaintiff's] offense is immaterial to whether the defendant's stated reason is pretextual."); Burnett v. Southwestern Bell Tel., L.P., 471 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1138 (D. Kan. 2007) ("The fact that one of the witnesses may have been mistaken as to the precise dates  [*55] of the occurrences does not support a finding of pretext."). Further, although Defendant's response to the EEOC represented the company's formal position, the fact remains that it was drafted some five months after Plaintiff's discharge by an employee in Defendant's Labor Relations Department, David Coombs (see Watson Dep. at 18-19), not by Heaton or another dualine supervisor who might have been present when the underlying incident occurred.15 Ultimately, when evaluating a claim of employment discrimination, a court must focus on the actual knowledge and real intent of those who actually made the employment decision at issue. See Walker v. Prudential Property and Cas. Ins. Co., 286 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir. 2002); Bass v. Board of County Comm'rs, 256 F.3d 1095, 1105 (11th Cir. 2001); Silvera, 244 F.3d at 1262. Because Plaintiff has failed to show pretext, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on her Title VII claim alleging that she was discharged because of sex.

3. Other Disciplinary Actions
Plaintiff has also pled that Defendant is liable under Title VII for discrimination because of sex in connection with discipline distinct from her termination. (See Compl. ¶¶ 11, 16, 21). In the section of her brief in which she seeks to dispute the Defendant's statement of facts, Plaintiff does reference evidence that could relate to such a claim, specifically as it pertains to her removal from the dualine and the five-day suspension notice she received on December 23, 2008, both stemming from the incident on December 10, 2008. (See Pl. Brief at 6-7, ¶¶ 11-12; id. at 10, ¶ 29). However, the only adverse action that Plaintiff even mentions in the argument section of her brief on her sex discrimination cause of action is her termination. (See Pl. Brief at 35-36). As a result, Title VII claims based on any other disciplinary actions have been abandoned.16 See Chandler v. Volunteers of Amer., N. Ala., Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27445, 2013 WL 832133, at *19-21 (N.D. Ala. Feb. 28, 2013);  [*57] Hawthorne v. Sears Termite & Pest Control, Inc., 309 F. Supp. 2d 1318, 1327 (M.D. Ala. 2003); see also United States v. Jernigan, 341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n.8 (11th Cir. 2003) (recognizing that to adequately raise a claim or issue, a party "must plainly and prominently so indicate," for instance by "devot[ing] a discrete section of his argument to" those claims); Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n.6 (11th Cir. 1989) (noting that if a party mentions the issue only in his Statement of the Case but does not elaborate further in the Argument section, the party has abandoned that issue).

C. Age Discrimination
Count IV of the Complaint claims that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff because of age, which she suggests is made unlawful by Title VII. However, as Plaintiff now correctly concedes, Title VII does not outlaw discrimination because of age. See Birdyshaw v. Dillard's Inc., 308 Fed. App'x 431, 436 (11th Cir. Jan. 28, 2009);  [*58] 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Nonetheless, another federal law, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621, et seq., does. See 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). The fact that Plaintiff cites the wrong statute in her pleading is not itself a sufficient basis for dismissing this count. See Evans v. McClain of Ga., Inc., 131 F.3d 957, 964 n.2 (11th Cir. 1997) ("'The form of the complaint is not significant if it alleges facts upon which relief can be granted, even if it fails to categorize correctly the legal theory giving rise to the claim.'") (quoting Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Invest. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 604 (5th Cir. Nov. 1981)); St. Joseph's Hosp., Inc. v. Hospital Corp. of Amer., 795 F.2d 948, 954 (11th Cir. 1986).
Nonetheless, Plaintiff concedes in her brief that her "age discrimination claim is due to be dismissed," although she seems to do so only "because [the claim] was based on Title VII." (See Pl. Brief at 37). But even without that concession, this claim is due to be dismissed. Defendant unmistakably contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on the age discrimination claim on multiple grounds other than Plaintiff's reliance on Title VII as the authorizing statute.  [*59] (See Dft. Brief at 20-23). Plaintiff has failed to respond to any of those arguments, so her age discrimination claim is also deemed abandoned.

D. Family and Medical Leave Act
The theory to which Plaintiff devotes most of her brief is her FMLA cause of action, raised in Count III of her Complaint. (Pl. Brief at 16-30). The FMLA's central provision guarantees eligible employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a one year period because of "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee," 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D). See also Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86-87, 122 S. Ct. 1155, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167 (2002); Cooper v. Fulton County, Ga., 458 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2006); Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 428 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir. 2005). The FMLA also establishes a right to be reinstated to the position that the employee held when leave began or to an equivalent position. 29 U.S.C. § 2614(a)(1). See also Parris v. Miami Herald Pub. Co., 216 F.3d 1298, 1301-02 (11th Cir. 2000); O'Connor v. PCA Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1354 (11th Cir. 2000). The FMLA makes it unlawful for an employer to "interfere with, restrain, or deny the  [*60] exercise of" substantive rights, 29 U.S.C.§ 2615(a)(1), and violators are subject to consequential damages and appropriate equitable relief, id., § 2617(a)(1). "To preserve the availability of these rights, and to enforce them, the FMLA creates two types of claims: interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act." Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of the City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted); see also 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a); Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006). Plaintiff is pursuing both types of claims. (See Pl. Brief 16-30).

1. FMLA Interference
To make out a claim of interference with a substantive right under the FMLA, an employee must demonstrate that she was entitled to a benefit that was denied by the employer. Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir. 2006); O'Connor, 200 F.3d at 1353-54. The employee need not show that his employer affirmatively  [*61] intended to deny a protected benefit, for the employer's motives in doing so are irrelevant. Hurlbert, 439 F.3d at 1293. In other words, "a causal nexus is not an element of an interference claim." Spakes v. Broward County Sheriff's Office, 631 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011). However, the fact that an employee might seek to exercise FMLA rights does not mean that she is thereby insulated from discharge or other adverse action. If an employer takes an adverse action that has the effect of preventing an employee from exercising an FMLA right, including taking protected leave or reinstatement, the employer will not be liable if it is able affirmatively to prove that it took the adverse action for a reason unrelated to FMLA leave. See id., 631 F.3d at 1310; Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1241 (11th Cir. 2010); Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010).
Defendant's summary judgment motion does not contest, and thus it is assumed here, that Plaintiff is an "eligible employee" and that Defendant was on notice that her breast cancer was a "serious health condition" that rendered her "unable to perform the functions" of her job such that Plaintiff  [*62] was entitled to benefits under the FMLA. Even so, it is unclear what FMLA benefit Plaintiff claims that Defendant denied or otherwise interfered with such that she might be entitled to relief. In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she "repeatedly requested leave protected under the [FMLA] due to her being diagnosed with cancer." (Compl. ¶ 37). However, she also expressly concedes that she "was allowed to take said leave" by Defendant. (Id.) Instead, Plaintiff asserts only that she was "later disciplined, suspended and terminated ... for taking said leave ...." (Id. (emphasis added)). She similarly maintains that her termination was "unlawful pursuant to the [FMLA]" and was "discriminatory" in that it "was based on plaintiff's use of her protected medical leave rights." (Id. ¶ 40).
To the extent those allegations are meant to raise an FMLA retaliation claim, they are addressed in a separate section below. As far as interference goes, however, it is undisputed that Defendant granted all of the medical leave Plaintiff ever asked for, with all of that being paid under the S&A plan, and Plaintiff does not suggest that she was entitled to any additional leave. Plaintiff appears to claim  [*63] that she might recover for interference based on a theory that Defendant failed to comply with certain employer FMLA requirements related to ascertaining whether requested leave specifically qualifies for protection under the FMLA and giving notice to the employee whether leave that is granted will be designated as counting towards her FMLA allotment. (See Pl. Brief at 23-27). No such claim is pled in the Complaint. Even if it were, the FMLA's enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. § 2617, "provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation" in some way. Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89. The FMLA only allows a plaintiff to recover damages for lost compensation, benefits, and other "actual monetary losses sustained ... as a direct result of the violation." 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(1)(A)(i); see also Nevada Dep't of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 740, 123 S. Ct. 1972, 155 L. Ed. 2d 953 (2003) (observing that employee's recoverable damages for a violation of the FMLA are "strictly defined and measured by actual monetary losses"). Thus, an employee cannot recover for emotional suffering or nominal damages for a technical violation, Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1284 (11th Cir. 1999), so  [*64] Plaintiff cannot be entitled to relief based simply on the fact that Defendant did not notify her whether it was calling the paid medical leave she received "FMLA leave." See Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89-90.
Even with respect to her discharge effective January 5, 2009, Plaintiff does not contest that Defendant approved each of her applications for S&A benefits, both before and after the ostensible termination, pursuant to which she received paid medical leave until December 29, 2009, i.e., 12 months following the date she acknowledges that she was last able to work. That full year of paid medical leave far exceeds the 12 weeks of unpaid leave to which she might have been entitled in any one-year period under the FMLA. See Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 90. Plaintiff thus has no viable FMLA interference claim related to the taking of leave itself. See Graham, 193 F.3d at 1275 ("A plaintiff suffers no FMLA injury when she receives all the leave she requests, and indeed is paid for most of it.").
Plaintiff's FMLA count also contains an allegation, incorporated by reference, to the effect that Defendant "has refused to put [her] back to work" following her termination. (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 35; see also id.  [*65] ¶¶ 25-26 (asserting that Defendant "has repeatedly refused to allow [Plaintiff] to return to work" despite that she was allegedly "ready, willing and able to return to work or some similar equivalent position ...."). Based on those allegations, it is assumed that Plaintiff has raised an FMLA claim asserting that her termination interfered with her substantive right to reinstatement. See, e.g., Martin v. Brevard County Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir. 2008); Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1208. Defendant argues, however, that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff has suffered no damage or injury that is cognizable under the FMLA as a result of her discharge. (See Dft. Brief at 28-29, 32 n. 7; Doc. 44 at 7). Specifically, Defendant again argues that Plaintiff's receipt of S&A benefits and SSDI benefits shows that she has remained unable to work since even before she was terminated on January 5, 2009, meaning that she could not have been eligible for reinstatement upon the exhaustion of any FMLA-protected leave.
If an employee is either unwilling or unable to return to work at the expiration of FMLA leave, the employer may terminate her employment, and she would not be  [*66] entitled to damages resulting from the termination or to reinstatement. See Franzen v. Ellis Corp., 543 F.3d 420, 426 (7th Cir. 2008); Colburn v. Parker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 332 (1st Cir. 2005); Clark v. Macon County Greyhound Park, Inc., 727 F. Supp. 2d 1282, 1292 (M.D. Ala. 2010). While Plaintiff does respond in her brief to Defendant's argument regarding her lack of legal injury flowing from her discharge (Pl. Brief at 37)17, nowhere does she claim that she could have returned to work at any point after she went on medical leave on December 30, 2008. It might be assumed that receipt of SSDI benefits may not itself automatically preclude a plaintiff from bringing an FMLA claim alleging interference with the right to reinstatement. See, e.g., Verhoff v. Time Warner Cable, Inc., 299 Fed. App'x 488, 496-98 (6th Cir. Oct. 24, 2008); cf. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 802 (recognizing that there is no "inherent conflict" between a plaintiff's receipt of SSDI benefits and an allegation that she is also a "qualified individual" for purposes of bringing a claim under the ADA). Despite that, Plaintiff's failure to argue in support of such a claim in her brief means that she  [*67] has abandoned any such theory. Even if the claim were preserved, Plaintiff has failed to offer any evidence explaining how she could be deemed qualified to have performed her duties despite her continuing receipt of S&A and SSDI benefits until well after the expiration of her leave allowed under the FMLA. Cf. Cleveland, 526 U.S. at 806 (holding that an ADA plaintiff who bears the burden to show that she is a qualified individual who, "with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of her job ... cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation."). Given that Plaintiff does not dispute that she has not been able to work since before the effective date of her termination, she has failed to show suffer any monetary losses or how she could be entitled to reinstatement. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claims.

2. FMLA Retaliation
Finally, Plaintiff contends that Defendant disciplined her and terminated her employment in retaliation for exercising her rights under the FMLA and for attempting to do so. Absent direct evidence of the employer's retaliatory intent, these claims are subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Martin, 543 F.3d at 1268. Plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by demonstrating (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) the adverse action was causally related to the protected activity. Id.
Plaintiff's discussion of her FMLA retaliation cause of action focuses primarily upon her termination. (Pl. Brief at 27-30). However, for the same reasons that Plaintiff cannot recover for that adverse action under the FMLA pursuant to an interference theory, she also cannot recover under a retaliation theory. That is, even assuming  [*69] that Plaintiff's discharge was motivated by protected activity, she has not suffered any resulting injury for which she might be entitled to relief under the FMLA. Again, Plaintiff does not dispute that she has been totally disabled since several days before she was discharged on January 5, 2009. Plaintiff thus cannot show that she has suffered any monetary losses from her termination, and her admission that she has been unable to work also precludes reinstatement. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliatory discharge claim.
The only other adverse action that Plaintiff references in her FMLA retaliation arguments relates to the suspension notice that she received on December 23, 2008, constituting discipline for her alleged role in causing a production stop on the dualine on December 10th.18 (Pl. Brief at 28-29). While Plaintiff argues that such notice resulted in her termination, as discussed in the above section on Plaintiff's Title VII discharge claim, the record establishes that the December 23rd notice itself imposed only a five-day suspension, not a termination. Even so, a five-day suspension would constitute adverse action capable of supporting an  [*70] FMLA retaliation claim provided that it resulted in a loss of pay. See Romans v. Michigan Dep't of Human Services, 668 F.3d 826, 842 (6th Cir. 2012).
On the other hand, because damages are available under the FMLA only for actual economic loss, and because Plaintiff's admitted disability would disqualify her for reinstatement or other equitable relief, a five-day suspension that did not cause a loss of pay or benefits would not support an FMLA claim. See Pulczinki v. Trinity Structural Towers, Inc., 691 F.3d 996, 1007-08 (8th Cir. 2012) (three-day suspension with pay was not a materially adverse employment action under the FMLA); cf. Drago, 453 F.3d at 1307 (FMLA plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he suffered any damage as a result of his employer's requirement that he take two additional days of paid leave). And there is reason to suspect that Plaintiff never actually served the suspension from the December 23rd notice nor suffered any economic loss from it. Plaintiff argues that she  [*71] "lost a week (December 24, 2008 to December 29, 2008) of salary due to Defendant's action." (Pl. Brief at 37). Plaintiff did not testify to that. Nonetheless, at least generally consistent with her argument is that fact that the December 23rd disciplinary notice provided that she was "suspended for 5 days subject to discharge" and that, "for purposes of the Basic Labor Agreement ["BLA"]," the days of suspension were to be from December 24 to December 28, 2008, inclusive. (DX F at USS926). That being said, the notice further instructed that if Plaintiff was already scheduled to work those dates, she was to "work as scheduled pursuant to the Justice and Dignity provision of the [BLA]" and that she would be "notified at a later date of the days [she would] actually be off work as a result of [the] suspension." (Id.) That dovetails with Plaintiff's testimony that an employee who receives a suspension notice does not serve it immediately but is instead given an opportunity to contest it and serve it later. (Pl. Dep. at 202). On December 30, 2008, only one week after receiving the notice, Plaintiff went on S&A leave that continued for 12 months, and she has remained unable to work ever since.  [*72] Plaintiff was, of course, also told that she was terminated as of January 5, 2009. Moreover, as further discussed in connection with the Title VII termination claim, the department work schedule indicates that, because of the holiday season and an intervening weekend, no one in Plaintiff's department worked between December 24 and December 29, 2008. Thus, it appears that Plaintiff could not have actually "served" the five-day suspension from the December 23rd notice, at least not in the sense that she would have been absent from work on dates that she would have otherwise been present performing her job duties.
Nevertheless, to the extent Defendant asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff suffered "no damages" as a result of disciplinary action, it is Defendant's burden as the movant under Rule 56 to point to record evidence that either negates that element of Plaintiff's claim or affirmatively demonstrates that she lacks sufficient evidence to prove it at trial. See McGee v. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC, 719 F.3d 1236, 1242 (11th Cir. 2013); Clark, 929 F.2d at 608; Four Parcels of Real Property, 941 F.2d at 1438 n. 19. Unless and until Defendant  [*73] has satisfied that initial burden, Plaintiff has no obligation to come forward with evidence demonstrating a cognizable injury. See Imaging Business Machines, LLC v. BancTec, Inc., 459 F.3d 1186, 1190 (11th Cir. 2006); Clark, 929 F.2d at 608.
In support of summary judgment, Defendant argues that Plaintiff did work from December 24 through December 29, 2008, and that she "wrongly claims lost wages" for that period. (Doc. 44 at 7). But Defendant relies only upon Plaintiff's testimony that "the last day that [she] worked was [December 29, 2008]." (Id. (citing Pl. Dep. at 64)). Even if credited, that statement does not prove that she worked from December 24th to the 28th, the days allocated for the suspension in the disciplinary notice. That is particularly so given that Plaintiff was undisputedly present at "work" on December 29, 2008, for the 9(b) hearing. Indeed, the department schedule indicates that no one in Plaintiff's department actually "worked" any day between December 24th (the day after she received the suspension notice) and December 29th (the last day before she went on S&A leave), even if the schedule further indicates that hiatus was occasioned by the holiday season and  [*74] a weekend. More to the point, Plaintiff's testimony that her "last day" was December 29th does not foreclose that she never lost pay as a consequence of the suspension notice. Even if Plaintiff was not scheduled to work any date between December 24th and 29th, it is at least possible that Defendant could have determined at some point to enforce the suspension by docking her salary for some or all those dates for which she might have otherwise been paid as a holiday or vacation. To be clear, there is no evidence that such actually occurred. Nonetheless, the December 23rd disciplinary notice provides on its face Plaintiff was subject to a five-day suspension. It is Defendant's burden as the movant for summary judgment to proffer evidence that Plaintiff did not lose pay as a result or evidence that Plaintiff will be unable to prove at trial that she lost pay. Defendant has done neither, so summary judgment is not warranted on the ground that Plaintiff suffered no economic injury from the suspension.
The undersigned will assume that the December 23rd five-day suspension notice shows an adverse action and that Plaintiff can otherwise establish a prima facie case of FMLA retaliation. Defendant,  [*75] however, has met its burden at the intermediate stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework. The December 23, 2008 notice provides that Plaintiff was disciplined for a legitimate reason, namely the incident that occurred on December 10th. (DX F at USS926). Specifically, it was alleged that Plaintiff was guilty of "unsatisfactory work" in that she "made an offset weld and welded a piece of scrap onto the strip causing the line to have to stop and cut out the scrap resulting in a 17 minute delay and 6000 pounds of scrap." (Id.)
Plaintiff raises several points in support of pretext. First, she emphasizes that she was issued the suspension notice on December 23, 2008, only about 15 minutes after she tendered a doctor's note to her supervisor advising that she would need additional medical leave for another surgery. Evidence of a close temporal relationship between a decisionmaker's becoming aware of the plaintiff's protected activity and the taking of adverse action thereafter is probative of whether the former motivated the latter. See Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1234-35; Martin, 543 F.3d at 1268; Brungart v. BellSouth Telecommunications., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000). Plaintiff's testimony  [*76] obviously supports that there was extremely close temporal proximity between her notice that she intended to take additional medical leave, which is assumed to be activity protected under the FMLA, see generally Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2012), and her receipt of the disciplinary notice stating that she was being suspended for the incident on December 10th. Nevertheless, the record also establishes that, on December 11, 2008, Heaton had already documented the December 10th incident in an email directing a disciplinary write-up for Plaintiff. (DX F at USS931). That email predated, and thus could not have been possibly motivated by, Plaintiff's notice on December 23rd regarding her intent to take additional medical leave. "Employers need not suspend previously planned [adverse action] upon discovering that [a plaintiff has engaged in protected activity], and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality." Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001).
Plaintiff also argues that she can show pretext on the theory that she was not  [*77] deserving of discipline for her actions on December 10th. Plaintiff admits that she was involved in an incident on that date as generally described in the disciplinary notice. (See Pl. Dep. at 151, 210-11). Plaintiff insists, however, that she did not do anything wrong. (Pl. Dep. at 67, 210-12). Rather, Plaintiff maintains that she made the offset weld because the "shears" on the equipment she was using were "dull," and she contends that a supervisor should have stopped the line earlier and had maintenance employees change the shears. (Id. at 46, 151, 164, 210-12).
The problem for Plaintiff with this line of argument is that her own perception about whether she should have been disciplined is beside the point; all that matters is what the relevant decisionmakers were aware of and what they thought. See Alvarez, 610 F.3d at 1266. Thus, the question is not whether the incident was Plaintiff's "fault," whether by her own estimation or even in an objective sense. The question is whether Defendant's decisionmakers were dissatisfied with her for lawful reasons, even if mistakenly or unfairly so, or instead merely used the reasons given for the discipline as cover for discrimination because  [*78] of her attempt to exercise rights under the FMLA. See id.; Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc); Elrod v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 939 F.2d 1466, 1470 (11th Cir. 1991). To that end, Plaintiff testified that her "supervisor knew that the shears were dull" (Pl. Dep. at 46) and that "they knew it was a mechanical error [that caused the problem], not [her] error." (Id. at 67). However, Plaintiff has not pointed to any admissible evidence to support either point, such as a statement by a decisionmaker that might indicate he did not honestly believe that Plaintiff was guilty of wrongdoing or that she did not deserve the punishment imposed.
Plaintiff also suggests that her suspension on December 23rd is suspicious because she had already been punished for the incident on December 10th. She explains that Heaton told her on the day of the incident that she was being moved off the dualine, back to her former wrapping position, which paid less, and that nothing else was said about the incident until she received the suspension notice almost two weeks later. (Pl. Dep. at 65-67; see also id. at 156-57). While it might have been Plaintiff's impression that the matter  [*79] was closed with her transfer back to wrapping, what Plaintiff thought is, again, not material. Employers are generally permitted to punish their employees as they see fit, including the imposition of multiple penalties for a single incident. See Zayas v. Bacardi Corp., 524 F.3d 65, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2008). Further, Plaintiff did not testify that Heaton or any other supervisor actually told her that the transfer back to wrapping would be her only penalty for the incident.19 To the contrary, Heaton's email dated December 11th instructing that Plaintiff be issued a formal disciplinary write-up for the incident refutes that he contemplated additional discipline only after Plaintiff gave notice on December 23rd of a need for more medical leave.
Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant exhibited more favorable treatment to other employees who did the same things for which she was disciplined. If Plaintiff could show that other employees did not engage in protected conduct and were treated more leniently despite being otherwise similarly situated to her, that would be probative pretext. See Holley v. Seminole County Sch. Dist., 755 F.2d 1492, 1505 & n.17 (11th Cir. 1985). The only potential comparators that Plaintiff mentions in the argument section of her brief are the seven male employees who she says received "more disciplinary action for poor workmanship than [she did]" but were not terminated. (Pl. Brief at 30). Such an argument seems directed  [*81] towards a claim founded on Plaintiff's discharge. For reasons already stated, she cannot recover for that action under the FMLA. In any case, that Defendant disciplined other employees on multiple occasions for poor workmanship does not show that Defendant treated them more favorably than Plaintiff with respect to a suspension. If anything, it supports that Defendant treated them all alike. It might be assumed that Plaintiff is attempting to demonstrate more broadly that Defendant harbored a retaliatory animus against her based on the fact that only she was later discharged. She would fail in that endeavor, however, because she has not sufficiently demonstrated that any of those seven employees are valid comparators, relative to her discharge or anything else.
Plaintiff has also claimed that she was treated more harshly insofar as she was disciplined for "mechanical problems" beyond her control while other employees allegedly were not disciplined in similar circumstances. (See Compl. ¶¶ 11, 16). However, that issue is mentioned in only one sentence in her brief, and only then in the discussion of the facts of the case. (See Pl. Brief at 6, ¶ 11). In order for comparator evidence to  [*82] raise an inference of unlawful discriminatory intent, a plaintiff must show that another employee outside of her protected class was "similarly situated ... in all relevant respects." Rioux, 520 F.3d at 1280. That similarity generally must extend to "the quantity and quality of the comparator's misconduct," McCann, 526 F.3d at 1373, including as to the comparator's work record and disciplinary history. See Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 741 (11th Cir. 2004), overruled on other grounds, Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 546 U.S. 454, 457, 126 S. Ct. 1195, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1053 (2006); Maynard v. Board of Regents of Div. of Univ. Fla. Dep't of Educ., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289-90 (11th Cir. 2003); Bogle v. Orange County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 162 F.3d 653, 658-59 (11th Cir. 1998). Also, the actions of proffered comparators are only relevant if it is shown that the employer's decision maker actually knew of the prior similar acts and did not discipline the rule violators. See Jones v. Gerwens, 874 F.2d 1534, 1542 (11th Cir. 1989); see also Silvera, 244 F.3d at 1262.
Plaintiff has not presented sufficient information to establish that other employees outside of her protected class were actually similarly situated to her in all relevant  [*83] respects and were also actually treated more favorably. While Plaintiff has argued that she has "identified other employees of [Defendant] who have engaged in similar action ... but who have not been terminated or disciplined," (Pl. Brief at 6, ¶ 11), such is not enough to show pretext. See Thomas v. Aventis Pharm., Inc., 177 Fed. Appx. 54, 57 (11th Cir. April 18, 2006) (plaintiff failed to show pretext despite having "claimed generally that other people were committing the same work-rule violations as he was"). That is particularly so in an FMLA case like this one. Again, the record establishes that Defendant granted Plaintiff far more medical leave and related benefits than that to which she might have been entitled under the FMLA. Likewise, Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence that anyone involved in a decision to take adverse action against her ever made a statement suggestive of an animus related to protected activity (or to any other characteristic or activity protected under Title VII, the ADA, or the ADEA, for that matter). Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claims.20

IV. RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 38) be GRANTED and that Defendant's motion to strike (Doc. 47) be DENIED AS MOOT.

Notice of Right to Object
Any party who objects to this report and recommendation must, within fourteen (14) days of the date on which it is entered, file specific written objections with the clerk of this court. Any objections to the failure of the magistrate judge to address any contention raised in the petition also must be included. Failure to do so will bar any later challenge or review of the factual findings or legal conclusions of the magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985),  [*85] reh'g denied, 474 U.S. 1111, 106 S.Ct. 899, 88 L.Ed.2d 933 (1986); Nettles v. Wainwright, 677 F.2d 404 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc). In order to challenge the findings of the magistrate judge, a party must file with the clerk of the court written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings and recommendation to which objection is made and the specific basis for objection. A copy of the objections must be served upon all other parties to the action.
Upon receipt of objections meeting the specificity requirement set out above, a United States District Judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report, proposed findings, or recommendation to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The district judge, however, need conduct a hearing only in his discretion or if required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his own determination on the basis of that record. The district judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.  [*86] Objections not meeting the specificity requirement set out above will not be considered by a district judge.
A party may not appeal a magistrate judge's recommendation directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Appeals may be made only from a final judgment entered by or at the direction of a district judge.
DONE, this the 3rd day of December, 2013.
