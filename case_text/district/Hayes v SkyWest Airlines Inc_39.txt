ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S RENEWED MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW
Blackburn, J.
The matter before me is Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law [#263],1 filed October 24, 2018. I deny the motion.
Plaintiff John Hayes's claims for retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654, and for discrimination and retaliation under the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ §§ 12101-12213, were tried to a jury on September 18-22, 2017. At mid-trial, defendant SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest") moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(a) on Mr. Hayes's FMLA retaliation claim.2 I deferred [*2]  my ruling on that motion at that juncture. At the close of the evidence, SkyWest renewed its mid-trial motion and also sought judgment on the issue of punitive damages. On September 25, 2017, the jury returned verdicts in favor of Mr. Hayes on all claims submitted to it and awarded substantial damages, including punitive damages. SkyWest now renews its oral Rule 50 motion.
A party seeking relief under Rule 50(b) is entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the evidence so overwhelmingly supports one position that no reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence to sustain the position of the nonmovant. Tyler v. RE/MAX Mountain States, Inc., 232 F.3d 808, 812 (10th Cir. 2000). "[I]n reviewing the record, [the court] will not weigh evidence, judge witness credibility, or challenge the factual conclusions of the jury." Hampton v. Dillard Department Stores Inc., 247 F.3d 1091, 1099 (10th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Judgment as a matter of law must be denied if there is any legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a claim. Id. I must consider the evidence and all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Id.; see also Aquilino v. University of Kansas, 268 F.3d 930, 933 (10th Cir. 2001).
Having reviewed the motion, the response, and the reply, I find and conclude SkyWest has not demonstrated it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. I find the evidence presented at trial was not of such quality [*3]  and weight as to establish irrefutably that reasonable people could not arrive at the verdicts other than those the jury here reached. Specifically, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Mr. Hayes suffered materially adverse actions in retaliation for his exercise of this rights under the FMLA and that an award of punitive damages against SkyWest under the ADA was justified.
Regarding the FMLA retaliation claim, SkyWest's decision to cancel Mr. Hayes's health insurance was the type of materially adverse action which might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from exercising his rights under the FMLA. See Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006); Metzler v. Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, 464 F.3d 1164, 1171 & n.2 (10th Cir. 2006) (applying Burlington Northern standard to FMLA retaliation claims). Mr. Hayes's health insurance was cancelled on June 30, 2014, the very day his FMLA leave expired.3 A reasonable employee might well have been discouraged from exercising his rights under the FMLA were he to face the prospect of losing health insurance.
SkyWest argues its actions were justified by its unambiguous company policy. I agree the policy is unambiguous, but not in the way SkyWest suggests. The apposite policy provides employees on FMLA [*4]  leave shall "maintain[] benefits until the end of the month following expiration of FMLA . . ." (Trial Exh. 56 § 3(F)(2)(a) (emphasis added).) The "month following" the expiration of Mr. Hayes's FMLA leave on June 30 was July; the manner in which SkyWest reads the policy would eliminate this crucial, qualifying language.4
The evidence at trial also was more than sufficient to allow the jury to infer a causal connection between those two actions. Contrary to SkyWest's arguments, the temporal proximity between these two events is extremely close - Mr. Hayes's insurance was cancelled within two weeks of going on leave. See Metzler, 464 F.3d at 1171-72.5 Although SkyWest notes that temporal proximity alone will not suffice where the employer has asserted a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, see id. at 1172, as discussed above, SkyWest's reliance on its policy language for the purpose does not bear scrutiny. Indeed, the jury properly could infer from SkyWest's strained and illogical interpretation of the policy alone that its stated reason was a pretext for retaliation for Mr. Hayes's exercise of his FMLA rights. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2108-09, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); Wells v. Colorado Department of Transportation, 325 F.3d 1205, 1217 (10th Cir. 2003).
Moreover, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the other adverse employment [*5]  actions Mr. Hayes suffered following his return from FMLA leave also were related to his taking of FMLA leave. Mr. Hayes took FMLA leave in the summer of 2014 to have a dialysis catheter implanted, a signal of the increasingly dire state of his health and his need going forward for regular dialysis treatment. Within days of Mr. Hayes's return to work (under conditions which the jury could reasonably infer showed SkyWest in fact could accommodate Mr. Hayes's medical restrictions), SkyWest placed him, involuntarily, on company medical leave. SkyWest's failure to hire him for the numerous other positions for which he applied thereafter, as well as the eventual termination of his employment,6 reasonably could have been construed by the jury as part of a pattern of retaliatory actions tied to the reasons for which he took FMLA leave that only ultimately culminated in these employment consequences.7 See Marx v. Schnuck Markets, Inc., 76 F.3d 324, 329 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 2552 (1996). That pattern, coupled with the flimsiness of SkyWest's reasons for forcing Mr. Hayes to take unpaid leave after he already had been returned to work, were sufficient to permit the jury to reasonably infer a causal connection between these later actions and Mr. Hayes's exercise [*6]  of his FMLA rights.
SkyWest further maintains the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's award of punitive damages. It most assuredly was not. Punitive damages are available under the ADA when the evidence shows a defendant acted "with malice or with reckless indifference to [plaintiff's] federally protected rights[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(1). To meet this standard, the evidence must show either that the employer knew it was acting in violation of federal law or that it acted "in the face of a perceived risk that its action will violate federal law." Kolstad v. American Dental Association, 527 U.S. 526, 535-36, 119 S.Ct. 2118, 2124-25, 144 L.Ed.2d 494 (1999). See also EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 187 F.3d 1241, 1245 (10th Cir. 1999).
The evidence here showed both of the leave administrators who were directly responsible for engaging in the interactive process with Mr. Hayes - Pennie Hancock and Andrea Roberts - received training on the requirements of the ADA and understood their duties thereunder, including, specifically, the duty to engage in the interactive process in good faith. Yet mere days after Mr. Hayes returned to work with his lifting restrictions (having already engaged in the interactive process with employee development manager Kiana Jodell), Ms. Roberts and Ms. Hancock came [*7]  to the conclusion Mr. Hayes could not perform that job under his then-current job code. Rather than simply change the code or discuss other, less drastic accommodations with Mr. Hayes, Ms. Roberts and Ms. Hancock agreed they needed to convince Mr. Hayes to take medical leave, contrary to their own understanding of what the ADA interactive process required. In addition to the substance of this evidence, the tone and tenor of these witnesses' testimony - defensive, non-responsive, and often contradictory of earlier testimony - amply supported the jury's conclusion that SkyWest acted with malice or reckless indifference to its obligations under the ADA.
Accordingly, SkyWest's motion for judgment as a matter of law must be denied.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law [#263], filed October 24, 2018, is denied.
Dated July 3, 2019, at Denver, Colorado.
