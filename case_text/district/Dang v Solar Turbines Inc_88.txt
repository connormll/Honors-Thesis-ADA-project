ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT;
[Doc. No. 43]

GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
[Doc. No. 45]
On April 2, 2008, Plaintiff Charlie T. Dang filed a Third Amended Complaint ("TAC") against Defendant Solar Turbines Inc. alleging discrimination based on disability, sex, national origin, race, and age [Doc. No. 32]. Dang also alleges causes of action for retaliation, sexual harassment, failure to accommodate, pay discrimination, "malicious practices of employment," and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Currently pending before the Court are two motions. [*2]  First, Dang moves for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 43]. Solar Turbines opposes the motion [Doc. No. 48]. Dang filed a reply [Doc. No. 51]. Second, Solar Turbines moves for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 as to all causes of action alleged in Dang's TAC [Doc. No. 45]. Dang opposes the motion [Doc. No. 53]. Solar Turbines filed a reply [Doc. No. 56].
For the following reasons, the Court DENIES Dang's motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint and GRANTS Solar Turbines's motion for summary judgment in its entirety.

Background
This action arises from the events surrounding Dang's approximately two and a half year medical leave of absence from his employment at Solar Turbines. Dang began working at Solar Turbines in July 1991 as an Associate Manufacturing Engineer. Solar Turbines promoted Dang to Staff Manufacturing Engineer in July 1993. In October 1995, Solar Turbines transferred Dang to the Technical Information Department due to his unsatisfactory performance as a Staff Manufacturing Engineer. Solar Turbines gave Dang the position of Publication Specialist, a position one pay grade lower than his previous engineering position. In September 1998, Dang's supervisor, [*3]  Sharlene Mullen, promoted Dang to Senior Publication Specialist. In December 2000, Solar Turbines reclassified Dang's position as a Technical Information Specialist.
Between August 1995 and July 2003, Solar Turbines placed Dang on three Performance Improvement Plans ("PIP") due to less than satisfactory job performance in his positions as Staff Manufacturing Engineer and Technical Information Specialist. Dang's July 2003 Performance Appraisal indicated that Dang continued to need improvement in several areas. As a result, Dang's supervisor placed him on a PIP in August 2003 to address his deficiencies.
On July 2, 2003, Dr. Edward Sanford III treated Dang for hemorrhoids and leg numbness. At the time, Dang's job assignment required him to walk the shop floor. Dang informed his supervisors that because of his medical conditions, he could not stand for more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time without difficulty and would have trouble climbing turbines or packages. In order to accommodate Dang's medical limitations, Dang's supervisors provided a chair on the shop floor so that he could sit when necessary, and a step ladder and ladder to assist him in accessing turbines and packages.
In [*4]  September 2003, Dang attended a meeting with Scott Jaykell, a human resources representative at Solar Turbines, to address continuing concerns about his less than satisfactory job performance. During the course of the discussion, Dang informed Jaykell that he had contemplated suicide and suffered from mental stress. Jaykell arranged for Dang to visit Solar Turbines' employee assistance program management company. After his consultation, on September 19, 2003, Dang went on medical leave under the federal Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and California's Family Rights Act ("CFRA") for a mental illness disability. His leave exhausted on December 15, 2003. Dang's physicians still considered Dang to be temporarily and totally disabled and unable to return to work. Solar Turbines allowed Dang to stay on medical leave, during which time Dang received long term disability benefits consisting of sixty percent of his base salary and full medical insurance coverage at no cost. On January 3, 2006, Solar Turbines' disability benefits insurer informed Dang in writing that his benefits would reach their maximum on March 17, 2006, and his benefits would terminate.
In March 2006, Dang's physicians [*5]  released him to return to work with medical restrictions, limiting Dang to sedentary work for not more than eight hours per day. At that time, Dang was unable to return to work as a Technical Information Specialist due to restructuring which eliminated the position company-wide. Therefore, between March 23, 2006 and May 25, 2006, Solar Turbines' human resources representatives assisted Dang in applying for other positions at the company. Dang applied for seven positions but Solar Turbines hired other applicants.
On June 21, 2006, Dang filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging that Solar Turbines discriminated and retaliated against him based on disability. In his EEOC Charge, Dang alleges that human resources representatives pressured him to resign in exchange for a "small" severance package, which he declined. On October 9, 2007, Solar Turbines' human resources manager contacted Dang to inform him that he needed an updated company medical review if he desired to continue seeking a new position. Dang had not applied for a position at Solar Turbines since May 2006. Dang did not schedule an appointment for a medical review.
On June [*6]  18, 2008, Dang was informed in writing that his medical leave from Solar Turbines would terminate on June 30, 2008, and if he had not been cleared to work and located a position at the company he would be terminated. Dang did not seek medical clearance and he did not apply for any positions. Solar Turbines terminated his employment effective June 30, 2008.

I. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND HIS TAC

A. Legal Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 governs amendment of pleadings. It states that if a responsive pleading has already been filed, the party seeking amendment "may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). This rule reflects an underlying policy that disputes should be determined on their merits, and not on the technicalities of pleading rules. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181-82, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962). Accordingly, the Court must be generous in granting leave to amend. See Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1990) (leave to amend granted with "extreme liberality"); Ascon Properties, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Co., 866 F.2d 1149, 1160 (9th Cir. 1989). However, there are several accepted reasons to deny leave to amend, including the presence of bad faith on the part of the plaintiff, undue delay, prejudice to the defendant, futility of amendment, and that the plaintiff [*7]  has previously amended the complaint. See Ascon Props., 866 F.2d at 1160; McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 809 (9th Cir. 1988). A district court's discretion to deny leave to amend is particularly broad where the plaintiff has previously filed an amended complaint. See Wagh v. Metris Direct, Inc., 363 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir. 2003).
Here, the Court has granted Dang leave to file three amended complaints. (See Doc. Nos. 9 (First Amended Complaint filed July 24, 2007), 25 (Second Amended Complaint filed January 22, 2008), and 32 (Third Amended Complaint filed April 2, 2008).) Dang attempted to file a fourth amended complaint on August 28, 2008. However, the Court rejected the pleading as discrepant due to Dang's failure to seek leave of court to file the proposed amended complaint pursuant to Rule 15 and the Court's Scheduling Order [Doc. No. 38]. The deadline to file motions to amend passed on August 25, 2008. (See August 8, 2008 Scheduling Order ¶ 1.) Notwithstanding its untimeliness, the Court permitted Dang to file the instant motion on September 10, 2008.
Applying the factors used to determine whether to grant a motion to amend, the Court finds that undue delay, prejudice to Solar Turbines, and the fact that Dang has filed three amended complaints, weigh in favor of denial. See Wagh, 363 F.3d at 830. Not only has Dang been given three previous opportunities [*8]  to amend, this case has been pending for over two years. Further, another amendment is likely to cause unnecessary prejudice to Solar Turbines, who has filed a motion for summary judgment as to the causes of action contained in Dang's TAC. It appears that Dang wishes to amend his complaint further in order to conduct additional discovery and in preparation for settlement conferences. However, these are not appropriate reasons to amend a complaint, and Dang offers no explanation of what additional facts he intends to plead or whether he intends to state additional causes of action at this mature stage in the litigation. See Allen v. Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 373 (9th Cir. Cal. 1990). Finally, Dang proffers no explanation as to why he failed to "fully develop his contentions" originally, or in his first, second, or third amended complaints. See id. (internal quotations omitted.)
Accordingly, the Court finds that the interests of justice do not require granting Dang leave to file a fourth amended complaint and therefore DENIES Dang's motion.

II. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

A. Legal Standards

1. Summary Judgment
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), a party is entitled to summary judgment "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions [*9]  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). It is beyond dispute that "[t]he moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact." Horphag Research Ltd. v. Garcia, 475 F.3d 1029, 1035 (9th Cir. 2007)(citation omitted). "Once the moving party meets its initial burden, . . . the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
A mere scintilla of evidence is not sufficient "to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment; instead, the nonmoving party must introduce some 'significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.'" Fazio v. City & County of San Francisco, 125 F.3d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 252). Thus, in opposing a summary judgment motion it is not enough to simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citations omitted). However, when assessing the record to determine whether there is a "genuine issue for trial," the court must "view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all reasonable [*10]  inferences in h[er] favor." Horphag, 475 F.3d at 1035 (citation omitted). On a summary judgment motion, the court may not make credibility determinations; nor may it weigh conflicting evidence. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. Thus, as framed by the Supreme Court, the ultimate question on a summary judgment motion is whether the evidence "presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Id. at 251-52.

2. Standards Applied for Pro Se Litigants
Pro se litigants "must be ensured meaningful access to the courts." Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952, 957 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc). In the context of a motion for summary judgment, "[d]istrict courts are obligated to advise prisoner pro per litigants of Rule 56 requirements." Klingele v. Eikenberry, 849 F.2d 409, 411-12 (9th Cir. 1988) (citing Hudson v. Hardy, 412 F.2d 1091, 1094, 134 U.S. App. D.C. 44 (D.C. Cir. 1968)) (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit has declined, however, to extend this duty to all pro se litigants. See Jacobsen v. Filler, 790 F.2d 1362, 1364-67 (9th Cir. 1986)(declining to extend the Hudson rule because "pro se litigants in the ordinary civil case should not be treated more favorably than parties with attorneys of record."); Rand, 154 F.3d at 956 (observing that the court in Jacobsen "refused to apply the [Hudson fair notice requirement] to pro se non-prisoners."); see also King v. Atiyeh, 814 F.2d 565, 567 (9th Cir. 1986) ("Pro se litigants must follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants."). [*11]  Courts apply the general summary judgment standard, construing a pro se plaintiff's pleadings liberally in her favor. See Eldridge v. Block, 832 F.2d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir. 1987) ("The Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to liberally construe the 'inartful pleading' of pro se litigants.") (citations omitted).

B. Discussion

1. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
Solar Turbines moves for summary judgment as to Dang's claims of employment discrimination based on disability, sex, race, national origin, and age, arguing that these claims are statutorily barred due to Dang's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Defendant's Memorandum, 9.) Dang contends that his Charge of Discrimination filed with the EEOC on June 21, 2006, along with the February 26, 2007 right-to-sue letter issued by the EEOC, satisfy his exhaustion requirement as to all asserted discrimination claims. (Plaintiff's Memorandum, 6.) Dang further asserts that the EEOC forwarded his Charge of Discrimination to the DFEH on his behalf, and attaches a copy of the Charge form submitted on June 21, 2006. (Id., attachment between p.6 and p.7.) Dang's EEOC Charge states "I believe that I am being discriminated against because my disability and retaliated against [*12]  for opposing an unlawful practice in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") of 1990 and Section 503(a)."

i) Title VII Claims
Title VII requires an aggrieved employee to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a private action in federal court. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f). To exhaust his administrative remedies, the employee is required to file a charge with the EEOC. Id. The filing of an administrative charge is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a civil action, id., and the district court's jurisdiction is limited to those acts alleged in the charge. Stache v. Int'l Union of Bricklayers, 852 F.2d 1231, 1234 (9th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 815, 110 S. Ct. 64, 107 L. Ed. 2d 32 (1989). Accordingly, the Court lacks jurisdiction over any claims not made part of the EEOC complaint or not "reasonably related" to the claims in the complaint. Shah v. Mt. Zion Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 642 F.2d 268, 271-72 (9th Cir. 1981). A plaintiff cannot litigate new theories of discrimination not raised with the EEOC. Id. This rule allows the EEOC an opportunity to settle disputes through conference, conciliation, and persuasion before the aggrieved party is permitted to file a lawsuit, and also puts defendants on notice of the substance of the charge. See Abigail Cooley Modjeska, Employment Discrimination Law, § 6:12 (3d ed. 1993). The ADA incorporates the procedures of Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a).
Where federal and state law overlap, [*13]  employment discrimination charges may be filed with either the EEOC or the DFEH. State agencies are authorized to investigate and enforce Title VII claims pursuant to "worksharing" agreements with the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-8(b); 29 C.F.R. § 1626.10(c). As a result of such worksharing agreements, each agency designates the other as its agent for purposes of receiving charges on discrimination claims that overlap under federal and state law. Charges filed with either agency are automatically forwarded to the other. Laquaglia v. Rio Hotel & Casino, Inc., 186 F.3d 1172, 1175-76 (9th Cir. 1999) (charges filed with DFEH are forwarded to and deemed filed with EEOC). Nevertheless, Title VII still requires a right-to-sue notice specifically from the EEOC in order to file suit in federal court. Federal-state cooperation does not extend to exhaustion of administrative remedies.1 Jones v. Grinnell Corp., 235 F.3d 972, 975 (5th Cir. 2001); Martin v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1726, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181 (1994); Roman v. County of L.A. (2000) 85 Cal. App. 4th 316, 326, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 13.
The sole charge in Dang's June 21, 2006 EEOC Charge is that his supervisors at Solar Turbines pressured him to resign for a small severance package, which he declined, based on his disability and in retaliation for him trying to enforce his rights of fair employment. Dang lists the earliest date of discrimination as March 17, 2006 (the day he was cleared by Solar Turbines medical department to return to work) and latest date [*14]  of discrimination as May 11, 2006 (the day he allegedly was asked to resign), a period of approximately two months during which time he remained on company medical leave.
Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Id., § 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). Discrimination on the basis of disability is not cognizable under Title VII,2 and Dang does not allege discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or national origin in his EEOC Charge. Therefore, Dang's Title VII claims fail.
Dang does not allege in the EEOC Charge that his supervisors subjected him to race or national origin discrimination, sexual discrimination or sexual harassment, or that his supervisors or anyone at Solar Turbines discriminated against him during the course of his employment on these grounds. Furthermore, these claims are not "reasonably related" to Dang's disability claim such that the EEOC Charge can satisfy the exhaustion [*15]  requirements. "When an employee seeks judicial relief for incidents not listed in his original charge to the [EEOC or DFEH], the judicial complaint nevertheless may encompass any discrimination like or reasonably related to the allegations of the [EEOC] charge, including new acts occurring during the pendency of the charge before the EEOC." Oubichon v. N. Am. Rockwell Corp., 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir. 1973) (emphasis added). Thus, "if an investigation of what was charged in the EEOC would necessarily uncover other incidents that were not charged, the latter incidents could be included in a subsequent action." Okoli v. Lockheed Technical Operations Co. (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 1607, 1615, 43 Cal. Rptr. 2d 57. Here, the evidence before the Court does not show, nor does Dang effect a serious attempt to argue, that his race, sex, age, and national origin based allegations are "like or reasonably related to" his original allegations such that they would "reasonably have been uncovered in an investigation of the charges that were made." Id. at 1617.
Courts in this circuit have held repeatedly in and different contexts that a particular charge of discrimination filed with an administrative agency does not reasonably trigger an investigation into discrimination on a separate and alternative ground. See Shah v. Mount Zion Hosp. & Med. Center, 642 F.2d 268, 271 (9th Cir. 1981) (affirming trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's civil claims [*16]  based on race and religious discrimination because such allegations were not "reasonably related" to the allegations of sex discrimination explicitly listed in the EEOC Charge); cf. Chaudhary v. Telecare Corp., No. 99-3189, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17729, 2000 WL 1721075, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2000) ("Because claims of sex and age discrimination are not 'reasonably related to' national origin/ancestry discrimination DFEH charges, they must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies."). Nor do listed charges of retaliation reasonably induce administrative investigation into a non-listed charge of discrimination. Okoli, 36 Cal. App. 4th at 1617 (holding that an administrative charge of race discrimination is "not like or reasonably related to" a charge of retaliation); see also Latu v. Am. Airlines, No. 00-3301, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21436, 2001 WL 1658289, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2001) ("The claim of retaliation is not like or reasonably related to the allegations . . . which focused solely on his claim that he was harassed."); cf. Barron v. United Air Lines, Inc., No. 92-1364, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5626, 1993 WL 140630, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 1993) ("[T]he scope of the administrative investigation into [plaintiff's] Charge of Discrimination would not reasonably have included an investigation into . . . claims [of] retaliation for complaining about discrimination.").
Dang specifically limited the focus of his EEOC Charge to discrimination and retaliation based on disability. If simply alleging the race, national origin, sex and age based [*17]  allegations in this action following his failure to properly exhaust his administrative remedy were deemed sufficient, it would allow Dang to bypass, and thus defeat, the exhaustion requirement — the purpose of which is "to give the administrative agency the opportunity to investigate, mediate, and take remedial action." Stewart v. U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 762 F.2d 193, 198 (2d Cir. 1985). Dang raised these claims for the first time when he filed his original complaint with this Court. Because these allegations were not made part of his EEOC Charge, and are not reasonably related thereto, the claims are statutorily barred. Dang has not provided any evidence to refute Solar Turbine's contention that he has not properly exhausted his administrative remedies as to these claims.3

ii) California Fair Employment and Housing Act Claims
Like the EEOC, "FEHA provides an administrative scheme to process claims of employment . . . discrimination. The statute creates two administrative bodies — the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Cal. Gov't Code § 12901, and the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, id. § 12903 - to investigate, adjudicate, and redress discrimination claims, id. §§ 12930, 12935. FEHA requires that an aggrieved claimant exhaust the administrative remedies provided by those bodies [*18]  before filing an action in state or federal court. Id. §§ 12960-12976." Bass v. County of Butte, 458 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir. 2006).
Dang's race, sex, and national origin claims brought pursuant to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), Cal. Govt. Code § 12900 et seq., also fail based on his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these claims. With respect to Dang's disability claim, FEHA makes it an unlawful employment practice, "unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification," for an employer "to refuse to hire an individual with a physical disability, due to the physical disability, unless such disability renders the individual unable to perform the essential duties of the position even with reasonable accommodations or the manner of the individual's performance would endanger his health or safety or the health or safety of others." Id., § 12940(a)(1). Therefore, a disability discrimination cause of action may be brought pursuant to FEHA. However, as stated above, an EEOC right-to-sue notice satisfies the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies only for purposes of an action based on Title VII. Inasmuch as Dang brings a disability claim based on the Fair Employment and Housing Act, the EEOC right-to-sue notice does not satisfy the jurisdictional [*19]  requirement that Dang have exhausted his administrative remedies as to the asserted violation of the California statute. Martin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th 1718, 1726, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181; Roman v. County of L.A. (2000) 85 Cal. App. 4th 316, 326, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 13.

iii) Age Discrimination and Employment Act Claim
The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). This prohibition applies to "individuals who are at least 40 years of age." 29 U.S.C. § 631(a). To pursue an ADEA claim in federal court, a plaintiff must first file a timely administrative charge with the EEOC. 29 U.S.C. § 626 (d). Further, "the jurisdictional scope of a Title VII claimant's court action depends upon the scope of both the EEOC charge and the EEOC investigation." Sosa v. Hiraoka, 920 F.2d at 1456 (citing Green v. Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools, 883 F.2d 1472, 1476 (9th Cir.1989)). A theory or claim of discrimination not included in the EEOC charge may not be considered by a federal court unless it is "'like or reasonably related to the allegations contained in the EEOC charge.'" Brown v. Puget Sound Elec. Apprenticeship & Training Trust, 732 F.2d 726, 729 (9th Cir.1984) (quoting Oubichon v. Northern American Rockwell Corporation, 482 F.2d 569, 571 (9th Cir.1973)).
Dang's EEOC Charge does not assert discrimination based on age. Dang checked the box designating discrimination based on disability, but did not check the box designated age. Nor does Dang's [*20]  short narrative mention discrimination based on age, only on disability. Dang did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his discrimination claim based on age, and may not, therefore, pursue the claim in this Court.

iv) Americans with Disabilities Act Claim
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), enacted in 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., precludes discrimination by an employer against "a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability." Id., § 12112(a). The ADA defines "qualified individual with a disability" as an "individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "In order to prevail on an employment termination [or refusal to hire] claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that he is qualified, that is, with or without reasonable accommodation (which he must describe), he is able to perform the essential functions of the job; and (3) that the employer terminated [or refused to hire] him because of his disability. A plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that [*21]  []he can perform the essential functions of [his] job with or without reasonable accommodation." Kennedy v. Applause, 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal citations and fn. omitted).
The ADA incorporates the filing requirements of Title VII. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12117, incorporating the filing requirements of, inter alia, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f); see also, e.g., Sosa v. Hiraoka, 920 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir.1990). Dang successfully exhausted his ADA-based disability claim by way of his June 21, 2006 EEOC Charge. Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction over the charges alleged in Dang's EEOC complaint that Solar Turbines discriminated against Dang based on his medical disabilities and retaliated against him based on his medical disabilities in violation of the ADA.

v) Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, this Court lacks jurisdiction over Dang's Title VII race, sex, and national origin claims, his claims brought under FEHA, and his ADEA age discrimination claim. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Solar Turbine's motion for summary judgment as to these claims.

2. ADA Claims

i) Discrimination
Solar Turbines moves for summary judgment as to Dang's disability discrimination claim, arguing that Dang fails to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Solar Turbines analyzes Dang's claim under the tripartite burden-shifting framework set [*22]  forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), as a Title VII claim. (Defendant's Memorandum, 1-13.) As noted above in Footnote 1, claims for discrimination based on disability arise only under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. However, the McDonnell Douglas framework has been applied by the courts to the analysis of ADA discrimination claims, therefore Solar Turbines discussion remains pertinent.
To state a claim under the ADA, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) he is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is a qualified individual, meaning that with or without reasonable accommodation, he can perform the essential functions of his job; and (3) the employer terminated him because of his disability. Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing Kennedy v. Applause, 90 F.3d 1477, 1481 (9th Cir. 1996)). Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination by providing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Snead v. Metropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1092 (9th Cir. 2001). If the employer satisfies its burden, the burden then shifts to the employee to demonstrate that the employer's proffered explanation is pretextual. Id.
Solar Turbines does not address whether Dang satisfies the three elements [*23]  required to establish a prima facie case. The Court finds that Dang has not met his burden. The evidence currently before the Court demonstrates that Dang was disabled during the period of alleged discrimination. In addition, the evidence demonstrates that Dang could have performed the essential functions of his position with reasonable accommodations. Solar Turbines explains that during his extended medical leave, restructuring took place and Dang's former position was eliminated company-wide. Therefore, Solar Turbines could not reinstate him as a Technical Information Specialist, and human resources representatives assisted Dang with finding and applying for other positions at the company. (See Decl'n. of Barbara Burton ¶¶ 5-6.) Solar Turbines contends that even if Dang's former position had existed and been available, his permanent medical restrictions would have prevented Dang from performing essential functions of the job. As a Technical Information Specialist, Dang was required to walk around the production area, or shop floor, and review products for the development of technical drawings. (Jaykell Decl'n. ¶ 7.) The company accommodated Dang's medical conditions prior to his [*24]  leave of absence by providing a chair for him on the shop floor and ladders to assist in climbing products for inspection. However, upon being cleared to return to work, Solar Turbines' medical department classified Dang as limited permanently to sedentary work only in eight hour shifts. The medical review states that Dang was "unable to return to previous job." (Defendant's Motion, Ex. 26.) Dang could not perform the essential functions of his former position even with reasonable accommodations. However, this is not the end of the inquiry. Reassignments to vacant positions can be reasonable accommodations under the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B).
Solar Turbines submits evidence that alternate jobs were available at the company which Dang could have performed with his permanent medical restrictions. Dang informed the human resources representatives that he would need a position where he could sit 75 to 80 percent of the time and he would be unable to stand or walk without taking breaks, acknowledging that he could not perform the essential functions of his former position or a position with equivalent physical requirements. (Dang Deposition, Defendant's Ex. 35, 20-21.) In an effort to procure a new position [*25]  for Dang so that he could continue his active employment with the company, Solar Turbines' human resources department assisted Dang during the period of alleged discrimination in finding another position.
Although Dang satisfies the first and second required elements of a prima facie case, he does not satisfy the third element, that Solar Turbines asked him to resign based on his disability. Solar Turbines offers evidence establishing that Dang failed to seek or obtain a position at the company for which he was qualified despite ample assistance from human resources and a period of several years in which to do so. (See, e.g., Jaykell and Burton Decl'ns., attached in support of Defendant's motion.) Solar Turbines offers the testimony of multiple employees in supervisory positions who reviewed Dang's application for various positions within the company, all of whom state that he was either not qualified for the position or he was not the most qualified applicant. (See, e.g, Decl'n. of Hector Andrade ¶¶ 6-7; Decl'n. of Kevin Brady ¶¶ 6-7; Decl'n. of Angel Enriquez ¶ 4.) With respect to positions for which Dang clearly was qualified, he refused to apply. (Burton Decl'n. ¶ 7; Jaykell Decl'n [*26] . ¶¶ 12-13.)
Dang only offers statements in his opposition to Solar Turbine's motion that constitute unfounded, unsupported conclusions. Conclusory statements without factual support are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. National Steel Corp. v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., 121 F.3d 496, 502 (9th Cir. 1997). Further, "[a] plaintiff's belief that a defendant acted from an unlawful motive, without evidence to support that belief, is no more than speculation or unfounded accusation about whether the defendant really did act from an unlawful motive.
To be cognizable on summary judgment, evidence must be competent." Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School District, 237 F.3d 1026, 1028 (9th Cir. 2001). The type of conclusory allegations employed by Dang in his opposition merely frame the issue of discrimination based on disability, but do not create a genuine issue of triable fact to defeat summary judgment. Radobenko v. Automated Equipment Corp., 520 F.2d 540, 543 (9th Cir. 1975). As such, Dang has not carried "the initial burden of offering evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on a discriminatory criterion," Fong v. American Airlines, Inc., 626 F.2d 759, 762 (9th Cir. 1980) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original), and the Court GRANTS Solar Turbines' motion for summary judgment as to Dang's disability discrimination claim.

ii) Retaliation Claim
In his June 21, 2006 EEOC Charge, Dang contends that Solar Turbines asked him to resign in [*27]  retaliation for "opposing an act of discrimination because of my medical condition; trying to enforce my rights of fair employment; and complaining about their actions." Dang also asserts he was retaliated against "for opposing an unlawful practice in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 503(a)." (Plaintiff's EEOC Charge of Discrimination.) Defendant argues that Dang cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation, and therefore summary judgment should be granted as to this claim.
To prove a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he was subject to adverse action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. See Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir. 2003) (ADA employment retaliation case). When analyzing the elements of an ADA retaliation claim, it is appropriate to look to Title VII cases for guidance. See, e.g., Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 389 F.3d 840, 850 & n.5 (9th Cir. 2004) (borrowing, in an ADA case, the definition of an "adverse employment action" from a Title VII case, Ray v. Henderson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1243 (9th Cir. 2000), and noting that "a retaliation claim under the ADA is analyzed under the same framework" as a Title VII claim). "Protected activity" includes objecting [*28]  to an action that is prohibited by the ADA.
Under the ADA, an adverse action is one that is "reasonably likely to deter [individuals] from engaging in protected activity." Pardi, 389 F.3d at 850 (ADA employment retaliation case) (quotation marks omitted); see also Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) (concluding that, in a Title VII employment retaliation case, a cognizable adverse action is one that "must be harmful to the point that [it] could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination"). Adverse action must be sufficiently material, i.e., it must be "non-trivial" in nature. White, 548 U.S. at 70. As to causation, a plaintiff must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a causal link between his protected activity and an adverse action. According to the terms of the statute, liability only arises when adverse action was taken "because" the plaintiff engaged in protected activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The adverse action must be based on a retaliatory motive. Poland, 494 F.3d at 1180.
With respect to the first element, Dang must show that he engaged in a protected activity. The ADA prohibits discrimination because an "individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge" under the ADA. [*29]  42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). For an individual's activity to be protected, he or she must have opposed an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA, or "made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing" under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). A protected activity ranges from filing formal charges to voicing informal complaints to superiors. See Hertz v. Luzenac America, Inc., 370 F.3d 1014, 1015 (10th Cir. 2004) (Title VII case). Dang cites to an October 2003 letter he authored to human resources representative Scott Jaykell and his June 21, 2006 EEOC Charge. Generally, the filing of an EEOC Charge satisfies this element. Dang filed his EEOC Charge because he was asked to resign. He filed his EEOC Charge on June 21, 2006 after he met with human resources on May 11, 2006. As such, Dang cannot satisfy the third element requiring that the adverse employment decision be caused by the protected activity. Solar Turbines literally did not and could not have asked Dang to resign in retaliation for filing his Charge of Discrimination over a month later. The timing of an adverse employment action alone may establish causation when the adverse employment action follows closely in time to the protected activity. See, e.g., Miller v. Fairchild Indus., 885 F.2d 498, 505 (9th Cir. 1989) (sufficient evidence to establish [*30]  prima facie case of causation where adverse actions occurred less than sixty days after EEOC hearing); Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding that evidence was sufficient to establish causation where adverse actions occurred less than three months after employee filed complaint). When the sequence of events is reversed, it becomes impossible for a plaintiff to establish the requisite causal connection.
In addition, even if the Court finds Dang's October 2003 letter to Scott Jaykell qualifies as a protected activity, Dang still cannot establish a causal connection. The letter predates the adverse employment action by two and a half years. Subsequent to receiving the letter, Solar Turbines allowed Dang to take an extended medical leave of absence and while on leave, assisted Dang in his efforts to return to work in a different department when his leave terminated. (See, e.g, Defendant's Motion, Ex. 20 (email from Dang to Jaykell thanking him for his assistance.) Dang was not asked to resign until May 11, 2006, during which time Solar Turbines' human resources department actively endeavored to keep him on the company payroll. The evidence before the Court demonstrates conclusively that Solar Turbines harbored no discriminatory [*31]  motive and did not retaliate against Dang based on his disability.
Because Dang cannot meet his burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation based on disability, the Court GRANTS Solar Turbines' motion for summary judgment as this claim.

iii) Failure to Accommodate
Unlawful discrimination under the ADA includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" includes "modifications or adjustment to the work environment, or the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that job." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1).
The Ninth Circuit has explained:
"[T]he duty to accommodate is a continuing duty that is not exhausted by one effort. . . . [I]f a reasonable accommodation turns out to be ineffective and the employee with a disability remains unable to perform an essential function, the employer must consider whether there would be an alternative reasonable accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship. Thus, the employer's obligation to engage in the interactive [*32]  process extends beyond the first attempt at accommodation and continues when the employee asks for a different accommodation or where the employer is aware that the initial accommodation is failing and further accommodation is needed."
Hummphrey Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F. 3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001).
Solar Turbines presents ample evidence demonstrating that human resources representatives engaged in a ongoing dialogue with Dang regarding his medical issues and resulting disabilities. Prior to his extended medical leave of absence, Dang received reasonable accommodations to assist in performing the functions of his position as a Technical Information Specialist. During his leave of absence, Solar Turbines remained in communication with Dang via letter, email, and telephone regarding his medical status and his expressed desire to transfer departments. Once Dang received his medical clearance, human resources representatives worked with him for months trying to help him find a suitable position in the company so he could remain in Solar Turbines' employment. The evidence further reveals that Dang eschewed Solar Turbines' assistance, by refusing to apply for positions for which he was qualified and could perform with his restrictions and eventually by [*33]  failing to seek any employment with the company at all. Dang's desire to transfer departments and his preference for certain positions over others does not negate Solar Turbines' efforts but rather establishes his resistance and unwillingness to be accommodated in any number of reasonable manners.
Solar Turbines' extension of Dang's medical leave accommodated his disability while he was temporarily and totally disabled. "In appropriate circumstances, reasonable accommodation can include providing the employee accrued paid leave or additional unpaid leave for treatment." Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1999) 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487. However, leave is sufficient only if other accommodations would be ineffective:
"[T]he leave accommodation is qualified. As long as a reasonable accommodation available to the employer could have plausibly enabled a handicapped employee to adequately perform his job, an employer is liable for failing to attempt that accommodation. In sum, a finite leave of absence has been considered to be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, provided it is likely that following the leave the employee would be able to perform his or her duties."
Id. As soon as physicians cleared Dang to return to work and defined the parameters [*34]  of his permanent restrictions, Solar Turbines human resources department actively assisted Dang in locating and applying for positions at the company that could accommodate his disability. Dang presents no evidence to the contrary. His own deposition testimony reveals that he believes Solar Turbines reasonably accommodated his disabilities. (Defendant's Motion, Ex. 35, 46.)
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Solar Turbines' motion for summary judgment as to this claim.

3. Additional Claims
Dang's remaining causes of action include "malicious practices of employment," "back and front pay discrimination in employment," and intentional infliction of emotional distress ("IIED"). Solar Turbines moves for summary judgment as to all three claims, arguing that the first two claims are not legally recognized causes of action and the IIED claim is preempted by California's worker compensation scheme. The Court agrees. Dang's malicious practice claim is not cognizable as an independent claim. Back pay and front pay are issues of damages and require an underlying finding of discrimination or other liability on the part of the defendant. There is no such finding in this case, therefore Dang is not entitled [*35]  to the requested compensation. Dang's state law IIED claim is preempted by California's labor laws. Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Prot. Dist., 43 Cal. 3d 148, 163, 233 Cal. Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743 (Cal. 1987).
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Solar Turbines' motion for summary judgment as these three claims.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff Charlie T. Dang's motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint and GRANTS Defendant Solar Turbines Inc.'s motion for summary judgment in its entirety.
This order disposes of all remaining claims. Accordingly, the Court ORDERS the Clerk of Court to enter judgment in favor of Defendants, close the case file, and terminate this case.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
