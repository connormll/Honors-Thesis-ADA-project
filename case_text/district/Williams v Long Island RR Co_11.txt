MEMORANDUM & ORDER
VITALIANO, D.J.,
On March 27, 2012 plaintiff John Williams filed the instant complaint against his former employer, the Long Island Railroad Company ("LIRR"), alleging discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12112-17 ("ADA"), New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL") and New York City Human Rights Law ("NYCHRL"). Following discovery, by its motion of January 31, 2014, defendant seeks summary judgment on all claims. For the reasons discussed below, defendant's motion is granted.

Background
Williams began working for LIRR in January 1985, first as a "third rail helper," and then, beginning in August 1988, as an electrician.1 Williams worked continuously for LIRR as an electrician for 17 years, until May 2005, when he suffered a back injury while [*2]  on the job, and was placed on sick leave. On March 23, 2006, plaintiff's doctor, Meeru Sathi-Welsch, submitted a report to LIRR, which indicated that plaintiff remained unable to work as an electrician and likely would never be able to return to this position. (Rule 56.1 Statement, ¶ 6.) About a year later, on March 30, 2007, Williams did return to work, albeit on a "light duty assignment" that involved answering the phone. That position was not a full-time LIRR position, but rather a temporary position for individuals such as Williams returning from injury. (Id. at ¶¶ 7-9.)
Approximately 5 months later, on August 14, 2007, another of plaintiff's treating physicians, Chris Lutz, submitted a report to LIRR advising that Williams was not able to return to duty, and likely would never be able to return to duty as an electrician. (Rule 56.1 Statement, Ex. G.) However, eight days later, in a complete about-face, Dr. Lutz submitted a new report indicating that Williams would be able to return to work as an electrician without [*3]  restriction beginning on September 5, 2007. (Id. Ex. H.) Williams then requested LIRR to restore him to his prior job as electrician, but the railroad refused, citing concerns about Williams's medical condition. As a result of this uncertainty, at the request of plaintiffs union, a new doctor, Joseph Stubel, examined plaintiff; that examination was conducted on September 21, 2007. (Id. ¶ 14.) Dr. Stubel reported that the "physical exam does not indicate any specific restriction from ability to do work including heavy work such as an electrician," but that Williams's "past history and his medical records . . . indicate that he would have a possibility of recurrent back injuries," and, therefore, he opined that Williams "cannot do this job [] which include[s] lifting up to 70lbs without running the high risk of re-injury." (Id., Ex. J at 3.) As a result of this assessment, LIRR notified Williams that he was disqualified from working as an electrician. (Id. ¶ 17.)
Following notice of disqualification, Williams continued to entreat LIRR that he could work as an electrician without restriction. He also made some effort to obtain a different job with the railroad that did not entail the same physical [*4]  challenges, though the extent of his efforts is disputed. In that regard, Williams contends that he spoke with LIRR's human resources director, Michael Nersesian, about a "train information position," and that be applied, and interviewed for this position. (Id. ¶¶ 22-24.) Nersesian, however, testified that he did not recall ever speaking to Williams about such a position; LIRR claims to have no documents indicating Williams ever applied for this position (or that such a position even existed). Discovery in this case has revealed no record confirming such dialogue. (Rule 56.1 Statement, ¶ 25; Rule 56.1 Counter-Statement ¶ 46.) Williams also claims that, at some undefined point, he spoke to his supervisor, John Collins, about re-assignment, but was told "We don't have a job for you." (Williams Depo. at 80.) In any event, on September 28, 2007, LIRR removed Williams from his temporary position working "light duty," which he had been doing since March 30 of that year. (Rule 56.1 Counter-Statement, ¶ 54.)
On December 11, 2007 plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to LIRR stating that Williams "is ready, willing and able to return to work with no restrictions" and conveyed Williams's request that LIRR re-instate him as [*5]  an electrician or, in the alternative, re-assign him to a "light duty" job. (Rule 56.1 Statement, Ex. P.) There is no record of any written response from LIRR. Approximately 10 months later, on October 1, 2008, Williams officially retired from LIRR and began receiving his pension. Next, on November 5, 2008, Williams requested disability from the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board ("RRB"). (Id. Ex Q.) In that application, Williams indicated that "[d]ue to my medical conditions listed herein, I can no longer perform my job as an electrician." (Id.) The record is empty regarding whether RBB granted this application.
Williams filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on July 21, 2008, alleging LIRR discriminated against him by terminating him due to his disability. On January 4, 2012, EEOC indicated that it was "unable to conclude" that Williams was discriminated against, and issued him a right-to-sue letter. (Rule 56.1 Counter-Statement, Ex. 12.) Williams then initiated the instant action, on March 27, 2012, alleging "unlawful termination" in violation of the ADA, NYCHRL and NYCHRL.

Standard of Review
A federal district court must grant summary judgment upon motion and finding, based on the [*6]  pleadings, depositions, interrogatory answers, admissions, affidavits, and all other admissible evidence that "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir. 2004). In determining whether the moving party has met this burden, a court must construe all evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, resolving all ambiguities and inferences in its favor. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Gibbs-Alfano v. Burton, 281 F.3d 12, 18 (2d Cir. 2002). However, "the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48 (emphasis in original); Burt Rigid Box, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Corp., 302 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Material facts are those which, given the substantive law, might affect the suit's outcome. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
If the moving party makes a prima facie showing that there are no genuine issues of material fact, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and put forth "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; Davis v. New York, 316 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2002). In so doing, the nonmoving party may not rely on conclusory allegations [*7]  or speculation. Golden Pac. Bancorp v. FDIC, 375 F.3d 196, 200 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing D'Amico v. City of New York, 132 F.3d 145, 149 (2d Cir.1998)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 ("Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein."). Thus, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586). Nonetheless, the nonmoving party need not make a compelling showing; it need merely show that reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the proffered evidence. R.B. Ventures, Ltd. V. Shane, 112 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 1997).
Employment discrimination claims at summary judgment are subject to a more particularized analytic—the familiar burden-shifting test set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Applying that standard, a plaintiff must set forth a prima facie case for discrimination, after which the employer must offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision; at that point, the burden shifts back to the employee to establish that the proferred reason is pretextual. Defendant's motion is tested by this standard.

Analysis

I. ADA Claim
ADA prohibits "discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability [*8]  in regard to discharge of employees." McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Manufacturing Co., 583 F.3d 92, 96 (2d Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted). Applying McDonnell-Douglas, "[i]n order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA a plaintiff must show (a) that his employer is subject to the ADA, (b) that be is disabled within the meaning of the ADA or perceived to be so by his employer, (c) that he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (d) that he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability." Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 134 (2d Cir. 2008.) Further, "[d]iscrimination in violation of the ADA includes, inter alia, not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." McBride at *96 (quotations omitted).
Defendant contends, firstly, that Williams was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA, pointing out that Williams repeatedly proclaimed himself fit to continue working as an electrician with no restrictions. The ADA defines disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." [*9]  42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). In that regard, LIRR emphasizes that Williams "had no difficultly standing, walking, lifting, socializing, or eating." At the same time, LIRR appears not to contest that Williams could not "walk a distance of longer than a half mile." (Def. Mem. of Law at 7.) Quite clearly, defendant's current contention that Williams was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA is totally at odds with LIRR's position at the time of his termination, when it specifically cited Williams's injuries as the reason why he could not work as an electrician. Indeed, the post-litigation swapping of positions by the parties, seems more than anything else, an attempt by LIRR to state some sort of estoppel theory—that Williams at the time of the alleged adverse consequence claimed not to be disabled and is estopped from claiming otherwise now. It is unavailing. Dispositively, an individual is disabled under ADA when he is "regarded as having an impairment." See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(C). Further, as discussed above, the relevant inquiry is whether an individual "is disabled within the meaning of the ADA or perceived to be so by his employer." Brady at *14 (emphasis added); Ar-Malik Spencer v. Constr. & Gen. Bldg. Laborers, Local 79, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41479, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). Obviously, LIRR perceived Williams to be too disabled to perform the [*10]  job requirements of an electrician, and LIRR's current, litigation-driven argument to the contrary, is without merit.
LIRR's second contention—that Williams fails to show he was "qualified" for any existing LIRR position with or without reasonable accommodation—is more convincing. Williams retorts that he has always remained qualified for the position of electrician because his back injury in no way impaired his performance. (Pl. Mem. of Law at 17-18.) With that premise, Williams takes the position that no "accommodation" on the part of the railroad was even necessary. This position cannot be squared with the conclusions of Dr. Stubel and Dr. Sathi-Welsch or, even more significantly, with Williams's own statements in his disability application, in which he admitted that "I can no longer perform my job as an electrician." (Rule 56.1 Statement, Ex. Q.) Confronted with his own words, plaintiff has offered no explanation for the inconsistencies between his RBB benefits application and his current contention that he could always perform the duties of an electrician without any accommodation. His failure to do so is fatal to his claim. See Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (plaintiff must "proffer a sufficient explanation" for "contradiction [*11]  that arises out of the . . . disability claim.")2
Further, and still more damagingly, plaintiff admits that he did not attempt to engage with LIRR about the possibility of modifying the job responsibilities of the electrician position or seeking an entirely different position with LIRR (with whatever terms and conditions normally attend to such positions) in light of his injury, but instead consistently represented that he remained able to perform all of the listed responsibilities of that position. (Pl. Mem. of Law at 17-18.) This fact undercuts the notion that LIRR failed to make an effort to reasonably accommodate his disability. Williams argues, notwithstanding, that Second Circuit case law places on LIRR the responsibility for initiating an "interactive process" of discussing potential accommodations with Williams. (Id. at 17.) However, the Second Circuit has actually held that "an employer's failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process does not form the basis of a claim [*12]  under the ADA and evidence therefor does not allow a plaintiff to avoid summary judgment unless [he] also establishes that, at least with some identified accommodation, [he] was qualified for the position at issue." McBride at 101. Because Williams fails to establish, even at the first step, that he was qualified for the electrician position, his "interactive process" claim fails.
Williams's argument that LIRR should have re-assigned him to a different position is similarly unavailing. "An ADA plaintiff does not satisfy [his] burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that [his] employer could have reassigned [him]. Instead, [he] must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which she could have been reassigned." McBride at 97. The identified position "must be one for which [he] was qualified" and "cannot be such that reassignment would have involved a promotion." Id. at 98. Although Williams claims that he interviewed for a "train information position," his recollection is notably unsubstantiated by any other record evidence and, in any event, he provides no evidence that he was qualified for that alleged position. [*13]  Nor is there any evidence that there was a vacancy in such a railroad position at the relevant time. Similarly, although plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to LIRR in December 2007 claiming that many "light duty" positions were available, there is not a scintilla of record evidence supporting that assertion. Because Williams has failed to produce any evidence that he was "qualified to perform the essential functions" of any existing, vacant position within the railroad, either with or without reasonable accommodation, his ADA claim fails at the first step as a matter of law. It is dismissed.
II. NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims
Williams claims unlawful termination under both the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. In their briefing, the parties primarily address the timeliness of Williams's state law claims, and not their underlying merit. The unsettled issue of state law that is raised might dispose of these claims at threshold.3 Though the Court, through the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction, has the authority to entertain these claims, it declines to do so. Hayward v. City of New York, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127357, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. 2013); 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment is granted to defendants on the ADA claim. It is dismissed with prejudice. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's remaining state law claims. They are dismissed without prejudice and with leave to replead in a state court of appropriate jurisdiction.
The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly and to close this case.
SO ORDERED.
