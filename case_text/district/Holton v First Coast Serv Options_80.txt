Opinion



ORDER
Pro se Plaintiff Felicia Holton filed this action alleging that Defendants Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida ("BCBSF") and First Coast Service Options, Inc. ("FCSO") engaged in unlawful employment practices. BCBSF moves to dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 48), and FCSO and BCBSF jointly move for summary judgment or, in the alternative, partial summary judgment as to damages (Doc. 53). Plaintiff opposes both motions. (Docs. 50, 54.)1

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint alleges disparate treatment and denial of reasonable accommodation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended,2 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. ("ADA"), and interference/retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. ("FMLA"). (Doc. 46.)
Plaintiff alleges that in January 2013, while employed by FCSO as a Medicare Provider Enrollment Analyst, she [*2]  requested and was approved for FMLA leave for a period ending March 25, 2013. She received a brief extension and returned to work on March 27, 2013, but failed to notify her supervisor or the human resources department that she was returning. Upon her return, Plaintiff produced a letter from her chiropractor stating that she could only return to work on a limited schedule of four hours per day, for two weeks.
Later that day, representatives of FCSO's Employee Relations and Employee Benefits departments met with Plaintiff and her supervisor and advised Plaintiff that under FCSO's company policy, she could not return to work on a reduced schedule without a letter from a physician. Because Plaintiff's chiropractor did not have a physician on staff, FCSO determined that Plaintiff did not have the requisite authorization to return to work with restrictions. Plaintiff inquired about other available positions, and was told she could visit the BCBSF website and the Employee Relations representative would assist her; however, Plaintiff never did. Instead, on April 1, 2013, Plaintiff informed her supervisor that she was getting a letter from a physician. On April 2, 2013, Plaintiff contacted [*3]  the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division and learned that a chiropractor's letter was sufficient, and therefore never obtained a letter from a physician.
Following Plaintiff's call, Wage and Hour Division personnel contacted Plaintiff's supervisor, and on April 5, 2013, a BCBSF attorney contacted the Wage and Hour technician, acknowledged awareness of FMLA regulations, and informed the technician that the situation would be resolved quickly. On April 9, 2013, the BCBSF attorney informed the Wage and Hour technician that they would contact Plaintiff and inform her that she could return to work. The technician contacted Plaintiff to relay this information, but Plaintiff responded that she wanted punitive damages in addition to compensation for days missed.
Thus, beginning on April 5, 2013, only a few days after informing Plaintiff that it needed documentation from a physician, FCSO personnel began attempting to contact Plaintiff, first by phone, and eventually by certified mail, to inform her that she could return to work on the reduced schedule without additional documentation. FCSO personnel tried to contact Plaintiff at least three times by phone, and once by certified letter. [*4]  The certified letter dated April 19, 2013 informed Plaintiff that if she did not return to work by April 30, 2013, her employment would be terminated. However, the phone calls were not answered, the voice messages were not returned, and the certified letter was returned as undeliverable. Plaintiff maintains that no one ever contacted her, despite confirming that at least one of the phone numbers and the address at which Defendants attempted to contact her were correct. She concedes, however, that she knew from the Wage and Hour contact on April 9, 2013 that someone from FCSO would be contacting her to inform her that she could return to work, but she denies that she was contacted. She admits that she never made any effort to contact her employer after March 27, 2013. When Plaintiff did not return to work by the April 30, 2013 deadline, FCSO terminated her employment.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Summary judgment is proper "when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., 662 F.3d 1292, 1314 (11th Cir. 2011); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c). The inquiry [*5]  is "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The movant bears the burden of showing the absence of dispute as to material facts, and upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to establish that a genuine dispute exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The evidence must be viewed in favor of the non-moving party, and all inferences drawn in her favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255. "Rule 56 mandates the entry of summary judgment, upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to [her] case on which [she] bears the burden of proof at trial." Schechter v. Ga. State Univ., 341 F. App'x 560, 562 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).

III. ANALYSIS

A. ADA
The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint alleges that as a result of a motor vehicle accident in 2008, she has been diagnosed with a back impairment that substantially limits her ability to perform activities of daily living and therefore qualifies as an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. (Doc. 46 at 5.) Plaintiff alleges ADA violations based on both disparate treatment and denial [*6]  of reasonable accommodation.

1. Disparate treatment
Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, an employee's ADA disparate treatment claim is analyzed under the familiar McDonnell Douglas 3 framework. Caporicci v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 3d 1314, 2016 WL 3033502, at *5 (M.D. Fla. May 27, 2016) (citing Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004)). The plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment under the ADA by showing that she has a disability, is a "qualified individual," and was discriminated against because of her disability. Id. If the plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to offer a non-discriminatory reason for her termination, following which the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the proffered reason is pretextual. Id.
Plaintiff has not established that she is disabled or that she is a qualified individual. She offers only conclusory statements that, "[a]s a result of [her] back impairment and related treatments, at all relevant times [she] was an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA . . . ."; "Defendants was [sic] aware that [she] had a record of such impairment"; and "[a]t all relevant times, [she] was a qualified individual with a disability within the [*7]  meaning of the ADA." (Doc. 46 at 5 ¶¶ 20, 21, 24.) She offers no evidence to support these statements. Furthermore, despite alleging that she is disabled, Plaintiff attached to her Second Amended Complaint a document from FCSO's third party administrator showing that her request for short term disability during the relevant time period was denied. (See Doc. 46 at 15; Holton Dep. 27:4-12.4 ) Plaintiff's failure to show that she has a disability alone mandates summary judgment.
Even assuming that Plaintiff could show that she is a qualified person with a disability, "[t]o establish unlawful disparate treatment, a plaintiff generally must demonstrate that [her] employer treated similarly situated employees outside of [her] protected class more favorably than [she] was treated." Wolfe v. Postmaster General, 488 F. App'x 465, 468 (11th Cir. 2012)5 (citing Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., 447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir. 2006)); see Caporicci, 189 F. Supp. 3d 1314, 2016 WL 3033502, at *6 ("In the disparate-discipline context, a plaintiff typically satisfies her burden under the third element by showing that a non-disabled employee, or 'comparator,' engaged in a similar work rule violation but was treated more favorably."). Plaintiff's failure to identify a comparator or offer any evidence that other employees were treated more favorably is fatal to her disparate treatment claim.6

2. Denial of reasonable accommodation
"An employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer fails to provide 'reasonable accommodations' for the disability . . . ." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir. 2001). "To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) [she] is disabled; (2) [she] is a qualified individual; and (3) [she] was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." McKane v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 363 F. App'x 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255). For the reasons stated in part III.A.1, supra, Plaintiff has not shown that she is a qualified individual with a disability.
However, even if she could make such a showing, Plaintiff's claim would again fail on the third prong. "As to the third element needed to establish a prima facie case, a qualified individual is unlawfully discriminated against if the employer does not make reasonable accommodations for the disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer." Knowles v. Sheriff, 460 F. App'x 833, 835 (11th Cir. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). An employer meets its burden [*9]  to accommodate a plaintiff's disability where the employer attempted to accommodate the employee, but the employee's own actions were responsible for the communication breakdown. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286-87 (11th Cir. 1997) (summary judgment was appropriate because "[l]iability simply cannot arise under the ADA where an employer does not obstruct an informal process; makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possesses; and the employee's actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process."); see also E.E.O.C. v. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc., 774 F.3d 127, 133-34 (1st Cir. 2014) (summary judgment against EEOC was warranted because "when an employer initiates an interactive dialogue in good faith with an employee for the purpose of discussing potential reasonable accommodations for the employee's disability, the employee must engage in a good-faith effort to work out potential solutions with the employer prior to seeking judicial redress. Manning did not do so in this case, and therefore, the EEOC has failed 'to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [its] case . . . .'" (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322) (alteration in original)).
FCSO's conduct does not demonstrate a failure to accommodate. When Plaintiff was initially [*10]  told that she needed a physician's approval for work restrictions, FCSO personnel told Plaintiff that she could check the BCBSF website for other available positions and that FCSO personnel would assist her; however, she chose not to. Then, within days of Plaintiff informing FCSO of her need for a limited work schedule, FCSO determined that Plaintiff could return to work on the reduced schedule without additional documentation.
Plaintiff concedes that she was not told that she could not come back to work even if she got a letter from a physician. (Holton Dep. 83:25-84:2.) Indeed, after learning that a chiropractor's letter was sufficient, employees from FCSO made multiple attempts to contact Plaintiff to inform her that she could return to work. (See Doc. 53-1 at 6 (Declaration of Carol Cornelius) ("I was later advised that Ms. Holton would be permitted to return to work with only a chiropractor's letter. Accordingly, on April 5, 2013, I called Ms. Holton at (904) 387-2672 and left a message on her answering machine that she could return to work and would not be required to submit a return to work letter from a medical doctor."); id. at 6-7 ("When we received no response from Ms. Holton, I wrote [*11]  a letter and provided it to Hazel Godbolt to be sent under her signature since Ms. Godbolt was Ms. Holton's supervisor. . . . It gave Ms. Holton until April 30, 2013 to return to work. The letter was sent by certified mail, but it was returned as undelivered . . . ."); id. at 13-14 (Declaration of Hazel Godbolt) ("On April 9, 2013, I was instructed to call Ms. Holton at home to advise her that she could return to work without any additional paperwork. Accordingly, I called Ms. Holton at (904) 387-2672, and at (904) 592-7126. At both of these numbers I left voicemail messages advising Ms. Holton that she could return to work without any further documentation. When we had no response from Ms. Holton, I sent a letter by certified mail on April 19, 2013 directing her to report to work by April 30, 2013.").)
Despite the FCSO employees' testimony, and Plaintiff conceding that the telephone number FCSO employees called and the address to which they sent the certified letter were correct, Plaintiff maintains (somewhat dubiously) that she never received the numerous messages or the letter. (Holton Dep. 8:13-20, 10:19-23, 11:7-9, 54:16-59:20.) However, Plaintiff did admit that even after becoming aware from [*12]  the Wage and Hour technician that FCSO was trying to contact her to inform her that she could return to work without additional documentation, she never attempted to contact FCSO. (Holton Dep. 52:14-20; Holton Dep. 99:2-7 ("If you picked up the phone and called [FCSO] and had a conversation with the employee relations department, you would not have missed more than a few days [sic] worth of work, would you?" "A: I guess.").) Thus, her own actions were responsible for any breakdown in communication with her employer. In light of FCSO's efforts to return her to work and Plaintiff's failure to participate in the interactive process, as a matter of law Plaintiff has not shown that FCSO failed to provide a reasonable accommodation.

B. FMLA
The Eleventh Circuit recognizes two types of claims alleging interference with FMLA rights under § 2615(a): (1) interference claims, in which an employee alleges that her employer denied or otherwise interfered with her substantive FMLA rights; and (2) retaliation claims, in which an employee alleges that her employer discriminated against her because she engaged in protected activity. Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Healthcare Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006). Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint alleges both FMLA interference and retaliation. [*13] 

1. Interference
"To demonstrate interference, the employee need only show that [her] employer interfered with or denied [her] an FMLA benefit to which [she] was entitled, not that the employer intended to interfere with or deny an FMLA benefit." McCarroll v. Somerby of Mobile, LLC, 595 F. App'x 897, 900 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir. 2001)).
Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff was permitted to take the full amount of FMLA leave to which she was entitled, and Plaintiff requested and was granted an extension of the original FMLA leave period. (See Holton Dep. 83:2-12.) Thus, Plaintiff has not shown that FCSO interfered with an FMLA benefit. See de la Cruz v. Children's Trust of Miami-Dade Cnty., 843 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1282-83 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (summary judgment in defendant's favor warranted as to plaintiff's FMLA interference and ADA accommodation claims where evidence showed all of plaintiff's FMLA leave requests were granted and the defendant accommodated the plaintiff's only ADA request). To the extent that Plaintiff is alleging interference with her FMLA right to reinstatement, such claim also fails; she was only entitled to the rights, benefits, or position of employment to which she would have been entitled absent the FMLA leave; FCSO could lawfully request certification from her health care provider that she was able to resume work. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2614(a)(1), (3), (4); see also 29 C.F.R. § 825.312(a).7 Accordingly, [*14]  she has not alleged a claim for interference with FMLA rights capable of surviving summary judgment.

2. Retaliation
To establish a claim for retaliation "an employee 'must demonstrate that [her] employer intentionally discriminated against [her] for exercising a right guaranteed under the FMLA.'" McCarroll, 595 F. App'x at 900 (citing Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Sch., 543 F.3d 1261, 1267-68 (11th Cir. 2008) ("Unlike an interference claim, an employee bringing a retaliation claim faces the increased burden of showing that [her] employer's actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus.")). To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must show either direct evidence of retaliation or establish a prima facie case of retaliation using circumstantial evidence. Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207.
Because there is no direct evidence of retaliation, [*15]  the McDonnell Douglas framework applies. Thus, to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the employee must show that: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Cmtys., Inc., 666 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2012). If a plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to offer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000). If the employer offers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, then the burden shifts back to the employee to show that the employer's proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation. Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir. 2004).
Here, Plaintiff engaged in protected activity; that is, she requested, was approved for, and took FMLA leave. It is undisputed that Plaintiff was terminated by FCSO. Thus, whether Plaintiff can state a prima facie case depends on whether there was a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination. "The causal connection element is satisfied if a plaintiff shows that the protected activity and the adverse action were 'not wholly unrelated.'" Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000)). "Generally, a plaintiff can show the two [*16]  events are not wholly unrelated if the plaintiff shows that the decisionmaker was aware of the protected conduct at the time of the adverse employment action." Id.
Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiff has shown a prima facie case, FCSO has identified Plaintiff's failure to report for work, which is a violation of the FCSO Standard of Conduct Policy, as the reason for her termination. (See Doc. 53 at 12; see also Doc. 53-1 at 10 (letter from FCSO to Plaintiff ordering her to report to work by April 30, 2013, and citing relevant portion of conduct policy of which she was in violation).) The Court will not second-guess an employer's proffered reason, so long as it is one that might motivate a reasonable employer. See Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comms., 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984), quoted in Bell v. Georgia Pacific Corp., 390 F. Supp. 2d 1182, 1190 n.61 (M.D. Fla. 2005) ("[An] employer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason."). Termination, pursuant to an employee conduct policy, based on the employee's failure to report to work, is reasonable. Accordingly, to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must show that the proffered reason is pretextual.
Plaintiff may establish pretext "either directly by [*17]  persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). FCSO has shown that its policy requires a return to work note from a treating physician when the employee seeks to return to work with restrictions. Moreover, FCSO promptly reconsidered its refusal to accept the chiropractor's note and offered Plaintiff reinstatement. Plaintiff simply declined to return to work. Thus, Plaintiff has not offered any evidence of pretext.8 She has failed to carry her burden of demonstrating a circumstantial case of retaliation, even under liberal pro se standards. See Oshodi v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 452 F. App'x 889, 890 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming district court's grant of summary judgment in defendant's favor in case alleging disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, retaliation, and interference under the ADA, Title VII, Rehabilitation Act, and FMLA; stating "[a]lthough we construe pro se briefs liberally, it is not the court's place to argue the appellant's case for them."); see also de la Cruz, 843 F. Supp. 2d at 1282-83 (summary judgment in defendant's favor warranted as to plaintiff's FMLA interference and ADA accommodation claims where evidence showed all of plaintiff's [*18]  FMLA leave requests were granted and the defendant accommodated the plaintiff's only ADA request).
Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED:
1. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. 53) is GRANTED.
2. The Clerk should enter summary final judgment in favor of First Coast Service Options, Inc. and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, and against Felicia Holton, and close the case.
DONE AND ORDERED in Jacksonville, Florida the 24th day of June, 2016.
