ORDER
AND NOW, this 11th day of June, 2020, upon consideration of Defendant Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (SEPTA) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint in Part (Doc. No. 16), Plaintiff Aaron Lett's response brief (Doc. No. 18), Defendant International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers, Transportation Division's (SMART) Motion to Dismiss Counts I, III, and IV of Plaintiff Aaron Lett's Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 19), Lett's response brief (Doc. No. 21), and Smart's amended reply brief (Doc. No. 26), the Court finds [*2]  as follows:
1. Lett worked as a bus driver for SEPTA from November 2015 to January 2018. (Doc. No. 5 at ¶¶ 29, 39.1 ) During that time, SEPTA used a seniority system to assign shifts to bus drivers, and when a driver could not report to an assigned shift because of illness, he was assessed sick leave points. (Id. at ¶¶ 33-34.) Once a driver accumulated more than 120 days of sick leave, he was effectively fired as a SEPTA employee. (Id. at ¶ 35.)
2. In May 2017, Lett was diagnosed with end-stage kidney failure and started receiving dialysis treatment three times a week. (Id. at ¶¶ 29-30.) After his diagnosis, Lett requested in writing that his work schedule be changed so that he could attend dialysis. (Id. at ¶ 32.) Under the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between SEPTA and SMART, disabled employees were to be "given consideration in assigning them to such duties, as they may be able to perform, along with other employees." (Id. at ¶ 41.) SMART also had authority to "control and adjust all seniority under the agreement." (Id. at ¶ 40.)
3. SEPTA did not alter Lett's schedule after his diagnosis, and it assigned him sick leave points for each day that he was unable to report to work [*3]  because of dialysis. (Id. at ¶ 36.) To prevent the continued accumulation of sick time, in September and October 2017, Lett submitted notes from his physician explaining that he needed to undergo dialysis while he waited for a transplant. (Id. at ¶ 37.) Once again, SEPTA did not change Lett's schedule, and it continued assigning him sick leave points on the days that he missed work to attend dialysis. (Id. at ¶ 38.) In January 2018, having exhausted all 120 days of sick leave, Lett was fired. (Id. at ¶ 39.)
4. Lett brings claims against SEPTA and SMART, for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12111 (ADA) (Count I), violation of the Pennsylvania Human Resources Act, 43 Pa. Stat. and Con. Stat. § 951 (PHRA) (Count III), and for bad faith breach of the CBA (Count IV). Lett also brings a claim for violation of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, against SEPTA only (Count II). Lett claims that he was fired because SEPTA failed "to grant him an appropriate accommodation" and SMART maliciously failed to "take appropriate action to enforce his right to an appropriate accommodation thereby aiding and abetting SEPTA's actions." (Id. at ¶ 43.)
5. SEPTA moves to dismiss Count IV of the amended complaint and Lett's request for punitive damages. (Doc. No. 16.) Lett agrees that the Court may [*4]  dismiss these claims with prejudice. (Doc. No. 18.) Therefore, SEPTA's motion is GRANTED, and Count IV of the amended complaint and Lett's request for punitive damages as against SEPTA are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
6. In a separate motion, SMART moves to dismiss Counts I, III, and IV of the amended complaint as against it. (Doc. No. 19.) In response, Lett asserts that the ADA claim in Count I is "brought against SEPTA only" and agrees that the breach of contract claim in Count IV is "redundant to his other claims against the Union and should be dismissed." (Doc. No. 21 at pp. 2, n.1 & 4, n.2.) Therefore, SMART's motion is GRANTED IN PART, and Counts I and IV as against SMART are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
7. That leaves only SMART's motion to dismiss Count III. The PHRA makes it unlawful for "any person, employer, employment agency or labor organization or employe[e] to aid [or] abet . . . the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice." 43 Pa. Stat. and Con. Stat. § 955(e) (emphasis added). Lett argues that SMART aided and abetted SEPTA in his discriminatory termination when it "malicious[ly] fail[ed] to take appropriate action to enforce his right to an appropriate accommodation." [*5]  (Doc. No. 5 at ¶ 43.)
8. "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. In the amended complaint, Lett alleges that under the CBA, SEPTA and SMART were required to consider Lett's disability in assigning his work duties, and SMART had the authority to control and adjust all seniority under the agreement. (Doc. No. 5 at ¶¶ 41-43, 56.) Despite that authority, SMART refused "to engage in the interactive process" with Lett, did not allow him to "work a schedule that would permit him to receive required lifesaving treatment for his end-stage kidney disease," and refused to "enforce [Lett's] right to an appropriate accommodation, thereby aiding and abetting SEPTA's actions." (Id. at ¶¶ 43, 56.) At this stage, that is enough to survive SMART's motion to dismiss. Cf. Murthy v. Indiana Univ. of Pa., No. 12-1194, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48081, 2013 WL 1363924 at *2 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 3, 2013) (denying motion to dismiss the plaintiff's aiding and abetting claim because she alleged that the [*6]  defendant's Director of Human Resources had the "authority to investigate and remedy alleged discrimination and pay disparities based upon race or other factors, but failed to do so even after [the plaintiff] complained to her about the discrepancy"); Sherif v. Astrazeneca, L.P., No. 00-CV-3285, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4255, 2001 WL 359958, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 5, 2001) ("Here, Sherif has sufficiently alleged that Stoner and Baldez were in supervisory positions and actively participated in his termination and Yuan was a supervisor who was made aware of and did not prevent Sherif's discriminatory demotion and termination.").
9. SMART argues that Lett's request for a different schedule was not a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law because it would have required that SEPTA and SMART violate a bona fide seniority system.2 (Doc. No. 21.) Lett responds that his request did not necessarily violate the seniority system because instead of allowing Lett to take shifts from senior drivers, SMART and SEPTA could have waived the sick leave policy as it applied to Lett. (Doc. No. 21 at p. 11.) In addition, even if Lett's accommodation did conflict with the seniority system, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff "remains free to present evidence of special circumstances that make 'reasonable' a seniority [*7]  rule exception in the particular case." U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 394 (2002), 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589.3 Broadly construing the amended complaint, as we must at this stage, the Court finds that Lett has sufficiently stated a claim for aiding and abetting under the PHRA against SMART and therefore, SMART's motion to dismiss as to Count III is DENIED.
For those reasons, it is ORDERED that SEPTA's partial motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 16) is GRANTED. Count IV of the amended complaint and Lett's request for punitive damages as against SEPTA are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that SMART's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 19) is GRANTED IN PART, and Counts I and IV of the amended complaint as against SMART are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. The remainder of SMART's motion is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED.
