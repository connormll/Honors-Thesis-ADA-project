Opinion



ORDER
Before the court are Plaintiff John Oirya's motion for leave to amend complaint (Doc. 34) and Defendant Mando America Corporation's response (Doc. 39).1 For the reasons set forth below, the motion for leave to amend the complaint is due to be denied.

I. Procedural Background
On September 3, 2019, Plaintiff John Oirya filed his initial complaint under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§12101 et seq., against Defendant Mando America Corporation, alleging that Defendant denied him a reasonable accommodation and retaliated against him, both in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 1, at 13, 15).2 On January 24, 2020, the court set April 9, 2020 as the deadline for amending the pleadings and October 26, 2020 as the discovery deadline. (Doc. 14, at 2). On September 14, 2020, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the discovery deadline [*2]  to November 26, 2020 (Doc. 16), which the court granted (Doc. 17). On November 24, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint (Doc. 20) to add claims for disparate treatment and wrongful termination under the ADA. Plaintiff asserted that the proposed amendment to the complaint was based upon newly discovered evidence received by Plaintiff during the November 17 and 18, 2020 depositions of Defendant's present and former senior human resource ("HR") officials. Id. at 2. Based upon the deposition testimony, Plaintiff also filed a new charge on January 25, 2021 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") alleging sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"). (Doc. 34-1, at 4). On March 1, 2021, Plaintiff's motion to amend was denied as untimely and for Plaintiff's failure to offer good cause for the delay, as Plaintiff did not establish why he did not diligently pursue the information he relied on as the basis of his motion to amend at an earlier date. (Doc. 31, at 1-2).
On March 14, 2021, Plaintiff filed a second motion for leave to amend the complaint, alleging additional claims involving sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that [*3]  he received disparate disciplinary treatment and was denied a reasonable accommodation, both on the basis of sex. See Doc. 34-7, at 15, 17. Plaintiff argues that the proposed amendment is based upon similarly situated comparator evidence supporting his new Title VII sex discrimination claim which Defendant disclosed to Plaintiff, for the first time, during the November 17, 2020 deposition of Defendant's witness, HR Manager Audie Swegman. (Doc. 34, at 1). Plaintiff asserts that the facts supporting his original ADA claims and his newly discovered Title VII claims arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence by Defendant as that set out in the original complaint, and because his ADA and Title VII claims relate back to the date of the original complaint they should be litigated together before this court. Id. at 5.
In response, Defendant contends that the comparator evidence relating to the Title VII claims is not newly discovered, as Plaintiff could have discovered this information before the April 9, 2020 amendment deadline, or at least knew about this information by April 17, 2020. (Doc. 39, at 2-3, 7, 9, 11, 14). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's motion should thus be [*4]  denied because he cannot show good cause for extending the deadline to amend his complaint and, even if he could show good cause, Plaintiff fails to establish that he did not act with undue delay in seeking to amend his complaint by waiting nearly 11 months after the amendment deadline and three months after the close of discovery. Id. at 2, 10-11. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff's motion to amend should be denied as futile because the claims are untimely and also would prejudice Defendant. Id. at 2, 10, 11, 15.

II. Legal Standard
"A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within: (A) 21 days after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). "In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). "An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when: the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence [*5]  set out or attempted to be set out -- in the original pleading . . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). "Rule 15(c) does not contemplate the addition of 'an entirely new claim based on a different set of facts.'" Farris v. United States, 333 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). However, "courts may deny a motion for leave to amend on numerous grounds, including undue delay, undue prejudice to the defendants, and futility of amendment." Donley v. City of Morrow, Georgia, 601 F. App'x 805, 810 (11th Cir. 2015); Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. King Bird Fireworks, LLC, No. 4:19-CV-0109, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232875, 2019 WL 9821777, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 27, 2019) ("A court thus may deny a motion to amend only if certain circumstances exist, including: (1) undue delay; (2) bad faith or dilatory motive; (3) repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed; (4) undue prejudice to the opposing party; or (5) futility of the amendment.") (citing Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Fla. Mowing & Landscape Serv., Inc., 556 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir. 2009)). "The futility threshold is akin to that for a motion to dismiss; thus, if the amended complaint could not survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny, then the amendment is futile and leave to amend is properly denied." Seacore Marine, LLC v. C & G Boat Works, Inc., No. CV 14-0596, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26972, 2016 WL 866347, at *1 (S.D. Ala. Mar. 3, 2016) (citing Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1320 (11th Cir. 1999)); Cone Fin. Grp., Inc. v. Emps. Ins. Co. of Wausau, 476 F. App'x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2012) ("If the complaint as amended would still be properly dismissed, then granting leave to amend is futile.").
Once a court "limits the time to amend pleadings in a scheduling order, the schedule may only be modified for 'good cause' and with the district court's consent." Donley, 601 F. App'x at 810 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4)). Thus, "[a] plaintiff seeking leave to amend its [*6]  complaint after the deadline designated in a scheduling order must demonstrate 'good cause' under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)." S. Grouts & Mortars, Inc. v. 3M Co., 575 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir. 2009). "A lack of diligence in pursuing a claim is sufficient to show a lack of good cause." Quinn v. Deutsche Bank Nat. Tr. Co., 625 F. App'x 937, 940 (11th Cir. 2015). "A plaintiff lacks diligence when, prior to the scheduling order deadline, he either (1) had full knowledge of the information with which he later sought to amend his complaint, or (2) failed to seek the information he needed to determine whether to amend the complaint." Donley v. City of Morrow, Georgia, 601 F. App'x 805, 811 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing S. Grouts & Mortars, 575 F.3d at 1241 n.3). "'Diligence, not lack of prejudice, is the touchstone of the Rule 16(b)(4) inquiry.'" TIC Park Ctr., 9 LLC v. Cabot, No. 16-24569-CIV, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221005, 2018 WL 4828435, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 28, 2018) (quoting Roberson v. BancorpSouth Bank, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130423, 2013 WL 4870839, at *1 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 12, 2013)); Jackson v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 593 F. App'x 871, 875 (11th Cir. 2014) ("Jackson claims that UPS would not be prejudiced because they already had conducted discovery and briefed the issues. Although this may be the case, it is not relevant to her failure to show good cause."). "This is not to say that prejudice is irrelevant in determining whether an amendment should be allowed. It simply means that if a party does not show diligence, 'the inquiry should end.'" Id. at * 4 (citation omitted); Norman v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., No. 4:19-CV-02132, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218157, 2021 WL 5196630, at *6 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 8, 2021). "It is only after the court addresses whether the proposed amendment may be granted under Rule 16 that the court is to determine whether it is proper under Rule 15." Nobles v. Rural Cmty. Ins. Servs., 303 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1283 (M.D. Ala. 2004) (citing Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., 133 F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir. 1998)); accord E.E.O.C. v. Exel Inc., 259 F.R.D. 652, 654 (N.D. Ga. 2008).

III. Discussion
In seeking to amend his complaint [*7]  by adding sex discrimination claims under Title VII, Plaintiff argues that the amendment is based upon similarly situated comparator evidence that Defendant disclosed to Plaintiff for the first time during Swegman's deposition on November 17, 2020. (Doc. 34, at 1). Plaintiff alleges that Swegman's testimony revealed that Swegman was the disciplinary manager or decision maker who directly received and handled the disciplinary charges of sleeping on the job against Veronica Alfa, Plaintiff's similarly situated comparator; Swegman was involved in the implementation, enforcement, and sanctioning of the favorable treatment that Alfa received from Mando; and Swegman directly handled the unfavorable treatment that Plaintiff received from Mando. Id. at 4. Plaintiff argues that until Swegman's deposition he could not have alleged a viable Title VII sex discrimination claim identifying a specific similarly situated female comparator that complied with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) and was not subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), citing Arafat v. Sch. Bd. of Broward Cty., 549 F. App'x 872, 874 (11th Cir. 2013) (affirming order of dismissal for failure to state a claim and stating, "If a plaintiff fails to show the existence of a similarly-situated employee, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate where [*8]  no other plausible allegation of discrimination is present.") and Silvera v. Orange Cty. Sch. Bd., 244 F.3d 1253, 1261 n.5 (11th Cir. 2001) ("[D]ifferences in treatment by different supervisors or decision makers can seldom be the basis for a viable claim of discrimination."). Id. at 5, 6. Plaintiff further argues that the statute of limitations for his Title VII sex discrimination claim was equitably tolled and did not start to run until November 17, 2020, and his EEOC charge was therefore timely filed. Id. at 7-8. Lastly, Plaintiff argues that consolidating both his ADA and Title VII actions will promote economy of expense, time, and effort for the parties and expedite the resolution of both actions. Id. at 8.
Defendant maintains that, like Plaintiff's first motion to amend, which was denied, Plaintiff's second motion for leave to amend is based entirely on Plaintiff's false contention that he did not know that Swegman was a decision maker with respect to both Plaintiff's and Alfa's discipline and accommodation requests until Swegman's deposition in November 2020. (Doc. 39, at 7). Defendant contends that Plaintiff fails to show good cause for his delay in pursuing the information that he now relies upon as the basis for his second motion for leave to amend. [*9]  Id. at 8. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff fails to show, in relation to his proposed Title VII sex discrimination claims, why he could not have alleged in his original complaint that he was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees when he knew about Alfa's sleeping on the job. Id. at 9. Defendant further contends that Plaintiff has provided no reason why he could not have learned of the alleged newly discovered evidence regarding Alfa's sleeping on the job before January 25, 2021—the first time Plaintiff pursued a Title VII sex discrimination claim; that the proposed amendment is futile because Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his Title VII claims in a timely manner, and that Plaintiff's actions foreclose a finding of diligence or extraordinary circumstances warranting the application of equitable tolling to Plaintiff's proposed Title VII claims; that his proposed amendment is futile because Swegman was not employed in February 2018 when Plaintiff was issued a last chance agreement and allegedly requested an accommodation, and therefore he was not involved in Plaintiff's initial discipline or accommodation request; and that the [*10]  amendment would prejudice Defendant. Id. at 11-12, 14-15, 16.
In his original complaint, Plaintiff alleges that he was disciplined by his supervisor, April Regier, for sleeping while on the job. (Doc. 1, at ¶¶ 26-27). At a February 2, 2018 meeting, Regier presented Plaintiff with a memorandum entitled, "Last Chance Agreement." Id. at ¶¶ 27-28; Doc. 34-2. The memorandum informed Plaintiff that on February 1, 2018, he was seen violating Defendant's conduct policy "by sleeping on the job and abusing [his] designation lunch period." Id. at ¶ 27; Doc. 34-2. The memorandum informed him that "[i]n lieu of termination," he was being placed under the last chance agreement for two years and that his failure to adhere to Defendant's conduct policies would result in his immediate termination. Id. at ¶ 27; Doc. 34-2. Plaintiff refused to sign the last chance agreement and instead submitted on February 9, 2018, a memorandum explaining his reasons for not signing the last chance agreement. Id. at ¶¶ 31-40; Doc. 34-5. In the memorandum, Plaintiff stated that he believed that there was a "lack of sufficient and meaningful Due Process that preceded the issuance of the [last chance] memo;" that the alleged [*11]  incident was protected under the ADA as he "was suffering [from] the effects of food poisoning with stomach flu symptoms" and that he "found it reasonable to sit relax in the breakroom while [his] pains subsided"; and that "[m]ultiple witnesses and credible avenues that would have verified and corroborated the allegations reports that [his] supervisor received were never consulted." (Doc. 34-5). Plaintiff also apparently attached a photograph of over-the-counter medication for pain relief and an antacid. Id. at 6.
Plaintiff's original complaint also alleges that on December 3, 2018, Regier requested that he attend a meeting, at which Audie Swegman, the HR manager, presented Plaintiff with a termination letter. (Doc. 1, at ¶¶ 52-55). The termination letter, signed by Swegman, stated that two employees confirmed the report that Plaintiff was observed on November 16, 2018 asleep at his desk, and that Defendant's conduct policy specifically lists sleeping on the job as cause for immediate termination. Id. at ¶¶ 59-60; Doc. 34-4. Swegman's letter referenced Plaintiff's last chance agreement issued on February 2, 2018, which was in effect for two years from that date. Id. at ¶ 62; Doc. 34-4. [*12]  Plaintiff's complaint alleges that after reading the letter, Swegman asked Plaintiff to hand in the keys and electronic access cards in his possession and to leave Defendant's premises. Id. at ¶ 56. Plaintiff's complaint also alleges that "Swegman never allowed [Plaintiff] to confront the disability-related allegations and other contents of that termination letter"; that Swegman and Mando deliberately ignored and disregarded [Plaintiff's] prior identified and requested reasonable accommodation to Mando, as outlined in his February 9, 2018 'Explanation for Last Chance Agreement'"; that Plaintiff "requested Mr. Swegman to grant him detailed notices of the allegations for which he was terminating [Plaintiff], and an opportunity for [Plaintiff] to confront these allegations," but that "Swegman denied [Plaintiff's] request for this reasonable accommodation"; and that "Swegman's acts, omissions and assertions in terminating [Plaintiff] were in violation of ADA." Id. at ¶¶ 57-58, 64-66.
Plaintiff admits to having received discovery showing that Defendant received two complaints against a female salaried employee, Veronica Alfa, who was seen sleeping on the job on December 10, 2018 and on January [*13]  3, 2019. Id. at 2. Plaintiff asserts that the produced records "clearly showed that Oirya and Ms. Alfa were NOT similarly situated comparators, because they had been subjected to disparate disciplinary treatment and disparate provision of reasonable accommodation, by completely different supervisors or decision makers at Mando," and thus, Plaintiff "had NO reason to believe at that time that Mando had discriminated against him because of his sex, in violation of Title VII." Id. (emphasis in original). Plaintiff maintains that upon receiving the first complaint against him for sleeping on the job on February 1, 2018, Regier, Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, disciplined him by issuing a last chance agreement; however, upon receiving the first complaint against Alfa for sleeping on the job on December 10, 2018, Robert Wurtz, Alfa's immediate supervisor, took no disciplinary action against her. Id.; Doc. 34-3. Plaintiff argues that Regier and Swegman disciplined Plaintiff by terminating his employment on December 3, 2018 when they received the second complaint of Plaintiff's sleeping on the job on November 16, 2018, whereas Wurtz and Mando's Human Resources Generalist Shinae Pak only [*14]  issued Alfa a last chance agreement upon receiving the second report of Alfa's sleeping on the job on January 3, 2019, which allowed Alfa to remain employed by Defendant. Id. at 2-3. The January 11, 2019 last chance agreement issued to Alfa stated that "[o]n December 10, 2018, it was reported that [Alfa] w[as] sleeping during work hours, and then again on January 3, 2019, it was reported that [Alf] w[as] sleeping during work hours." (Doc. 34-3). The memorandum informed Alfa that "[i]n lieu of termination," she was being placed under the last chance agreement for two years and that any future incidents of sleeping would result in her immediate termination. Id.
Plaintiff further maintains that during the January 11, 2019 disciplinary meeting, Alfa was allowed to explain that she was on medication that caused drowsiness and she usually took that medication around 11:30 A.M. so she could sleep during her lunch break. (Doc. 34, at 3). The supplemental notes to Alfa's last chance agreement reflect Alfa's explanation for falling asleep at work. (Doc. 34-6). The supplemental notes also reflect that Wurtz stated that it was acceptable for her to sleep during lunch, but that she should refrain [*15]  from doing so during work hours. Id. According to the notes, Pak stated that Alfa could submit medical documents to HR. Id.
In his November 17, 2020 deposition, Swegman testified that the HR manager has authority to take any type of disciplinary action, short of termination. (Doc. 40-14, at pp. 22-23). Swegman testified that a supervisor, upon receiving documentation from a physician and after proper investigation, may accommodate an employee so long as the HR manager concurs with the determination to accommodate. Id. at pp. 29-34. Swegman testified that he was hired as HR manager in June 2018 and was not employed by Defendant when Plaintiff received his last chance agreement in February 2018. Id. at pp. 27, 76-78. Swegman said that he concurred with Regier's recommendation to terminate Plaintiff for sleeping on the job, given that Plaintiff had been issued a last chance agreement. Id. at pp. 94-95, 125. As to Alfa, Swegman testified that he was directly contacted on one occasion about Alfa's sleeping on the job and, as a result, Alfa was issued a last chance agreement because it was her first offense. Id. at pp. 74-75.3
Rule 16 "is designed to ensure that 'at some point both the parties and the pleadings will be fixed.'" Leary v. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 906 (6th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted); Johnson v. Am. Fam. Ins., No. 1:18-CV-1552, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256528, 2020 WL 10181572, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 7, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:18-CV-1552, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256456, 2020 WL 10181662 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 18, 2020). Here, Plaintiff has failed to show good cause under Rule 16 for failing to seek leave to amend sooner to include his Title VII sex discrimination claims. Plaintiff was aware that Swegman was involved in his own termination and alleged in his original complaint that "Mr. Swegman's acts, omissions and assertions in terminating Oirya were in violation of the ADA." (Doc. 1, at ¶ 66). Plaintiff admits to receiving discovery concerning Alfa months prior to Swegman's deposition and was aware that, although Alfa had received two complaints about her sleeping on the job on two separate occasions, she only received a last chance agreement after the second incident. See Doc. 34, at 2; Doc. 40, at 3. [*17]  Thus, Plaintiff was aware of facts to allege plausibly that Swegman treated Alfa differently by not firing her for sleeping on the job a second time. Alfa's last chance agreement, which Plaintiff evidently had received in discovery, certainly provided enough information to raise the question of why Alfa was not terminated for her second offense. See Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289, 1295-96 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that the pleading standard "simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element," and that "[i]t is sufficient if the complaint succeeds in 'identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render [the element] plausible.'" Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Thus, the court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish why he did not diligently seek to amend his complaint to allege claims under Title VII for sex discrimination at an earlier date, and therefore he has not shown good cause for the delay. Accordingly, the motion for leave to amend the complaint is due to be denied.4

IV. Conclusion
Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, it is hereby
ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend complaint (Doc. 34) is [*18]  DENIED.
DONE, on this the 14th day of January, 2022.
