Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment and Brief in Support [Doc. No. 37] filed by Defendant Oklahoma Department of Transportation ("ODOT"). It is at issue. See Pl.'s Resp.1 [Doc. No. 38]; Def.'s Reply [Doc. No. 39]. For the following reasons, the Motion is GRANTED.

I. Governing Standard
"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "An issue is 'genuine' if there is sufficient evidence on each side so that a rational trier of fact could resolve the issue either way." Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 670 (10th Cir. 1998). "Material" issues of fact include those that, under the substantive law, are "essential to the proper disposition of the claim." Id. The Court's function on summary judgment is not "to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether [*2]  there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); see also Roberts v. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Corp., 884 F.3d 967, 972 (10th Cir. 2018). In doing so, the Court considers the factual record and all reasonable inferences drawn from the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Adler, 144 F.3d at 670.

II. Undisputed Material Facts2
Plaintiff was working for ODOT in October 2018 when she experienced a stressful event at her workplace. This encounter is set forth in detail in the Court's previous Orders [Doc. Nos. 10, 27]. Because neither party includes this factual background in their statements of facts, the Court does not recite it again in detail here.3
As a result of the incident, Plaintiff began a leave of absence on October 15, 2018. Four days later, Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Veronneau, sent a letter advising that Plaintiff "should be able to return to work 10/29/2018 but she will be reassessed in a week." [Doc. No. 37-1]. Dr. Veronneau met with Plaintiff again on October 26 and recommended she "take another week off work," to be reassessed in a week. [Doc. No. 37-2] at 1. But at the end of that week, Dr. Veronneau advised that Plaintiff was "not yet ready to return to work." Id. at 2. She instead recommended Plaintiff "take another two weeks off," to be reassessed in [*3]  two weeks. Id. Two weeks later, on November 16, Dr. Veronneau again stated that Plaintiff "is not yet ready to return to work," but was "considering returning at the beginning of the new year." Id. at 3.
On December 11, Dr. Veronneau filled out Plaintiff's FMLA paperwork, noting that she was "unsure" when Plaintiff could return, but she "anticipate[d]" it would be "early January." [Doc. No. 37-3] at 2-3. Dr. Veronneau's next letter, dated January 7, 2019, reiterated that Plaintiff "is not able to return to work at this time," but that she was collaborating with Plaintiff's counselor to "get [Plaintiff] back as soon as we feel she is able." Dr. Veronneau stated they were now "aiming for a return date at the beginning of February." [Doc. No. 37-2] at 4. Though Plaintiff's FMLA leave expired on January 9, 2019, her supervisor, Gary Sloup, approved her to take sick leave from January 10 through January 22. Mr. Sloup also advised Plaintiff that she would be placed on annual leave through February 1 after her sick leave expired.
On February 22, Dr. Veronneau advised that Plaintiff "still needs more time to recover" and her condition would be "reassess[ed] end March." [Doc. No. 37-2] at 5. [*4]  One month later, on March 22, Dr. Veronneau again concluded Plaintiff "still needs more time to recover," and advised she would "reassess end April." Id. at 6. On April 1, Mr. Sloup informed Plaintiff that she was "placed on approved leave in April 2019 until [her] annual and sick leave are exhausted" and confirmed that he would continue applying her annual leave to her time off. [Doc. No. 37-5]. On April 10, however, Mr. Sloup informed Plaintiff she would exhaust all annual and sick leave on April 26. He advised Plaintiff that she could take leave without pay until April 30, but that unpaid leave was not approved beyond that time. Accordingly, Mr. Sloup advised Plaintiff that ODOT would seek her termination if she did not "return to work on May 1, 2019 with a full medical release stating [she is] able to perform the essential functions" of her position. [Doc. No. 37-6].
But Plaintiff did not return to work by this deadline. Instead, her counselor, Katherine Anderson, LPC, sent a letter on May 1 advising that Plaintiff "still needs more time to recover." [Doc. No. 37-7]. Ms. Anderson explained that she would meet with Plaintiff's doctor to "reassess at the end of May 2019." Id. Ms. [*5]  Anderson, who had been seeing Plaintiff weekly since October 24, explained Plaintiff was "still experiencing PTSD symptoms related to the incident at the workplace." Id. The letter did not include an anticipated date that Plaintiff could return to work.
The following day, HR Director Brian Kirtley emailed Plaintiff, stating that "[b]ased on [their] conversation" that morning, he was "approving leave without pay or shared leave (should a donor be found) through May 17, 2019." [Doc. No. 37-9]. Mr. Kirtley also advised that he would discuss Plaintiff's request for 12 months of unpaid and/or shared leave, but that ODOT was "concern[ed]" that Plaintiff's "situation is open ended" and that ODOT had not received anything "indicat[ing] [she] will return to work." Id. On May 20, Mr. Kirtley emailed Plaintiff to inform her that ODOT had extended her period of unpaid leave through June 3.
On May 22, ODOT again cautioned Plaintiff that "[f]ailure to return to work . . . with a full medical release" would "result in the agency seeking to terminate [her] employment." [Doc. No. 37-13]. This time, ODOT gave Plaintiff a June 4 deadline to return to work. But at 4:54 p.m. on June 3, Plaintiff emailed [*6]  Mr. Sloup that she was "[u]nable to return to work" the following day. [Doc. No. 37-14]. Plaintiff attached a letter from her clinical psychologist, Dr. Dinah Cloud, to this email.4 Dr. Cloud listed Plaintiff's diagnoses as post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder with agoraphobia. Dr. Cloud opined that Plaintiff's "mental health problems are significantly interfering with her daily functioning," despite "weekly treatment with a psychotherapist and tak[ing] three psychotropic medications." [Doc. No. 37-11]. Further, Dr. Cloud stated that:
Due to her mental health difficulties [Plaintiff] will not be able to work in the same workplace environment where the trauma was endured. [Plaintiff] may be ready to return to work in six to eight weeks with the following reasonable workplace accommodations:
a. Relocation of her office to the new ODOT Training Facility
b. Security officer on-site during working hours
c. Parking spot close to the building with adequate outdoor lighting
d. Office location that is not immediately accessible to the public and/or front door of the building
e. Office space with a door that can be closed
f. Ability to complete new hire training [*7]  at the new ODOT Training Facility with at least one colleague or assistant on location during those trainings
g. Change of office phone number and email address
h. Ability to work from home and flexible in-office working hours to accommodate doctors' appointments and changes in symptoms
i. Flexibility within this plan to re-assess based upon her mental health needs[.]
Id. at 2. Dr. Cloud later clarified that she did not believe Plaintiff could return to work on May 20. See Cloud Dep. [Doc. No. 37-12] at 34:5-8.
Early the next morning, June 4, Mr. Sloup confirmed receipt of Plaintiff's email. The following day, June 5, Mr. Sloup, Mr. Kirtley, and Scott Lange, then an HR Programs Manager III, met to review and discuss Plaintiff's requested accommodations. On June 10, Plaintiff received a notice of pre-termination hearing, scheduled for June 14. In reply, Plaintiff wrote she had "yet to receive any response to [her] request for an accommodation" and advised that she believed "Human Resources has not yet considered this request or submitted it thru [sic] proper channels per ODOT policy B-306-8." [Doc. No. 38-1] at 31.5 That policy states, in relevant part, that a "verbal request and/or a [*8]  written request" for an accommodation "starts the documentation process and the supervisor will create a file and will document the Reasonable Accommodation process." Id. at 16. The policy describes ODOT's interactive process to include:
a) analysis of the particular job to determine its purpose and essential functions
b) a consultation with the employee to ascertain the precise job-related limitations imposed by the individual's disability and how those limitation [sic] could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation
c) identification of potential accommodations and, in conjunction with the employee, an assessment of the effectiveness of those accommodations in enabling the employee to perform the essential functions of the job
d) consideration of the preference of the employee and selection and implementation of the accommodation that is appropriate for the employee and the employer
e) the overall needs of the office
Id. at 17. The policy also explains that "[u]ndue hardship issues will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis," but includes the following requirement:
In the event that any accommodation would cause an undue hardship, the division head must submit a written statement to the [*9]  Department ADA/504/508 Coordinator, providing all case information and a written statement of the reasons for reaching this conclusion. In turn, the ADA/504/508 Coordinator will review the case and consider all resources available to determine if the claim that has been submitted, is valid and/or would cause an undue hardship on the agency as a whole.
Id. at 18. If the coordinator believes the requested accommodation would cause an undue hardship, the policy directs her to draft a written statement of concurrence "to the head of the Department for his/her final decision." Id. But if the coordinator disagrees with the division head, the policy instructs her to draft a written statement and "then step in and work with the requestor to identify an effective reasonable accommodation." Id.
On June 12, two days after receiving Plaintiff's email, Mr. Sloup asked ODOT's ADA/504/508 Coordinator, La Tashia Thompson, to meet "as early as possible" the following day to discuss "a reasonable accommodation issue per Policy B-306-8." Id. at 33. The email did not mention Plaintiff by name. That same day, Mr. Sloup, Mr. Kirtley, and Mr. Lange met for the second time. The following day, Mr. Sloup and [*10]  Mr. Lange met with Ms. Thompson. Ms. Thompson later testified that she "did not prepare a document for [Plaintiff] . . . as an ADA coordinator." [Doc. No. 38-1] at 98.
On June 14, four days after Plaintiff alleged ODOT failed to properly consider her reasonable accommodation request, Mr. Sloup sent a substantive response to the requested accommodations set forth in Dr. Cloud's letter. He acknowledged that "some of" Plaintiff's requested accommodations were reasonable—including changing her phone number and email address and providing "flexible in-office working hours to accommodate doctors' appointments"—but explained others were either "not reasonable or would place undue hardships on others."6 [Doc. No. 37-15].
On July 2, Mr. Kirtley sent a follow-up email because ODOT "wanted to be more specific" about the requested accommodations listed in Dr. Cloud's letter. [Doc. No. 37-16] at 1. Mr. Kirtley explained that the new ODOT training facility was not yet open and, in any event, had no available office space. He also clarified that Plaintiff needed to return to the existing ODOT office—as opposed to working from either the new facility or from home—because "supervision of [her] work [*11]  activities would place an undue hardship on [her] supervisor," and "interaction with ODOT employees would not be feasible" if she worked elsewhere. Id. at 1-2. Mr. Kirtley also reiterated the accommodations that ODOT agreed to make, including (1) changing her phone number and email address, (2) providing an office with a door that closed and that did not have immediate access to the public or the front door of the existing facility, and (3) providing flexibility to attend doctors' appointments. ODOT asked that Plaintiff send "comments or other potential accommodations" by July 9. Id. at 2.
On July 9, Plaintiff's attorney sent a letter responding to Mr. Kirtley's email. The letter requested that Plaintiff be allowed to "work from home until December 31, 2019, when her mental health status can be reassessed." [Doc. No. 37-17] at 2. The letter explained that Plaintiff would be "ready to start working from home" as soon as her computer could be set up. Id. at 3. Recommendations from Dr. Cloud and Ms. Anderson, both of whom also supported Plaintiff's request to work remotely though December 31, were attached as support. Neither Dr. Cloud nor Ms. Anderson discussed Plaintiff's ability to [*12]  perform her job duties, nor did they provide an anticipated date that she could return to work at the office.
The following day, July 10, Mr. Kirtley told Plaintiff ODOT did "not find [her] request reasonable" because "[r]egular attendance in the workplace is an essential function" of her position. [Doc. No. 37-25]. Mr. Kirtley stated that her "position requires regular and impromptu face to face interaction and coordination of work with managers, supervisors, employees, applicants, and other HR Division employees." Id. When Mr. Sloup filled out Plaintiff's FMLA paperwork on or about December 11, 2018, he had listed Plaintiff's essential job functions as "Agency Talent Manager [and] Agency New Employee Orientation Manager, attend career fairs, conduct new employee training." [Doc. No. 37-3] at 1 (capitalization in original). While Plaintiff was on leave, the orientation training for ODOT's new hires was put on hold, as Plaintiff "had prepared the session and there was no one else to do it." Lange Dec. [Doc. No. 37-20] ¶ 5. The orientation training took place four times per year at the central office, where the incident took place. Id.
Plaintiff replied to Mr. Kirtley three days later, [*13]  on July 13, urging she was "ready to return to work" immediately "with the reasonable accommodation that [she] be allowed to work from home." [Doc. No. 38-1] at 43. In support of her request, she cited ODOT's telework policy, which "allows staff to work away from their existing office location under certain conditions." Id. at 21. Before an employee may begin teleworking, the policy requires her supervisor to "evaluate the arrangement, considering factors such as job responsibilities, workspace consideration, work schedules, and equipment needs to determine if the position is appropriate for a telework arrangement." Id. Mr. Kirtley responded to Plaintiff's memo two days later, advising that ODOT had "already considered and addressed [her] request to work from home." Id. at 45.
ODOT terminated Plaintiff on August 7, 2019. The Notice of Discharge stated she was terminated due to "[i]nability to perform the duties of the position." [Doc. No. 37-18] at 1. The same justification had previously been listed on the Notices of Pre-Disciplinary Action, dated June 12 and June 20. See [Doc. No. 38-1] at 51, 54. At no time during 2018 or 2019 did Plaintiff receive a full medical release to return [*14]  to work, as ODOT had requested. Plaintiff later testified that she was "not sure" if she was medically capable of working full-time in an office setting as of 2020. Hart Dep. [Doc. No. 37-8] at 26:13-16.
Following her termination, Plaintiff pursued resolution in the Oklahoma Merit Protection Commission ("OMPC").7 The administrative law judge ("ALJ") issued his ruling on October 13, 2020, following a two-day evidentiary hearing. The ALJ concluded that "regular attendance in the workplace" was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. [Doc. No. 37-19] at 17. Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff "failed to show she was a qualified individual with a disability because she ha[d] not proven that she can perform the essential functions of her job with or without an accommodation." Id. The ALJ ruled in ODOT's favor, concluding that ODOT had "just cause" to terminate Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff had "failed to prove a prima facie case of discrimination based on disability and retaliation based on her disability claim." Id. at 17-18.

III. Analysis
Plaintiff filed the instant action on June 17, 2021, alleging ODOT (1) discriminated against her based on her disability, (2) failed to accommodate [*15]  her disability, and (3) retaliated against her for requesting accommodations, all in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-796l.8 ODOT has moved for summary judgment on all three claims.

A. Preclusion
As an initial matter, ODOT urges the Court to hold that the final decision of the OMPC precludes Plaintiff from seeking relief in federal court.9 Plaintiff does not address the substantive merits of ODOT's preclusion argument. Instead, she asserts that ODOT has waived the affirmative defense of preclusion by raising it for the first time on summary judgment. ODOT counters that it included the affirmative defense in both its Answer [Doc. No. 11] and its Answer to the Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 31], citing the following language: "Plaintiff sought remedies through the merit protection commission and therefore is barred from asserting any exception from merit protection jurisdiction."
Beyond the conclusory assertion that it has "appropriately reserved its rights," however, ODOT does not explain how this language is relevant to either issue or claim preclusion. Def.'s Reply [Doc. No. 39] at 4. The plain language of this affirmative defense does not appear to implicate either [*16]  issue or claim preclusion; instead, it contemplates a jurisdictional challenge to the agency's authority. Plaintiff has not argued she is "except[ed]" from the OMPC's jurisdiction or otherwise urged the Court to discount the OMPC's decision for jurisdictional reasons. And if this affirmative defense intended to reference to preclusion, it is perplexing why ODOT did not raise the issue in either of its two Partial Motions to Dismiss [Docs. No. 7, 18]. Accordingly, the Court concludes that ODOT raised preclusion for the first time in its Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 37].
Preclusion is an affirmative defense that is "subject to waiver where not timely raised." Pittsburg Cnty. Rural Water Dist. No. 7 v. City of McAlester, 358 F.3d 694, 708 n.4 (10th Cir. 2004)). Though "the best procedure is to plead an affirmative defense in an answer or amended answer," it is not necessarily waived if raised for the first time in a motion for summary judgment. Ahmad v. Furlong, 435 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2006). To determine whether an affirmative defense can be raised for the first time in a post-answer motion, the Court treats the issue as one of constructive amendment of the answer. See id. ("Rather than demanding that the defendant first move to amend the answer, we need only apply the same standards that govern motions to amend when we [*17]  determine whether the defendant should be permitted to 'constructively' amend the answer by means of the summary-judgment motion.").
"The liberal pleading rules established by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the pleading of affirmative defenses." Creative Consumer Concepts, Inc. v. Kreisler, 563 F.3d 1070, 1076 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Hassan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 842 F.2d 260, 263 (11th Cir.1988)). But the Court will not allow constructive amendment if there is evidence of "prejudice to the opposing party . . . 'undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive . . ., or repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.'" Ahmad, 435 F.3d at 1202 (quoting Harris v. Sec'y, U.S, Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 126 F.3d 339, 345, 326 U.S. App. D.C. 362 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). When determining whether delay is "undue," the focus is "primarily on the reasons for the delay." Minter v. Prime Equip. Co., 451 F.3d 1196, 1206 (10th Cir. 2006). "[D]enial of leave to amend is appropriate 'when the party filing the motion has no adequate explanation for the delay.'" Id. (quoting Frank v. U.S. West, 3 F.3d 1357, 1365-66 (10th Cir.1993)).
ODOT has not articulated any reason for waiting until this stage of the litigation to present its preclusion defense. As Plaintiff highlights, ODOT did not include the defense in its Answer [Doc. No. 11], Answer to the Amended Complaint [Doc. No. 17], or either of its Partial Motions to Dismiss [Docs. No. 7, 18]. Nor could ODOT plausibly argue that it learned of the defense late in litigation, as it was party to the OMPC hearing in [*18]  September 2020. The Court agrees the delay is undue and therefore declines to let ODOT constructively amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense of preclusion.

B. Disability Discrimination
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that "[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Absent direct evidence of discrimination, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies. Aubrey v. Koppes, 975 F.3d 995, 1014 (10th Cir. 2020) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)). "In the summary judgment context, a plaintiff initially must raise a genuine issue of material fact on each element of the prima facie case." Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997). If she does so, the burden then shifts to ODOT "to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for terminating Plaintiff. Kendrick v. Penske Transp. Servs., Inc., 220 F.3d 1220, 1226 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802). Finally, the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to "show that the defendant's justification is pretextual." Id.

1. Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case of Disability Discrimination
To state a prima facie case of disability discrimination under § 504, [P]laintiff must prove "1) [s]he is a disabled person within the meaning of the law; 2) [s]he [*19]  is otherwise qualified for the job; and 3) [s]he was discriminated against because of [her] disability." McMullin v. Ashcroft, 337 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1294 (D. Wyo. 2004) (citing Pack v. Kmart Corp., 166 F.3d 1300, 1304 (10th Cir.1999); Wells v. Shalala, 228 F.3d 1137, 1144 (10th Cir.2000)). ODOT challenges only the second and third elements. Because Plaintiff has not established that she is "otherwise qualified," ODOT is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.
An employee is "otherwise qualified" if, "with or without reasonable accommodation," she "can perform the essential functions of the employment position." Adair v. City of Muskogee, 823 F.3d 1297, 1307 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)).10 "Essential functions of a job are those that 'bear more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue.'" Kilcrease v. Domenico Transportation Co., 828 F.3d 1214, 1221 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Hawkins v. Schwan's Home Serv., Inc., 778 F.3d 877, 887 (10th Cir. 2015)). The essential function inquiry places "considerable weight on an employer's judgment." Id. at 1221-22; see also Brown v. Austin, 13 F.4th 1079, 1086 (10th Cir. 2021) (finding employer's judgment "about whether a function is essential" is generally entitled to deference in the absence of some evidence that its "view was not job-related, uniformly enforced, [or] consistent with business necessity"). If ODOT "come[s] forward with evidence that a job function or requirement is essential," Plaintiff then "bears the burden to dispute that evidence or otherwise show that the function or requirement is nonessential." Kilcrease, 828 F.3d at 1222.
Here, ODOT has proffered evidence that physical presence is an essential [*20]  function of Plaintiff's job. Mr. Lange, ODOT's current HR Director, stated that "Plaintiff was needed in the Central Office building to quickly respond to the multitude of questions that needed to be answered by Human Resources personnel and ODOT Supervisors/Employees on a daily basis." Lange Dec. [Doc. No. 37-20] ¶ 3. Mr. Lange explained that working remotely would be "disruptive to [Plaintiff's] supervisor," would "negate her ability to interact with other Human Resources personnel and ODOT supervisors/employees that would regularly walk in to request her assistance," and would impede her ability "to cover for other Human Resources personnel." Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Mr. Lange also confirmed that no employees in the human resources department, including those supervised by Mr. Sloup or Mr. Kirtley, were permitted to telework at the time of Plaintiff's termination. See id. ¶ 7. Finally, Mr. Lange explained that the new employee training sessions, which Plaintiff was responsible for conducting, took place four times per year in the central office. See id. ¶ 5.
Plaintiff has provided no evidence to "dispute [ODOT's] evidence or otherwise show that the . . . [physical presence] requirement is nonessential." [*21]  Kilcrease, 828 F.3d at 1222. Rather, her argument that she is otherwise qualified reads, in its entirety:
Ms. Hart was qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job held. She had successfully worked in the position of Talent Manager since 2013, without even a blemish on her record of performance. Had ODOT afforded her the accommodation of allowing her to from home, via the already existing Telework Program (See Plaintiff's Exhibits 3, 17-19), temporarily, Ms. Hart would have been able to perform the essential functions of her job.
Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 38] at 9. Though Plaintiff references ODOT's permissive telework policy, she proffers no evidence that indefinite remote work was appropriate for her position.11 The only indication that physical presence is not an essential function of Plaintiff's job is the description she provided in her July 13 memo to Mr. Kirtley. See [Doc. No. 38-1] at 42-44. But this evidence is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff is a qualified individual. See Brown, 13 F.4th at 1086 (concluding employee's "own belief that he could perform the essential functions of his job from home is not enough" to survive summary [*22]  judgment).

2. Pretext
Even if Plaintiff could establish her prima facie case,12 she has not provided sufficient evidence of pretext. "A plaintiff demonstrates pretext by producing evidence of 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.'" Jaramillo v. Colo. Jud. Dep't, 427 F.3d 1303, 1308 (10th Cir. 2005), as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 20, 2005) (quoting Morgan, 108 F.3d at 1323). ODOT claims it terminated Plaintiff because she failed to return to work and failed to "provide[] a medical release indicating [her] ability to perform the duties of the position [she] occup[ies]." [Doc. No. 37-18] at 2; see Boykin v. ATC/VanCom of Colorado, L.P., 247 F.3d 1061, 1065 (10th Cir. 2001) ("[E]mployers are not obligated to retain a disabled employee on unpaid leave indefinitely or for an excessive amount of time.").
Failure to comply with a "written policy can be evidence of pretext." Metzger v. City of Leawood, 144 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1262 (D. Kan. 2001) (citing Beaird v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 145 F.3d 1159, 1168 (10th Cir. 1998)). "[T]he standard for establishing pretext requires evidence of not just any procedural shortfall, but of a disturbing procedural irregularity," which is "often exemplified by an employer's falsifying [*23]  or manipulating of relevant criteria." Hysten v. Burlington N. Santa Fe Ry. Co., 415 F. App'x. 897, 909-10 (10th Cir. 2011) (first quoting Cooper v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 296 F. App'x. 686, 696 (10th Cir.2008); and then Timmerman v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 483 F.3d 1106, 1122 (10th Cir. 2007)). Thus, even if ODOT "failed to follow its own internal procedures," its noncompliance "does not necessarily suggest" Plaintiff's termination "was motivated by illegal discriminatory intent," or that ODOT's "substantive reasons . . . for its employment decision were pretextual." Id. at 909 (quoting Berry v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 490 F.3d 1211, 1222 (10th Cir. 2007)).
The evidence regarding ODOT's noncompliance is not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext. Though Plaintiff alleges ODOT repeatedly violated its Disability/Reasonable Accommodation policy before terminating her, she has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that ODOT actually committed most of the alleged policy violations.13 First, she claims Mr. Sloup did not create a written file or document her request process, as required by the policy. But this contention improperly cites Ms. Thompson's testimony that she did not maintain a file on Plaintiff. See [Doc. No. 38] at 10 (citing [Doc. No. 38-1] at 92). In fact, Ms. Thompson testified that she did not know whether Mr. Sloup or Mr. Kirtley created a file for Plaintiff. See [Doc. No. 38-1] at 92. Next, Plaintiff alleges ODOT violated Policy B-306-8(2), which triggers certain requirements [*24]  if a request for accommodations needs "higher administrative approval, or the division feels the request would be better suited with the Civil Rights Division." [Doc. No. 38-1] at 16. But Plaintiff proffers no evidence that her request fell into either of those categories. Third, Plaintiff argues ODOT violated its policy because neither Mr. Sloup nor Mr. Kirtley contacted her about her requested accommodations within 10 business days. But Plaintiff submitted her requested accommodations after business hours on June 3, and Mr. Sloup substantively responded to those requests on June 14.
But even where ODOT did violate its policy, those violations did not rise to the level of disturbing procedural irregularities. When Mr. Kirtley determined Plaintiff's request to work from home created an undue hardship on her supervisors, for example, he violated ODOT's policy by failing to submit "a written statement of the reasons for reaching this conclusion" to Ms. Thompson. [Doc. No. 38-1] at 18. The policy also requires Ms. Thompson to either write a statement of concurrence, or to "step in and work with the requestor to identify an effective reasonable accommodation." Id. Because she did not receive [*25]  a written statement from Mr. Kirtley, Ms. Thompson did not take either of these steps. But there is no evidence that Mr. Kirtley's actions reflect an attempt to manipulate the process. To the contrary, the record indicates that Ms. Thompson was still involved in the reasonable accommodation conversation prior to the denial of Plaintiff's requests. See id. at 33, 95-101.
Similarly, Plaintiff alleges ODOT violated the interactive process procedures laid out in Policy B-306-8(4) because it "did not communicate with [Plaintiff]" or "make any effort to work with [her] to identify effective reasonable accommodations," but instead "merely rejected [her] reasonable accommodation requests." Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 38] at 12. But after several internal meetings, Mr. Sloup communicated ODOT's conclusions to Plaintiff and asked her to propose other options. Mr. Kirtley then sent a more detailed email, explaining why each request—including her request to work from the new ODOT training facility or from home—had been approved or denied. Specifically, Mr. Kirtley told Plaintiff she could not work from home because that arrangement would create an undue hardship for her supervisors and impede her ability to interact [*26]  with other ODOT employees. Additionally, Mr. Kirtley invited Plaintiff to provide "comments or other potential accommodations." [Doc. No. 37-16] at 2. When Plaintiff proposed the same accommodation request—to work from home indefinitely—Mr. Kirtley reiterated that ODOT had considered and rejected that request. While the record lacks sufficient detail to determine whether ODOT fully complied with the policy, its actions do not evidence the falsification or manipulation indicative of a disturbing procedural irregularity.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff argues ODOT's actions raise an inference of discrimination because it knowingly "ignored" its policy after Plaintiff highlighted its noncompliance. Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 37] at 10. To be sure, Plaintiff emailed Mr. Sloup on June 10, stating: "[I]t appears that Human Resources has not considered this request or submitted it thru [sic] proper channels per ODOT policy B-306-8." Id. at 31. But two days later, Mr. Sloup reached out to Ms. Thompson, asking to discuss "a reasonable accommodation issue per Policy B-306-8" as soon as possible. [Doc. No. 38-1] at 33. The next day, Mr. Sloup and Mr. Lange met with Ms. Thompson. No rational factfinder could [*27]  conclude these actions reflect a willful disregard for the policy—let alone a disturbing procedural irregularity. Accordingly, ODOT is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim.

C. Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff also alleges that ODOT failed to accommodate her disability. This claim is also subject to the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting analysis. See Aubrey, 975 F.3d at 1005. To establish her prima facie case, Plaintiff "must show that [s]he "(1) is disabled; (2) is 'otherwise qualified'; and (3) requested a plausibly reasonable accommodation." Brown v. Austin, 13 F.4th 1079, 1084-85 (10th Cir. 2021) (quoting Sanchez v. U.S. Dep't of Energy, 870 F.3d 1185, 1195 (10th Cir. 2017)). As explained supra, Plaintiff cannot show that she is "otherwise qualified." See Aubrey, 975 F.3d at 1014 (applying same "otherwise qualified" analysis to both failure-to-accommodate claim and disability discrimination claim). For the same reasons previously articulated, ODOT is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim.

D. Retaliation
Finally, Plaintiff claims that after she requested to work remotely or from the new training facility, ODOT retaliated against her in violation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by terminating her employment. To survive summary judgment, Plaintiff must present either direct evidence of retaliation or proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting [*28]  framework. See Reinhardt v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 595 F.3d 1126, 1131 (10th Cir. 2010).

1. Direct Evidence
First, Plaintiff asserts she has direct evidence that she is the victim of retaliation. "To prove discrimination or retaliation directly under the direct method of proof, a plaintiff . . . needs evidence that directly reflects the forbidden animus." Twigg v. Hawker Beechcraft Corp., 659 F.3d 987, 1000 n.8 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hall v. U.S. Dep't of Lab., 476 F.3d 847, 854 (10th Cir.2007)). Plaintiff argues this evidence can be found by comparing Mr. Kirtley's July 10 email, in which he reiterated ODOT's denial of her request to work from home, with the August 7 "Specifics of Cause" attached to her notice of termination. Both documents include the following justification:
The position requires regular and impromptu face to face interaction and coordination with managers, supervisors, employees, applicants and other HR Division employees. Regular attendance is an essential function of the position you occupy.
[Doc. No. 38-1] at 41; [Doc. No. 37-18] at 2. Plaintiff claims these two documents "prove, without inference, that [she] was terminated due to her request for reasonable accommodations because both documents use the exact same language." Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 38] at 20.
The Court disagrees. At most, the statements indicate that the same rationale that supported Mr. Kirtley's [*29]  decision to deny Plaintiff's requested accommodations also supported her termination—not that Plaintiff's request for accommodations served as the justification for her termination. Because these two documents do not "directly reflect[] the forbidden animus," Plaintiff must instead proceed under the McDonnell Douglas framework. Twigg, 659 F.3d at 1000 n.8 (quoting Hall, 476 F.3d at 854)).

2. McDonnell Douglas
This analysis is set forth in detail above. The only difference is that Plaintiff must establish her prima facie case of retaliation by showing: "1) she engaged in a protected activity; 2) she was subjected to adverse employment action subsequent to or contemporaneous with the protected activity; and 3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co., 181 F.3d 1171, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999).
Plaintiff easily satisfies the first two elements of her prima facie case. "An employee's request that his employer provide him an accommodation for a disability constitutes a protected activity for purposes of advancing an ADA retaliation claim." Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co., 900 F.3d 1166, 1209 (10th Cir. 2018). And termination clearly constitutes an adverse employment action. Tapia v. City of Albuquerque, 170 F. App'x. 529, 533 (10th Cir. 2006). Both parties recognize Plaintiff's June 3 email as a request for accommodations. See Def.'s Mot. [Doc. No. 37] at 25; Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 38] [*30]  at 22. The email attached Dr. Cloud's initial list of recommendations, including the request to either work from home or from the new ODOT training facility. Similarly, the parties agree that Plaintiff was terminated.
Plaintiff's causation argument relies solely on timing. She contends ODOT's retaliatory motive can be inferred because she requested accommodations on June 3, and ODOT terminated her about nine weeks later, on August 7. Additionally, Plaintiff notes she was terminated less than one month after Dr. Cloud and Ms. Anderson recommended she be permitted to work from home until December 31. See [Doc. No. 37-17]. Plaintiff is correct that, in certain cases, temporal proximity alone may be sufficient to establish the causation element of a prima facie case of retaliation. See Foster v. Mountain Coal Co., LLC, 830 F.3d 1178, 1191 (10th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff relies on Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1179, asserting "[t]he Tenth Circuit has also held that two months and one week is sufficient to support a prima facie case of retaliation." Resp. [Doc. No. 38] at 22-23.
This is not Anderson's holding. Because the plaintiff in Anderson could not establish pretext, the court declined to decide whether a nine-week period was sufficient to establish causation. See Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1179 ("We need not decide on which [*31]  side the line should be drawn, however, because assuming two months and one week is sufficient to support a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff cannot prove that Defendant's proffered reason for terminating her was pretextual." (emphasis added)). Instead, temporal proximity may be sufficient to establish causation when it is somewhere "between six weeks (or less) and three months." Inniss v. Rocky Mountain Inventory, Inc., 385 F. Supp. 3d 1165, 1170 (D. Colo. 2019) (citing Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1179). Here, Plaintiff was terminated two months and four days after her initial request for accommodations. But even assuming the one-month period between July 9—when Plaintiff essentially re-urged her earlier request to work from home—and her August 7 termination was sufficient to establish causation, Plaintiff's claim still fails because she cannot establish pretext. Plaintiff does not make a separate pretext argument for her retaliation claim, but "incorporates by reference" the "evidence and arguments" applicable to her disability discrimination claim. Pl.'s Resp. [Doc. No. 38] at 23. For the reasons already articulated, that argument fails.
Additionally, the Court finds Morgan, 108 F.3d at 1322-24, instructive given the factual similarities to Plaintiff's retaliation claim. In that case, an employee received several [*32]  warnings for her absenteeism before filing a charge of disability discrimination with the EEOC. Id. The court of appeals concluded that neither the warnings she received after she engaged in protected activity nor her eventual termination gave rise to an inference of pretext. Id. at 1324. Instead, those actions "simply completed the disciplinary process already set in motion." Id. Similarly, ODOT told Plaintiff on April 10 and on May 22 that she would be terminated if she did not return to work with a full medical release. Plaintiff requested accommodations on June 3, but never returned to work or provided a medical release. After ODOT determined Plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of her job remotely, it terminated her on August 7 for failing to return to work. Because Plaintiff "has not cast doubt on [ODOT's] facially nondiscriminatory explanation for its actions," id., ODOT is entitled to summary judgment on her retaliation claim.
