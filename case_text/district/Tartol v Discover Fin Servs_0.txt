MEMORANDUM OPINION
CHARLES P. KOCORAS, District Judge:
Before the Court is Defendant Discover Financial Services Inc.'s ("Discover") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Anne M. Tartol's ("Tartol") First Amended Complaint ("FAC") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the following reasons, the Court denies the motion.

BACKGROUND
For purposes of this opinion, the Court accepts as true the following facts from the complaint. Alam v. Miller Brewing Co., 709 F.3d 662, 665-66 (7th Cir. 2013). All reasonable inferences are drawn in Tartol's favor. League of Women Voters of Chicago v. City of Chicago, 757 F.3d 722, 724 (7th Cir. 2014).
Plaintiff Tartol is an Illinois resident who suffers from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and arthritis in her left wrist. These ailments substantially limit her life activities, including her ability to work. Defendant Discover is a Delaware corporation doing business in Illinois.
Tartol began working for Discover in November 2000. She most recently held the position of administrative assistant. When Tartol began working for Discover, [*2]  her then-manager granted her an informal accommodation to help manage both her stress and IBS symptoms. The accommodation allowed Tartol to forgo or adjust her breaks to reduce the length of her workday. In July 2017 Discover rescinded that accommodation.
Around the same time, Tartol alleges that a coworker began behaving antagonistically towards her. The coworker, without any authority to do so, repeatedly criticized, screamed at, and blamed Tartol for mistakes that were not Tartol's fault. She even sharply criticized Tartol in front of other employees for having a roasting pan on her department's office party cart. This coworker's behavior continued over the course of approximately a year-and-a-half and caused Tartol great stress and embarrassment, which aggravated the symptoms of her IBS.
Seeking an end to her co-worker's behavior, Tartol initiated a series of eight meetings with an Employee Relations Representative beginning in July 2017 and ending in September 2018. None of these meetings resolved the issue. In October 2018, Tartol attended a presentation by Discover's security department that covered harassment and physical violence. Following the presentation, Tartol brought her [*3]  concerns about the coworker to the security department. At a follow-up meeting on April 2, 2019, the security department told her that, despite what appeared to be legitimate concerns, they could do nothing; she must go back to Employee Relations to lodge her complaints.
On April 18, 2019, Tartol filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. ("ADA").
In May or June of 2019, the director to whom Tartol reported was transferred to a different department. Typically, Tartol would have begun reporting to one of the five other directors she supported, but in a departure from normal procedure she began reporting directly to a vice president, Rohit Tanwar ("Tanwar"). Tartol alleges that this change should have made her an executive administrative assistant with a higher salary or title. She received neither. She also claims that Tanwar gave her a negative midyear review even though she only reported to him for about a month and does not recall doing any work for him other than making copies. Finally, she alleges that Tanwar denied her an uncharged paid time off (PTO) for a day to attend a funeral, [*4]  even though he granted similar requests to other assistants.
In June or July of 2019, Tartol became aware of an opening for an executive administrative assistant position to support a vice president whom Tartol had known for many years. Tartol expressed her interest in the position to the outgoing executive administrative assistant and to the boss of the vice president hiring the new executive administrative assistant. However, Discover did not interview Tartol and never even posted the position, which departed from Discover's normal process. Instead, Discover promoted a recently-hired employee whom Tartol had trained. After learning of the hire, Tartol spoke to the hiring vice president regarding why Discover had deviated from its normal hiring process. Tartol says that the vice president responded that he had no choice in the matter and had been forced to hire the other employee.
Based on these events, Tartol filed this suit on October 19, 2019. On January 6, 2020, Tartol filed her FAC, alleging failure to accommodate under the ADA (Count I) and retaliation for filing the EEOC charge (Count II). On January 14, 2020, Discover moved to dismiss the FAC under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to [*5]  dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) "tests the sufficiency of the complaint, not the merits of the case." McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 694 F.3d 873, 878 (7th Cir. 2012). The allegations in the complaint must set forth a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Plaintiff need not provide detailed factual allegations but she must provide enough factual support to raise her right to relief above a speculative level. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).
A claim must be facially plausible, meaning that the pleadings must "allow...the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). The claim must be described "in sufficient detail to give the defendant 'fair notice of what the...claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'" E.E.O.C. v. Concentra Health Servs., Inc., 496 F.3d 773, 776 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements," are insufficient to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.

DISCUSSION
Discover urges the Court to Dismiss Tartol's discrimination claim because Tartol has not plead sufficient facts to state a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA. Discover also urges the Court to dismiss the retaliation claim because Tartol has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required [*6]  by the ADA. We address each argument in turn.

I. Failure to Accommodate
The ADA makes it unlawful to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Included in the definition of discriminate is "not making reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
To state a claim for failure-to-accommodate, Tartol must show: (1) she is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) Discover was aware of the disability; and (3) Discover failed to reasonably accommodate the disability. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 417 F.3d 789, 797 (7th Cir. 2005).
Discover argues that Tartol has failed to state a failure to accommodate claim for two reasons. First, Discover contends that Tartol fails to allege that she engaged in the interactive process with Discover and that Discover was responsible for the breakdown in communication. Second, Discover argues that neither eliminating stress nor transferring Tartol away from particular co-workers are recognized as reasonable accommodations.
Tartol argues that she does not need to allege that she engaged in an interactive process with Discover because she alleged that Discover rescinded her accommodation and failed to [*7]  protect her from her abusive coworker. We agree that Tartol has sufficiently alleged a failure to accommodate claim.
The Seventh Circuit said in Sears, "After an employee's initial disclosure [of a disability], 'the ADA obligates the employer to engage with the employee in an 'interactive process' to determine the appropriate accommodation under the circumstances.'" Sears, 417 F.3d at 805 (quoting Giles v. v United Airlines, 213 F.3d 365, 373 (7th Cir. 2000)). If the employer "takes an active, good-faith role in the interactive process, it will not be liable if the employee refuses to participate." Id. at 806. If the employer does not engage in the interactive process, the claim can be defeated if the employer can show no reasonable accommodation is possible. Id. at 805.
Tartol alleges that Discover knew of her disability and that she needed accommodation because it had previously granted her an accommodation. Thus, Discover was obligated to engage in an interactive process with Tartol. Nevertheless, Discover rescinded Tartol's existing accommodations seemingly without any additional engagement in the interactive process. Moreover, Tartol alleges that she raised her issues with the harassing coworker to the Employee Relations department but her efforts were not fruitful in resolving the matter. [*8]  Thus, Discover's argument that Tartol failed to engage it in an interactive process fails for two reasons: first, it merely shifts the burden of engaging in the interactive process from the employer to the employee; and second, Tartol did in fact attempt to engage her employer regarding one requested accommodation but was unsuccessful.
Discover next argues that Tartol's accommodation requests to eliminate all work stress and transfer her away from a coworker were unreasonable as a matter of law. However, Tartol did not request the elimination of all work stress or a job transfer. Tartol requested that Discover prevent a coworker from harassing her because the harassment was causing her disability to flare up. Discover has not shown that is request is unreasonable as a matter of law. The question of whether an accommodation is reasonable is a fact question and is generally inappropriate for resolution at this stage. See McWright v. Alexander, 982 F.2d 222, 227 (7th Cir. 1992); Earl v. Espejo, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137398, 2017 WL 3704826, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 2017) ("Whether a requested accommodation is reasonable is highly fact-specific, and determined on a case-by-case basis by balancing the cost to the defendant and the benefit to the plaintiff . . . any further 'fact-specific balancing' at the pleading stage would be premature."). [*9] 
At this stage Tartol has sufficiently alleged that she was a qualified individual with a disability, that Discover knew of her disability, and that Discover failed to accommodate her disability. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Count I is denied.

II. Retaliation Claim
Discover argues that Count II must be dismissed because Tartol did not exhaust her administrative remedies and because she failed to state a retaliation claim. We address each argument in turn.

A. Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
Discover first argues that Tartol did not include her retaliation claim in her EEOC charge and therefore failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to this claim. Tartol argues that she need not exhaust her administrative remedies for a claim of retaliation based on filing an EEOC charge. We agree with Tartol.
"[C]ourts look to Title VII retaliation cases for guidance in deciding retaliation cases under the ADA." Casna v. City of Loves Park, 574 F.3d 420, 427 (7th Cir. 2009). "As a general rule, a Title VII plaintiff cannot bring claims in a lawsuit that were not included in her EEOC charge." Cheek v. W. & S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994). However, a plaintiff need not exhaust administrative remedies for a retaliation claim where the facts giving rise to the alleged retaliation occur after [*10]  filing an EEOC charge. Heuer v. Weil-McLane, 203 F.3d 1021, 1023 (7th Cir. 2000); McKenzie v. Ill. Dept. of Trans., 92 F.3d 473, 48283 (7th Cir. 1996); Griffin v. Chi. Housing Auth., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164118, 2014 WL 6657799, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 2014).
Tartol alleges that Discover retaliated against her for filing her EEOC charge by failing to promote her, giving her a negative performance review, and denying her request for an uncharged PTO day. Tartol filed her EEOC charge on April 18, 2019. Each of the alleged retaliatory actions occurred after Tartol filed the EEOC claim. Accordingly, Tartol was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies for the retaliation claim.

B. Failure to State a Claim
Discover next argues that Tartol has failed to state a retaliation claim because she does not allege a recognized adverse employment action. Tartol argues that Discover deviating from its ordinary procedure by not posting the job opening is a recognized adverse employment action. We agree with Tartol.
To establish a claim of retaliation, a plaintiff must allege (1) she engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse action; and (3) a causal connection between the two. Dickerson v. Bd. of Trustees of Cmty. Coll. Dist. No. 522, 657 F.3d 595, 601 (7th Cir. 2011). "Typically, adverse employment actions are economic injuries such as dismissal, suspension, failure to promote, or diminution in pay." Markel v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wisconsin Sys., 276 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir. 2002) (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761-62, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998)).
Discover argues that Tartol did not allege an adverse employment action [*11]  because Tartol never applied for the executive administrative assistant position. However, the Seventh Circuit has held that an application is not necessary when "an employer ordinarily entertains applications for a certain type of job but a plaintiff is deterred from applying by the very discriminatory practices he is protesting." Volling v. Kurtz Paramedic Servs., Inc., 840 F.3d 378, 384 (7th Cir. 2016). "In cases such as this, the employer's 'manner' of publication may involve the discriminatory absence of publication." Id. (emphasis in original).
Tartol alleges that she clearly expressed a desire for the position by communicating it to two Discover employees, the position opening was never posted in accordance with Discover's ordinary procedure, and the position was filled with a less qualified candidate. Tartol alleges that Discover's failure to post the job and not allowing her to apply was in retaliation for filing the EEOC charge. In this situation, therefore, Tartol did not need to have applied in order to state a claim for retaliation. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Count II is denied.

CONCLUSION
For the aforementioned reasons, the Court denies Discover's Motion to Dismiss. It is so ordered.
