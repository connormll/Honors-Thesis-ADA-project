Opinion



ORDER
Pending before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Motion to Strike and Motion to Correct Misnomer. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion is denied in part and granted in part (#32), and Defendant's motion is denied in part and granted in part (#27).
Plaintiff brings this suit contending that the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences ("UAMS") violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("Rehabilitation Act") when it terminated his employment on March 11, 2010. Plaintiff raises claims of disparate [*2]  treatment, a failure to accommodate, and retaliation under both Acts.
Defendant brings its motion contending that Plaintiff has failed to name the proper defendant, Plaintiff cannot recover monetary damages from UAMS under the ADA, and Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation under both Acts. Plaintiff has responded to the motion and filed a Motion to Strike1 and an Alternative Motion to Correct Misnomer.
Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the dispute may be decided solely on legal grounds. Seymour v. City of Des Moines, 519 F.3d 790, 796 (8th Cir. 2008); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The initial inquiry is whether there are genuine factual issues that can be properly resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
I. Facts
Plaintiff suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ("ADHD").2
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant in 1996. He worked in the Server Group as a systems administrator who provided Defendant's staff, faculty, and students with responses to all hardware and software computer related problems.
Plaintiff was given an oral warning for failure to follow directives regarding his work schedule on November 12, 2008. [*3]  Plaintiff was given an oral warning on March 6, 2009 based upon his failure to follow his set work schedule and his failure to attend scheduled staff meetings. On July 17, 2009, Plaintiff was given an oral warning for failure to follow directives. Plaintiff received a written warning on February 11, 2010 based upon non-compliance with management's directives. (Def. Ex. A-15).
On March 10, 2010, Plaintiff's supervisor's met with Plaintiff for a regularly scheduled meeting to discuss Plaintiff's work performance. Plaintiff was recording the meeting. When asked to cease recording the meeting, Plaintiff refused. The meeting came to an end.
After the March 10, 2010 meeting, Plaintiff's supervisor ran a report from certain databases to see if system administrators had followed his instructions to up date their servers. The Tracking Database regarding server updates indicated that Plaintiff had update his servers on March 8, 2010. After accessing three of Plaintiff's servers to confirm that they had been updated, the supervisor concluded that the servers had not been updated in over five months. Def. Doc. 27-1, pp. 90-103.
Plaintiff was terminated on March 11, 2010. The reasons stated in his [*4]  termination letter were that Plaintiff had failed to take directions and falsified records. Def. Ex. A-17.
Plaintiff was hired by the University of Arkansas in November of 2010. Plaintiff has not requested an accommodation for his disability at his new place of employment.
II. Analysis
A. ADA Claims
The Supreme Court held in Board of Trustees of Univer. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 n. 9, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed. 2d 866 (2001) that "Congress did not validly abrogate the States' sovereign immunity from suit by private individuals for money damages under Title I" of the ADA. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has held that while under the doctrine set forth in Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) "state officials may be sued in their official capacities for prospective injunctive relief without violating the Eleventh Amendment, the same doctrine does not extend to states or state agencies." Monroe v. Arkansas State University, 495 F.3d 591, 594 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 443 (F.3d 1005, 1017 (8th Cir. 2006)).
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has not spoken regarding the effect of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.L. 110-235 on a state's sovereign immunity; however, the District Courts which have addressed the ADA Amendments have found that the ADA Amendments does not change the Eleventh Amendment analysis. See, e.g., Williams v. Recovery School District, 859 F. Supp. 2d 824, 2012 WL 893421 (E.D. La. March 15, 2012); Dube v. Tex. Health & Human Servs. Comm'n, No. [*5]  SA-11-CV-354-XR, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99680, 2011 WL 3902762, at 2-3 (W.D .Tex. Sept. 6, 2011) (holding that claims for monetary damages brought under the ADA Amendments Act were barred by the Eleventh Amendment); see also Goodnow v. Okla. Dept. of Human Servs., No. 11-CV-54-GKF-FHM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118318, 2011 WL 4830183, at 1 (N.D.Okla. Oct. 12, 2011) ("[T]he ADAAA is devoid of language purporting to negate the constitutional limitation upon the authority of Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity recognized in Garrett."); Odonnell v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections, 790 F.Supp. 2d 289, 298 n.9 (M.D. Pa. 2011).
Here, Plaintiff has sued a division of the University of Arkansas System which would preclude any monetary relief under the ADA based upon Garrett and, because he did not sue a named official, would also preclude the grant of injunctive relief. Plaintiff's Alternative Motion to Correct Misnomer is futile as in this alternative motion Plaintiff seeks to change the name of the Defendant from UAMS to the University of Arkansas which does not change the outcome of application of Garrett and the inapplicability of Ex Parte Young. Thus Plaintiff's Motion to Correct Misnomer is denied as to his ADA claims.
Plaintiff's ADA claims are dismissed based upon this Court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) are dismissed without prejudice.
B. Rehabilitation Act3
The Eighth Circuit has held that Arkansas has waived its sovereign [*6]  immunity from suit under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. See Jim C. v. United States, 235 F.3d 1079 (8th Cir. 2000). Because the State of Arkansas is not immune from suit under Section 504, Plaintiff's Motion to Correct Misnomer is granted in part. Plaintiff will be allowed to file an amended complaint naming the University of Arkansas as the Defendant.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to establish a "prima facie" case of disparate treatment, failure to accommodate or retaliation.
The familiar three-step McDonnell Douglas approach is applied in a disparate treatment case where no direct evidence of discrimination is available. Norcross v. Sneed, 755 F.2d 113, 117 & n. 5 (8th Cir.1985) (holding McDonnell Douglas is applicable in disparate treatment cases under the Rehabilitation Act).
Under McDonnell Douglas, after a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of disparate treatment, the burden shifts to the defendant to state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) ; Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). If the defendant meets that burden, the presumption of discriminatory action raised by the prima facie case is rebutted. Id. The plaintiff may respond by showing that the defendant's proffered reason was a pretext for the disparate treatment. Id.
To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must [*7]  demonstrate that he or she: (1) has a disability; (2) is a qualified individual; and (3) has suffered an adverse employment action because of that disability. See Jeseritz v. Potter, 282 F.3d 542, 546 (8th Cir. 2002). For purposes of this motion, Defendant concedes that Plaintiff is disabled. This concession leaves the issue of whether Plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform his job duties, but was dismissed solely because of his disability.
The Court finds that there are disputed facts regarding whether Plaintiff was dismissed based upon his disability, e.g., allegedly derogatory statements made regarding Plaintiff's disability and whether Defendant's stated reason for Plaintiff's termination was pretext for discrimination, e.g., whether another non-disabled employee who falsified records was treated differently.
Plaintiff second and third claims are that the Defendant committed unlawful employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability and by retaliating against him for seeking an accommodation. "An employer commits unlawful discrimination ... if the employer does 'not mak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise [*8]  qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless [the employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of [the employer].' Ballard v. Rubin, 284 F.3d 957 (8th Cir. 2002) (citing Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 951 (8th Cir.1999)).
When an employee truly and affirmatively requested accommodation, the employer has an obligation to engage in an interactive process with the employee. Id. "To show that an employer failed to participate in this interactive process, the employee must demonstrate that: "'1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith. . . . The mere failure of an employer to engage in the interactive process does not give rise to per se liability, although for summary judgment purposes such failure is considered prima facie evidence that the employer may be acting in bad faith." Id.
To make a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must show (1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) he suffered [*9]  an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection exists between (1) and (2). Box v. Principi, 442 F.3d 692, 696 (8th Cir. 2006).
Essential to both Plaintiff's claims is evidence that Plaintiff sought an accommodation based upon his disability. Plaintiff contends that he was refused a transfer to another work group in 2009, refused special training, and refused the use of a tape recorder. Plaintiff contends that all of these requests related to his disability.
Defendant contends that there is no evidence that Plaintiff's request for transfer to another work group was made based upon his disability. See Lowery v. Hazelwood Sch. Dist., 244 F.3d 654 (8th Cir. 20001) (employee's request must convey that a transfer is an accommodation for employee's disability). However, Plaintiff has presented evidence of an e-mail in which he asked for a transfer and attached a copy of an article about ADHD.4 Slender reed it may be, but it is sufficient to present a factual dispute on the request for accommodation in the form of a transfer.
Moreover, based upon the evidence before the Court there is a factual dispute on whether Plaintiff's request for the use of a tape recorder at the March 10, 2010 meeting was a request for an accommodation. Plaintiff's testimony is that he was requesting the use of a tape [*10]  recorded as an accommodation for his ADHD. Defendant has presented evidence that Plaintiff wanted to use the tape recorder to advance his legal claims.
Finally, there are disputed facts regarding Plaintiff's request for special training. Plaintiff testified that he requested special training due to his disability. Doc. #32, Ex. F at 129-130. Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to inform it that his request was related to his disability and presented evidence that Defendant gave Plaintiff the requested training or a reasonable alternative to the requested training. Doc. #27, Ex. A and C.; Doc. #33, ¶79.
Based upon this disputed facts and the modified burden shifting analysis called for in failure to accommodate cases, summary judgment is precluded.
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff's ADA claims are dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claims of disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, and retaliation will proceed to trial on May 21, 2012.
IT IS SO ORDERED THIS 8 day of May, 2012.
