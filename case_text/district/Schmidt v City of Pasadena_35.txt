Id.
On February 14, 2022, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the FAC (the "Motion" (Dkt. 17)). On the same day, Defendant filed a Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (the "RJN" (Dkt. 18)). On March 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion (the "Opposition" (Dkt. 22)). On April 12, 2022, Defendants filed a reply in support of the Motion (the "Reply" (Dkt. 23)).
A hearing on the Motion was held on October 17, 2022 and it was taken under submission. Dkt. 28. For the reasons stated in this Order, the Motion is GRANTED, with prejudice as to certain claims, and without prejudice as to the others.

II. Factual Background
A. The Parties
The FAC alleges that Plaintiff is employed as a forensic specialist by the Police Department of the City of Pasadena. FAC ¶¶ 1, 9. It alleges that Plaintiff resides in Pasadena, California. Id. ¶ 9. It alleges that the City of Pasadena is located in Los Angeles County, California. Id. ¶ 10.
B. Allegations in the FAC
The FAC alleges that the City of Pasadena issued a vaccine mandate to its employees, including Plaintiff, on or about August 5, 2021. Id. ¶ 12. It alleges that the mandate required [*3]  all of these employees to be vaccinated with respect to COVID-19 by September 17, 2021. Id. It alleges that Plaintiff submitted a request for a religious exemption from the mandate on or about September 28, 2021. Id. ¶ 13. The FAC alleges that in his religious exemption letter, "Plaintiff described his repugnance to get 'vaccinated', consistent with his religious beliefs as a Christian." Id. ¶ 14.
The FAC alleges that Plaintiff "was approved for exemption from the 'vaccine' itself, but was forced, as a condition of returning to work, to undergo futile and possibly dangerous and invasive 'Covid-19' tests." Id. ¶ 16. It alleges that Plaintiff's vaccinated coworkers were not "subject to the same humiliation and indignity of getting dubious and ineffective 'tests.'" Id. The FAC alleges that Jennifer Curtis, director of Human Resources for the City, sent Plaintiff an email on October 1, 2021 that "emphasized that Mr. Schmidt should wear a face mask 'in order to protect the health and safety of the community', implying that Mr. Schmidt had a disease that the 'community' needed protecting from, without any evidence." Id. ¶ 17. It also alleges that Plaintiff presumes "the 'vaccinated', super-spreaders [*4]  of Covid 19, according to the literature, did not receive such an email nor such a demand to wear masks or undergo tests." Id. ¶ 18. It further alleges that Plaintiff, "relying purely on his extremely strong 'natural' immunity, would conquer the virus for himself and thereby stop the creation of new mutants, which the 'vaccinated' tend to do, by the existing science on this." Id. ¶ 19.
The FAC alleges that after Plaintiff requested the religious exemption, he was placed on unpaid administrative leave "without any further explanation, or notice as to why he was put on such leave, nor ability to contest this discipline, which was presumably imposed on him because he contested the mandate, mask and testing requirements." Id. ¶ 20. It then alleges that Plaintiff "has signaled his willingness to return to work if he would submit to the 'saliva' test alone, not the intrusive and ineffective 'PCR' test; he has also signified his willingness to return to work wearing a mask." Id. ¶ 21. The FAC alleges that "these conditions were not imposed on his 'vaccinated' colleagues." Id.
The FAC alleges that Plaintiff has resumed working at the police department. Id. ¶ 23. It does not state for how long [*5]  Plaintiff was on administrative leave. The FAC alleges that Plaintiff "is forced to wear a mask at all times due to the recent mask mandate promulgated by the City of Pasadena." Id. ¶ 24. It alleges that Plaintiff has observed several administrators of the police department routinely failing to wear masks, "while obligating the rank-and-file cop to wear one." Id. ¶ 25. It alleges that Plaintiff "has been forced to submit to humiliating tests once a week, presumably testing negative, week after week." Id. ¶ 26. The FAC alleges that a coworker of Plaintiff's "became gravely ill and unstable psychologically" after becoming vaccinated, which it alleges might be explained by a "recent study [that] . . . has attributed the possibility of 'prion-like' mad cow disease to the Covid-19 vaccines" Id. ¶¶ 29-31. The FAC alleges that Plaintiff is "experiencing ringing in his ears" as a result of wearing a mask. Id. ¶ 39.
The FAC also alleges that "the 'vaccinated' co-workers, who tested positive [for] Covid were allowed to work alongside Plaintiff and not quarantined." Id. ¶ 32. It alleges that "Defendant favors the 'vaccinated', even as they get sick from the 'vaccine', against Plaintiff." Id. ¶ [*6]  33. It alleges that Plaintiff has been required to go to crime scenes "where Defendant knew that some of the individuals on the crime scene were Covid positive" and Defendant failed to provide him with corresponding, advance notice. Id. ¶ 34. It alleges that Plaintiff has noticed "a marked hostility" toward him by several of his vaccinated colleagues. Id. ¶ 35. Further, it alleges that the police officers who are supposed to accompany Plaintiff to crime scenes placed him in danger on at least one occasion by leaving him alone at "an especially notorious house." Id. ¶ 37. Finally, the FAC alleges that "Defendant promulgated the mask, testing and vaccine mandate knowing full well the uselessness of all this in preventing virus transmission" and that Defendant also knew that the vaccine mandate "imposed severe health risks onto the employees of the Police department." Id. ¶ 40.
C. The Vaccination Policy
A copy of the vaccination policy is attached to the FAC, and it is alleged that the City emailed this to Plaintiff. Defendant also includes an updated version of the policy in its RJN. Dkt. 18, Ex. A at 5-7.
The policy details its claimed purpose, including that COVID-19 cases had risen since [*7]  pandemic restrictions were lifted and the Delta variant increased the level of transmission of the virus. Id. at 5. It states that "[a] continued increase in the vaccination rate is paramount to stem this rapid increase in COVID-19 transmission." Id. at 6.
The policy states that "all City employees must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or request an exemption as a condition of employment no later than September 17, 2021." Id. It states that employees must report their vaccination status, provide proof of status and certify that the information is true and accurate. Id.
The policy provides for two types of exemptions: medical/disability exemptions and religious exemptions. Id. at 6-7. It states that the City's Human Resources department "will review requests for medical, disability, and religious exemptions on a case-by-case basis consistent with procedures for reasonable accommodation requests." Id. at 6.
With respect to medical/disability exemption requests, the policy states: "Employees with a medical condition, disability, or other medical restriction that affects their eligibility for a vaccine, as verified by their medical provider, may request a reasonable accommodation through [*8]  the Human Resources Department to be exempted from this vaccination requirement." Id. at 6.
With respect to religious exemption requests, the policy states: "Employees with a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance that prohibits them from receiving a vaccine, may request a reasonable accommodation to the Human Resources Department. . . ." Id. at 7.
The policy states that if a review of an employee's request is pending on or after September 18, 2021, employees shall be required "to be tested weekly for COVID-19 and wear a face mask covering nose and mouth indoors (unless in private office/room) or when in a shared vehicle." Id. It provides that the same masking and testing requirements apply to employees who receive an exemption. Id.
The version of the policy attached to the FAC, which is dated August 5, 2021, states that employees also have the option to request a deferral "until after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives final approval of one COVID-19 vaccine." Dkt. 15, Ex. 1, at 6. The version attached to the RJN, which appears to have been revised as of August 31, 2021, does not contain this option.
D. Exhibits to the FAC
Several exhibits are attached to the [*9]  FAC. Exhibit 1 includes an email that discusses the City's vaccination policy and attaches a copy of the policy. Dkt. 15, Ex. 1. Exhibit 2 is a letter from Plaintiff's counsel to the City dated September 14, 2021. Dkt. 15, Ex. 2. The letter states that Plaintiff "demands hereby an exemption from being vaccinated or being forced to undergo invasive Covid-19 tests as well as the wearing of masks." Id. at 9. The letter states that all of these measures "are intrusions into Mr. Schmidt's bodily integrity and he will not accept any of these based on his sincerely held religious beliefs as an Evangelical." Id. It also states that vaccines involve gene manipulation, which is "profoundly troubling to a Christian," and is antithetical to Plaintiff's belief that "every human being is made in the likeness of God." Id. at 10. It also states that the vaccines "involve the use of aborted fetal cells," which is "repugnant to Mr. Schmidt's sincere religious beliefs." Id. at 10. The letter also objects to vaccines, testing, and masks on the grounds that each measure is dangerous and ineffective. Id. at 10-13. It states: "Mr. Schmidt does not want to protect his rights in the courts but will not hesitate [*10]  to do so, if need be. Otherwise, Mr. Schmidt will continue in his functions without masks, vaccine or Covid-19 tests." Id. at 13 (emphasis in original).
Exhibit 4 contains the October 1, 2021 email sent to Plaintiff by Michael Paliwoda on behalf of Jennifer Curtis, which is referenced in the FAC. Dkt. 15, Ex. 4. It states that Plaintiff's request to be exempt from the vaccination requirement is granted. Id. at 23. It further states that Plaintiff's "request for an exemption to being tested for COVID-19 and to wearing a face covering while at work due to a sincerely held religious belief requires additional review." Id. It states that Plaintiff's "request for an exemption to being tested for COVID-19 and to wearing a face covering while at work precludes you from fulfilling your obligation to protect the health and safety of the community and that of your fellow City employees." Id. It then states: "The City will engage with you in a timely, good-faith interactive process to further evaluate your request to be exempted from COVID-19 testing and from wearing a face covering while at work. The purpose of the interactive process will be to determine whether an effective and reasonable accommodation [*11]  is available for your request." Id. The email also states: "Effective Friday, October 8, 2021, you will be placed on an unpaid leave of absence pending the outcome of the interactive process. You may elect to utilize accrued leaves, with the exception of sick leave, during the period of unpaid administrative leave." Id. (emphasis omitted).
Exhibit 4 also includes an email from Plaintiff to Curtis, apparently in response to the October 1, 2021 email. Id. at 25-26. This email states that Plaintiff has filed a civil rights complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Id. at 25. It states: "I am notifying you and the City of Pasadena that by defying my exemption from the vaccination mandates you are discriminating against me by placing me on leave without pay, it is illegal, and a violation of Federal Law, specifically Title 7 of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964." Id. The letter also states: "By law under Title 7, you have to accept my exemption on my sincerely held religious beliefs without question. By defying that you are a law breaker, therefore [you] are a federal criminal." Id.
Exhibit 3 contains a copy of undated correspondence from Plaintiff that is addressed to Mr. Paliwoda. Dkt. 15, Ex. 3. The [*12]  correspondence also appears to respond to the October 1, 2021 email. See id. at 16. It states reasons why Plaintiff believes the City has violated his rights. Id. It states that the City has violated a range of his constitutional and state statutory rights, committed slander and libel, and violated Title VII by stating that it would place Plaintiff on administrative leave and thereby "us[ing] threats and harassment to make [him] change [his] opinions and [his] sincerely held religious beliefs." Id. at 18. Exhibit 3 also includes a copy of Pasadena's COVID-19 dashboard. Id. at 21.
Exhibit 5 contains several scientific articles related to the COVID-19 virus and vaccines. Dkt. 15, Ex. 5.

III. Analysis
A. Request for Judicial Notice
1. Legal Standards
"[C]ourts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice." Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rts., Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007); see also Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-89 (9th Cir. 2001).
Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) provides that a court "may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial [*13]  jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned." Consideration of such materials ensures that "allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit" are not simply "accept[ed] as true" in connection with a motion to dismiss. Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001). A court may take judicial notice of a wide range of matters, including public records, government documents, judicial opinions, municipal ordinances, newspaper and magazine articles, and the contents of websites. See, e.g., Makaeff v. Trump Univ., LLC, 715 F.3d 254, 259 n.2 (9th Cir. 2013); Tollis, Inc. v. County of San Diego, 505 F.3d 935, 938 n.1 (9th Cir. 2007); United States v. Chapel, 41 F.3d 1338, 1342 (9th Cir. 1994); Heidelberg USA, Inc. v. PM Lithographers, Inc., No. CV1702223ABAJWX, 2017 WL 7201872, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 19, 2017); United States, ex rel. Modglin v. DJO Glob. Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 993, 1008 (C.D. Cal. 2015), aff'd sub nom. United States v. DJO Glob., Inc., 678 F. App'x 594 (9th Cir. 2017).
"Judicial notice is appropriate for documents 'made publicly available by governmental entities . . . and neither party disputes the authenticity of the web site[ ] or the accuracy of the information displayed therein.'" Am.'s Frontline Drs. v. Wilcox, No. EDCV211243JGBKKX, 2022 WL 1514038, at *4 (C.D. Cal. May 5, 2022) (quoting Japanese Vill., LLC v. Fed. Transit Admin., 843 F.3d 445, 454 (9th Cir. 2016). Additionally, "[d]ocuments that are not physically attached to a complaint may be considered 'when the authenticity of the documents is not disputed and the plaintiff's complaint necessarily relies on the documents.'" Id. (quoting Bryan v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 669 F. App'x 908, 909 (9th Cir. 2016)) (taking judicial notice of university's vaccine policy because the complaint "incorporates the [p]olicy in its allegations"). "[A] court may consider [*14]  evidence on which the complaint necessarily relies if: (1) the complaint refers to the document; (2) the document is central to the plaintiff['s] claim; and (3) no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) motion." Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Even if judicial notice is taken of a record, a court must distinguish between undisputed and disputed facts that it may include. Lee, 250 F.3d at 689-90. For example, "when a court takes judicial notice of another court's opinion, it may do so 'not for the truth of the facts recited therein, but for the existence of the opinion, which is not subject to reasonable dispute over its authenticity.'" Id. (quoting S. Cross Overseas Agencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping Grp. Ltd., 181 F.3d 410, 426-27 (3d Cir. 1999)).
2. Application
Defendant requests judicial notice of the following three public documents: (1) Exhibit A, which is the City of Pasadena Manual of Personnel & Administrative Rules, COVID-19 Vaccination Policy, established August 5, 2021; (2) Exhibit B, which is the California Department of Public Health, January 5, 2022 Guidance for the Use of Face Masks, retrieved on February 7, 2022, at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings-1-5-2022.aspx; and (3) Exhibit C, which [*15]  is the California Department of Public Health, February 7, 2022 Guidance for the Use of Face Masks, retrieved on February 7, 2022, at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx.
Plaintiff has not opposed the request for judicial notice.
Defendant argues that Exhibit A is properly subject to judicial notice because Plaintiff relies on the vaccination policy in support of the claims advanced in the FAC. See Dkt. 18 at 3. The version of the policy attached to the FAC differs slightly from the one attached to the RJN. Compare Dkt. 15, Ex. 1 at 4-7, with Dkt. 18, Ex. A at 5-7. As noted, the version attached to the RJN states that it was updated on August 31, 2021, while the version attached to the FAC states that it was established on August 5, 2021. The version attached to the FAC includes an option for employees to request a deferral from the vaccination requirement pending FDA final approval of a COVID-19 vaccine. Dkt. 15, Ex. 1 at 6. The later-dated version attached to the RJN does not contain this deferral option. See Dkt. 18, Ex. A at 6-7. Thus, the RJN version of the policy is not the one that is physically attached to the FAC. However, [*16]  the FAC necessarily relies on the August 31, 2021 version of the policy, i.e., the RJN version. Thus, it alleges that Plaintiff requested an exemption from the policy on or around September 28, 2021, at which time the updated version of the policy would have been in effect. Dkt. 15 ¶ 13. Plaintiff has not disputed the authenticity of the RJN version of the policy. See Dkt. 22. For these reasons, judicial notice is appropriate as to Exhibit A.
Exhibits B and C are also subject to judicial notice because each is a publicly available government document, and Plaintiff does not dispute their authenticity.
Therefore, applying the stated standards that, in connection with a motion to dismiss, certain materials that are properly deemed ones on which the FAC relies may be considered, the Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED.
B. Motion to Dismiss
1. Legal Standards
Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) provides that a "pleading that states a claim for relief must contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The complaint must state facts sufficient to show that a claim for relief is plausible on its face. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The complaint need not include detailed factual allegations, but [*17]  it must provide more than a "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action." Id. at 555. "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
A party may move to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Dismissal is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support one. Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008). In considering a motion to dismiss, the allegations in the challenged complaint are deemed true and must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996). However, a court need not "accept as true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit. Nor is the court required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001)).
If a motion to dismiss is granted, the court should "freely give leave [to [*18]  amend] when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Although this policy is to be applied "with extreme liberality," Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2001), allowing leave to amend is inappropriate in circumstances where litigants have failed to cure previously identified deficiencies, or where an amendment would be futile. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962); Allen v. City of Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 374 (9th Cir. 1990).
2. Application
Defendant contends that the FAC fails to state a claim as to any of the asserted causes of action that arise under federal law, and supplemental jurisdiction should not be exercised over those that arise under state law. Dkt. 17 at 13, 22.
a) The City's Authority to Mandate Vaccination
Plaintiff argues that, in general, but without reference to any particular cause of action, "there is considerable precedent for the idea that vaccine mandates involving employers, especially, are per se, illegal and unconstitutional." Dkt. 22 at 14. Plaintiff cites several cases that he contends support the position that the City's vaccination policy is unlawful. See id. All of these cases are factually distinguishable. In Brnovich v. Biden, a preliminary injunction issued that barred a vaccination requirement for federal contractors because it "exceed[ed] the President's authority under the Procurement Act." 562 F. Supp. 3d 123, 157 (D. Ariz. 2022). Similarly, [*19]  Louisiana v. Becerra granted a preliminary injunction against a rule promulgated by federal agencies requiring vaccination for staff, volunteers, and contractors for an education program. 577 F. Supp. 3d 483, 498, 503 (W.D. La. 2022). The court concluded that the rule exceeded the statutory authority of the agencies that issued it. Id. Similarly, Kentucky v. Biden granted a preliminary injunction on the ground that the President exceeded his delegated authority and "stepped into an area traditionally reserved to the states" by issuing an executive order mandating vaccination for federal contractors. 571 F. Supp. 3d 715, 725, 735 (E.D. Ky. 2021), aff'd as modified sub nom. Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545 (6th Cir. 2023). The district court opinion stated: "This is not a case about whether vaccines are effective. They are. Nor is this a case about whether the government, at some level, and in some circumstances, can require citizens to obtain vaccines. It can." Id. at 719. Finally, Missouri v. Biden preliminarily enjoined a federal vaccination mandate, but at the time the parties submitted their briefing, that injunction had been stayed by the Supreme Court, which rejected the conclusion that the policy was arbitrary and capricious. 571 F. Supp. 3d 1079, 1104 (E.D. Mo. 2021); Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. 647, 211 L. Ed. 2d 433 (2022). The district court ruling was later vacated by the Eighth Circuit. Mo. v. Biden, No. 21-3725, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 10258, 2022 WL 1093036, at *1 (8th Cir. Apr. 11, 2022), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 94, 214 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2022).
In sum, [*20]  none of the cases Plaintiff cites in support of the position that the City's vaccination policy is "per se" illegal are relevant here. Instead, this action involves a mandate by the City that its employees get vaccinated unless entitled to an exemption. Thus, Plaintiff has not shown that it was unlawful for the City to adopt its vaccination policy.
b) Count 7: Title VII
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee due to his or her religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2. Title VII "requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation to employees who have religious beliefs that conflict with their employment responsibilities, unless the employer can show that the accommodation would either unduly burden the employer or other employees." EEOC v. AutoNation USA Corp., 52 F. App'x 327, 329 (9th Cir. 2002); see Lawson v. Washington, 296 F.3d 799, 804 (9th Cir. 2002).
To establish a prima facie case of religious discrimination under Title VII, "a plaintiff must allege facts that plausibly demonstrate: (1) he holds a bona fide religious belief, the practice of which conflicted with an employment duty; (2) he informed the employer of that belief and conflict; and (3) the employer threatened the employee with or subjected him to discriminatory treatment, including discharge, because of an inability to fulfill [*21]  the job requirements." Burcham v. City of Los Angeles, 562 F. Supp. 3d 694, 708 (C.D. Cal. 2022) (citing AutoNation, 52 F. App'x at 329). Once a plaintiff has made a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that "it initiated good faith efforts to accommodate reasonably the employee's religious practices or that it could not reasonably accommodate the employee without undue hardship." Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 358 F.3d 599, 606 (9th Cir. 2004).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated Title VII. FAC ¶ 71. The FAC is not entirely clear as to the precise nature of the claim or the basis for the alleged liability. It appears that Plaintiff seeks to bring a failure to accommodate claim based on his request for exemption from the vaccination policy. See id. ¶ 72. The specific factual allegations as to the Title VII cause of action are as follows:
71. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, by segregating Plaintiff, based on his "unvaccinated" statis [sic], depriving him of his status and ability to do his job, has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
. . .
73. Plaintiff argues that allowing Plaintiff to perform his duties as an "unvaccinated" person, without test, mask or "vaccine" does not create an undue hardship on Defendant since, as mentioned above, Plaintiff will self-isolate and rely on his NATURAL immune system to defeat the virus if he does get infected. [*22]  Tests are not necessary and studies have proven masks are ineffective (see attached Exhibits for articles); however Plaintiff in good faith will wear a mask when with his colleagues but he will not subject himself to unnecessary, humiliating, discriminatory and totally ineffective tests.
74. Plaintiff argues that there is a greater risk his "vaccinated" colleagues will transfer the virus to him, since they have greater viral loads; however Plaintiff is willing to undergo this risk. Plaintiff therefore argues that accommodating the reasonable religious requirements of Plaintiff do not impose undue hardship on Defendant and should be accommodated. Not doing so would constitute a violation of Title VII.
Dkt. 15 ¶¶ 71, 73-74.
These allegations do not explain which of Plaintiff's sincerely held religious beliefs conflict with a specific employment duty. Nor do they clearly identify the alleged, discriminatory actions by Defendant toward Plaintiff. The allegations focus primarily on whether accommodating Plaintiff's religious beliefs would have imposed an undue hardship on Defendant. However, the issue of undue hardship arises only after a plaintiff has made a prima facie case and thereby shifted [*23]  the burden to the defendant to show it could not provide reasonable accommodations to the plaintiff without under hardship. See Peterson, 358 F.3d at 606.
Plaintiff makes allegations elsewhere in the FAC, and by reference to the attached exhibits, that may be relevant to his Title VII claim. However, it is not clear how these allegations are tied specifically to the Title VII claim. For example, the FAC alleges that the City violated Title VII by adopting the vaccination policy, and applying it to Plaintiff. See Dkt. 15 ¶ 71. However, it also alleges that Plaintiff's request for an exemption from the vaccination requirement was granted. Id. ¶ 43. Thus, Plaintiff's request for an exemption from the vaccination requirement cannot plausibly serve as a basis for a failure to accommodate claim. See Burcham, 562 F. Supp. at 708 ("Without allegations that Defendants have not, or are not likely to, deny Plaintiffs' requests for accommodation, Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Defendants have discriminated, or threatened to discriminate, against them.").
Plaintiff appears to allege that the City retaliated against him for obtaining the exemption by requiring him to wear a mask and undergo testing. See Dkt. 15 ¶¶ 24, 26, 71. However, Plaintiff [*24]  has not cited any legal authority that requiring such alternatives constitutes discriminatory treatment under Title VII. As part of its opposition to this claim, Defendant cites the statement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") that requiring masking and testing of employees who do not wish to get vaccinated may constitute a reasonable accommodation. Dkt. 17 at 16 (citing What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws, EEOC at K.2, https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws (July 12, 2022). ("For example, as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance from coworkers or non-employees, work a modified shift, get periodic tests for COVID-19, be given the opportunity to telework, or finally, accept a reassignment.").
Plaintiff argues that his Title VII claim is also based on his request to be exempt from the mask and testing requirements. See Dkt. 22 at 14-15. He argues that he sought an exemption from those requirements on the same religious grounds, implies that he was not granted [*25]  such an exemption, but has not clearly alleged or stated that. Id. However, the FAC does not allege how wearing a mask or undergoing testing would conflict with Plaintiff's religious beliefs. Nor does it allege that Plaintiff informed the City that if he were required to comply with these requirements, it would conflict with his religious views. Further, some allegations imply that Plaintiff's objections to masking and testing were not for religious reasons. For example, the FAC alleges that, "although, [Plaintiff] was granted his religious exemption based on his sincerely held religious beliefs, the pre-condition for him to return to work [required him] to subject himself to bodily harm." Dkt. 15 ¶ 43. The FAC also states that "Plaintiff in good faith will wear a mask when with his colleagues but he will not subject himself to unnecessary, humiliating, discriminatory and totally ineffective tests." Id. ¶ 73.
The exhibits attached to the FAC provide some support for Plaintiff's Title VII claim based on the response to his request for an exemption from the mask and testing requirements. Although Defendant argues that the letter in which Plaintiff sought an exemption from the masking [*26]  and testing requirements did not object to them on religious grounds, the copy of the letter attached to the FAC implies that Plaintiff did present such an objections. See id., Ex. 2. The letter objects to masks and testing on the grounds that neither is effective and both are dangerous: "[M]asks have been shown to have NO efficiency in keeping the transmission of Covid-19" and the "PCR test is a hazardous means of testing for Covid-19." Id. at 11-12. However, the letter also states that masks and testing conflict with Plaintiff's religious beliefs: "Mr. Schmidt, based on his sincerely held religious beliefs, under the First Amendment of the US Constitution . . . demands hereby an exemption from being vaccinated or being forced to undergo invasive Covid-19 tests as well as the wearing of masks," and then adds: "[a]ll of these [vaccination, masking, and testing requirements] are intrusions into Mr. Schmidt's bodily integrity and he will not accept any of these based on his sincerely held religious beliefs as an Evangelical." Id. at 10 (emphasis omitted).
Also relevant is the email sent to Plaintiff on behalf of Jennifer Curtis. Id., Ex. 4. It states that the City granted his request for an exemption from the vaccine mandate, [*27]  but that an exemption from the mask and testing policy would prevent Plaintiff "from fulfilling [his] obligation to protect the health and safety of the community and that of [his] fellow City employees." Id. at 23. The email stated that this request would be subject to further review as the City determined whether it could reasonably accommodate it, and Plaintiff would be placed on an unpaid leave of absence pending this interactive process. Id. The FAC also alleges that Plaintiff was placed on "unpaid administrative leave . . . without any further explanation, or notice as to why he was put on such leave, nor ability to contest this discipline, which was presumably imposed on him because he contested the mandate, mask and testing requirements." Dkt. 15 ¶ 20.
Although some of these matters may support the claim of discrimination in violation of Title VII, they are not expressly alleged in the FAC. Further, the FAC does not make clear whether Plaintiff's request to be exempt from masking and testing was denied. It alleges that Plaintiff "has since rejoined his functions at the Police department," but it does not make specific allegations about what conditions, if any, were imposed, [*28]  following his apparent completion of his administrative leave and return to work. Id. ¶ 23. In this regard, the FAC alleges that Plaintiff "has signaled his willingness to return to work if he would submit to the 'saliva' test alone, not the intrusive and ineffective 'PCR' test; he has also signified his willingness to return to work wearing a mask." Id. ¶ 21. The FAC then alleges that "Plaintiff has been forced to submit to humiliating tests once a week," but it does not specify which type of test these are. Id. ¶ 26. Again, it is not clear what conditions, if any, were actually imposed following the administrative leave. The FAC also alleges that, at the time it was filed, Plaintiff was "forced to wear a mask at all times due to the recent mask mandate promulgated by the City of Pasadena." Id. ¶ 24. This allegation raises the question whether the alleged discriminatory requirement that Plaintiff wear a mask was due to Defendant's failure to accommodate him, or a city-wide mask mandate. Id.
For these reasons, the FAC does not provide "fair notice" to Defendant of the alleged unlawful employment practice that violated Title VII. See Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011) (a complaint "must contain sufficient allegations [*29]  of underlying facts to give fair notice and enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively."). Thus, the FAC does not "provide a 'short and plain statement of the claims showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' and leaves it to the defendant (and the court) to piece together the allegations and claims—as though they comprise a puzzle to be solved—in order to discern the nature and factual basis of the claim of which defendant stands accused." George v. Grossmont Cuyamaca Cmty. Coll. Dist. Bd. of Governors, No. 22-CV-0424-BAS-DDL, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 215141, 2022 WL 17330467, at *15 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2022). Because Plaintiff may be able to allege a Title VII claim, leave to amend is appropriate, and this cause of action is dismissed without prejudice. Substantive due process "protects individuals from arbitrary deprivation of their liberty by government." Sylvia Landfield Tr. v. City of Los Angeles, 729 F.3d 1189, 1195 (9th Cir. 2013). It "provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests." Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997). Strict scrutiny applies to actions that infringe fundamental rights, but rational basis review applies to those that infringe non-fundamental rights. Sagana v. Tenorio, 384 F.3d 731, 743 (9th Cir. 2004).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated his "substantive due process rights to his protected property interest in his job as a city employee." Dkt. 15 ¶ 77 (emphasis in original). Because the right to pursue [*30]  an occupation is subject to reasonable government regulation, judicial review of actions infringing this right "merely look to see whether the government could have had a legitimate reason for acting as it did." Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020, 1031 (9th Cir. 1999) (emphasis omitted); see Franceschi v. Yee, 887 F.3d 927, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2018). Nor is there a "fundamental right to continued government employment." Burcham, 562 F. Supp. at 706 (citing Engquist v. Or. Dep't of Agr., 553 U.S. 591, 598, 128 S. Ct. 2146, 170 L. Ed. 2d 975 (2008)). The current caselaw supports the view that there is no fundamental right to be free of vaccination. See Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25-27, 25 S. Ct. 358, 49 L. Ed. 643 (1905) ("[A] community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members"); see also Kheriaty v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 22-55001, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 32406, 2022 WL 17175070, at *1 (9th Cir. Nov. 23, 2022) ("Kheriaty fails to offer any appropriate historical example to establish a 'fundamental right' to be free from a vaccine mandate at a workplace."); Williams v. Brown, 567 F. Supp. 3d 1213, 1226 (D. Or. 2021) ("Courts have also consistently held that, following Jacobson, challenges to vaccination mandates are properly considered under rational basis review."). Because Plaintiff has not presently asserted a fundamental right, rational basis review applies.
Plaintiff opposes the application of rational basis review on the ground that "Defendant cannot claim the benefit of rational basis review as a state actor since in the present circumstance, it did not act as a state actor" and instead "was operating [*31]  as a health service provider, nothing less." Dkt. 22 at 13 (emphasis omitted). This argument is not persuasive. Plaintiff relies on Mohil v. Glick, 842 F. Supp. 2d 1072 (N.D. Ill. 2012). However, Mohil discussed the "standard for deciding when a private entity acts under color of state law." Id. at 1076. It did not state that government entities may be treated as non-state actors when they are alleged to have acted on a matter that is not something exclusively within the authority of the government. Further, if Defendant were deemed not to have engaged in state action, a significant issue would be presented as to whether Plaintiff could bring any claims under the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires a showing of action by a governmental body or agent. See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1982).
Turning to the rational basis standard, in deciding whether a policy satisfies rational basis review, "[f]irst, [courts] must determine whether the challenged law has a legitimate purpose. . . . Second, [courts] address whether the challenged law promotes that purpose." Erotic Serv. Provider Legal Educ. & Rsch. Project v. Gascon, 880 F.3d 450, 457 (9th Cir. 2018), amended, 881 F.3d 792 (9th Cir. 2018). "Under rational basis review, courts 'do not require that the government's action actually advance its stated purposes, but merely look to see whether the government could have had a legitimate reason for acting as it did.'" Kheriaty v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., No. SACV211367JVSKESX, 2021 WL 6298332, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 8, 2021) (quoting Wedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. City of Phoenix, 24 F.3d 56, 66 (9th Cir. 1994)), [*32]  aff'd sub nom. Kheriaty v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 22-55001, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 32406, 2022 WL 17175070 (9th Cir. Nov. 23, 2022). Seeking to "stem[] the spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling interest." Roman Cath. Diocese v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67, 208 L. Ed. 2d 206 (2020). The vaccination policy states that its purpose "is to provide a safe work environment and protect the health and safety of City of Pasadena employees, and the public we serve, in compliance with Pasadena's Health Orders. . . ." Dkt 18, Ex. A at 5. Thus, there is a legitimate purpose for the City's vaccination policy.
The policy requiring employees to be vaccinated or wear masks and test for COVID-19 is rationally related to the interest of protecting the health and safety of employees and reducing the spread of COVID-19. The vaccination policy, which is dated August 31, 2021, explains that COVID cases had been on the rise, and "[r]ecent real-world evidence supports research findings that suggest authorized vaccines are highly protective against hospitalization and death from infection with the Delta variant, and people who are fully vaccinated are less likely to be contagious or transmit the virus to someone else." Id. at 5. This statement demonstrates a rational relationship between the City's interest in providing a healthy workplace and reducing the spread of COVID-19, and its choice [*33]  of policy measures. See George v. Grossmont Cuyamaca Cmty. Coll. Dist. Bd. of Governors, No. 22-CV-0424-BAS-DDL, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201835, 2022 WL 16722357, at *16 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 4, 2022) ("In concluding vaccine mandates are a rational method to reduce COVID-19 infection and the risk of serious illness, hospitalization, and death related thereto, the Court rests on all fours with its sister courts in the Ninth Circuit and other circuit courts."); Burcham, 562 F. Supp. at 707 (concluding that an ordinance requiring city employees to be vaccinated or wear a mask and undergo weekly testing was rationally related to the interest of preventing the spread of COVID-19).
Although Plaintiff argues that some studies have shown that vaccines, masks and testing are ineffective, "[t]he Due Process Clause does not require scientific consensus to justify government action." Burcham, 562 F. Supp. at 707 (quoting Guilfoyle v. Beutner, 2021 WL 4594780, at *16 (C.D. Cal. Sep. 14, 2021). Plaintiff also argues that requiring him to disclose his vaccination status violates his privacy interests "by the constant disclosure of his unvaccinated status to all his colleagues." Dkt. 22 at 16. However, the FAC does not expressly allege that the City disclosed his vaccination status to his colleagues.
For the foregoing reasons, the FAC fails to state a substantive due process claim. However, because Plaintiff may be able to amend the allegations in the FAC to allege a violation of his right to informational privacy, [*34]  this cause of action is dismissed without prejudice.
d) Count 10: Equal Protection
The header for Count 10 describes the cause of action as "Violation of Procedural Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution." Dkt. 15 at 14. However, the allegations as to this cause of action refer to the Equal Protection Clause. Id. ¶¶ 86-89. Therefore, this cause of action is construed, and then considered, as an Equal Protection claim.
The Equal Protection Clause provides that "[n]o state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Heightened scrutiny applies to claims under the Equal Protection Clause only when government action implicates a suspect classification or a fundamental right. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). To prevail on an equal protection claim where no suspect classification or fundamental right is implicated, a plaintiff must show that "(1) they are members of an identifiable class; (2) they were treated differently from others similarly situated; and (3) there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment." George, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201835, 2022 WL 16722357, at *10 (citing Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S. Ct. 1073, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1060 (2000)).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated his equal protection rights because it treated vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in different ways. Thus, it required him to take COVID-19 tests and wear a mask, but did not require vaccinated [*35]  individuals to do so. FAC ¶ 88. Plaintiff contends that Defendant "has not provided any basis for committing such acts" and "has not provided a shred of evidence that the two categories of individuals are in dissimilar positions." Id. ¶ 89.
Plaintiff has not shown that distinguishing between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals reflects a suspect classification, nor has he has shown that the City's vaccination policy infringes a fundamental right. See Williams v. Brown, 567 F. Supp. 3d 1213, 1227 (D. Or. 2021) ("[C]ourts have routinely rejected the argument that vaccine mandates will trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause and have instead applied rational basis review.") Thus, rational basis review applies. The inquiry is the same for equal protection claims as it is for substantive due process claims. Kheriaty, 2022 WL 17175070, at *2.
Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that the City did not have a rational basis for treating vaccinated and unvaccinated employees differently. As noted, the City's vaccination policy states that "people who are fully vaccinated are less likely to be contagious or transmit the virus to someone else." Dkt. 18 at 5. The California Department of Public Health's January 5, 2022 Guidance for the Use of Face Masks (January 5 Mask Guidance), which [*36]  the City attaches to its RJN, makes a similar statement: "Unvaccinated persons are more likely to get infected and spread the virus." Id. at 9. Such findings provide a rational basis for requiring employees who receive an exemption from the vaccination requirement to take additional precautions against COVID-19 transmission. See also Abadi v. City of New York, No. 21 CIV. 8071 (PAE), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21815, 2022 WL 347632, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2022) ("[T]he distinction [New York City's Executive Orders] draw between vaccinated and non-vaccinated persons has an amply rational basis.").
Kheriaty concluded that the vaccination mandate of the University of California satisfied rational basis review. Similarly, the "face of the [v]accine [p]olicy makes clear that the" City "considered scientific literature and evidence before deciding to require vaccination." Kheriaty, 2021 WL 6298332, at *8. Plaintiff argues that "[v]accinated individuals are more likely than unvaccinated individuals to get 'breakthrough' Covid-19 cases," Dkt. 22 at 16, but "under a rational basis review, it is not enough for a party to merely cite scientific studies challenging the government's classification policy," Kheriaty, 2022 WL 17175070 at *2 (affirming dismissal of substantive due process and equal protection challenges to vaccination requirement because "the school cited its own studies [*37]  that support its vaccination policy—and that is enough for the policy to survive rational basis review.").
The City has cited guidance from the California Department of Public Health that discusses studies that support the rationale for its vaccination policy. "[I]t is not the task of this Court to set public health care policy or to reach its own decision about how best to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. . . . The only proper function of the Court is to determine whether the State's decisions have a legitimate end, and a rational basis for achieving that end." Strong v. Zucker, No. 21-CV-6532L, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55438, 2022 WL 896525, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2022) (rejecting constitutional challenges to a state's COVID response and software system that collected information about individuals' vaccine status).
For these reasons, the City has shown that its policy has a rational basis, and Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for violation of his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. Because leave to amend would be futile, this claim is dismissed with prejudice.
e) Count 11: First Amendment Establishment Clause
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by "promulgating (or attempting to promulgate) a 'vaccine' mandate which fundamentally violates the rights of Christians such as Plaintiff." Dkt. 15 ¶ 91. He also alleges that imposing the [*38]  mandate was "hostile to religious people of all religions, and especially Christians" and "Defendant showed itself hostile to religious believers such as Plaintiff." Id. ¶ 93.
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment "provides that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishing of religion.'" Am. Legion v. Am. Humanist Ass'n, 139 S. Ct. 2067, 2080, 204 L. Ed. 2d 452 (2019). The conclusory allegations of the FAC are not sufficient to support a claim under the Establishment Clause. It does not sufficiently allege that the City engaged in conduct that would constitute the establishment of religion. The FAC does not expressly state a Free Exercise claim. However, Plaintiff appears to rely on such a theory in the portion of the Opposition that discusses the Fourteenth Amendment claims. See Dkt. 22 at 16 (citing Employment Div., Dep't of Hum. Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990) and stating: "In the present case, the testing requirements were applied only to unvaccinated individuals such as Plaintiff. The vaccine mandate was not 'neutral or generally applicable', therefore the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated in this case."). Defendant appears to anticipate both Free Exercise and Establishment Clause issues in its Motion. See Dkt. 17 at 19-20. However, even if the Establishment Clause cause of action is interpreted as including a claim under the Free Exercise Clause, the FAC does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
"The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment [*39] , prohibits laws 'prohibiting the free exercise' of religion. Am.'s Frontline Drs., 2022 WL 1514038, at *12 (quoting U.S. Const. amend. I). In analyzing Free Exercise claims, "[t]he threshold inquiry is whether a challenged law is 'neutral or generally applicable.'" Id. (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 881). "[L]aws incidentally burdening religion are ordinarily not subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause so long as they are neutral and generally applicable." Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1976 (2021). A government entity "fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature." Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877. A law is not generally applicable when it "'invite[s]' the government to consider the particular reasons for a person's conduct by providing 'a mechanism for individualized exemptions'" or when it "prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government's asserted interests in a similar way." Id. (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884). "A law is not generally applicable if the record before the court 'compels the conclusion" that suppression of religion or religious practice is the object of the law at issue.'" Bacon v. Woodward, No. 2:21-CV-0296-TOR, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 215778, 2021 WL 5183059, at *4 (E.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2021) (quoting Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534, 113 S. Ct. 2217, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1993)).
It is unclear whether Plaintiff seeks to raise a First Amendment challenge only to the vaccination requirement itself, or also to the requirement that exempt employees wear masks and undergo testing. The allegations in the FAC mention only the vaccination requirement, Dkt. 15 ¶¶ 90-93, but the Opposition raises issues as to the mask and testing matters. Dkt. 22 at 14-15. Because the FAC does not clearly plead a First Amendment challenge based on the mask and testing requirement, it is insufficient to state such a claim.
Where plaintiffs have brought challenges to "COVID-19 vaccination policies with exemptions and accommodations," courts have "separately analyze[d] [the] two parts" of the policies: "(1) the Mandate, and (2) the Accommodations." UnifySCC v. Cody, No. 22-CV-01019-BLF, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116386, 2022 WL 2357068, at *5 (N.D. Cal. June 30, 2022); see also George, 2022 WL 17330467, at *18 ("Moreover, Plaintiffs' Free Exercise Clause challenges to the Mandates and the Accommodation Frameworks inevitably will rely upon distinct sets of factual allegations and theories. That is, the latter must be predicated upon Plaintiffs' religious objections to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines, while the former must be predicated upon Plaintiffs' religious objections to antigen testing, face-mask compliance, or another [*40]  form of accommodation administered by the CCDs. For this reason, too, it is essential for Plaintiffs' Free Exercise Clause challenges to be pleaded separately and distinctly in order to provide Defendants with fair notice.") Thus, Plaintiff must clearly plead any challenge to the mask and testing requirements.
With respect to Plaintiff's objection to the vaccination requirement, "COVID-19 vaccination requirements have been held to be facially neutral when they apply to an entire category (i.e., all employees) and 'do[] not single out employees who decline vaccination on religious grounds.'" UnifySCC, 2022 WL 2357068, at *6 (quoting We the Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, 17 F.4th 266, 281 (2d Cir. 2021) (per curiam)); see also Bacon, 2021 WL 5183059, at *4 (city employee vaccination requirement deemed neutral because it applied to all employees, and "the City recognizes exemptions for those who qualify for accommodations due to their sincerely held religious beliefs"). Additionally, "[t]he existence of religious exemptions does not undermine facial neutrality." UnifySCC, 2022 WL 2357068, at *6 (citing Kane v. De Blasio, 29 F.4th 152, 165 (2d Cir. 2021)).
The FAC does not allege facts showing that the vaccination policy is neither neutral nor generally applicable. On its face, the policy applies to all employees. It treats religion differently only in that it offers an exemption from the requirement for those with sincerely [*41]  held religious beliefs. This does not show the absence of neutrality. See UnifySCC, 2022 WL 2357068, at *6. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the vaccine mandate of a school district was neutral and generally applicable even when it did not include any religious exemptions, because the interest advanced by the district was the "health and safety" of students. See Doe v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 19 F.4th 1173, 1180 (9th Cir. 2021), reconsideration en banc denied, 22 F.4th 1099 (9th Cir. 2022).
For these reasons, the FAC does not state a viable First Amendment claim. Because Plaintiff has suggested through the Opposition that he seeks to challenge the requirement that employees who receive an exemption wear masks and undergo testing, leave to amend is warranted. Thus, the Motion is granted without prejudice as to a claim under the Free Exercise Clause.
f) Count 12: 21 U.S.C. § 360
The FAC alleges that Defendant violated 21 USC § 360 bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(iii), which applies to Emergency Use Authorizations. It alleges that the statute provides, "[a]ppropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered must be informed of . . . the option to accept or refuse the administration of the product." Dkt. 15 ¶ 95. He alleges that Defendant violated the statute because it "did NOT provide Plaintiff the option of refusing the 'vaccine.'" Id. ¶ 96.
This argument lacks merit [*42]  for several reasons. The vaccination policy sent to Plaintiff, which is attached as an exhibit to the FAC, states that employees may elect to defer vaccination until after one of the vaccines receives final FDA approval. Dkt. 15, Ex. 2 at 6. Further, the informed consent requirement of the emergency use authorization applies only to medical providers, not to employers, so long as the employer is not directly administering the vaccine. Burcham, 562 F. Supp. 3d at 707-08.
Plaintiff argues that "the emergency use authorization, indeed the very existence of an 'emergency' with respect to Covid proved to be capriciously based, and recently lifted. . . . It seems that the 'emergency' referred to by Defendant never really existed, or if it did, it was based on an extremely capricious basis." Dkt. 22 at 9. This is irrelevant to whether the City violated Plaintiff's rights by implementing its vaccination policy. Because leave to amend would be futile, this cause of action is dismissed with prejudice.
g) Counts 13 and 19: Right to Informed Consent and 21 C.F.R. § 50, et seq.
Count 13 of the FAC alleges that Defendant violated Plaintiff's right to informed consent, and cites Schloendorff v Soc'y of N.Y. Hosp., 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92, 93, (N.Y. 1914), abrogated by Bing v. Thunig, 2 N.Y.2d 656, 143 N.E. 2d 3, 163 N.Y.S.2d 3 (N.Y. 1957), and the Nuremberg Code. FAC ¶¶ 98-100. It alleges that it did [*43]  so by "forcing Plaintiff to choose between his job and the vaccine (or mask and test)." Id. ¶ 101. Plaintiff argues that this is a federal cause of action because the Nuremberg Code has been incorporated into Federal regulations, "including 21 C.F.R. § 50.23 and § 50.245." Dkt 22 at 5. The citation to § 50.245 appears to be in error, and may be referring to § 50.24.
Nowhere in the allegations in support of Count 13 does Plaintiff refer to any federal regulations. However, even assuming that the Thirteenth Cause of Action is based on common law that has been incorporated into 21 C.F.R. §§ 50, et seq., such regulations do not provide a cause of action here because they apply only to clinical trials. 21 C.F.R. § 50.1(a) ("This part applies to all clinical investigations regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under sections 505(i) and 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits for products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. . . .").
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant failed to oppose Count 13 because its briefing did not expressly address the claim. Dkt. 22 at 6. Defendant replies that it did so in arguing that all of Plaintiff's federal claims should be dismissed. Dkt. 23 at 15; see also Dkt. 17 at 12-15 ("As [*44]  every single one of Plaintiff's federal claims is based on a challenge to this lawful policy, each of these claims are fundamentally flawed. They should be dismissed, without leave to amend."). Additionally, Defendant separately opposed Count 19, and to the extent that Plaintiff conceptualizes Count 13 as a federal cause of action, it appears to be co-extensive with Count 19, which alleges violations of 21 C.F.R. §§ 50, et. seq. See Dkt. 17 at 22. Therefore, even if Count 13 is deemed a federal cause of action, Defendant has opposed it.
In the Opposition, Plaintiff cites the absence of evidence of a genuine emergency that justified ignoring informed consent requirements. Dkt. 22 at 5-8. Plaintiff does not cite to specific legal authority to support this position, but he may be relying on 21 C.F.R. § 50.23, to which the FAC refers and which provides: "The obtaining of informed consent shall be deemed feasible unless . . . both the investigator and a physician who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify" that several conditions exist, including that "[t]he human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation necessitating the use of the test article." § 50.23(a). Again, this informed consent requirement [*45]  applies to clinical trials.
Plaintiff also attempts to bring a claim under the Nuremberg Code as part of Count 13. The FAC alleges that "the Nuremberg Code, (binding on the United States), also prohibits [t]he intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion. . . .'" FAC ¶ 100 (emphasis omitted). However, "there is no private right of action for violations of the Nuremberg Code." Ward v. Schaefer, No. CV 16-12543-FDS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60736, 2021 WL 1178291 (D. Mass. Mar. 29, 2021).
Because 21 C.F.R. §§ 50, et seq plainly does not apply to this action and because Plaintiff cannot bring a claim under the Nuremberg Code, Counts 13 and 19 must be dismissed as presently alleged, and any amendment would be futile on these grounds. However, the dismissal as to Count 13 is without prejudice because whether a viable claim could be presented under New York common law need not be addressed because the only challenge to state law claims is that supplemental jurisdiction should not be exercised.
h) Count 18: Thirteenth Amendment
The FAC alleges that Defendant's requirement that Plaintiff wear a mask violates the Thirteenth Amendment because it is a "badge of slavery and obedience." Dkt. 15 ¶ 130. It also alleges that "the imposition of masks serves no other purpose than to humiliate Plaintiff, [*46]  to make sure that he understands that he is in a dominated position." Id. ¶ 128. Plaintiff argues that the requirement to wear a mask constitutes a badge of slavery because "inhibiting Plaintiff's right to breathe most definitely involves a restraint upon [his] . . . fundamental rights and freedoms." Dkt. 22 at 17. Defendant argues that "Plaintiff's argument that any restraint on freedom amounts to a badge of slavery is simply unsupported, incorrect, and offensive." Dkt. 23 at 14.
The Thirteenth Amendment prohibits slavery and gives Congress the power to enact legislation abolishing "badges and incidents of slavery." See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439, 88 S. Ct. 2186, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1189 (1968). The Thirteenth Amendment does not apply here. See Joseph v. Becerra, No. 22-CV-40-WMC, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214302, 2022 WL 17262231, at *6 (W.D. Wis. Nov. 29, 2022) ("As other district courts have explained, the inconvenience of wearing a mask to prevent communicable disease does not plausibly or even remotely equate to any form of slavery."); Kagy v. Sterling Hills Golf Course, 211 F. App'x 563, 565 (9th Cir. 2006) ("The Thirteenth Amendment provides individuals with the right to be free from involuntary servitude; it does not afford protection from discrimination more generally."). Further, Plaintiff does not allege any racially discriminatory conduct on the part of the City; rather, he alleges that the requirement that he wear a mask "serves no useful purpose other than to put Plaintiff in his place for [*47]  having the temerity to resist the 'vaccine' mandate." Dkt. 15 ¶ 130; see City of Memphis v. Greene, 451 U.S. 100, 126, 101 S. Ct. 1584, 67 L. Ed. 2d 769 (1981) ("We begin our examination of respondents' Thirteenth Amendment argument by reiterating the conclusion that the record discloses no racially discriminatory motive on the part of the City Council.").
For these reasons, the Thirteenth Amendment claim is dismissed with prejudice.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons stated in this Order, the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. The Motion is granted WITHOUT PREJUDICE, i.e., with leave to amend as to Counts 7, 8, 11, and 13. It is granted WITH PREJUDICE, i.e., without leave to amend as to Counts 10, 12, 18, and 19.
Plaintiff shall file any amended complaint within 14 days of the issuance of this Order. A decision on Defendant's request as to declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims is DEFERRED until any amended complaint is filed, and its amended claims reviewed.
