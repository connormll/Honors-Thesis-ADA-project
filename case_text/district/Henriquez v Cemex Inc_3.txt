Opinion



Proceedings: Order (1) GRANTING Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and/or Strike (Dkt. No. 13); (2) VACATING the January 9, 2023 Hearing; and (3) ORDERING Defendants to File Supplement to Notice of Removal and Plaintiff to Allege Amount in Controversy (IN CHAMBERS)
Before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss and/or Strike under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(f) filed by [*2]  Defendants. ("Motion," Dkt. No. 13.) The Court determines this matter is appropriate for resolution without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. After considering all papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court GRANTS the Motion. The January 9, 2023 hearing is VACATED.

I. BACKGROUND
On July 1, 2022, Plaintiff Anthony Henriquez ("Plaintiff" or "Mr. Henriquez") filed this action in San Bernardino Superior Court. ("Notice of Removal," Dkt. No. 1.) On September 19, 2022, Defendant Cemex Construction Materials Pacific LLC removed the action. (Id.) On September 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants Cemex, Inc.; Cemex Construction Materials Pacific, LLC; Cemex California Cement, LLC; and Does 1-100 (collectively, "Defendants"). ("FAC," Dkt. No. 9.) The FAC alleges six causes of action: (1) disability discrimination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940; (2) failure to accommodate, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m); (3) retaliation under Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h) and Cal. Lab. Code. § 132a; (4) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code §§ 12940(i) and 12940(k); (5) failure to engage in the interactive process, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); and (6) wrongful termination in violation [*3]  of public policy. (Id.) On September 30, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation extending the time for Defendants to file a responsive pleading to October 25, 2022. (Dkt. No. 12.)
On October 25, 2022, Defendants filed the Motion. (Motion.) On November 14, 2022, Plaintiff opposed. ("Opposition," Dkt. No. 14.) On November 21, 2022, Defendants replied. ("Reply," Dkt. No. 15.) On December 2, 2022, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion from December 5, 2022 to December 12, 2022. (Dkt. No. 16.) On December 9, 2022, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion from December 12, 2022 to December 19, 2022. (Dkt. No. 17.) On December 15, 2022, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion from December 19, 2022 to January 9, 2023. (Dkt. No. 18.)

II. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Plaintiff alleges the following facts, which are assumed to be true for purposes of this Motion.
Plaintiff was employed by Defendants in Cemex's cement quarry in Apple Valley, California, from November 2019 to January 21, 2022. (FAC ¶ 10.) He worked as a Tower Attendant. (Id.) During his employment at Cemex, Mr. Henriquez received positive informal performance reviews, salary raises and was promoted. (Id.)
On or about December [*4]  30, 2021, Plaintiff "suffered a dismemberment injury in the course and scope of employment." (Id. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff was working under the direction of his supervisor, attempting to troubleshoot a machine. (Id.) Plaintiff had not worked on the machine previously. (Id.) Three of Mr. Enriquez's co-workers were also working on the machine, in addition to Plaintiff and his supervisor. (Id.) While working on the machine, Plaintiff's hand became stuck as he was trying, per his supervisor's instructions, to place the lid on a certain part of the equipment. (Id.) Though he was wearing a glove, the force of the machine's moving parts severed two fingers on his right hand. (Id.)
Plaintiff filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. (Id. ¶ 12.) Approximately a week after the accident, Plaintiff was interviewed by Defendants' human resources manager. (Id.) During that interview, "he requested to make a statement regarding the circumstances of his injury and his ability to perform his job going forward." (Id.) Defendants "refused to allow [him] to make any statement and made no attempt to engage in the interactive process to discuss any possible accommodations." (Id.)
On or about January 21, [*5]  2022, Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment. (Id. ¶ 13.) The stated reason for doing so was that Plaintiff had purportedly violated the company's safety policy by failing to ensure that the machine's power was off at the time Plaintiff, his supervisor and co-workers were working on the machine. (Id.) Defendants' stated reason was pretextual, in that the machine had to be in operation to enable the work that Plaintiff's supervisor instructed him to do. (Id.) Plaintiff's supervisor was not injured; he was suspended for two days for his role in the incident. (Id.) Plaintiff's three co-workers were not injured, disciplined, or terminated, "even though they presumably were equally responsible for any purported safety violation." (Id.)
In January 2022, the Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) of the United States Department of Labor investigated the incident. (Id. ¶ 14.) On or about January 31, 2022, MSHA issued a report that found Defendants had violated certain safety regulations. (Id.) MSHA issued two citations against Defendants for the incident. (Id.) MSHA did not conclude that Plaintiff was at fault for the incident. (Id.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Rule 12(b)(6)
Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may bring a [*6]  motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Rule 12(b)(6) must be read in conjunction with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which requires a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that a pleader is entitled to relief," in order to give the defendant "fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); see Ileto v. Glock Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, 1199-1200 (9th Cir. 2003). When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept all material allegations in the complaint—as well as any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them—as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Doe v. United States, 419 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2005); ARC Ecology v. U.S. Dep't of Air Force, 411 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2005); Moyo v. Gomez, 32 F.3d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994). Courts are not required, however, "to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences." Hartman v. Gilead Scis., Inc. (In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig.), 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal citation and quotation omitted). Courts also need not accept as true allegations that contradict facts which may be judicially noticed. See Mullis v. U.S. Bankr. Court, 828 F.2d 1385, 1388 (9th Cir. 1987).
"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitlement to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted). Rather, [*7]  the allegations in the complaint "must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id.
To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570; Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 'entitlement to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). The Ninth Circuit has clarified that (1) a complaint must "contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively," and (2) "the factual allegations that are taken as true must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation." Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).

B. Rule 12(f)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that a party may request that the court strike "any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). "'Immaterial' matter is [*8]  that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the defenses being pleaded[,]" while "'[i]mpertinent' matter consists of statements that do not pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question." Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir. 1993) (citations omitted), rev'd on other grounds by Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994). "'Redundant' allegations are those that are needlessly repetitive or wholly foreign to the issues involved in the action." Cal. Dep't of Toxic Substances Control v. Alco Pac., Inc., 217 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1033 (C.D. Cal. 2002). The grounds for a motion to strike must appear on the face of the pleading under attack. S.E.C. v. Sands, 902 F. Supp. 1149, 1165 (C.D. Cal. 1995), aff'd by 142 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 1998).
In addition, the Court must view the pleading under attack in the light more favorable to the pleader when ruling upon a motion to strike. In re 2TheMart.com, Inc. Sec. Litig., 114 F. Supp. 2d 955, 965 (C.D. Cal. 2000). "If there is any doubt whether the portion to be stricken might bear on an issue in the litigation, the court should deny the motion." Platte Anchor Bolt, Inc. v. IHI, Inc., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1057 (N.D. Cal. 2004). Courts generally do not determine disputed or substantial questions of fact or law on a motion to strike. See Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir. 2010); ACT, Inc. v. Worldwide Interactive Network, Inc., 46 F.4th 489, 499 (6th Cir. 2022).
"Motions to strike are generally regarded with disfavor because of the limited importance of pleading in federal practice, and because they are often used as a delaying tactic." Cal. Dep't of Toxic Substances Control, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 1033; see also Bureerong v. Uvawas, 922 F. Supp. 1450, 1478 (C.D. Cal. 1996). However, courts will grant motions to strike in order "to avoid the expenditure of time and money that must [*9]  arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial." Whittlestone, 618 F.3d at 973 (quoting Fantasy, 984 F.2d at 1527). The "possibility that superfluous pleadings will cause the trier of fact to draw 'unwarranted' inferences at trial is the type of prejudice that will support the granting of a motion to strike." Id. "Ultimately, whether to grant a motion to strike lies within the sound discretion of the district court." Cal. Dep't of Toxic Substances Control, 217 F. Supp. 2d at 1033 (citing Fantasy, 984 F.2d at 1528).

C. Rule 15
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 ("Rule 15") provides that leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The Ninth Circuit has held that "'[t]his policy is to be applied with extreme liberality.'" Eminence Capital, L.L.C. v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2001)). Generally, a "district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by allegation of other facts." Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

IV. DISCUSSION

A. First Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination
FEHA prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics, including physical or mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). To state a prima facie claim of discrimination under FEHA, a plaintiff must allege: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he [*10]  was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) some other circumstance suggests a discriminatory motive. Kelleher v. Hertz Corp., 479 F. App'x 778 (9th Cir. 2012); Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 355, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). To state a disparate treatment disability discrimination claim under FEHA, a plaintiff must allege that he "(1) suffered from a disability or was regarded as suffering from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of a job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialists, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 31, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 809 (2021). "California defines adverse employment actions as those 'materially affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.'" Hicks v. Netflix, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 3d 763, 775 (C.D. Cal. 2020) (quoting Flores v. City of Westminster, 873 F.3d 739, 748 (9th Cir. 2017)).
Under FEHA, a physical condition must limit a major life activity before it constitutes a disability. Cal. Govt. Code § 12926(m)(2)(B). "Major life activities" are broadly construed and include "physical, mental, and social activities and working." Id. § 12926(m)(1)(B)(iii).
Under the third element of a FEHA disability discrimination claim, the employer must have taken an adverse employment action "because of" an employee's disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). The disability must have been "a substantial motivating factor" for the [*11]  employment decision. Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 214, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013). A plaintiff satisfies this prong by plausibly alleging similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably or by plausibly alleging other circumstances surrounding the adverse employment action give rise to an inference of discrimination. Hawn v. Executive Jet Management, Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010); Peterson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 358 F.3d 599, 603 (9th Cir. 2004).
Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to show that he suffered a disability covered by FEHA. (Motion at 11.) First, Defendants note that, while Plaintiff alleges that he suffered a workplace accident resulting in the loss of two fingers, "he does not allege any facts as to how the injury limits a major life activity, such as whether the injury affected or impaired his ability to do his job as a Tower Attendant." (Id.) Plaintiff does not allege any facts regarding his job duties or what, if any, physical activities were required for his job as a Tower Attendant. (Id.) Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to establish a causal nexus, in that he does not allege beyond a conclusory assertion that "Defendants committed disability discrimination" how Defendants made any adverse employment decision "because of" Plaintiff's disability. (Id. at 13.)
Plaintiff's [*12]  response presents a compelling case that he could plausibly allege a disability discrimination claim while sidestepping the unmistakable conclusion that he has failed to do so. Plaintiff first argues at length that Defendants' reliance on Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) cases is misplaced because the ADA limits its coverage to physical or mental conditions that "substantially limit" a major life activity, while FEHA requires only that the condition "limit" the major life activity. (Opposition at 13-14.) While a correct statement of law, it makes little difference here; Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts regarding limitations to any "major life activity," "substantial" or not.1 Second, Plaintiff argues that "losing fingers plainly affects one of the body's 'major systems,' namely, the ability to grip, grasp and manually manipulate objects, one of the hallmark abilities of homo sapiens." (Id. at 15.) Moreover, "it is obvious that missing two fingers uniquely limits one's ability to perform manual tasks, for it makes performing such tasks 'difficult' in myriad ways." (Id.) (emphasis in original.) Accordingly, Plaintiff cites numerous examples of possible limitations to major life activities, ranging from "working [*13]  with tools" and "typing" to social activities like "playing cards." (Id. at 16.) In his view, because Plaintiff "was a manual laborer in a cement quarry, meaning he had to work with tools and machines . . . [i]t is obvious—or at least a fair inference from the FAC's allegations—that Henriquez's loss of two fingers would have made his work tasks more difficult for him as compared to other employees who have all ten fingers." (Id.)
The Court harbors little doubt that the loss of two fingers could plausibly limit Plaintiff's ability to perform his work as a manual laborer. But the energy expended in Plaintiff's seven pages of legal argument opposing dismissal of the first cause of action would have been better directed toward alleging facts in a complaint explaining how the loss of fingers limited one or more major life activities.2 The Court is persuaded that Plaintiff's burden in this regard is likely not very high when he alleges "anatomical loss" — such a situation is clearly distinguishable from, say, hospitalization for pancreatitis that caused an employee to miss less than a week of work. See, e.g., Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1249, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008). Indeed, a few sentences of explanation would likely suffice. But Defendants are [*14]  correct that Plaintiff does not allege a single fact in the FAC regarding (1) what, if any, major life activity is limited; (2) whether the loss of two fingers limited his ability to perform his work, and if so, how; (3) the nature of his work, including what physical tasks he was required to perform as a Tower Attendant; or why, after the accident, he "could perform the essential duties of [the] job with or without reasonable accommodations." Zamora, 71 Cal. App. 5th at 31. Moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiff essentially asks the Court to hold as a matter of law that anyone who loses a finger is disabled under FEHA, because such a conclusion is so "obvious" that it obviates the need to plead with specificity. (See Reply at 3.) That some courts have held an individual who lost a finger was not disabled clearly demonstrates the Court cannot make such a sweeping finding. See, e.g., Nealy v. Patterson Dental Supply, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31788, 2005 WL 3132182, at *3-4 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 22, 2005) (granting summary judgment for defendant and finding that plaintiff who suffered two severed fingers to dominant hand was not disabled because she presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the injury prevented or severely restricted her from performing a major life activity); Barger v. Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 945, 1999 WL 51797, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 1, 1999) (granting summary judgment for defendant [*15]  and finding that plaintiff with two severed fingers on right hand did not demonstrate that he was substantially limited in any life activity). Because Plaintiff fails to make the requisite factual showing, he does not state a claim for relief. See Mayfield v. Trevors Store, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24576, 2004 WL 2806175, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2004) (Plaintiff failed to allege under FEHA which physiological functions were affected by her pregnancy and which major life activities were thus impaired); Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 47, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006) (stating that, under FEHA, it is "insufficient [to] . . . simply allege a disability or to identify an injury or physical condition," because the plaintiff must "demonstrate his injury or physical condition . . . makes 'difficult' the achieve of work or some other major life activity"); Olson v. Mono Cnty. Superior Ct., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58756, 2014 WL 1671586, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 28, 2014) (dismissing FEHA disability claim with leave to amend because Plaintiff had only set forth the elements of the claim in conclusory fashion without requisite factual showing); Phomthevy v. WinCo Holdings, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120083, 2019 WL 3067105, at *3 (E.D. Cal. July 12, 2019) ("Although the statutory definitions of 'physical and mental disabilities' should be broadly applied, . . . at a minimum a disability claim under FEHA requires the claimant to allege a qualifying ailment that affects a bodily system, . . . and limits a major life activity. . . Indeed, it is insufficient simply to allege a disability [*16]  or to identify an injury or physical condition") (internal quotations, citation and ellipses omitted); Bell v. Univ. of Cal. Davis Med. Ctr., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64594, 2013 WL 1896318, at *3 (E.D. Cal. May 6, 2013), report and recommendation adopted, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82088, 2013 WL 2664552 (E.D. Cal. June 11, 2013) (noting that, because the ADA defines disability with specificity as a term of art, "not all individuals having what might commonly be perceived as physical or mental disabilities are protected by the ADA. Merely having an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA"); Sanders v. Arneson Prods., Inc., 91 F.3d 1351, 1354 n.2 (9th Cir. 1996) ("A person may be 'disabled' in the ordinary usage sense, or even for purposes of receiving disability benefits from the government, yet still not be 'disabled' under the ADA"). As it possible (indeed, highly likely) that Plaintiff can cure the deficiencies in his pleadings through the allegation of other facts, the claim is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. See Lopez, 203 F.3d at 1127.
Assuming Plaintiff cited sufficient facts to support the first and second elements of a disability discrimination claim, the Court would disagree with Defendants' second argument regarding a causal nexus between discovery of Plaintiff's disability and the decision to terminate his employment. (See Motion at 13.) To state the third element of a FEHA disability discrimination claim, Plaintiff must allege [*17]  sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the disability was a "substantial motivating factor" for the decision to terminate him. See Harris, 56 Cal. 4th at 214. Mr. Henriquez can satisfy this prong by plausibly alleging that similarly situated individuals outside his protected class (i.e. nondisabled workers) were treated more favorably. See Hawn, 615 F.3d at 1156; Peterson, 358 F.3d at 603. Plaintiff does this by alleging that (1) Defendants terminated him; (2) Plaintiff was injured while attempting to fix the machine, but his supervisor and three co-workers were not; (3) Defendants did not discipline or terminate his co-workers, while only suspending Plaintiff's supervisor for two days; and (4) Defendants' reason for terminating Plaintiff was pretextual, because the machine had to be in operation to do the work that Plaintiff's supervisor instructed him to perform. (See FAC ¶ 13.) Accordingly, Plaintiff plausibly alleges that he was terminated because of his disability (assuming, again, that he had properly plead how the loss of two fingers constituted a disability) when nondisabled employees were treated more favorably. In his amended complaint, Plaintiff is welcome to allege facts such as "who made the decision Plaintiff purports to challenge and when [*18]  they knew of his alleged disability" (Motion at 13) but the Court does not find he is required to do so to state a claim.
For these reasons, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to the first cause of action and dismisses the claim WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

B. Second and Fifth Causes of Action: Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Under FEHA, an employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled employee is a violation of the statute in and of itself. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m). The elements of a failure to accommodate claim are (1) the plaintiff has a disability under FEHA, (2) the plaintiff is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability. Scotch v. Art Institute of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1009-10, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "'Reasonable accommodation' means a 'modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables a disabled employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired.'" Achal v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., 114 F. Supp. 3d 781 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(p). An employer who fails to continue to accommodate an employee's need may be held liable. See Nigro v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 784 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2015).
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, [*19]  if any, in response to a request for accommodation by an employee . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). To state a prima facie case for failure to engage in the interactive process, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she "tender[ed] a specific request for a necessary accommodation." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000)). "FEHA requires an informal process with the employee to attempt to identify reasonable accommodations, not necessarily ritualized discussions." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 379, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (2015). "Both employer and employee have the obligation 'to keep communications open' and neither has 'a right to obstruct the process.'" Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1014 (2009) (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 266, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)). "Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous." Id. at 1013.
Defendants appear to make two arguments regarding Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim: first, that it fails because he does not allege that he "triggered Defendant[s'] duty to consider an accommodation by informing the Company of the condition requiring accommodation, communicating his limitations, and requesting a specific accommodation" and second, that Plaintiff fails to allege how he was qualified to perform his job despite the injury and what, if any, accommodations would allow to do so. (See Motion at [*20]  14-15.) The Court agrees with the latter argument but not the former.
As Plaintiffs explain at length in the Opposition, it makes little sense to find an employer liable for failing to accommodate an employee's specific requests for accommodation but not an employer who fires the employee before he has had an opportunity to explain that he wishes to retain his job and believes he is capable of performing it with certain accommodations. In other words, "Cemex does not get to benefit from its swift and absolute violation of the law—it cannot argue the FAC is insufficient precisely because it shut Henriquez down before he could even discuss specific modifications of work duties that would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of his job." (Opposition at 22.) Under such a theory, "no employee could assert a failure to accommodate cause of action as long as the employer acts fast enough to fire that employee before any detailed accommodation discussion could take place." (Id.) The case law Defendants cite is not to the contrary. Defendants cite King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 443, for the proposition that an "employee is required to make [a] specific request for accommodation and to provide 'a concise list of [*21]  restrictions which must be met to accommodate the employee.'" (Motion at 14.) King, in turn, quotes Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, which states that "[i]t is an employee's responsibility to understand his or her own physical or mental condition well enough to present the employer at the earliest opportunity with a concise list of restrictions which must be met to accommodate the employee." Id. at 266. Defendants also cite Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000) for the proposition that a "plaintiff is required 'to tender a specific request for a necessary accommodation" (Motion at 14), but neglect to include the complete sentence: "An employee whose disability is not apparent is therefore obliged to tender a specific request for a necessary accommodation." Id. at 1380 (emphasis added). This is in accordance with the familiar principles that an "employee cannot demand clairvoyance of his employer" and that an employee cannot "expect the employer to read his mind and know he secretly wanted a particular accommodation and sue the employer for not providing it[,] [n]or is an employer ordinarily liable for failing to accommodate a disability of which it had no knowledge." King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 443 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, it appears that Cemex would have been aware of Plaintiff's [*22]  disability, assuming the loss of two fingers constituted one, because Cemex's reason for terminating him, whether pretextual or not, referenced the accident. Because the purported disability was thus "apparent," there is minimal danger that Cemex would be held liable for failing to accommodate a disability it had no knowledge of. Though Plaintiff almost certainly did not provide Cemex "a concise list of restrictions which must be met to accommodate" him, Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 266, he also alleges that was fired before he was able to do so, which hardly makes it a defense that he did not present Cemex with such a request "at the earliest opportunity." Id. Moreover, "[a]n employee is not required to specifically invoke the protections of FEHA or speak any 'magic words' in order to effectively request an accommodation under the statute." Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc., 5 Cal. App. 5th 570, 598, 210 Cal. Rptr. 3d 59 (2016); see also Prilliman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935, 954, 62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 142 (1997); Avila, 165 Cal. App. 4th at 1252. By alleging that (1) he requested to make a statement "regarding the circumstances of his injury and his ability to perform his job going forward" to a human resources manager a week after the incident and (2) Defendants "refused to allow [him] to make any statement" and thereafter made no attempt to discuss any possible accommodations before firing him, Plaintiff [*23]  states a plausible theory of relief for both a failure to reasonably accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process. (See FAC ¶ 12.)
However, Plaintiff fails to state a reasonable accommodation claim for similar reasons to his disability discrimination claim. To plead a failure to accommodate claim, a plaintiff must allege that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position with or without accommodation. Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1009-10; Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262-63, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007). Plaintiff alleges a single conclusory assertion in support of his reasonable accommodation claim, alleging that Defendants "unreasonably failed to accommodate Plaintiff after his injury" and "crafting an appropriate accommodation for Plaintiff would not have subjected Defendants to an undue burden." (FAC ¶ 26.) Mr. Henriquez appears to be under the mistaken impression that, because Cemex fired him before he could request an accommodation, he need not allege "facts as to the accommodation he required, if any, the work restrictions or modified duty necessary to accommodate his disability, the physical requirements for his job that would require accommodation, or whether he was qualified to perform his job with or without accommodations." (Opposition [*24]  at 22.) But it does not follow that Cemex's alleged refusal to listen to any request absolves him of the requirement to allege what he might have said had he been given the opportunity. It remains his burden to demonstrate that he is a qualified individual under FEHA, "that is, a person 'who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions' of [his] job." Green, 42 Cal. 4th at 261 (citation omitted). Accordingly, Plaintiff must allege facts regarding what, if any, accommodations he required to perform the essential functions of his job; what, if any, work restrictions or modified duties would be necessary to accommodate any disability; and why he was qualified to perform his job without or without any accommodation. For that reason, and that reason alone, Plaintiff also fails to state a claim for failure to engage in the interactive process; dismissal of the second cause of action necessarily requires dismissal of the fifth. See Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999). Because Plaintiff may allege other facts that could support these causes of action, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to the second and fifth causes of action and DISMISSES them WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

C. Third Cause of Action: Retaliation
Under FEHA, an employer [*25]  may not retaliate or discriminate against any person because "the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). An employer also may not retaliate or discriminate against an individual "for requesting an accommodation . . . regardless of whether the request was granted." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under [] FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity, (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020 (internal quotation omitted); Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005). California Labor Code Section 132 makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate "against any employee because he or she has filed or made known his or her intention to file a claim for [workers'] compensation with his or her employer." Cal. Lab. Code § 132a(1).
In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges that Cemex retaliated against him for requesting accommodations, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h), and for filing a workers' compensation claim, in violation of Cal. Lab. Code § 132a(1). (FAC ¶ 33.) In his Opposition, however, Plaintiff appears to argue that the subsection under which [*26]  he brings his disability retaliation claim is 12940(m)(2), not 12940(h), which bars retaliation against an individual who makes a request for accommodation. (See Opposition at 25.) In reliance on the FAC's reference to the latter provision, Defendants argue that the disability retaliation claim fails because to "establish a FEHA retaliation claim, Plaintiff must show that he made a complaint of disability discrimination, which he does not." (Motion at 16.) Pursuant to amendments to FEHA effective January 1, 2016, however, subsection (m)(2) provides a cause of action when an employer retaliates against an employee for requesting an accommodation, regardless of whether the request was granted. Castro-Ramirez v. Dependable Highway Express, Inc., 2 Cal. App. 5th 1028, 1049, 207 Cal. Rptr. 3d 120 (2016); Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2).
The problem for Plaintiff is that the facts he alleges in the FAC contradict his legal conclusion that "Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff by terminating him based on the fact that Plaintiff . . . requested accommodations for his disability." (FAC ¶ 33.) As noted above, Plaintiff alleges that he was terminated before he had an opportunity to "discuss any possible accommodations." (Id. ¶ 12.) The Court has held that Plaintiff asserts a viable theory of relief for failure to accommodate when he requests "to make a statement [*27]  regarding the circumstances of his injury and his ability to perform his job going forward" but Defendants "refused to allow [him] to make any statement and made no attempt to engage in the interactive process to discuss any possible accommodations." (Id.) In the context of a failure to accommodate claim, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that an employer should not benefit from "act[ing] fast enough to fire that employee before any detailed accommodation discussion could take place," at least when the employee attempts to initiate that discussion. (Opposition at 22.) But it is a step too far to find that Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff under such a theory. For one, Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff for the mere act of attempting to initiate that discussion. The inference from the FAC is that Defendants had made up their mind to fire Plaintiff (whether due to his disability or not) by the time he met with a human resources manager, which is why Defendants were not interested in listening to what Plaintiff had to say. (See FAC ¶¶ 11-13.) Assuming Plaintiff is correct that Defendants' stated rationale was pretextual, as the Court must at this [*28]  stage, that would constitute disability discrimination, but it does not constitute retaliation, based on Plaintiff engaging in some sort of protected activity. Put another way, Plaintiff fails to establish "a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1020. Second, the text of Section 12940(m)(2) is clear: it provides that an employer may not retaliate against an individual "for requesting an accommodation . . . regardless of whether the request was granted." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2). Plaintiff cites no authority, and the Court is not aware of any, that would support a reading of this provision that runs counter to its plain meaning, allowing for a retaliation cause of action when an employee does not request an accommodation, even if that is because his interactions with his former employer were cut short before he would have done so. Based on the factual narrative he alleges in the FAC, it is unlikely that Plaintiff could allege facts in support of a theory that Defendants retaliated against him for engaging in a protected activity, but the Court will afford Plaintiff an opportunity to do so. Accordingly, it GRANTS the Motion as to the FEHA retaliation claim and DISMISSES the allegations of [*29]  the third cause of action underpinning it WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
Defendants also challenge Plaintiff's retaliation claim under Labor Code Section 132a, arguing that it is barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity doctrine. (Motion at 16.) The parties debate the import of City of Moorpark, et al., Petitioners v. The Superior Court of Ventura County, Respondent, Theresa L. Dillon, Real Party in Interest., 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998), where the California Supreme Court held that Section 132a, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees who are injured in the course and scope of employment, is not a plaintiff's exclusive remedy for discrimination, and thus FEHA and common law remedies remain available. Defendants argue that Moorpark rejected the proposition that Section 132 provides the exclusive remedy for alleged discrimination, whereas here, given that Plaintiff's FEHA discrimination claim fails, his retaliation claim based on an alleged request for workers' compensation is barred by the exclusivity doctrine. (Reply at 8.) But courts in this District have extended Moorpark to the retaliation context, finding that, "[a]lthough Moorpark addresses a disability discrimination claim, not a retaliation claim, the reasoning followed in Moorpark applies with equal weight" when a plaintiff alleges that he was terminated for filing or making known his intention to file for [*30]  workers' compensation. See Keshe v. CVS Pharmacy Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46782, 2016 WL 1367702, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 5, 2016), aff'd sub nom. Keshe v. CVS Pharmacy, 711 F. App'x 396 (9th Cir. 2017). The Keshe court, applying Moorpark, reasoned that "retaliatory termination is similarly outside the compensation bargain, as it acts to prevent the employee from participating in the compensation bargain at all." Id. It thus held that the Workers' Compensation Act did not provide the exclusive remedy for a retaliatory termination claim and thus that the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the claim. Id. Other courts have reasoned similarly. See, e.g., Gwin v. Target Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139891, 2013 WL 5424711, at *8-11 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 27, 2013) (finding that Section 132a did not provide the exclusive remedy for a violation of Labor Code § 98.6 and holding that the plaintiff stated a claim when he was subject to discrimination and discharge for filing claims for workers' compensation); Crisostomo v. Akima Facilities Mgmt., LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21466, 2014 WL 644495, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 2014) (rejecting argument that "all workers' compensation claims" cannot be heard in court due to Section 132a). Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that the Section 132a claim must be dismissed as a matter of law, or alternatively, that references to the provision must be stricken under Rule 12(f). (See Motion at 16, Reply at 9-10.)3
However, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for retaliation [*31]  based on filing a workers' compensation request. Defendants note that the FAC "is devoid of any essential facts and does not even allege the date on which [Plaintiff] filed a workers' compensation claim; whether he filed a workers' compensation claim before or after his termination; whether there are any facts showing that any managers knew that he had filed a workers' compensation claim; and whether any such managers were the decision makers in his termination." (Reply at 8.) Such facts, especially the date on which Plaintiff filed his workers' compensation request, are essential to demonstrating causation. See Keshe, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46782, 2016 WL 1367702, at *7 (dismissing claim asserting retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim because the plaintiff filed it after his employer terminated him). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to the workers' compensation retaliation claim and DISMISSES the allegations of the third cause of action underpinning it WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.

D. Fourth and Sixth Causes of Action: Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation and Wrongful Termination
"Under California common law, although 'an at-will employee may be terminated for no reason, or for an arbitrary or irrational reason, [*32]  there can be no right to terminate for an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy.'" Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 748 (quoting Silo v. CHW Med. Found., 27 Cal. 4th 1097, 1104, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 698, 45 P.3d 1162 (2002)). "[T]his public policy exception to the at-will employment rule must be based on policies 'carefully tethered to fundamental policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions.'" Silo, 27 Cal. 4th at 1104 (internal citation omitted). "The elements of this tort are (1) the existence of a public policy and (2) a nexus between the public policy and an employee's termination." Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d at 749. "[D]isability discrimination can form the basis of a common law wrongful discharge claim." Moorpark, 18 Cal. 4th at 1161.
A FEHA failure to prevent claim requires evidence of a "fail[ure] to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). "A plaintiff seeking to recover on a failure to prevent discrimination claim under FEHA must show that (1) [he] was subjected to discrimination; (2) defendant failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination; and (3) this failure caused plaintiff to suffer injury, damage, loss or harm." Achal, 114 F. Supp. 3d at 804.
Courts have interpreted "a failure to prevent discrimination claim [to be] essentially derivative of a [FEHA] discrimination claim." Id.; Ravel v. Hewlett-Packard Enter., Inc., 228 F. Supp. 3d 1086, 1098 (E.D. Cal. 2017) [*33] . Thus, there can be no claim for failure to prevent discrimination unless an underlying discrimination claim survives. McKenzie v. San Joaquin Valley College, Inc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74537, 2017 WL 2129685, at *12 (C.D. Cal. May 15, 2017) (citing Trujillo v. North Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998)); see also Kohler v. Inter-Tel Technologies, 244 F.3d 1167, 1174 n.4 (9th Cir. 2001); Dickson v. Burke Williams, Inc., 234 Cal. App. 4th 1307, 1314-17, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 774 (2015), as modified on denial of reh'g (Mar. 24, 2015). The same is true for a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. See Walker v. Brand Energy Services, LLC, 726 F. Supp. 2d 1091, 1107 (E.D. Cal. 2010); Sanders v. Arneson Products, Inc., 91 F.3d 1351, 1354 (9th Cir. 1996); Jennings v. Marralle, 8 Cal. 4th 121, 135-136, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074 (1994). As addressed above, each of Plaintiff's FEHA and retaliation claims must be dismissed, which requires dismissal of the failure to prevent and wrongful termination in violation of public policy claims. Because the underlying claims are dismissed with leave to amend, the derivative claims are also dismissed with leave to amend. The Court thus GRANTS the Motion as to Plaintiff's fourth and sixth causes of action and DISMISSES them WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
In so holding, the Court observes that Plaintiff's sixth cause of action is not saved by Plaintiff's allegations that Defendants violated other provisions of law not referenced elsewhere in the FAC, namely Article I, Section 8 of the California Constitution; the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"); and Labor Code § 6310. (FAC ¶ 52.) Defendants observe that the FAC does not contain a single factual allegation regarding any of these legal theories. (See Motion at 17.) For instance, Plaintiff does not allege that he made a request for medical leave under CFRA, that he was eligible for leave, that he provided notice of his need for leave, or [*34]  that Defendants refused to grant him leave. (Id.) Plaintiff responds that "Cemex violated the core objectives of this law when it prevented Henriquez from presenting any request for leave or accommodation." (Opposition at 27.) Even if the Court were to accept that argument without citation to any authority, the FAC contains no factual allegations to support it; essentially, Plaintiff asks the Court to find that he plausibly alleges Defendants violated CFRA without citing any facts or law. The Court will not do so. As to Labor Code § 6310, which "makes it unlawful to fire or otherwise retaliate against an employee who makes a workplace safety complaint with government agencies," Lujan v. Minagar, 124 Cal. App. 4th 1040, 1043, 21 Cal. Rptr. 3d 861 (2004), the FAC does not even allege that Plaintiff made any complaint to a government agency regarding purportedly unsafe working conditions, let alone when and how he did so. Plaintiff responds that he alleges that MHSA investigated the incident and found against Cemex (see FAC ¶ 14), and that "[a] fair inference from the allegations . . . is that Henriquez made a complaint to this governmental agency regarding unsafe working conditions." (Opposition at 28.) Once again, Plaintiff does not ask the Court to draw a reasonable inference [*35]  from the facts; he asks the Court to conjure a narrative that he failed to allege altogether. As Defendants note, there are multiple reasons why MHSA might have investigated the incident, one of which is that Cemex self-reported the incident, as required by law. (Reply at 11) (citing 30 C.F.R. § 50.20). Should Plaintiff amend the FAC to state claims for relief under FEHA, it will not be necessary for him to assert additional violations of CFRA or Labor Code § 6310 to bring a derivative wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. But if he chooses to do so, he must allege the necessary facts to support them.

E. Supplement to Notice of Removal; Amount in Controversy
The Motion indicates that Plaintiff contemplated, but ultimately did not file, a motion to remand, challenging the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. (Motion at 4-5.) The Court observes that at least some of the purported bases for federal question jurisdiction referenced in the Notice of Removal may no longer apply in light of Plaintiff's amendments to the pleadings. (See id.; Complaint; FAC; Notice of Removal.) It appears that one of the reasons that Plaintiff decided against filing a motion to remand, if not the primary reason, was Defendants' [*36]  contention that the Court would alternately have diversity jurisdiction over the action, assuming it found the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000. (Motion at 5.) The FAC and Notice of Removal reference Defendants' incorporation in states outside of California but are silent as to the location of Defendants' principal place(s) of business. (See FAC; Notice of Removal.) While the Court accepts Defendants' representation as to the diversity of the parties for now, to ensure that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the case, the Court ORDERS Defendants to file a supplement to the Notice of Removal stating the location of each Defendants' principal place of business. Defendants shall provide an answer for each named Defendant, regardless of whether Defendants believe a Defendant is "proper" in this action. (See Motion at 2.) Defendants shall file a supplement to the Notice of Removal by January 17, 2023.
If Plaintiff files a Second Amended Complaint (SAC), Plaintiff is ORDERED to allege whether he seeks in excess of $75,000.

V. CONCLUSION
For the reasons above, the Court GRANTS the Motion. Each of Plaintiff's causes of action are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. An amended complaint, [*37]  if any, shall be filed by January 17, 2023. Defendants are ORDERED to file a supplement to the Notice of Removal by January 17, 2023. The January 9, 2023 hearing is VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
