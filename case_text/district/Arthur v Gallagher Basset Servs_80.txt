ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION [14]

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Jennifer Arthur filed this Motion for Summary Adjudication on September 14, 2009. Plaintiff moves for Summary Adjudication against Defendant Gallagher Bassett Services ("GBS" or "Defendant") as to: (1) the First Cause of Action for Employment Discrimination based upon Pregnancy and Disability, on the ground that there is no triable issue that Defendant terminated Plaintiff because of her [*2]  inability to return to work due to her pregnancy-related disability; (2) the Second Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent Employment Discrimination, on the same grounds; (3) the Third Cause of Action for Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), on the ground that Defendant terminated Plaintiff without offering her an extension of her leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the Fifth Cause of Action for Wrongful Discharge Against Public Policy on the ground that Defendant terminated Plaintiff due to her inability to return to work due to pregnancy and/or disability.
The Court finds this motion suitable for resolution without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 78; Local Rule 7-15. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.

II. FACTS
The following facts are undisputed, unless otherwise stated. Plaintiff was employed by GBS as an insurance adjuster from October 2000 to April 2007. (Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts ["PSUF"] 1.) Plaintiff became pregnant in August 2006. (PSUF 2.) She was due to give birth in May 2007, which Defendant became aware of sometime [*3]  prior to April 2007. (PSUF 3, 7.) In early October 2006, Plaintiff learned that she had a high-risk pregnancy and was ordered by her doctor to strict bed rest. (PSUF 3; Plaintiff's Separate Volume of Exhibits in Support of Motion ["Pl.'s Exhs."], Exhs. 2, 3.) There is some dispute as to the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition; however, this dispute is not material as the fact that Plaintiff's pregnancy caused her to be bed ridden for several months is not in dispute.
Plaintiff notified GBS of her medical condition on or about October 9, 2006. (PSUF 4.) On or about that date, Plaintiff submitted a request for a leave of absence with an effective date of October 5, 2006 to Herman Ramirez, Assistant Vice President of Plaintiff's Department at GBS. (Pl. Exh. 3; Def.'s Response to Pl. Statement of Undisputed Facts ["Def. Response to PSUF"] 6; Declaration of Herman Ramirez ["Ramirez Decl."] ¶¶ 2, 4.) Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note to GBS indicating that she would be "strictly on bed rest" from October 5, 2006 to November 16, 2006. (PSUF 5; Pl.'s Exh. 3.) GBS granted Plaintiff's request for leave. (PSUF 5; Ramirez Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff submitted another doctor's note on November 17, [*4]  2006, indicating that she needed additional leave and was ordered to bed rest from November 17, 2006 to December 15, 2006. (PSUF 5; Def. Response to PSUF 6.; Pl. Exh. 3.) GBS granted this request. (Ramirez Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff then submitted a third doctor's note dated December 15, 2006 indicating that she required additional leave and was ordered to bed rest from December 16, 2006 to January 12, 2007. GBS granted this request. (PSUF 5; Def. Response to PSUF 6.; Pl. Exh. 3)
Two additional requests for leave were granted in 2007. Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note dated January 12, 2007 indicating that she need bed rest through March 13, 2007. (Pl. Exh. 3.) GBS granted a request for leave. (PSUF 5; Ramirez Decl. ¶ 7.) Finally, Plaintiff submitted a doctor's note dated March 14, 2007 indicating that Plaintiff would be on bed rest and would need additional leave through April 11, 2007. (Pl. Exh. 3) GBS also granted this request. (PSUF 5; Ramirez Decl. ¶ 8.) In total, Plaintiff was granted just over six months of leave, from October 5, 2006 to April 18, 2007 (Def. Response to PSUF 8.)
Defendant contends that throughout the time Plaintiff was out on leave, the Operations' Supervisor, Kristin [*5]  Wybenga ("Wybenga"), kept in contact with Plaintiff about her disability status. Plaintiff offers no evidence to either support or refute this fact. Plaintiff does not address who she spoke with at GBS regarding her leave. That said, both parties submitted an email from Wybenga to Ramirez dated March 6, 2007 relaying a conversation Wybenga had with Plaintiff on that date.1 (Pl.'s Exh. 9.) Wybenga told Plaintiff that her official leave end-date was April 18, 2007 and asked Plaintiff what she was planning on doing after that time.2 (Id.) Plaintiff indicated that she was scheduled for a doctor's appointment on March 15, 2007 and that her baby was due three weeks thereafter. (Id.) Plaintiff told Wybenga that she was still ordered not to work and would not know anything further until her doctor's appointment, but would love to come back to work if possible. (Id.) On March 14, 2007, Plaintiff submitted her last request for leave through April 11, 2007, which was granted. There is no evidence that Plaintiff contacted anyone at GBS after that time to request additional leave or any other accommodation. Plaintiff has also not submitted any evidence as to when and whether she was able to return [*6]  to work at GBS.
On April 9, 2007, GBS sent Plaintiff a letter notifying her that her "Short-Term Disability" was due to end on April 10, 2007, and that Plaintiff's status with GBS "has been changed from 'leave of absence' to terminated effective April 18, 2007, the last day of your job protection." (Pl.'s Exh. 7; Ramirez Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. H.)3 On or about April 12, 2007, Plaintiff learned that her unborn child had died, just a few weeks before her expected due date of May 2007. (Arthur Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff was terminated from GBS on April 18, 2007.
Plaintiff filed this action against GBS on April 16, 2009 alleging the following causes of action: (1) Employment Discrimination under California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"); (2) Failure to Prevent Employment Discrimination under FEHA; (3) Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process under FEHA; (4) Retaliation under FEHA; (5) Wrongful Discharge under FEHA; (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (7) Unfair Business Practices under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq. Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication on the First, Second, Third, and Fifth causes of action arising under FEHA.

III. ANALYSIS

A. Legal Standard
Summary judgment [*7]  will be granted for the moving party when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Tarin v. County of Los Angeles, 123 F.3d 1259, 1263 (9th Cir. 1997). "A material issue of fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth." SEC v. Seaboard Corp., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982).
When a plaintiff moves for summary judgment under Rule 56(c), plaintiff bears the burden of affirmatively establishing all the elements of her legal claims. See Southern Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885 (9th Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (adopting District Court order as its own); see also Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., 780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir. 1986) ("[I]f the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue, either because he is the plaintiff or as a defendant he is asserting an affirmative defense, he must establish beyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the claim or defense to warrant judgment in his favor.") (emphasis in original).
Once the moving party has met its initial burden, Rule 56(e) requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and identify specific facts that show a genuine issue for trial. See id. at 323-34; Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A scintilla of evidence or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative [*8]  does not present a genuine issue of material fact. Addisu v. Fred Meyer, 198 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir. 2000). A genuine dispute exists "where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.

B. Third Cause of Action: Failure to Engage in Good Faith in the Interactive Process and Failure to Accommodate
Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication on her third cause of action for violations of FEHA due to the alleged failure of GBS to engage in good faith in the interactive process regarding Plaintiff's pregnancy-related disability and to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff. The Court will address this claim first, as the majority of the briefing is devoted to it and Plaintiff's discrimination claims are closely related to the resolution of the failure to accommodate claim.
FEHA provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail "to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known [disability or medical condition]." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(n). The purpose of the interactive process is to explore the alternative working arrangements [*9]  to accommodate the disability. Wysinger v. Automobile Club of Southern Calif., 157 Cal. App. 4th 245, 261 (2007). FEHA also prohibits an employer from "fail[ing] to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee," unless doing so would "produce undue hardship to [the employer's] operation." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m). Plaintiff argues that GBS violated both these provisions.

1. Threshold Requirements
To succeed on a claim under FEHA for failure to engage in the interactive process or failure to accommodate, the employee must show that she (1) has a disability of which the employer is aware, and (2) is a qualified individual. Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940(a)(1), 12940(m); Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2005). A physical disability under FEHA includes a condition that affects one or more major body systems, including the reproductive system, and "limits an individual's ability to participate in major life activities." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7293.6(e); Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(k). Major life activities are broadly construed and include such things as performing manual tasks, walking, and working. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7293.6(a).
FEHA does not prohibit an employer from discharging an employee with a disability who is "unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a)(1). Thus, in addition to showing plaintiff has a disability, Plaintiff must show she is a qualified individual [*10]  — that is, that she can perform the job with or without accommodations. FEHA does not specifically use the term "qualified individual", however, courts often look to decisions and regulations interpreting the federal Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA") for guidance in construing and applying similar provisions under FEHA. Hastings v. Dep't of Corrections, 110 Cal. App. 4th 963, 973 (2003); Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1133 n.6 (9th Cir. 2001).4 Under the ADA, a qualified individual is an employee with a disability who can perform the functions of the employment position with or without accommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1111 (9th Cir. 2000); Chin, Wiseman, Callahan, and Exelrod, California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (Rutter Group) § 9:2245 (2009). Numerous courts have held that a plaintiff seeking relief under § 12940, like a plaintiff seeking similar relief under the ADA, must be able to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. See, e.g., Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 257-58 (2007); Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 972-75; Pensinger v. Bowsmith, Inc., 60 Cal. App. 4th 709, 719 (Ct. App. 1998), overruled on other grounds by Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc., 29 Cal. 4th 1019, 1031 n.6 (2003).
Here, Plaintiff clearly had a disability as defined under FEHA. She had a high risk pregnancy and was ordered by her physician to "strict bed rest" for several months. Strict bed rest clearly limits one's ability to perform major life activities, such as working and other manual tasks. Further, there appears to be no [*11]  dispute that GBS knew Plaintiff was disabled at least from October 5, 2006 to April 11, 2007. Plaintiff had submitted several notes from her doctor indicating that she was ordered to bed rest up until April 11, 2007.
However, there is a disputed issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff continued to be disabled after April 11, 2007 and, if so, whether GBS knew of that fact. Plaintiff's motion appears to indicate that Plaintiff continued to suffer from her pregnancy-related disability after April 11, 2007, because the only reasonable accommodation Plaintiff argues existed as of that time was additional leave from work. However, there is no evidence that Plaintiff communicated to GBS that she continued to suffer from her disability after April 11, 2007. Additionally, because Plaintiff continued to submit doctor's notes for leave periods averaging about one month, and repeatedly pushed back the date for her return to work, there was no way for GBS to know if another doctor's note was forthcoming or if the date in the final note contained Plaintiff's actual return-to-work date. In the conversation between Plaintiff and Wybenga in early March 2007, Plaintiff appears to have indicated that her [*12]  doctor might release her to work in mid-March 2007. (Pl. Exh. 9.) But after mid-March 2007, it is not clear if Plaintiff had any contact with GBS.
On the other hand, GBS knew that Plaintiff's expected due date was in early May 2007; thus, GBS may have presumed her pregnancy-related disability would extend until that time. On the basis of this record, therefore, a triable issue of fact exists as to whether GBS knew of Plaintiff's disability after April 11, 2007.
A disputed issue of fact also exists as to whether Plaintiff was a "qualified individual." It is clear that Plaintiff was not able to perform the essential functions of her job without accommodation, as she was subject to strict bed rest up until at least April 11, 2007. (Mot. at 16.) (noting that Plaintiff was still unable to perform her job functions as of April 18, 2007). Plaintiff has not offered any evidence that an accommodation short of a leave of absence - for example, modified working hours or working from home - would have been suitable for her. This is of course highly unlikely given that Plaintiff was subject to bed rest. Therefore, whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual will depend on whether an additional leave [*13]  of absence after her leave expired on April 18, 2007 would have been a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled Plaintiff to return to work within a finite time.
This issue will be addressed further in section III.B.3. For now, the Court will assume for the sake of argument that Plaintiff is a qualified individual, so as to address Plaintiff's substantive argument regarding GBS's alleged failure to engage in a good faith interactive process.

2. Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process
As stated above, section 12490(n) requires an employer to engage in a good faith interactive process with an employee with a disability to determine available accommodations suited to the employee. Cal. Gov. Code 12490(n). The process "requires communication and good-faith exploration of accommodations between employers and employees." Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 984-85 (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d at 1114-15). The process requires that both sides communicate directly, exchange essential information, and neither side can delay or obstruct the process. Id.; Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 266 (Ct. App. 2000). The employee bears the burden of notifying the employer of the disability, and cooperating with the employer by explaining his or her disability and its qualifications. Prillman v. United Air Lines, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 4th 935 (Ct. App. 1997). When a claim is brought for failure to engage in the interactive [*14]  process, the trial court's ultimate obligation is to determine the cause of the breakdown in the process and assign responsibility. Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 985 (internal citations omitted). The employer is only liable where it bears the responsibility for the breakdown in the interactive process. Id.
In most circumstances, it is the employee's responsibility to initiate the interactive process. Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001). However, once the process is initiated, and the employer is aware that the employee has a disability and desires an accommodation, the employer has a mandatory duty to work with the employee to find a reasonable accommodation. Humphrey v. Memorial Hosp. Assoc., 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001); Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1061 (C.D. Cal. 2005). Further, the duty to accommodate is "continuing" and is not exhausted by one effort. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138. Thus, if an employer grants a reasonable accommodation that later turns out to be ineffective, and the employee with a disability remains unable to perform the essential functions of the job, the employer must consider whether an alternative reasonable accommodation exists. Id.
Plaintiff makes a conclusory argument that GBS did not engage in the interactive process in good faith. Plaintiff contends: "Despite knowing of Plaintiff's condition, GBS never engaged her in the interactive process before it terminated [*15]  her employment. To this end, GBS took no steps to identify available accommodations - such as an extension to her leave of absence - before making the decision to terminate her employment." (Mot. at 13.)
In response, GBS has presented ample evidence that it engaged in the interactive process in good faith, at least until mid-April 2007. Beginning in October 2006, Plaintiff informed GBS of her high-risk pregnancy and began to request leave from work as she was ordered to bed rest by her physician. Plaintiff submitted five separate requests for leave, which totaled just over six months of leave. GBS promptly granted each of Plaintiff's requests. There is no evidence that Plaintiff made any additional requests for accommodation that were rejected by GBS.
GBS also submitted evidence, which was not disputed, that the Operations Supervisor, Wybenga, kept in contact with Plaintiff throughout her leave. The March 6, 2007 email from Wybenga to Ramirez indicates that Wybenga spoke to Plaintiff in early March 2007 and asked Plaintiff what she would like to do after her leave expired, and whether Plaintiff was able to come back to work. (Pl. Exh. 9.) Plaintiff told Wybenga that she was ordered not [*16]  to work at all because she was having pre-labor contractions. (Id.) Wybenga asked Plaintiff to please keep her informed of her doctor's recommendations, and Plaintiff agreed. (Id.) However, there is no evidence that Plaintiff ever followed up on this conversation. These facts establish that GBS was in communication with Plaintiff about her disability, and granted every request for accommodations that Plaintiff submitted. Thus, GBS engaged in the interactive process at least through early April 2007.
Further, GBS cannot be found liable for the failure to consider accommodations other than a leave of absence during the interactive process. Although an employer has an affirmative duty to consider all reasonable alternative accommodations that would be appropriate and would not cause an undue burden to the employer, it is not required to consider alternatives that would be futile. For example, in Swonke v. Sprint Inc., plaintiff employee had submitted doctor's notes that indicated plaintiff should be excused entirely from work due to his knee injury. 327 F. Supp. 2d 1128, 1137 (N.D. Cal. 2004). The Court held that the employer could not be liable for failure to engage in the interactive process where the employer did not consider [*17]  accommodations for plaintiff such as a modified schedule, rest breaks, or the ability to work at home. Such modifications were inconsistent with plaintiff's stated work restrictions and would have been futile. Id. Here, as in Swonke, Plaintiff submitted doctor's notes to GBS indicating that she was not to work at all and was confined to "strict bed rest." (Pl. Exh. 3.) Thus, any failure by GBS to consider modifications to Plaintiff's duties or work schedule would have been inconsistent with Plaintiff's work restrictions and likely futile. GBS therefore cannot be faulted for failure to consider these modifications.5
Nonetheless, a reasonable fact finder could concludde that GBS's conduct in mid-April 2007, after granting the six months of leave, was not in good faith and may have caused the breakdown in the interactive process. See Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138 (employer has a continuing duty to investigate reasonable alternatives if initial efforts fail). Plaintiff submitted evidence that GBS sent her a letter on April 9, 2007 indicating that Plaintiff's leave would expire on April 18, 2007 and that she would be terminated as of that date. (Pl. Exh. 7.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant never contacted her to discuss [*18]  additional accommodations before sending this termination letter.
In response, Defendant submits the Declaration of Herman Ramirez, the author of the letter. Ramirez states that the letter "was sent to Ms. Arthur allowing time for Ms. Arthur to contact me or get back to Ms. Wybenga to discuss whether additional accommodation may be needed prior to the expiration of her leave." (Ramirez Decl. ¶ 13.) But the contents and tone of the letter are patently inconsistent with this interpretation. The letter makes no mention of whether Plaintiff would be reporting to work after her leave expired on April 18, 2007, it does not inquire as to Plaintiff's current medical status or work restrictions, and it appears to give Plaintiff little option to continue on as an employee after April 18, 2007. (Id.) A reasonable person reading this letter likely would not view it as an invitation for an open discussion regarding her future employment at the company. To the contrary, the letter seems clear that Plaintiff's termination was going to take place on April 18, 2007.
On the other hand, an employee concerned for her job security likely would make efforts to contact her employer regardless of her impression [*19]  upon receiving this letter. There is no evidence that Plaintiff did so. Further, there is no evidence that Plaintiff ever got back to Wybenga after their conversation on March 6, 2007, in which she indicated that her doctor may release her for work after a March 15, 2007 doctor's appointment. Plaintiff's final request for leave indicated that she would be on bed rest until April 11, 2007. After that time, it appears Plaintiff never contacted GBS regarding her disability status. Given these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff's failure to contact GBS and keep it apprised of her disability status and work restrictions was the cause of the breakdown in the interactive process.
In sum, the Court concludes that a triable issue of fact exists on the basis of the current record as to whether GBS engaged in good faith in the interactive process to attempt to identify additional accommodations for Plaintiff after April 2007. A triable issue of fact also exists as to whether GBS knew that Plaintiff was disabled after April 11, 2007. For these reasons, summary adjudication is as to Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in an interactive process is denied.
Finally, the Court [*20]  notes that Plaintiff will not be able to prevail on her claim at trial unless she can demonstrate that a reasonable accommodation existed at the time the interactive process broke down. Scotch v. Art Institute of California-Orange County, Inc., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1018 (Ct. App. 2009). An employer cannot be liable for the failure to engage in a process to identify reasonable accommodations if, in fact, no such accommodations exist. Id.; Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1116 (employer who fails to engage in the interactive process in good faith faces liability only if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible). Here, Plaintiff has only identified one possible accommodation that GBS could have offered her - an extension of her leave at least through her delivery date in May 2007. (Mot. at 13.) As discussed in the next section, however, the Court finds that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether this accommodation was reasonable under the circumstances.

3. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation
Plaintiff argues that GBS violated FEHA, Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m), by failing to grant Plaintiff an additional extension of her leave of absence as a reasonable accommodation. (Mot. at 18.) Again, this is the only accommodation Plaintiff identifies that GBS should have considered.
GBS responds that it reasonably accommodated Plaintiff [*21]  by repeatedly granting requests for leave totaling six months, which was more than Plaintiff was entitled to under California law. Further, GBS notes that Plaintiff never asked for an extension of her leave beyond April 18, 2007. Thus, GBS argues that it satisfied its obligation under § 12940(m). (Opp'n at 5-12.) Plaintiff contends, however, that even if GBS granted the entire period of leave Plaintiff was specifically entitled to by law, the FEHA reasonable accommodation provisions required GBS to consider an additional leave. (Mot. at 18.)
This argument requires a discussion of California and federal law related to pregnancy-related disability leave. Leave due to pregnancy-related disabilities is governed by the California Pregnancy Disability Leave Law ("the PDLL"), which is part of FEHA. Cal. Gov't Code § 12945. Under the PDLL, section 12945(a),6 an employer must allow "a female employee disabled by pregnancy or related medical conditions to take a leave for a reasonable period of time not to exceed four months and thereafter return to work, as set forth in the commission's regulations." Cal. Gov. Code 12945(a) (emphasis added). A reasonable period of time means the time period during which the employee is actually disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth [*22]  or related conditions. Cal. Gov. Code 12945(a). The maximum four-month period for a full-time employee like Plaintiff here amounts to 88 working days. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.7(a)(1). Finally, the employer may require an employee to use any accrued sick leave, or the employee may choose to use any accrued sick leave or accrued vacation time during the otherwise unpaid portion of her pregnancy disability leave. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.11(b)(1) and (2).
Employees with pregnancy-related disabilities may also be entitled to a leave of absence under federal law. Leaves taken for incapacity due to pregnancy are governed by the Family Medical Leave Act ("the FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq. Under the FMLA, an employee who is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her job because of a serious health condition, including disabilities related to pregnancy, is entitled to a leave of absence totaling up to 12 workweeks. 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(D); 29 C.F.R. § 825.114(a)(2)(ii) (a serious health condition also includes any period of incapacity due to pregnancy).
Contrary to Plaintiff's arguments otherwise, the PDLL and the FMLA are not mutually exclusive. The regulations implementing the PDLL clearly provide that "the employer may be able to count an employee's pregnancy disability leave under this subchapter, up to a maximum of 12 weeks, against her [*23]  FMLA leave entitlement." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.12. Thus, pregnancy disability leaves under the PDLL run concurrently with leave taken under the FMLA. Id.; Chin, Wiseman, Callahan, and Exelrod, California Practice Guide: Employment Litigation (Rutter Group) § 12:1422.
Finally, employees may also be entitled to leaves of absence under the California Family Rights Act ("the CFRA"), enacted as the Moore-Brown-Roberti Family Rights Act. The CFRA provides that an employee may take a leave of absence of up to 12 weeks for the birth of an employee's child. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945.2. Thus, once the baby is born, a pregnant employee can take an additional 12 weeks of leave under CFRA. Id. The CFRA does not run concurrently with the PDLL. In other words, an employee who took a pregnancy disability leave under the PDLL will still have the right to take a CFRA leave of up to 12 weeks once the child is born. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.13(c). The CFRA, however, does not apply to Plaintiff's leaves of absence in this case because the leaves were all requested prior to the expected birth of Plaintiff's child.7
Putting all this together, the California regulations clearly state: "The maximum combined statutory leave entitlement for CFRA/FMLA employees for both pregnancy disability leave (under [*24]  FMLA and [the PDLL]) and CFRA leave for reason of the birth of the child is four months and 12 workweeks." 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.13 (Relationship Between CFRA and Pregnancy Leaves). Further, "this assumes that the employee is disabled by pregnancy for four months and then requests, and is eligible for, a 12-week CFRA leave for reason of the birth of her child." Id. Here, because Plaintiff sought leave prior to the birth of her child, her maximum statutory leave would not include the CFRA leave. Thus, Plaintiff was entitled by California and federal to a leave of absence not to exceed four months prior to the birth of her child.
Once an employee's four month leave under the PDLL is exhausted, the employer must reinstate the employee to the same position or a comparable position as the position she previously held, subject to certain limited exceptions. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.9(a). If the employee was granted, and took, a pregnancy disability leave for longer than four months, the employer is not required to reinstate the employee unless the employer would do so for other similarly situated employees who have taken a similar length disability leave. 2 Cal. Code Regs. § 7291.9(d). For example, if the employer had a policy allowing for reinstatement to other temporarily [*25]  disabled employees who are disabled for six months, the employer must allow such reinstatement to a woman disabled by pregnancy for six months. Id.
Applying this framework to the case at issue, there is no dispute that Plaintiff was granted more than the maximum amount of leave to which she was specifically entitled under California and federal law. GBS granted multiple requests for leave from October 5, 2009 through April 18, 2007. Plaintiff was given just over six months of leave, which far exceeds the 88 days (4 months) of leave she was entitled to by law. GBS therefore clearly met the requirements of section 12945(a).
Notwithstanding this fact, Plaintiff argues that the reasonable accommodation requirement in section 12940(m)8 requires the employer to consider an additional leave of absence beyond the statutory four-month entitlement as a reasonable accommodation for an employee disabled by pregnancy. (Mot. at 17-18.) Plaintiff cites several cases that stand for the proposition that a leave of absence to allow an employee to recover from a disability is itself a form of reasonable accommodation under FEHA. See, e.g., Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 263 (Ct. App. 2000); Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078, 1090 (9th Cir. 2006); Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 226 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128 (9th Cir. 2001). The Court recognizes that "holding a job open for a disabled employee who needs [*26]  time to recuperate or heal is in itself a form of reasonable accommodation and may be all that is required where it appears likely that the employee will be able to return to an existing position at some time in the foreseeable future." Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 263. Further, cases decided under FEHA and comparable provisions of the ADA have found that leaves of absence longer than four months, or even six months, were reasonable accommodations. See e.g., Hanson, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 226 (seven months was a reasonable accommodation under FEHA); Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenternals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 647-48 (1st Cir. 2000) (employer's failure to hold job open after granting more than a year of leave held to be a failure to reasonably accommodate under ADA).
That said, none of the cases cited above regarding reasonable accommodations involve an employee with a pregnancy-related disability. As Defendant correctly points out, pregnancy-related disabilities are specifically governed by section 12945(a) of FEHA, which only requires employers to grant a leave not to exceed four months. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945(a). Thus, Defendant argues that case law applying the general reasonable accommodation mandates of FEHA, section 12940(m), do not apply to leaves of absence where the employee has a pregnancy-related disability governed by section 12945(a). Defendant contends that a contrary interpretation renders [*27]  section 12945(a) completely meaningless in so far as other statutory provisions of FEHA could require an employer to do what is expressly excluded by section 12945(a) — provide a leave longer than four months to an employee incapacitated due to pregnancy. (Mot. at 11.) Were this the case, Defendant argues, countless pregnant women would argue for leaves longer than four months as a reasonable accommodation. (Mot. at 12.)
The Court finds Defendant's argument persuasive; however, it is not sufficiently developed at this stage in the briefing. Defendant has not cited any legal authority relating to the construction of the FEHA statutes, the relationship between section 12940(m) and section 12945(a), the legislative history of section 12945(a), or case law addressing leaves of absence as an accommodation for women with pregnancy-related disabilities. The Court recognizes the well-settled principle of statutory construction that "where there is in one statute a specific provision and a general one, which in its most comprehensive sense would include matters embraced in the specific provision, the general provision must be understood to affect only those cases within its general language that are not within the purview of the specific provision, with the result that [*28]  the specific provision controls." 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 45:5 (7th ed. 2009); see Rose v. State, 19 Cal. 2d 713, 723-24 (Cal. 1942); King v. Armstrong, 9 Cal. App. 368, 371 (Ct. App. 1908); Bautista-Perez v. Mukasey, No. C 07-4192, 2008 WL 314486 (N.D. Cal., Feb. 4, 2008). Put more simply, specific statutory provisions usually control over more general provisions. Thus, although a reasonable accommodation under section 12940(m) may include a leave of absence (among many other types of accommodation), the specific provision of section 12945(a) relating to leaves due to pregnancy-related disabilities likely should control.
However, statutes must also "be construed to further the intent of the legislature as evidenced by the entire statutory scheme." 2A Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 45:5. The California Legislature provides that statutory provisions under FEHA are remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to accomplish the purpose of eliminating discrimination. Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12920; 12993(a). Additionally, section 12945 specifically provides that the protections in that section are in addition to the provisions that govern pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions under section 12940. Cal. Gov. Code § 12945 (emphasis added). Thus, it may be that employers can be required, in certain circumstances, to provide employees incapacitated due to pregnancy both the leave mandated by § 12945(a) and additional leave if such leave [*29]  is a reasonable accommodation under § 12940(m).
The Court is ill-equipped, on the basis of the current briefing, to decide as a matter of law that there are no circumstances under which an employer is required to give an employee with a pregnancy-related disability an extended leave of longer than four months as a reasonable accommodation. The Court therefore invites Defendant to brief this issue by way of a motion for summary judgment. If Defendant can establish, on the basis of existing authority, that section 12945(a) controls over section 12940(m), such that an additional leave of absence longer than four months is not a reasonable accommodation for a pregnancy-related disability, Plaintiff's FEHA claims will certainly fail.
For present purposes, the Court will assume that a leave of absence longer than four months could be a reasonable accommodation under 12940(m) for a pregnancy-related disability, and will consider whether such an accommodation would have been reasonable under the circumstances here.
"Ordinarily, the reasonableness of an accommodation is an issue for the jury." Prilliman, 53 Cal. App. 4th at 954 (internal citations omitted); Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d. 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999) ("Determining whether a proposed accommodation (medical leave in this case) is reasonable . . . requires a fact-specific, [*30]  individualized inquiry."). Where Plaintiff moves for summary judgment, it is her burden to establish that a leave of absence would have been a reasonable accommodation. Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078, 1091 (9th Cir. 2006). Several factors should be considered when evaluating the reasonableness of a leave of absence as an accommodation. First, the court should consider the duration of the leave of absence, whether the employee would still be qualified for the job upon return from leave, and when and under what conditions the employee could return to work. Id. at 1091. Also relevant is the employer's policy regarding leaves of absence for its employees, and whether the employer would suffer undue hardship if an extended leave were granted. Prilliman, 53 Cal. App. 4th at 953. Finally, the court should consider whether a prior leave was granted to the employee and was unsuccessful. Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1136 n.13.
Applying these factors to the present case, Plaintiff cannot establish as a matter of law that an additional leave of absence beyond the six months she received would have been a reasonable accommodation. First, a material issue of fact exists as to what length of extension Plaintiff would have required to be able to return to work. Plaintiff's motion argues that her anticipated return-to-work date was [*31]  no longer than one month after her leave of absence expired on April 18, 2007. (Mot. at 3.) However, there is no evidence to support this contention. It is true that Plaintiff's expected delivery date was in early May 2007, which GBS knew. (PSUF 3, 7.) But that does not establish that Plaintiff would be able to return to work on that date. It belies common sense that Plaintiff would have returned to work immediately after giving birth. Moreover, GBS was not aware of whether Plaintiff continued to suffer from her pregnancy-related condition after April 11, 2007, or whether the condition would cause a continued disability after the child's birth, for example, by virtue of complications during delivery. There is very little evidence in the regard regarding the nature of Plaintiff's medical condition. Finally, the facts indicate that Plaintiff unfortunately lost her baby a few weeks before she was due to deliver. Plaintiff likely experienced significant emotional trauma that would have precluded her from immediately returning to work. However, it appears GBS was unaware of this at the time. These are all factual issues that are not developed in the current record and preclude any finding [*32]  that a "brief" extension would have been reasonable, or even effective, under the circumstances.
Plaintiff also has not submitted any evidence as to what her position or responsibilities were at GBS, other than to state that she was an adjuster. She has not come forward with any evidence that she would be able to return to work after being granted an additional leave of absence or that she would be able to perform the essential functions of her position after returning to work.
There is also little evidence in the record regarding GBS's internal policies concerning employee disability leave; however, the evidence that does exist supports GBS. The Declaration of Manual Ramirez states that, when Plaintiff's leave was about to expire, he sent Plaintiff "our standard letter . . . informing employees about the expiration of their leave and their short term disability leave." (Ramirez Decl. ¶ 13.) In addition, Plaintiff submitted an email chain dated April 2-3, 2007 in which Kristin Wybenga asked Sara Gleason, the Human Resources Administrator at GBS, what to do regarding the expiration of Plaintiff's leave.9 (Pl. Exh. 11.) Gleason responded that Plaintiff was going to reach the end of her [*33]  26 week Short Term Disability period on April 10, 2007, and that "at the end of one's [short term disability] period, we terminate employment." (Id.) Thus, it appears that GBS had some uniform policy regarding terminating employees after a period of disability leave that was equal to, or perhaps shorter than, what Plaintiff received. This may be relevant to the resources GBS had available to accommodate persons with disabilities, the nature of GBS's business, and whether an accommodation of a longer leave may have caused GBS to suffer an undue hardship.
There is considerable evidence that GBS granted Plaintiff multiple leaves of absence, which were unsuccessful, and did not allow Plaintiff to recover. Plaintiff repeatedly submitted doctor's notes indicating that she would need approximately 4-6 weeks leave, and then extended such leave on the last day before the leave was set to expire. In Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., the Ninth Circuit noted that an employer may not be obligated to grant a second leave of absence to an employee who suffered cluster migraines, if the employee returned from leave and later suffered a recurrence of the condition. 889 F.2d 869, 879 (9th Cir. 1989). The Court reasoned that, "the [*34]  fact that an accommodation has been attempted and was unsuccessful is a relevant consideration for the factfinder and may in fact prove dispositive in determining whether failure to permit subsequent leave constituted failure to make a reasonable accommodation." Id.; see also, Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1136 n.13 ("Of course, the requirement to grant a leave . . . can not be repeatedly invoked, thus permitting an unqualified employee to avoid termination by requesting a leave of absence each time he is about to be fired.").
The analysis in Kimbro may be tempered by the fact that, here, Plaintiff's disability was related to pregnancy, which is by definition a temporary condition. Thus, it may be that it was reasonable for GBS to continue to extend leaves until such time as Plaintiff's due date, even if such leaves were repeatedly unsuccessful. That said, Plaintiff also told GBS that she may have been able to return to work in mid-March 2007, which later proved to be impossible. (Pl. Exh. 9.) Thus, the record may show that GBS felt Plaintiff was not being forthright about her condition, and continued to request leaves at the last moment, knowing she was unable to come back to work. These issues cannot be resolved on the [*35]  basis of the current record and are better left for the jury.
Finally, the fact that Plaintiff never requested an extension of her leave when it expired on April 18, 2007 also weighs against a finding of reasonableness. While the employer has a duty to consider reasonable accommodations if it is aware that an employee is disabled and desires to return to work, the employee cannot expect the employer to "read his mind and know that he secretly wanted a particular accommodation." Prilliman, 53 Cal. App. 4th at 954. "Nor is the employer ordinarily liable for failing to accommodate a disability of which it had no knowledge." Id. Here, because Plaintiff had submitted doctor's notes indicating a need for bed rest for short, specific periods, GBS may not have known that Plaintiff continued to suffer from her condition in late April 2007, or that she desired an additional leave of absence. There is simply no evidence in the record that Plaintiff communicated with GBS regarding her condition after mid-March 2007. Thus, under these circumstances, a jury may find that GBS had no duty to further accommodate Plaintiff.
In sum, triable issues of fact exist as regarding whether an additional leave of absence would have been effective, [*36]  Plaintiff's expected return-to-work date, Plaintiff's ability to return to work had she been provided additional leave, the hardship Plaintiff's continued absence may have had on GBS, GBS's internal employment policies, and whether Plaintiff had any communication with GBS to put it on notice that she continued to suffer from her condition and required additional accommodations. Thus, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of GBS's alleged failure to accommodate.
For these reasons, Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication is DENIED as to her third cause of action.

C. Employment Discrimination Under FEHA
Plaintiff also moves for summary adjudication on her first cause of action under FEHA for employment discrimination based upon pregnancy and disability. Section 12940(a) prohibits an employer from discharging an employee because of a physical or mental disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). However, section 12940(a)(1) provides that it is not unlawful for an employer to "discharg[e] an employee with a physical or mental disability . . . where the employee, because of his or her physical or mental disability, is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations . . . ." Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a)(1).
Thus, [*37]  to prevail on a discriminatory discharge claim under section 12940(a), an employee bears the burden of showing: (1) that he or she was discharged because of a disability; and (2) that he or she could perform the essential functions of his or her job with or without accommodation - that is, that he or she was a "qualified individual" as understood under the ADA. Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 962 (Ct. App. 2008) (citing Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 257-58 (2007)).10
Plaintiff contends that she was discharged because of "her inability to return to work because of her condition." (Mot. at 19.) GBS argues that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff — that is, Plaintiff was terminated because her leave under the PDLL and the FMLA had expired and she did not request any additional accommodation after April 11, 2007. (Opp'n at 17.) GBS further argues that Plaintiff was not treated any differently than similarly-situated disabled employees, and that GBS had a policy of terminating employees at the end of their short-term-disability leave that applied equally to pregnant employees and other disabled employees. (Id. at 16-17.)
The Court sees little distinction between Plaintiff's proffered reason for her discharge and that offered by Defendant. Defendant's contention [*38]  that Plaintiff was discharged because her leave expired implicitly relies on the fact that Plaintiff was unable to come back to work prior to the expiration of her leave. Indeed, if Plaintiff had returned to work prior to April 18, 2007, the record suggests that GBS would have reinstated her. (Pl. Exh. 11 (Email dated 04/02/07 from Kristin Wybenga to Sara Gleason, in which Wybenga notes: "Jennifer's [leave] expires on 04/18/07. If she does not [return to work] on or before that date, what is the procedure?) (emphasis added).) Instead, Plaintiff was unable to return and was therefore terminated.
The Ninth Circuit holds that a legitimate non-discriminatory reason is "one that 'disclaims any reliance on the employee's disability in having taken the employment action.'" Dark v. Curry County, 451 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Snead v. Metropolitan Property & Cas. Ins. Co., 237 F.3d 1080, 1093 (9th Cir. 2001)). Here, GBS's proffered reason for terminating Plaintiff implicitly relies on the fact that Plaintiff was unable to come back to work prior to the expiration of her leave because she continued to suffer from her disability. This reason is inextricably tied to Plaintiff's disability and does not constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation. See e.g., Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1140 (where employee's attendance problems may have been [*39]  caused by her obsessive compulsive disorder, employer's decision to fire employee due to absences could be discrimination based on disability); Dark, 451 F.3d at 1084 (employee's misconduct was not a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his discharge where the misconduct (crashing a tractor while experiencing a seizure) was caused by employee's epilepsy); Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1065 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (terminating plaintiff on the basis of absences that occurred as a result of plaintiff's mental disability does not constitute a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination); Kimbro v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 875 (9th Cir. 1989) (decided under Washington state law similar to FEHA) (sufficient causal connection between employee's discharge and his disability exists where employer terminated employee due to excessive absences that were caused by employee's chronic migraine headaches.)
Nonetheless, even if GBS's reason for termination is discriminatory, a triable issue of fact remains as to whether Plaintiff was a qualified individual and, at the time of her discharge, could have performed her job with or without reasonable accommodations. See infra section III.B.3. Plaintiff implicitly concedes that she could not have performed her job in mid-April 2007 without an accommodation. (Mot. at 13, [*40]  19.) Thus, Plaintiff's claim for discriminatory discharge depends entirely upon her claim for GBS's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. See Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139-49 (explaining that, "often [claims for failure to accommodate and for unlawful discharge under FEHA] are, from a practical standpoint, the same. For the consequence of the failure to accommodate is, as here, frequently an unlawful termination."). If the jury finds that an additional, unrequested leave of absence would have been a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff under the facts presented, GBS will be liable for the failure to grant such an accommodation, and consequently for terminating Plaintiff. In contrast, if the jury finds that such an accommodation is not reasonable, Plaintiff will not be able to show that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodations, and her discriminatory discharge claim necessarily will fail.
In sum, because a triable issue of fact exists as to whether GBS failed to grant Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation, Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to her cause of action for discriminatory discharge must be DENIED.

D. Public Policy Claims for [*41]  Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Wrongful Termination
Plaintiff seeks summary adjudication on her second and fifth causes of action for failure to prevent discrimination11 and wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,12 respectively. Plaintiff has not advanced any argument specifically with regard to these two claims, and the claims are based entirely on the same allegations of her first cause of action for discriminatory discharge under FEHA. (See Mot. at 2-3.) Thus, because Plaintiff's ability to recover on these claims rests completely on her ability to establish a discriminatory discharge in violation of section 12940(a), and because material issues of fact exists with regard to Plaintiff's discrimination claim, Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication is DENIED as to the second and fifth causes of action.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication as to the First, Second, Third and Fifth causes of action is DENIED.
If Defendant GBS intends to file a Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of whether California Government Code § 12945(a) controls over section 12940(m), as addressed in section III.B.3 of this Order, it shall do so in accordance with the following briefing [*42]  schedule:
