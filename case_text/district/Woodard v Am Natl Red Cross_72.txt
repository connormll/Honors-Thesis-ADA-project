CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (in chambers): ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Docket No. 22]
This matter is before the Court on Defendants American National Red Cross and American Red Cross Southern California Blood Services Region's (together "Defendants" or "ARC") Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion"), filed November 5, 2018. Plaintiff Kimberly Woodard ("Plaintiff' or "Woodard") opposed the Motion ("Opposition") on November 26, 2018. Defendants replied ("Reply") on December 3, 2018. The Court found this matter suitable for disposition without oral argument and vacated the hearing set for December 17, 2018. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b). For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the Motion. The Court GRANTS the Motion as to Plaintiff's claim of punitive damages but DENIES the Motion as to Plaintiff's remaining causes of action in the operative complaint.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
A. Procedural Background
Plaintiff brought [*2]  this action in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles on December 7, 2017, alleging that Defendants wrongfully terminated her employment because she developed a physical disability that limited her ability to lift, push, and pull weight. (Notice of Removal at 2, ECF No. 1; see generally Notice of Removal, Ex. B ("Complaint"), ECF No. 1-2.) On January 10, 2018, Defendants removed the action to this Court on the ground that this Court has original jurisdiction over any case in which Defendants are parties under 36 U.S.C. § 300105(a)(5). (See generally Notice of Removal at 1-3.)
Plaintiff brings seven causes of action related to her termination: (1) disability discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, Cal. Gov't Code § 12940, et seq. ("FEHA"); (2) failure to engage in the interactive process, in violation of FEHA; (3) failure to provide reasonable accommodations, in violation of FEHA; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, in violation of FEHA; (5) retaliation, in violation of FEHA; (6) failure to prevent retaliation, in violation of FEHA; and (7) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. (See generally Compl.)
B. Factual History
Unless noted otherwise, the following facts are either undisputed or supported [*3]  by sufficient admissible evidence that they are "admitted to exist without controversy" for the purposes of this Motion. L.R. 56-3.1
1. Woodard's Employment by the ARC
The ARC employed Plaintiff from November 25, 2002 until September 9, 2017, first as an allogenic medical assistant and then as a Collections Technician I ("Tech-I"). (Deposition of Kimberly Woodard ("Woodard Dep."), 17:10-18:3, ECF No. 33-1; Deposition of Christine Hinnerichs ("Hinnerichs Dep.") at 93, Ex. 9, ECF No. 28-2.) The primary purpose of Woodard's job was to collect blood from donors through the "venipuncture" process. (Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts ("PMF") P 2; Hinnerichs Dep., 110:18-21; Deposition of Irma Escobedo ("Escobedo Dep.") at 163:25-164:2, Exhibit A to Supplemental Notice of Errata Re Compendium of Exhibits, ECF No. 30.) During her employment, Woodard staffed and collected blood from donors at blood drives hosted in remote locations, at the ARC's fixed donation centers, and on mobile blood donation vehicles ("bloodmobiles"). (Woodard Dep., 42:4-43:1, 43:18-20.) Woodard's duties and responsibilities included driving to assigned blood drive locations, helping set up blood drives, [*4]  taking medical histories from donors, collecting blood, and providing donor care. (Woodard Dep., 18:4-13, 59:4-22.) When assigned to work at blood drive locations, Tech-Is, such as Woodard, were required to help drivers load and unload the trucks delivering necessary blood drive supplies by pushing carts of equipment from the trucks to the blood drive location and by removing totes containing supplies from the carts. (Woodard Dep., 18:13-20, 22:15-24, 26:5-14.) According to Woodard, working on a bloodmobile required less lifting because the equipment was built in to the vehicle. (Woodard Dep., 44:8-21.) Similarly, heavy equipment was already built in to donation centers, but ARC staff had to pack blood themselves at these centers, and had to lift bags of ice to do so. (Woodard Dep., 44:8-21, 65:13-24, 109:21-110:5.)
A job description for the position of "Technician I, Collections" for the American Red Cross Southern California Region, dated September 1, 2003, states as the first line of the "Job Summary": "Conduct health history interviews and provide donor care during the collection of blood units." (Escobedo Dep., Ex. 19.) "Major Responsibilities" include:
Perform phases of whole blood [*5]  collection according to . . . policies and procedures to ensure safe product and optimum donor experience. Recruit donors for future donations.
Assess donor history according to operating procedures, BSDs, and the Code of Federal Regulations within specific guidelines.
Assemble and maintain supplies and equipment to ensure a state of readiness.
Function with team effort to ensure smooth and efficient blood collection process.
. . . .
Complete extensive standardized training and demonstrate competency to perform each job function and commit to perform only those tasks for which documented training has been completed.
Perform other related duties as necessary.
(Escobedo Dep., Ex. 19.) The following page of the job description sets out the "Essential Functions/Physical Requirements" as follows:
The duties above indicate the essential functions of the position. Operational flexibility is required to meet sudden and unpredictable needs. Physical requirements may include the ability to lift, push or pull heavy weights up and down ramps and stairs, good manual dexterity, the ability to sit or stand for long periods of time and adapt to long, irregular hours and frequent schedule changes is required. [*6] 
(Escobedo Dep., Ex. 19.)
Article 9, section 3, subdivision 9 of the 2015-2018 collective bargaining agreement between the American National Red Cross and the Coalition of American Red Cross Unions provides that "[c]ollections staff may be required to assist with set up and tear down of the blood drive. Although it is the primary duty of the driver to load and unload the vehicle, current Collections staff may need to assist in the loading and unloading of equipment where there is an insufficient number of drivers available and to the extent necessary." (Escobedo Dep, Ex. 17.)
1. Plaintiff's Injuries
While employed by the ARC, Woodard suffered two separate injuries. (PMF P 6, ECF No. 27-4.) First, on April 9, 2013, she suffered an electrical shock and developed work restrictions that limited the use of her left hand to 8 hours per day and limited her to lifting or pushing no more than ten (10) pounds. (PMF P 7l; Deposition of Barbara Gunter ("Gunter Dep."), 61:22-62:22, Ex. 23.) The ARC permitted her to work modified duties with these restrictions under a "temporary alternative duty assignment" for a maximum of 12 weeks, beginning April 10, 2013. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 10.) During at least part of this period, Woodard [*7]  performed "health histories," during which she documented the donor's health history, took vital signs, and took a drop of blood from the donor's finger to check their hemoglobin. (Woodard Dep. 50:12-24, 105:12-20.) Woodard informed Barbara Gunter that she felt that she needed to rest her hand, but she declined to do administrative tasks in Defendants' Pomona location. (Woodard Dep., 92:22-93:1, 93:17-94:3, 94:23-95:25.) Barbara Gunter was the Loss Control Officer at ASC, one of the employees of ARC responsible for engaging in the interactive process and seeking to provide an accommodation to Woodard.
Second, in March 2014, Woodard injured her shoulder when a donor fainted and fell into her. (Gunter Dep. at 59:19-60:3, ECF No. 28-5.) On the day that Plaintiff suffered her second injury, she was cleared to return to work with limited use of her left hand and was restricted to lifting no more than 10 lbs. (PSF P 17.) However, Plaintiff was not permitted to return to work because she exhausted her modified duty and was restricted to lifting no more than 15 lbs. (Gunter Dep., 179:19-24.) Plaintiff was cleared to work without restrictions on August 12, 2014 and returned to work on August [*8]  21, 2014. (Gunter Dep., 121:11-122:3, Ex. 29; PMF P 23.) On May 8, 2015, Plaintiff underwent surgery on her shoulder, and her doctor took her off work until August 12, 2015. (PMF P 24.) Plaintiff's doctor cleared her to work with lifting and overhead work restrictions on August 13, 2015. (PMF P 25.) Plaintiff was not permitted to return to work at that time. On November 10, 2015, Plaintiff was cleared to work without restrictions, and Defendants permitted her to return to work on November 16, 2015. (PMF PP 27-28.) On June 8, 2016, Plaintiff visited her doctor because she was still experiencing pain and received work restrictions that limited her lifting, pulling and pushing to 15 lbs. (PMF P 29.) Plaintiff was not permitted to return to work at that time, but was placed on leave. (Gunter Dep., 179:19-24.) In March 2017, a new physician performed a surgery on Plaintiffs' shoulder and released her to work on July 27, 2017 with the restrictions that she not lift 15 lbs or perform overhead work. (DSF PP 35-36.) Plaintiff did not return to work at that time.
On July 27, 2017, Defendants sent Plaintiff a medical questionnaire for her medical provider to complete. (Woodard Dep., 148:3-18 & [*9]  Ex. 14.) The medical questionnaire was accompanied by a letter stating: " . . . we want to work with you to see if there are any reasonable workplace accommodations we could provide, that would allow you to return to work and perform the essential functions of your position." (Woodard Dep., Ex. 14.) The questionnaire stated that its purpose was "to determine the specific limitations upon Ms. Woodard's ability to perform the duties of her job so that we may determine if we can support the accommodation." (Woodard Dep., Ex. 14.) Among the questions were: "(1) . . . . Given Ms. Woodard's medical condition, is she able to perform the duties of her job?" and "(4) If Ms. Woodard is not able to perform the duties of her job, is there any accommodation that may be provided that would enable her to perform those duties? If so, describe the accommodation(s)." The questionnaire was accompanied by a "JOB REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST" for the positions of "Phlebotomist/Tech I & II," which indicated that the "physical demands" of these positions included occasional lifting, occasional carrying of 75 pounds, occasional pushing and pulling of 240 lbs, and included occasional reaching overhead, as an "essential [*10]  function" of the position." The checklist defined occasional as "activity or condition [that] occurs 0-33% of [the] workday or 1-4x per hour." Woodard Dep., Ex. 14.) Plaintiff submitted the questionnaire to her doctor and returned the completed form to Defendants on or about August 17, 2017. (DSF PP 37-38.)
Plaintiff's medical provider responded to varied questions with similar answers, writing that Plaintiff "has modified duties" of "no overhead work" and "no lifting more than 15 lbs." The medical provider also indicated that the duration of Plaintiff's injury could not be determined and that "further recommendations will be made [sic] approx 6 months." (Woodard Dep., Ex. 15.)
By August 23, 2017, Defendants had drafted a termination letter for Woodard. (Berenji Decl., Ex. F, ARC 036600.) Plaintiff's employment was terminated effective September 9, 2017. Defendants sent Woodard a letter that referenced the questionnaire and stated:
Unfortunately, the essential functions of your position cannot be performed with these restrictions and continued leave of absence for an unknown period of time is an undue hardship for the organization. As a result, your employment with the American Red Cross [*11]  will be terminated effective September 9, 2017.
(Woodard Dep., Ex .8.)
On September 21, 2017, Plaintiff visited her medical provider, who provided her with a form indicating that she could return to work without restrictions. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 17.) Plaintiff notified Irma Escobedo of this development and was encouraged to apply for open positions, but was not reinstated. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 18.)
Plaintiff filed a "Charge of Discrimination" with the Department of Fair Employment & Housing ("DFEH") on December 6, 2017. (PMF P 41; Woodard Dep., Ex. 22.)
II. LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) mandates that "[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. In such a case, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact [*12]  on each issue material to its case." C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving part does not need to produce any evidence or prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325. Rather, the moving party's initial burden "may be discharged by 'showing'—that is, pointing out to the district court—that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. "Summary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff 'fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [his] case, and on which [he] will bear the burden of proof at trial.'" Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 805-06, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).
Once the moving party meets its initial burden, the "party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [nonmoving party]'s position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [nonmoving party]." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); accord Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) ("[O]pponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts."). [*13]  Further, "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit . . . will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248. At the summary judgment stage, a court does not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence. See id. at 249. A court must draw all inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587.
III. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff brings several causes of action against Defendants in relation to her termination. Defendants move for summary judgment as to all of these causes of action. Ultimately, the Court determines that the vast majority of these causes of action survive summary judgment, but that Plaintiff cannot claim punitive damages from Defendants.2
A. Statute of Limitations
As a threshold matter, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's FEHA causes of action are barred to the extent that they rely on conduct that occurred prior to December 6, 2016.
1. Legal Standard
"The timely filing of an administrative complaint is a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil action for damages under FEHA." Blum v. Superior Court, 141 Cal. App. 4th 418, 422, 45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 902 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Medix Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. Superior Court, 97 Cal. App. 4th 109, 116, 118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 249 (Ct. App. 2002)); see also Ayala v. Frito Lay, Inc., 263 F. Supp. 3d 891, 902 (E.D. Cal. 2017). Before suing under FEHA, a plaintiff must exhaust his [*14]  or her administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") within one year of the occurrence of the allegedly unlawful act and obtaining a right-to-sue letter. Cal. Gov't Code § 12960(b), (d); see also Rickards v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 206 Cal. App. 4th 1523, 142 Cal. Rptr. 3d 916 (Ct. App. 2012); Blum, 141 Cal. App. 4th at 422. The limitations period is calculated from the date of the filing of the administrative complaint, and "any conduct occurring [outside this time frame] cannot serve as the basis for liability unless some exception to the one-year limitations period applies." Cucuzza v. City of Santa Clara, 104 Cal. App. 4th 1031, 1040, 128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 660 (Ct. App. 2002)).
Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff filed a "Charge of Discrimination" with the Department of Fair Employment & Housing on December 6, 2017. (PMF P 100.) Therefore, Defendants are not liable under FEHA for any actions that occurred prior to December 6, 2016 unless an exception to the limitations period applies. Plaintiff argues that the continuing violation doctrine permits her to bring causes of action related to Defendants' conduct prior to the statute of limitations period. (Opp'n at 20.)
Under the continuing violation doctrine, "an employer is liable for actions that take place outside the limitations period if these actions are sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct that occurred within the limitations [*15]  period." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1056, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005) (applying the continuing violation doctrine to FEHA retaliation claims). Under this doctrine "an employer's persistent failure to reasonably accommodate a disability, or to eliminate a hostile work environment targeting a disabled employee, is a continuing violation if the employer's unlawful actions are (1) sufficiently similar in kind . . . ; (2) have occurred within reasonable frequency; (3) and have not acquired a degree of permanence." Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal. 4th 798, 823, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 87, 29 P.3d 175 (Cal. 2001). "Permanence" is properly understood to mean that "an employer's statements and actions make clear to a reasonable employee that any further efforts at informal conciliation to obtain reasonable accommodation or end harassment will be futile." Id.
In Richards, the California Supreme Court explained that FEHA's statute of limitations should be interpreted "in a way that does not short-circuit the reasonable accommodation process," which it described as an "informal, interactive" and "ongoing process," but should also not permit an employee "indefinitely to delay the filing of a lawsuit based on the employer's failure to reasonably accommodate disability." Id. at 821-23. Comparing disability discrimination to harassment, the court explained [*16]  that "an instance of an employer's failure to accommodate . . . in isolation may seem trivial can assume greater injury when viewed as one of a series of such failures." Id. at 821-22; see also Dominguez v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 168 Cal. App. 4th 714, 722-24, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 705 (Ct. App. 2008) (collecting cases in which the continuing violation doctrine applied and brought in previous, different harassing conduct related to misconduct occurring within the statute of limitations). "Thus, when an employer engages in a continuing course of unlawful conduct under the FEHA by refusing reasonable accommodation of a disable employee or engaging in disability harassment, and this course of conduct does not constitute a constructive discharge, the statute of limitations begins to run, not necessarily when the employee first believes that his or her rights may have been violated, but rather, either when the course of conduct is brought to an end, as by the employer's cessation of such conduct or by the employee's resignation, or when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in vain." Id.
With respect to the permanence prong, a state of permanence is reached "when a reasonable employee would understand that 'further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in [*17]  vain.'" Acuna v. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co., 217 Cal. App. 4th 1402, 159 Cal. Rptr. 3d 749 (Ct. App. 2013). In denying application of the continuing violation doctrine, courts have pointed to the retention of counsel, the filing of an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment & Housing (DFEH), repeated and unsuccessful internal grievances, and allegations that the employer and human resources employee "made no effort whatsoever" to assist the employee as proof that alleged discrimination reached a state of permanence. Id. at 1414-15 (citing Cucuzza v. City of Santa Clara, 104 Cal. App. 4th 1031, 128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 660 (Ct. App. 2002)).
2. Application of Continuing Violation Doctrine
Here, Plaintiff's claims for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and retaliation are based in part on the following events: (1) Plaintiff's forced leave of absence between March and August 2014 after sustaining her shoulder injury; (2) Plaintiff's forced leave of absence between May and November 2015 following her first shoulder surgery; (3) and Defendants alleged failure to discuss or attempt accommodations for
Plaintiff or permit Plaintiff to work with restrictions between June and December 2016. Each of the events would be barred absent the application of the continuing violation doctrine. Plaintiff argues that the statute of [*18]  limitations did not begin to run until Plaintiff's termination on September 9, 2017, because it was at that point that Defendants' discrimination acquired permanence. (Opp'n at 20-21.) Plaintiff also argues that Defendants' "final act of terminating Woodard was based on a 'systematic policy of discrimination' and served as a 'sharp reminder' of all the instances in which [Defendants] refused to accommodate Woodard's requests for workplace accommodations." (Opp'n at 21.) Defendants do not respond to these arguments.
The Court agrees with Plaintiff. Plaintiff's allegations establish that a reasonable person would have understood that Defendants denied her requests for accommodation upon receipt of her termination letter in August 2017. According to Plaintiff's allegations, Defendants repeatedly refused to permit her to return to work with restrictions, but Plaintiff did not file an administrative complaint with DFEH until December 2017, several months after she was terminated. The limitations period thus would extend only as far as December 2016.
However, the continuing violation doctrine applies. In the years preceding the limitations period, Plaintiff was permitted to return to work [*19]  when able to work without restrictions, and at least once communicated with her employer regarding possible accommodation for her disability. (Def's Response to Pl.'s Facts PP 23, 28, 30.) Because Defendants offered temporary leaves of absence as accommodation, repeatedly communicated with Plaintiff regarding her physical status, and inquired as late as summer 2017 into possible accommodations, there is no reason to believe that Plaintiff was on notice that efforts to end allegedly unlawful conduct was in vain until her termination.
The remaining elements of the continuing violation doctrine are also met. The conduct complained of both before and after the limitations period is of the same nature, discrimination against Plaintiff because of her disability. Defendants' conduct also occurred in each year from 2014 until Plaintiff's termination.
Accordingly, Defendants can be held liable under the continuing violation doctrine for conduct that they undertook prior to December 6, 2016. The Court DENIES Defendants' Motion as to the statute of limitations argument.
B. FEHA Disability Discrimination
The Court next addresses Defendants' Motion as to Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination [*20]  under FEHA. Under subsection 12940(a) of FEHA, it is unlawful for an employer to discharge an employee because of "physical disability" unless the employee "is unable to perform the . . . essential duties even with reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a), § 12940(a)(1). "A prima facie case of disability discrimination under FEHA requires the employee to show that he or she (1) suffered from a disability . . . ; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations[;] and (3) was subjected to adverse employment action because of the disability." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (Ct. App. 2010) (citing Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (Ct. App. 2000)).
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff suffered a disability. They also do not dispute that Defendants terminated Plaintiff's employment because of her physical restrictions. (See Berenji Decl., Ex. F; Hinnerichs Dep., 168:19-25, Ex. 9.) Thus, summary adjudication turns on whether Plaintiff was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation. Defendants submit that lifting, pushing, and pulling weight were essential functions of Plaintiff's job, and that she could not perform these functions with or without reasonable accommodation.
1. Essential Functions of Plaintiff's Job [*21] 
The Court begins by determining whether lifting, pushing and pulling weight, and providing donor care were essential functions of Plaintiff's job.
"'Essential functions' means the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires" and excludes "the marginal functions of the position." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Ct. App. 2015) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f) and Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e)(3)). Marginal functions are "those that, if not performed, would not eliminate the need for the job or that could be readily performed by another employee or that could be performed in an alternative way." Cal. Code. Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e)(3). "A job function may be considered essential for any of several reasons, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the following":
(A) . . . the reason the position exists is to perform that function.
(B) . . . the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed.
(C) . . . the incumbent in the position is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular [highly specialized] function.
Cal. Gov't Code, § 12926(f); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to, the following:
(A) The employer's or other covered entity's judgment as to which functions [*22]  are essential.
(B) Accurate, current written job descriptions.
(C) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function.
(D) The legitimate business consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function.
(E) Job descriptions or job functions contained in a collective bargaining agreement.
(F) The work experience of past incumbents in the job.
(G) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
(H) Reference to the importance of the performance of the job function in prior performance reviews.
Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(e).
a. Lifting, Pushing, and Pulling Heavy Weight Was Not An Essential Function of Plaintiff's Job.
To support the contention that lifting weight, and pushing and pulling carts weighing 240 pounds were essential functions of Plaintiff's job, Defendants point to a 2003 "Technician I, Collections" job description, which indicates that "physical requirements" of the position "may include the ability to lift, push or pull heavy weights up and down ramps and stairs." The job description's responsibilities include "[a]ssembl[ing] and maintain[ing] supplies" and notes on the subsequent page that "[t]he duties above indicate the essential functions of the position"—appearing to refer [*23]  to the previously described responsibilities. A "JOB REQUIREMENT CHECKLIST" produced by the Defendants for the positions of "Phebotomist/Tech I & II" indicate that these jobs' "essential functions" include occasional "reaching overhead." (Woodard Dep., Ex. 14.) In addition, the checklist indicates that "physical demands" of these jobs include occasional lifting from various heights, carrying 75 pounds, and pushing and pulling 240 lbs. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 14.) The Collective Bargaining Agreement governing Plaintiff and Defendants' relationship also states that "[c]ollection staff may be required to assist with set up and tear down of the blood drive. Although, it is the primary duty of the driver to load and unload the vehicle, current Collections staff may need to assist . . . where there is an insufficient number of drivers available and to the extent necessary." (Escobedo Dep., 154:9-22; Escobedo Dep., Ex. 17, at 10.) Moreover, Plaintiff testified that during her employment, she would lift totes filled with supplies to help set up blood drives and had previously indicated that her job at some point in time required up to three hours per day of lifting and/or carrying items weighing [*24]  between 26 and 50 pounds. (Woodard Dep., 22:15-24, 25:23-26:14, 121:18-122:22, Ex. 12.)
Despite this evidence, it is undisputed that the primary purpose of Plaintiff's job was to collect blood from donors through the "venipuncture" process. (Defs' Response to PUF, PP 1-2, 71.) Plaintiff testified that throughout her employment, she collected blood on bloodmobiles and at fixed donation centers, and she was not required to push or pull carts at these locations, although she still performed some lifting. (Woodard Dep., 42:4-43:25, 44:8-45:5, 109:21-110:13.) Plaintiff testified that remote blood drives would be staffed by multiple individuals. (Woodard Dep., 26:22-25, 28:23-29:3, 31:9-13). Plaintiff also previously indicated that her job required only occasional lifting and carrying of between eleven (11) and fifty (50) pounds. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 12.) In addition, lifting and carrying was only one aspect of her employment.
Accordingly, lifting, pushing, and pulling heavy weights were not essential functions of Plaintiff's job. These duties were not specialized, did not comprise the majority of her work, elimination of these duties did not eliminate the need for Plaintiff's job, and the collective [*25]  bargaining agreement indicates that some of these duties belonged primarily to the drivers.
b. Donor Care Was An Essential Function of Plaintiff's Job.
Undisputed facts show that donor care was an essential function of Plaintiff's job. Defendants' "Complications Guide" describes many donor reactions and includes procedures in the event a donors faints. (Berenji Decl., Ex. F.) In such an event, staff are instructed not to lift fallen donors from the floor. (Berenji Decl., Ex. F). The guide does instruct that staff close to a falling or fainting donor should stand behind the donor, hold the donor's hips and slide the donor down their leg to the floor. (Berenji Decl., Ex. F.) These instructions suggest that Plaintiff would be unable to provide this assistance if she were unable to lift more than 10 or 15 pounds. Although donors may faint infrequently, the rarity of the event does not mean that caring for, or providing for the safety, of these donors is non-essential.
Accordingly, the Court agrees with Defendants that providing donor care is an essential function and that providing donor care would involve Plaintiff pushing and pulling more than 10 or 15 pounds. Plaintiff would not be able [*26]  to complete this task without a reasonable accommodation.
2. Reasonable Accommodations
Having established that Plaintiff had to provide "donor care" as part of her essential function and that she would need an "accommodation" to provide some of this donor care, the Court next determines whether Defendants provided a "reasonable accommodation" to Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends that she could have fulfilled her essential "donor care" duties if Defendants: (1) "temporarily assigned another employee . . . or volunteer to assist Woodard when the donor stood up[;]" (2) "assigned Woodard to an available position in its corporate office in Pomona[;]" (3) offered an extended leave of absence up to six months; and/or (4) assigned Woodard to work at a fixed donation center or Bloodmobile, which would have eliminated the need to lift, push or pull heavy equipment. (Opp'n at 17-19.) Defendants argue that none of these accommodations are reasonable.
The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendants could have temporarily assigned another employee or volunteer to assist Woodard when donors stood up as a reasonable accommodation. Statutory examples of reasonable accommodations include "providing assistive [*27]  aids or services" to an employee, "reallocation or redistribution of non-essential job functions in a job with multiple responsibilities," and "providing an alteration of when and/or how an essential function is performed." Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, § 11065(p)(2).
Defendants cite Provstgaard v. IHC Health Servs., Inc., No. 2:14-CV-00117-RJS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145455, 2016 WL 6108545 (D. Utah Oct. 19, 2016) for the proposition that it is not a reasonable accommodation to assign another employee to help perform the duties of a job, but this case is factually distinct. In Provstgaard, the plaintiff was an echocardiograph technician who suffered a stroke and thereafter experienced short term memory loss and started making frequent, major mistakes in his work that sometimes put patients at risk. Id. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145455, [WL] at *1-4. As a result, he almost always worked with another employee, and his employer would schedule an extra employee to work and earn overtime to supervise his work and mitigate patient risk. Id. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145455, [WL] at *10.
Provstgaard differs from the instant case. Undisputed facts show that Plaintiff could perform her major responsibilities, including collecting blood and providing donor care. Her proposed accommodation of having another employee or volunteer assist her during the short time frame during which a donor stands after donating [*28]  blood is reasonable. Providing care to a donor standing up was only a small part of Plaintiff's job, and assistance in providing donor care was readily available to Plaintiff. For example, Plaintiff has testified that each blood drive was staffed by multiple people and a volunteer.
The Court DENIES Defendant's Motion with respect to Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination. Plaintiff has established sufficient facts to show that (1) she suffered from a disability, (2) she could perform the essential duties of her job with a reasonable accommodation, and (3) she was subject to an adverse employment action because of her disability.
C. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation
The Court next analyzes Plaintiff's cause of action for Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation for her known physical disability. "The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are: (1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability." Nealy v. City of Santa Monica, 234 Cal. App. 4th 359, 373, 184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 9 (Ct. App. 2015).
As set forth in the prior section, the Court has held that Plaintiff [*29]  has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a reasonable accommodation was available to Plaintiff and whether Defendants failed to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable accommodation. See Dep't of Fair Emp't & Hous. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 642 F.3d 728, 743-44 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55, 68 (2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's failure to provide reasonable accommodation cause of action.
D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
Defendant next contends that Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process fails because Defendants continuously and repeatedly engaged in the interactive process, Plaintiff has failed to identify a reasonable accommodation that should have been produced by the process, and because Plaintiff declined the opportunity to train for alternative positions.
FEHA requires employers to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n); see also Scotch v. Art Inst., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1003, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (Ct. App. 2009). "The 'interactive process' required by the FEHA is an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation [*30]  that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively." Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1013 (quoting Wilson v . County or Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1195, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (Ct. App. 2009)). Ritualized discussion are not required, but the interactive process imposes burdens on both the employer and the employee. See id.
The employee must initiate the interactive process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious. Id. (citing Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)). "Once the interactive process is initiated, the employer's obligation to engage in the process in good faith is continuous." Id. (citing Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosp. Assn., 239 F.3d 1128, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001)). Each party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party. Liability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith. See Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62 n.22, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1115 (9th Cir. 2000) ("[C]ourts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown [in the interactive process] and then assign responsibility so that liability . . . ensues only where the employer bears responsibility for that breakdown." (internal quotation marks omitted)), rev'd on other grounds, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 152 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2002).
In the instant case, there is no doubt [*31]  that Defendants and Plaintiff engaged in a preliminary interactive process. Plaintiff testified that she visited a doctor after she injured her shoulder, and that doctor informed Defendants that Plaintiff could return to work with limited use of her left hand, limited gripping and grasping, and limited lift of up to ten (10) pounds. (Woodard Dep., 130:24-131:13, Ex. 13.) Plaintiff testified that Gunter called her the following Monday to let her know that Defendants could not accommodate her work restrictions and that she did not need to come into work. (Woodard Dep., 131:5-13, 132:12-18.) Plaintiff also visited a doctor upon guidance from Defendants. (Woodard Dep., Ex. 14, Ex. 16.) Upon receipt of the complete medical questionnaire and with input from Christine Hinnerichs, Human Resources Business Partner Irma Escobedo, and Loss Control Officer Barbara Gunter, Defendants determined that it could not accommodate Ms. Woodard's medical restrictions. (Hinnerichs Decl. P 7, ECF No. 22-3.)
As noted previously, however, Plaintiff has identified a reasonable accommodation that could have allowed her to continue in her job and abide by the instructions that her doctor had provided. The existence [*32]  of this reasonable accommodation suggests that despite Defendants initially communicating with Plaintiff about Plaintiff's disability, Defendants did not adequately analyze Plaintiff's condition and engage in an interactive process with her to identify a reasonable accommodation. See Scotch, 173 Cal. App. 4th at 1018 ("To prevail on a claim under section 12940, subdivision (n) for failure to engage in the interactive process, an employee must identify a reasonable accommodation that would have been available at the time the interactive process should have occurred.")
The Court, therefore, DENIES summary judgment as to the interactive process cause of action.
E. Retaliation Claim
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "discharge, expel, or otherwise discriminate against any person because the person has opposed any practices forbidden under this part or because the person has filed a complaint, testified, or assisted in any proceeding under this part." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(h). FEHA also clarifies that it is unlawful for an employer to "retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, Plaintiff must show: "(1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) she was subjected to an [*33]  adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123 (2005).
Requesting an accommodation for a disability is a protected activity under an amendment to FEHA, made effective January 1, 2016. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)(2); see also Castro-Ramirez v. Dependable Highway Express, Inc., 2 Cal. App. 5th 1028, 1050, 207 Cal. Rptr. 3d 120 (Ct. App. 2016). Because termination is an adverse employment action, Plaintiff must only raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a causal link between her request for accommodation and her termination. Proximity in time between the employee's protected activity and the adverse employment action satisfies the employee's prima facie burden. Castro-Ramirez, 2 Cal. App. 5th at 1049-49 (citing McRae v. Dep't of Corrections & Rehabilitation, 142 Cal. App. 4th 377, 388, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 313 (Ct. App. 2006)).
In the instant case, because of the proximity in time between Plaintiff's request for an accommodation and her ultimate termination, the Court holds that a prima facie case of a retaliation claim exists. The Court, therefore, DENIES Defendants' Motion as to Plaintiff's cause of action for retaliation.
F. Failure to Prevent Discrimination or Retaliation
FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer "to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination . . . from occurring." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k). "The employer's duty to prevent harassment and discrimination is affirmative [*34]  and mandatory." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 288, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., 103 Cal. App. 4th 1021, 1035, 127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 285 (Ct. App. 2002)).
Defendants contend that Plaintiff's fourth and sixth causes of action for failure to prevent discrimination and failure to prevent retaliation must fail because Plaintiff cannot prove her underlying discrimination and retaliation claims. The Court DENIES Defendants' Motion as to these two causes of action. As for the failure to prevent discrimination cause of action, Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff could perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation. As for the failure to prevent retaliation cause of action, Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact as to whether she was terminated in retaliation for her request for a reasonable accommodation.
G. Wrongful Termination
Termination of an employee constitutes a tort when it violates fundamental principles of public policy. Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., 27 Cal. 3d 167, 170, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980). To prove a wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) the existence of an employer-employee relationship; (2) that the termination of plaintiff's employment was in violation of public policy; (3) that the termination of employment was a legal [*35]  cause of Plaintiff's damages; and (4) the nature and the extent of plaintiff's damages. See Holmes v. Gen. Dynamics, Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1427 n.8, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (Ct. App. 1993). Violation of FEHA can serve as the basis for such a claim. See Acuna v. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co, 217 Cal. App. 4th 1402, 1420, 159 Cal. Rptr. 3d 749 (Ct. App. 2013) ("To the extent [the plaintiff] is able to prove the allegations of a timely [FEHA] retaliation claim, she also may be entitled to recover on a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy prohibiting retaliatory terminations"); see also Moorpark v. Superior Court, 18 Cal. 4th 1143, 1159-61, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 445, 959 P.2d 752 (1998). "[W]hen a plaintiff relies upon a statutory prohibition to support a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the common law claim is subject to statutory limitations affecting the nature and scope of the statutory prohibition . . . ." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in the original) (quoting Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 880, 904, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (Ct. App. 1997)).
Defendants' only argument in support of summary judgment is that Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim is duplicative of her FEHA claims. Although Dubins v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 25 Cal. App. 4th 77, 82 n.3, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 336 (Ct. App. 1994), supports Defendants' position, California courts have since established that FEHA may indeed serve as the basis of a wrongful termination claim.
Accordingly, because Plaintiff has established sufficient facts to survive summary judgment as to the underlying FEHA discrimination claim, [*36]  the Court DENIES Defendants's Motion as to the wrongful termination cause of action.
H. Punitive Damages
Defendants finally argue that Plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages. Although Defendants contend that they are immune from punitive damages because of their status as a federal instrumentality, the Court declines to address this argument because the undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages on other grounds.
To recover punitive damages against an employer, a plaintiff must prove "by clear and convincing evidence" that an officer, director, or managing agent was personally guilty of oppression, fraud or malice or ratified such oppression fraud or malice, or authorized or ratified such conduct. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a)-(b).
In the instant case, Plaintiff has identified no conduct that could be considered so despicable, willful, cruel or unjust so as to rise to the level of malice or oppression. The only offensive comment Plaintiff ever recalled was Barbara Gunter's response to her inquiry about how she could get to work without using her left hand, to which Gunter responded, "That's not our problem." (Woodard Dep., 136:22-137:9.) In fact, Plaintiff never complained of [*37]  discrimination or retaliation to any of the Defendants, nor did Plaintiff ever assert to Defendants that she could in fact perform the essential functions of her job with the work restrictions imposed on her.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion with respect to Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.
IV. RULING
For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES IN PART AND GRANTS IN PART Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court DENIES the Motion as to all of Plaintiff's causes of action. However, the Court GRANTS the Motion with respect to Plaintiff's claim of the remedy of punitive damages.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
