Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
Pending before the Court is Defendant Careington International Corporation's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, Request for Sanctions, and Brief in Support ("Defendant's Motion to Dismiss") [Dkt. 3]. After reviewing the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff's Response [Dkt. 4], Defendant's Reply [Dkt. 5], and all other relevant filings, the Court recommends Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. 3] be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, as set forth herein.

BACKGROUND
On November 30, 2020, Plaintiff Karen Manson ("Plaintiff") initiated the instant action against her former employer, Defendant Careington International Corporation, through the filing of her Original Complaint ("Complaint") [Dkt. 1], alleging disability discrimination on the basis of her "love/sex addiction" and failure to accommodate [*2]  as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") [Dkt. 1 at 3-4]. Per her Complaint, Plaintiff worked for Defendant in its office in Frisco, Texas, "as a Director of IT Operations" at the time of her termination [Dkt. 1 at 2]. Plaintiff avers that in December 2019, she informed her immediate supervisor that she "suspected she suffered from a love/sex addiction" and was in the process of identifying a therapist with whom to pursue treatment [Dkt. 1 at 2]. On January 19, 2020, the website for one of Defendant's customers "suffered a widespread and lengthy outage," for which Plaintiff's department was responsible [Dkt. 1 at 2]. On January 23, 2020, Plaintiff took a personal day "to attend an emergency counseling session relating to her condition," where she was officially diagnosed with a "love/sex addiction" [Dkt. 1 at 2]. When Plaintiff returned to the office on January 24, 2020, she disclosed her diagnosis to her immediate supervisor [Dkt. 1 at 2]. Plaintiff was fired the same day she informed her immediate supervisor of her "love/sex addiction", however, Defendant stated that her termination was related to the customer outage [Dkt. 1 at 2]. Plaintiff states that although she "discovered the source" of [*3]  the outage and led the team to resolve the problem, "[o]ddly, she was the only employee to receive any discipline at all relating to the outage," despite four other employees sharing responsibility for the outage [Dkt. 1 at 2-3].
Plaintiff asserts two claims against Defendant under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate as required by 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5); and (2) disability discrimination under 12 U.S.C. § 12112 [Dkt. 1 at 3].1 Through her claims, Plaintiff contends "Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff [] on the basis of her disabilities or perceived disabilities when, in response to the customer outage, it terminated her employment but did not discipline the other employees involved in the outage" [Dkt. 1 at 4].

Motion to Dismiss and Request for Sanctions
On December 22, 2020, Defendant filed its Motion to Dismiss, seeking dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) "because sexual behavior disorders, including sex addiction, are expressly excluded from the ADA's coverage, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Plaintiff never requested an accommodation, rendering her failure to accommodate claim equally frivolous" [Dkt. 3 at 2]. Defendant notes Plaintiff's own Complaint recognizes "Defendant terminated [Plaintiff's] employment [*4]  five days after the customer outage that occurred under Plaintiff's supervision as the Director of IT[,]" and that Defendant based Plaintiff's termination on the outage [Dkt. 3 at 3]. In addition, Defendants requests the Court impose Rule 11 sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel because "they knowingly and purposefully filed a lawsuit based on a non-existent disability expressly excluded by the ADA, and further because Plaintiff's Complaint fails to advance any nonfrivolous argument for modifying or reversing existing law or for establishing new law" [Dkt. 3 at 8-9].

MOTION TO DISMISS

Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss argues that the complaint fails to assert facts that give rise to legal liability of the defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that each claim in a complaint include a "short and plain statement . . . showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Each claim must include enough factual allegations "to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff's complaint and view those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. [*5]  Bowlby v. City of Aberdeen, 681 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). Thus, "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). "But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the [C]ourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Id. at 679 (alterations in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).
In Iqbal, the Supreme Court established a two-step approach for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. First, the Court should identify and disregard conclusory allegations, for they are "not entitled to the assumption of truth." Id. Second, the Court "consider[s] the factual allegations in [the complaint] to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief." Id. at 681. "This standard 'simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of' the necessary claims [*6]  or elements.'" Morgan v. Hubert, 335 F. App'x 466, 470 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing In re So. Scrap Material Co., 541 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir. 2008)). This evaluation will "be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing [C]ourt to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.2

Plaintiff Does Not Allege a Disability Within the Meaning of the ADA
The ADA prohibits covered entities3 from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Under either of Plaintiff's ADA "disability related claims," her discrimination or failure to accommodate claim, a prima facie element of each is proof of a disability.4 The ADA defines disability as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 (describing the three prongs of the definition of "disability" as the "actual disability" prong, the "record of" prong, and the "regarded as" prong). Despite the ADA's broad definition [*7]  of disability, it does contain certain statutory exclusions. Relevant herein, "[u]nder this Act, the term 'disability' shall not include—(1) transvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders." 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b)(1); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.3(d)(1).
Defendant avers, in reliance on the statutory text, that Plaintiff's "love/sex addiction" cannot give rise to a cognizable disability discrimination claim under the ADA given Congress's express exclusion of "other sexual behavior disorders" from the definition of disability [Dkt. 3 at 5]. In support of this position, Defendant argues that the American Psychiatric Association excluded sex addiction, a behavioral disorder "which it has also referred to as 'hypersexual disorder,' from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 ("DSM-5") published in 2013" [Dkt. 3 at 6 n.5]. The DSM-5 explains,
[G]roups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to [*8]  establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.
Am. Psychiatric Ass'N, Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), Westlaw S2H16 (May 2013 update) (emphasis added); see Marcelo Piquet-Pessôa et al., DSM-5 and the Decision Not to Include Sex, Shopping or Stealing as Addictions, 1 Current Addiction Reps. 172, 173 (2014) ("While the evidence supporting the inclusion of gambling disorder as a behavioral addiction in DSM-5 was considered sufficient, there is still debate on whether other, less recognized forms of abnormal behaviors, such as compulsive buying, compulsive sex or hypersexual disorder, and kleptomania, can be conceptualized as addictions.").
Plaintiff conversely claims that her "love/sex addiction" is not covered by the exemption in the ADA because it is not a "sexual behavior disorder" [Dkt. 4 at 2-3]. Plaintiff describes her condition as a "mental disorder that requires that she limit her interactions with members of the opposite sex", which Plaintiff avers is different than a sexual behavior disorder [Dkt. 4 at 2].5 Plaintiff contends that a sexual behavior disorder is marked by behaviors [*9]  such as "viewing any sexually explicit content or touching oneself or another person in a sexual way" [Dkt. 4 at 2]. However, Plaintiff points to no authority supporting this distinction.6 The plain text of the statute similarly supports no such distinction—the ADA does not limit "sexual behavior disorders" to conditions that manifest through behaviors such as a need for physical contact or viewing sexually explicit material. See 42 U.S.C. § 12211(b)(1). Indeed, the ADA's non-exhaustive list of exempted disabilities includes several conditions related to sexual behavior that do not involve the behaviors identified by Plaintiff, including "transsexualism" and "gender identity disorders." Id. "The plain language of the statute indicates that [other sexual behavior disorders are] excluded from the definition of disability no matter how [they are] characterized, whether as a physical impairment, a mental disorder, or some combination thereof." Doe v. United Consumer Fin. Servs., No. 1:01 CV 1112, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25509, 2001 WL 34350174, at *6 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 9, 2001).
Further, no court has recognized a love/sex addiction as a covered disability under the ADA. Other sources have cited with approval Pacenza v. IBM Corp. for the proposition that "sex addition" is not a disability covered by the ADA. No. 04 CIV. 5831 (PGG), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, 2009 WL 890060, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2009), aff'd, 363 F. App'x 128 (2d Cir. 2010). In Pacenza, the court [*10]  considered allegations of discrimination under the ADA based upon an employee's post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), which manifested itself as a sex addiction. Id. The plaintiff in Pacenza argued that because his sex addiction was caused by his PTSD, he was discriminated against and fired based on his disability, when his employment was terminated shortly after his supervisor became aware that he was utilizing company computers to access "explicit" chatrooms. Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, [WL] at *6. The plaintiff argued that IMB "used his improper internet usage as a pretext to justify his termination and disguise its disability and age discrimination." Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, [WL] at *1. The court found summary judgment for IBM proper, concluding that the plaintiff had "failed to establish a prima facie case" for discrimination under the ADA because the evidence did not establish that the plaintiff's termination for his sex addiction and improper use of company computers was a pretext to termination for his PTSD. Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, [WL] at *8. The court in Pacenza further noted that Plaintiff did not attempt to argue that his sex addition itself constituted a disability, explaining that under 29 C.F.R. § 1630.3(d)(1) "a 'disability' under the ADA does not include '[t]ransvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, [*11]  exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, or other sexual behavior disorders[.]'" Id. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, [WL] at *10 n.12. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's decision finding that the plaintiff "failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination under the ADA" because the evidence reflected that the plaintiff's supervisors were unaware of his diagnosis of PTSD at the time of his termination. Pacenza v. IBM Corp., 363 F. App'x 128, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2010). Plaintiff argues Pacenza is not persuasive in the instant case because the disability alleged was PTSD and not sex addiction [Dkt. 4 at 3]. While Plaintiff is correct that the alleged disability was PTSD, the court in Pacenza found the employee failed to state a claim under the ADA because his termination occurred when his employer had knowledge of his sex addiction but not his PTSD diagnosis, meaning the plaintiff had no claim based on a covered disability—the implication being that disclosure of the sex addiction alone was insufficient to show he had an ADA-covered disability. See Pacenza, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29778, 2009 WL 890060, at *10.
The Court further considers the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine's decision in Winston v. Me. Tech. Coll. Sys., 631 A.2d 70, 73-75 (Me. 1993). Upon review of a plaintiff's claim that he was wrongly "terminated because of his 'mental handicap of [*12]  sexual addiction[,]'" the Court in Winston determined that sex addiction is a sexual behavior disorder which is excluded by § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Id. at 73-74. Relevant herein, the Fifth Circuit has held that "because the rights and remedies under both [the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act] are the same, case law interpreting one statute can be applied to the other." Pace v. Bogalusa City Sch. Bd., 403 F.3d 272, 287-88 (5th Cir. 2005). Thus, the Winston court's finding that "[p]laintiff's claimed [sex] addiction is a sexual behavior disorder[,]" and is not a disability under the Rehabilitation Act, is instructive in the instant case. Winston, 631 A.2d at 74. After determining that the plaintiff's sex addition was a sexual behavior disorder, the Winston court found that the Rehabilitation Act was not "intended to protect individuals with sexual behavior disorders." Id. at 75. The court continued: "[w]e further note that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual does not officially include sexual addiction, [and] that defendant's psychiatrist's opinion is based on a very broad 'process' addiction model representing the view of a 'subset' of physicians, and that the [ADA] also specifically excludes 'sexual behavior disorders' from the term 'disability[.]'" Id.
While Plaintiff argues that the cases cited by Defendant are [*13]  insufficient to conclude that her love/sex addition is excluded from the definition of disability, Plaintiff has wholly failed to provide the Court any legal authority supporting her position that her "love/sex addition" is a disability included under the ADA. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege a disability under the ADA; Plaintiff's disability-related claims asserted on the basis of a "love/sex addiction" should be dismissed. See e.g., Carter v. Mich. Dep't of Corr., No. 1:13-cv-37, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90089, 2013 WL 3270909, at *7 (W.D. Mich. June 27, 2013) ("[P]laintiff's alleged propensity for sexual misbehavior does not constitute a 'disability' within the meaning of the ADA. The ADA expressly states that 'disability' as defined within 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) does not include 'sexual behavior disorders.'") (citing Hawkins v. Mich. Parole Bd., No. 98-1045, 187 F.3d 635, 1999 WL 506996, at *1 (6th Cir. June 10, 1999)); Oiler v. Winn-Dixie La., Inc., No. CIV. A. 00-3114, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17417, 2002 WL 31098541, at *3 n.47 (E.D. La. Sept. 16, 2002) (explaining that plaintiff, who was terminated based in part because he was transgender, did not attempt to bring an ADA claim, and could not bring such a claim, because gender disorders and other sexual behavior disorders are not a disability under the statute).

Failure to State a Claim for Failure to Accommodate
Even if the Court were to assume Plaintiff's love/sex addiction constitutes a covered disability, her failure to accommodate [*14]  claim would remain subject to dismissal. "[A] plaintiff must prove the following statutory elements to prevail in a failure-to-accommodate claim: (1) the plaintiff is a 'qualified individual with a disability;' (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were 'known' by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make 'reasonable accommodations' for such known limitations." Amedee v. Shell Chem., L.P., 953 F.3d 831, 837 (5th Cir. 2020) (quoting Feist v. Louisiana, 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. 2013)). "[I]t is the employee's initial request for an accommodation which triggers the employer's obligation to participate in the interactive process of determining one." Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9, App. (1995) ("it is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.")). Stated differently, "[e]mployees who require accommodation due to a disability are responsible for requesting a reasonable accommodation." Acker v. GM, L.L.C., 853 F.3d 784, 791 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Griffin v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216 (5th Cir. 2011)). "If the employee fails to request an accommodation, the employer cannot be held liable for failing to provide one." Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165.
Plaintiff's Response advances that she requested a reasonable accommodation, limiting her interactions with members of the opposite sex [Dkt. 4 at 6-7]. However, in her Complaint, Plaintiff states only that she [*15]  "informed Defendant of her disabilities and the consequences thereof at the time of her diagnosis" [Dkt. 1 at 3]. As Defendant urges [Dkt. 3 at 7-8], this is insufficient. To state a claim for failure to accommodate, "[a]n employee who needs an accommodation. . . has the responsibility of informing [her] employer." Delaval v. PTech Drilling Tubulars, L.L.C., 824 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing EEOC v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009)). "[W]here the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee . . . to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Grant v. Harris Cnty., 794 F. App'x 352, 360 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d at 621). Here, Plaintiff has not pleaded that she informed Defendant of the reasonable accommodations she would require because of her "love/sex addiction." See Mesa v. City of San Antonio, No. CV SA-17-CA-654-XR, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196695, 2017 WL 5924263, at *4 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 29, 2017) (Dismissing plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA where plaintiff did not "allege any facts indicating that he requested an accommodation or that a reasonable accommodation was denied."). Against this backdrop, Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate should be dismissed.

MOTION FOR SANCTIONS
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides for sanctions for filing frivolous, baseless claims that are unsupported [*16]  in law or fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. Rule 11 serves the purposes of deterring "baseless filings" and sparing "innocent parties and overburdened courts from the filing of frivolous lawsuits." Orchestrate HR, Inc. v. Trombetta, 178 F. Supp. 3d 476, 498 (N.D. Tex. 2016) (citations omitted). An attorney's compliance with Rule 11 is measured by "an objective, not subjective, standard of reasonableness under the circumstances." Iris Connex, LLC v. Dell, Inc., 235 F. Supp. 3d 826, 855 (E.D. Tex. 2017) (quoting Whitehead v. Food Max of Miss., Inc., 332 F.3d 796, 802 (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc)). The Court has "discretion to impose an appropriate sanction" if it finds counsel has violated Rule 11. Jabary v. McCullough, 325 F.R.D. 175, 182-83 (E.D. Tex. 2018). Imposing sanctions under Rule 11, however, is "an extraordinary remedy, one to be exercised with extreme caution." Trombetta, 178 F. Supp. 3d at 498 (citation omitted).
Defendant requests the Court sua sponte issue a show cause order "requiring Plaintiff and her counsel to show why Rule 11 has not been violated, and upon hearing, impose sanctions against them for violating Rule 11" [Dkt. 3 at 9]. Defendant avers that an "award of sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel is appropriate" because (1) "they knowingly and purposefully filed a lawsuit based on a non-existent disability expressly excluded by the ADA," and (2) "Plaintiff's Complaint fails to advance any nonfrivolous argument for modifying or reversing existing law or for establishing new law" [Dkt. 3 at 8]. As an initial matter, Rule 11 does not permit [*17]  the Court to impose monetary sanctions against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(5)(a) ("Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not impose a monetary sanction: against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2)"); see Marlin v. Moody Nat'l Bank N.A., 533 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir. 2008) ("Monetary sanctions may not be imposed against a represented party . . . for violation of Rule 11(b)(2) (requiring legal contentions to be warranted, inter alia, by existing law)."); Skidmore Energy, Inc. v. KPMG, 455 F.3d 564, 567 (5th Cir. 2006) ("the 1993 Amendment to the Rule specifically provides that '[m]onetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a violation of subdivision (b)(2)' concerning legally frivolous pleadings, which are peculiarly within the province of lawyers"); Estate of Milburn v. Colonial Freight Sys. Inc., No. 2:19-CV-00233-JRG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212082, 2020 WL 6701557, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 12, 2020) ("the Court may not impose a monetary sanction against a represented party for a violation of Rule 11(b)(2)—legally frivolous contentions"). Moreover, the failure of Plaintiff to state a plausible claim for relief in the Complaint "under Rule 12(b)(6) is not by itself sufficient to warrant the imposition of sanctions." Margetis v. Furgeson, No. 4:12-CV-753, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130903, 2015 WL 6688063, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 29, 2015), aff'd, 666 F. App'x 328 (5th Cir. 2016). Upon consideration of the pleadings before the Court, the Court finds sanctions inappropriate. Thus, the Court recommends Defendant's request for sanctions be denied.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Based on the foregoing, the undersigned recommends that Defendant [*18]  Careington International Corporation's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, Request for Sanctions, and Brief in Support [Dkt. 3] be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiff's claims against Defendant should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Further, Defendant's Request for Sanctions should be DENIED.
Within fourteen (14) days after service of the magistrate judge's report, any party must serve and file specific written objections to the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C). In order to be specific, an objection must identify the specific finding or recommendation to which objection is made, state the basis for the objection, and specify the place in the magistrate judge's report and recommendation where the disputed determination is found. An objection that merely incorporates by reference or refers to the briefing before the magistrate judge is not specific.
Failure to file specific, written objections will bar the party from appealing the unobjected-to factual findings and legal conclusions of the magistrate judge that are accepted by the district court, except upon grounds of plain error, provided that the party has been served with notice that such consequences will result from [*19]  a failure to object. See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1417 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc), superseded by statute on other grounds, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) (extending the time to file objections from ten to fourteen days).
