Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff Rebecca Sutherland filed the above-styled action against Defendant Global Equipment Co., Inc. ("Global"), in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, on August 23, 2016. [Doc. 1]. The action was removed to this court by Defendant Global on September 22, 2016, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441, and 1446. [Id.]. Plaintiff Sutherland filed her first amended complaint on November 18, 2016. [Doc. 3]. Plaintiff asserts state law claims for breach of contract, fraud, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. [Id., Counts 1-4]. Plaintiff also asserts federal claims for interference and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. [Id., Count 5]. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Global violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments of 2008 ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., by discriminating and retaliating against her because of her association with her [*2]  disabled husband. [Id., Count 6]. Defendant has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on Plaintiff's claims based upon the pleadings, statements of material facts, exhibits, and discovery materials submitted to the court. [Doc. 31].

I. Facts
When evaluating the merits of a motion for summary judgment, the court must "view the evidence and all factual inferences raised by it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party." Comer v. City of Palm Bay, Florida, 265 F.3d 1186, 1192 (11th Cir. 2001). However, mere conclusions and unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005). In accordance with the foregoing principles, the following facts are deemed to be true for the limited purpose of evaluating Defendant's motion [Doc. 31] for summary judgment.
Defendant Global is a business that sells industrial equipment and supplies. [Defendant's Statement of Material Facts ("DSMF") ¶ 1]. Defendant hired Plaintiff Rebecca Sutherland as an Outside Sales Account Manager in 2005. [Id.]. As an Account Manager, Plaintiff was responsible for selling industrial equipment and supplies to the customer accounts that [*3]  Global assigned to her. [DSMF ¶ 2]. In her job as an Account Manager, Plaintiff would make calls to and receive calls from her assigned customer accounts to take product orders, answer questions about orders, and generate quotes, among other tasks. [DSMF ¶ 4].
When placing an order for a customer or generating a quote, Plaintiff would enter the product's part number and quantity of the product into Global's Profit Center Software ("PCS") system on her computer. [DSMF ¶ 7]. Plaintiff could immediately see the cost, the gross profit, the shipping cost, and the price to the customer. In fact, PCS would also generate and display the commission that Plaintiff would earn for each specific transaction. [DSMF ¶ 8]. Similarly, whenever she needed, Plaintiff could access and did access company reports and historical records of the financial information for the transactions that she made. [DSMF ¶ 9].
Under Global's Account Manager Commission Plan (the "Commission Plan"), Plaintiff received a base annual salary of $17,000 plus commissions. [DSMF ¶ 5]. Plaintiff could earn commissions based on various criteria described in the Commission Plan. [DSMF ¶ 6]. Once an order shipped to the customer, Global [*4]  did not wait for the customer to pay for the products before Global advanced Plaintiff her commission on that sale. [DSMF ¶ 10]. Global advanced the commission, but Plaintiff understood that if a customer did not pay within 90 days, Global would take back or "ding" the advanced commission by deducting it from commission advances in a subsequent paycheck. [DSMF ¶ 11].
Plaintiff regularly accessed "aging" reports of accounts receivable that listed each of her accounts and the corresponding orders so that she could see whether the customers paid for their orders right away, whether they still owed money, and whether she needed to follow up with the customers to make sure they paid on time. [DSMF ¶ 12]. Plaintiff understood that making collections was part of her role as an Account Manager, and she regularly monitored the "aging" reports. [DSMF ¶ 13]. Plaintiff followed up with customers to make sure they paid within the 90 days so she could receive her commission. [DSMF ¶ 14]. If Plaintiff disputed a "ding" (that is, a deduction to recover an advanced commission), she had the opportunity to follow the complaint procedure described in the Commission Plan and submit paperwork to support [*5]  her claim that her advanced commission should not have been taken out of a subsequent paycheck or that it should be paid to her. [DSMF ¶ 15]. In fact, Plaintiff took advantage of the complaint procedure over six times and received more than $4,525 back from Global for commission advances that had been deducted. [DSMF ¶ 16].
For most of her employment, Plaintiff's work schedule was from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. [DSMF ¶ 4]. In October 2010, Plaintiff was issued a final warning for attendance problems. Global changed Plaintiff's schedule so that she would come to work one hour later, and work from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., because Plaintiff was so often tardy when required to arrive at 8:00 a.m. [DSMF ¶ 19]. Around two years later, Global allowed Plaintiff to return to her prior schedule of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. [DSMF ¶ 20]. Plaintiff resigned from Global in May of 2013, but after a period of two weeks, she returned to the company. [Doc. 38, Ex. A, Plaintiff's Affidavit ("Pla. Aff.") ¶ 8]. Plaintiff reported to J. Logsdon, Assistant Corporate Sales Manager, from the time Plaintiff returned to Global in May of 2013 until Mr. Logsdon's resignation on November 4, 2015. Mr. Logsdon oversaw Plaintiff's [*6]  FMLA leave and personal leave including her tardies and absences. [Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts ("PSMF") ¶ 6; Pla. Aff. ¶ 11].
The customer accounts assigned to each Account Manager would change regularly depending on Global's business judgment. [DSMF ¶ 3; Plaintiff's Deposition ("Pla. Dep.") at 99-100]. Plaintiff testified, "So the accounts change pretty much on a regular basis. I did have some of these that I came into and had the duration of being an employee with Global; however, some would be taken away, given, whatever the preference was for Global. It was their account, so they did with them as they pleased." [Pla. Dep. at 100]. Plaintiff testified that in 2015, Defendant Global shuffled customer account responsibilities for Account Managers. [PSMF ¶ 4; Pla. Aff. ¶ 9]. According to Plaintiff, during this reshuffling, she lost approximately 30 accounts, including a Holiday Inn Account. Plaintiff testified that as a result of the reshuffling, she lost $500,000 in account sales. [Id.].
Plaintiff testified that since around March of 2015, her husband has suffered from a condition that causes him to have episodic periods of impaired lung functioning to such an extent that [*7]  he cannot get out of bed to use the bathroom. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 1; PSMF ¶ 1]. Plaintiff testified that she does not know which days her husband will not be able to leave the house. [Id.]. Plaintiff cares for her husband, sometimes takes her husband's daughter to school, and has household responsibilities such as taking care of three dogs. [Pla. Aff. ¶¶ 1, 2; PSMF ¶¶ 1, 2].
In August 2015, Plaintiff notified Marj Nourie, Human Resources Manager, that she would need to take time off work for the care of her spouse with a serious health condition. Ms. Nourie gave Plaintiff the documents necessary for requesting and receiving FMLA leave. [DSMF ¶ 21]. Ms. Nourie approved Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave based on the Certification of Health Care Provider that detailed the treating physician's certifications of the specific leave that Plaintiff would need, as well as the request for Family and Medical Leave that Plaintiff filled out and returned to Ms. Nourie. [DSMF ¶ 23]. The treating physician certified that Plaintiff needed intermittent FMLA leave to care for her spouse for the period of August 26, 2015, through September 1, 2016. The treating physician also certified that Plaintiff needed [*8]  to be absent once or twice a month and approximately one week every two to three months. [DSMF ¶ 25]. Plaintiff testified that prior to going on FMLA leave, she was aware of two other individuals in the Sales Department who were covered under the FMLA leave policy: Pam Sawyer, who had cancer, and Arlene McIntyre, whose husband had cancer. [PSMF ¶ 9; Pla. Aff. ¶ 14]. Plaintiff alleges that Ms. McIntyre "was allowed to designate a lower performing [Account Manager] to cover her accounts" and that Global "had another lower performing employee from another department cover [Ms. Sawyer's] accounts." [Id.].
On August 18 and 19, 2015, Plaintiff was granted two days of FMLA leave for her own serious health condition. [DSMF ¶ 22; Pla. Dep. at 147, Ex. 30; Nourie Declaration ("Dec.") ¶ 15, Ex. 2]. From August 26, 2015, through December 18, 2015, Plaintiff took numerous days of FMLA leave to care for her husband. [Pla. Dep. at 149-55, Ex. 30]. Plaintiff had no difficulties taking FMLA leave during this time and has represented to the court that "she was treated fairly and appropriately." [Doc. 38-1 at 17-18]. As noted supra, Plaintiff reported to Mr. Logsdon, Assistant Corporate Sales Manager, [*9]  until November 4, 2015. [PSMF ¶ 6; Pla. Aff. ¶ 11]. Plaintiff testified that she reported to Will Heinsman from November 4, 2015, until December 28, 2015, when Linda Matthews became her new Assistant Corporate Sales Manager. [PSMF ¶ 7; Pla. Aff. ¶ 12].1
Ms. Nourie testified that she followed the usual procedure for tracking Plaintiff's FMLA absences and compared the FMLA leave Plaintiff was taking to the amount of leave specified in the physician's certification. [Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; DSMF ¶ 27]. As previously noted, the treating physician certified that Plaintiff needed to be absent once or twice a month and approximately one week every two to three months. [DSMF ¶ 25]. The record evidence reveals that Plaintiff took FMLA leave for three and a half days in September 2015, three days in October 2015, three days in November 2015, four days and five hours in December 2015, and three days in January 2016. [Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; Pla. Dep. at 149-55; Doc. 39-1 at 6-16]. Ms. Nourie observed that Plaintiff took FMLA leave more frequently and for more consecutive days than originally approved in the physician's certification. [DSMF ¶ 28]. As a result, Ms. Nourie decided to touch base [*10]  with Plaintiff in January 2016 to see whether she needed an update to the physician's certification to support the change in the frequency and intervals of her leave. [DSMF ¶ 28].
On days when Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave, it was customary for other Account Managers to cover Plaintiff's assigned customer accounts by responding to customer calls, taking orders, and generating quotes. [DSMF ¶ 29; Davis Dec. ¶¶ 12, 13]. If customers made purchases while Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave, the commissions still went to Plaintiff, not to the Account Managers who actually entered the order. [Davis Dec. ¶¶ 12, 22]. In January 2016, Plaintiff's supervisors learned that this arrangement was no longer working effectively or fairly. [DSMF ¶ 29; Davis Dec. ¶¶ 12, 13]. At this time, Linda Matthews, Assistant Corporate Sales Manager, was Plaintiff's immediate supervisor. Ms. Matthews reported directly to Evelyn Davis, Corporate Sales Manager. [DSMF ¶ 30]. The first two weeks that Ms. Matthews supervised Plaintiff were January 4-8 and January 11-15 of 2016. [Matthews Aff. ¶ 5].
Ms. Matthews testified that Plaintiff was tardy four out of five days during the week of January 4-8. [Id.]. Plaintiff acknowledged [*11]  in her affidavit that she arrived at work after her scheduled time of 8:00 a.m. on four out of five days during the week of January 4-8, but that she was not tardy on one of those days because it was within the five minute grace period. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 18]. Ms. Matthews testified that during the week of January 11-15, Plaintiff was tardy all four days she came to work, was absent one full day, and was at work for less than two hours on another day. [Matthews Aff. ¶ 5]. Plaintiff acknowledged in her affidavit that during the week of January 11-15, she arrived at work after 8:00 a.m. on the four days she worked, but that she was not tardy on three of these days because they were within the five minute grace period. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 18]. In addition, as previously noted, records show that Plaintiff was absent from work on FMLA leave for three days the same month: January 18, 19, and 20, 2016. [Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; Pla. Dep. at 157; Pla. Aff. ¶ 18; Doc. 39-1 at 16]. Plaintiff testified that she was sick those three days and that she returned to work on January 21, 2016. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 18].
Ms. Matthews shared her concerns about Plaintiff's tardiness and attendance problems with Ms. Davis. [Davis [*12]  Dec. ¶ 14; Matthews Aff. ¶ 8]. Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis agreed that they would have a conversation with Plaintiff and tell her that she needed to come to work on time and improve her attendance. [Id.]. Ms. Nourie and Ms. Davis then met and agreed that Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis would speak to Plaintiff about her attendance problems unrelated to FMLA and that they would encourage Plaintiff to get to work on time. [Nourie Dec. ¶¶ 21, 22; Davis Dec. ¶ 16]. Ms. Nourie and Ms. Davis also agreed that Ms. Nourie would have a separate conversation with Plaintiff about her FMLA leave. [Id.].
Plaintiff was absent from January 18-20, and returned to work on January 21, 2016. [Nourie Dec. ¶¶ 18, 20, Ex. 11; Pla. Aff. ¶ 18]. On January 21, 2016, Plaintiff arrived for work ten minutes late, and Ms. Matthews asked her to come to a meeting in Ms. Davis' office. [Davis Dec. ¶ 17; Pla. Dep. at 158-59; Matthews Aff. ¶ 10; DSMF ¶ 36]. In the meeting, Ms. Davis and Ms. Matthews told Plaintiff that she needed to get to work on time and improve her attendance for the days that she did not take FMLA leave. [Pla. Dep. at 160; Davis Dep. at 72; Davis Dec. ¶ 19; Matthews Aff. ¶¶ 11-12; DSMF ¶ 37]. Ms. Davis [*13]  and Ms. Matthews also told Plaintiff that the other Account Managers helping to field calls at her desk when she was absent were having a hard time keeping up, especially since they did not receive a commission for the work that they did for her accounts. [Pla. Dep. at 160; Davis Dec. ¶ 22; DSMF ¶ 39]. Plaintiff was concerned that "her accounts were neglected," and she blamed fellow Account Managers for failing to properly handle her assigned accounts during her absences. [DSMF ¶ 41]. Plaintiff and her supervisors acknowledged that the current arrangement was no longer working effectively or fairly. [Pla. Dep. at 151, 160, 168-70; Davis Dec. ¶ 13; DSMF ¶ 40]. Plaintiff testified that during the meeting, Ms. Davis informed her to choose five accounts to be reassigned to other Account Managers. [Pla. Dep. at 174; DSMF ¶ 42]. At the end of the meeting, Ms. Davis asked Plaintiff if she had anything to say, and she said "no." [Pla. Dep. at 161].
Immediately after the meeting ended, Plaintiff left Ms. Davis' office and walked into the office of Ms. Nourie and resigned. [Pla. Dep. at 161; DSMF ¶ 46]. Ms. Nourie asked Plaintiff if she had spoken with Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis about her decision [*14]  to resign, and Plaintiff said "no." [DSMF ¶ 49]. Plaintiff also said that she did not respect Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis enough to talk with them. [Id.]. Five days later, on January 26, 2016, Ms. Nourie received an e-mail from Plaintiff Sutherland that was identified as her letter of resignation. [DSMF ¶ 50; Pla. Dep. at 167, Ex. 32].
Additional facts will be set forth as necessary during discussion of Plaintiff's claims.

II. Summary Judgment Standard
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides, "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (amended 2010). Rule 56(a) "mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The standard for granting summary judgment mirrors the directed verdict standard under Rule 50(a), which requires the court to grant a directed verdict where there can be but one reasonable conclusion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
The movant bears the initial burden of asserting the basis [*15]  of his motion, and that burden is a light one. See Celotex, 106 S. Ct. at 2553. The movant is not required to negate his opponent's claim. See id. Rather, the movant may discharge this burden merely by "'showing' - that is, pointing out to the district court - that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Id. at 2554.
When evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001). However, the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). Instead, "the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond the pleadings showing that a reasonable jury could find in its favor." Fickling v. United States, 507 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990)).
The court will apply these standards in ruling on Defendant's motion for summary judgment.

III. Discussion
Plaintiff Rebecca Sutherland asserts federal claims based on the FMLA and the ADAAA. [Doc. 3, Counts 5, 6]. In Count Five of her complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she sought to take FMLA leave to take care of her husband but that Defendant Global interfered with her rights under the FMLA and subjected her to retaliation for her exercise of her FMLA rights. [*16]  [Id. ¶¶ 23-30]. Plaintiff alleges in Count Six that Defendant violated the ADAAA by discriminating and retaliating against her because of her association with her disabled husband. [Id. ¶¶ 32-35]. In Counts One through Four, Plaintiff asserts state law claims for breach of contract, fraud, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. [Id. ¶¶ 9-21].

A. FMLA Claims
The FMLA provides, in part, that "an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following: . . . (C) In order to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition." 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1). "The term 'serious health condition' means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves—(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider." 29 U.S.C. § 2611(11). Plaintiff's FMLA claims are based on her need to take leave from work to care for her husband with a serious health condition. [Doc. 3, Count 5]. Since around March of 2015, Plaintiff's husband has suffered from a condition that causes him to have [*17]  episodic periods of severe lung functioning impairment. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 1; PSMF ¶ 1]. Plaintiff does not know which days her husband will not be able to leave the house. [Id.]. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff's husband has a serious health condition. [Doc. 3, Count 5; DSMF ¶ 21].
"FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason." 29 C.F.R. § 825.202. The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that the FMLA "creates two types of claims: interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act." Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care System, Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff has asserted both an interference claim and a retaliation claim pursuant to the FMLA. [Doc. 3, Count 5]. The court will first address Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim.
The FMLA makes it "unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt [*18]  to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). "To prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that [she] was denied a benefit to which [she] was entitled under the FMLA." Martin v. Brevard County Public Schools, 543 F.3d 1261, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Thus, "[a]n interference claim has two elements: (1) the employee was entitled to a benefit under the FMLA, and (2) her employer denied her that benefit." White v. Beltram Edge Tool Supply, Inc., 789 F.3d 1188, 1191 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 2010)). "An employer may be liable for interference despite good intentions; its 'motives are irrelevant.'" Id. at 1191 n.2 (quoting Krutzig, 602 F.3d at 1235).
Plaintiff asserts that her FMLA interference claim is based on Defendant's actions from late 2015 through early 2016 when she sought FMLA leave to take care of her husband. In August 2015, Plaintiff notified Marj Nourie, Human Resources Manager, that she would need to take time off work for the care of her spouse with a serious health condition. Ms. Nourie gave Plaintiff the documents necessary for requesting and receiving FMLA leave. [DSMF ¶ 21]. Ms. Nourie approved Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave based on the Certification of Health Care Provider that detailed the treating physician's certifications of the specific leave that Plaintiff would need, as well as the request for Family and Medical Leave that [*19]  Plaintiff filled out and returned to Ms. Nourie. [DSMF ¶ 23]. The treating physician certified that Plaintiff needed intermittent FMLA leave to care for her spouse for the period of August 26, 2015, through September 1, 2016. [DSMF ¶ 25]. Although Plaintiff states that she was treated "fairly and appropriately" regarding FMLA leave from August through mid-December 2015, Plaintiff asserts "that when the new Corp. Sales Manager Evelyn Davis and new Assistant Sales Manager Linda Matthews ascended to their respective positions on December 28, 2015, a three (3) week denial of FMLA leave status was instituted against Plaintiff which culminated in her resignation from her employ with the Defendant on January 21, 2016." [Doc. 38-1 at 18].
Defendant Global argues that summary judgment should be granted on Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim. [Doc. 21-23 at 18-19]. Global contends that it approved Plaintiff's request for intermittent FMLA leave to take care of her husband. [Id.]. Global also asserts that the company did not interfere with Plaintiff from taking any of the leave that she requested or took. [Id.]. The court finds that Plaintiff's FMLA interference claim cannot survive summary judgment [*20]  because she is unable to show that Defendant Global denied her a benefit under the FMLA.
As previously noted, Plaintiff alleges in her brief filed in response to Defendant's summary judgment motion that she was denied FMLA leave for three weeks beginning December 28, 2015. [Doc. 38-1 at 18]. But Plaintiff fails to point to any evidence supporting this assertion. Plaintiff merely offers the conclusory allegation in her brief. However, as Defendant correctly notes, the Local Rules for the Northern District of Georgia provide that "[t]he court will not consider any fact . . . set out only in the brief and not in the [respondent's] statement of undisputed facts." L.R. 56.1B.(1)d., (2)b., N.D. Ga. In addition, the evidence before the court, including the time and attendance records submitted by Plaintiff, contradicts her current allegation that she was denied FMLA leave. The record reveals that Plaintiff took FMLA leave for three and a half days in September 2015, three days in October 2015, three days in November 2015, four days and five hours in December 2015, and three days in January 2016. [Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; Pla. Dep. at 149-55; Doc. 39-1 at 6-16]. The days in January 2016 that Plaintiff [*21]  was absent from work on FMLA leave were January 18, 19, and 20, 2016. [Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; Pla. Dep. at 157; Pla. Aff. ¶ 18; Doc. 39-1 at 16]. Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant Global ever denied her request for FMLA leave.2
In summary, a plaintiff bringing an FMLA interference claim "must demonstrate that [she] was denied a benefit to which [she] was entitled" under the Act. Martin, 543 F.3d at 1266-67. Plaintiff was granted numerous days off work for FMLA leave, and she has failed to offer evidence which would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Plaintiff was denied leave or any other benefit under the FMLA. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED that Defendant Global's motion [Doc. 31] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff Sutherland's FMLA interference claim [Doc. 3, Count 5].
Plaintiff next alleges that Defendant subjected her to retaliation for exercising her rights under the FMLA. The FMLA makes it "unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). To succeed on an FMLA retaliation claim, Plaintiff "must demonstrate that [Defendant] 'intentionally discriminated against [her] [*22]  in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right.'" Jones v. Gulf Coast Health Care of Delaware, LLC, 854 F.3d 1261, 1270 (11th Cir. 2017) (quoting Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd. of City of Birmingham, 239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2001)). "[U]nless there is direct evidence of the employer's retaliatory intent, this Court employs the burden-shifting framework established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973)." Schaaf v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 602 F.3d 1236, 1243 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Martin, 543 F.3d at 1268); accord Bartels v. Southern Motors of Savannah, Inc., 681 Fed. Appx. 834, 837-38 (11th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 358, 199 L. Ed. 2d 263 (2017).
"Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by demonstrating (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity." Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1243; accord Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000). Once a prima facie case is established, "the burden then shifts [to the employer] to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason" for its actions. Schaaf, 602 F.3d at 1243 (citing McDonnell Douglas, 93 S. Ct. at 1824-25). If the defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff must then present evidence demonstrating that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons "were, in reality, merely a pretext for retaliation." Id. at 1244. Because Plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, rather than direct evidence, to establish a prima facie case, application of the McDonnell Douglas framework is appropriate.
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in protected [*23]  expression as it is defined under the FMLA, which is met by seeking FMLA leave. See Pereda v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, 666 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2012); Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1207. Defendant Global does not dispute that Plaintiff is able to establish this element. Defendant, however, argues that Plaintiff is unable to establish the second prima facie element of her FMLA retaliation claim because she did not suffer an adverse employment action. Plaintiff responds by arguing that Defendant took adverse actions against her when the company allegedly took five accounts away from her and constructively discharged her. The court finds Plaintiff's arguments unpersuasive and concludes that Plaintiff has failed to show that she was subjected to an adverse employment action.
The evidence reveals that the treating physician for Plaintiff's husband certified that Plaintiff needed to be absent from work once or twice a month and approximately one week every two to three months. [DSMF ¶ 25]. However, after Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave was approved by Ms. Nourie in August 2015, Plaintiff took at least three days of FMLA leave every month from September 2015 through January 2016. [DSMF ¶ 23; Nourie Dec. ¶ 18, Ex. 11; Pla. Dep. at 149-55; Doc. 39-1 at 6-16]. On days when Plaintiff was [*24]  out on FMLA leave, other Account Managers covered Plaintiff's assigned customer accounts by responding to customer calls, taking orders, and generating quotes. [DSMF ¶ 29; Davis Dec. ¶¶ 12, 13, 22]. If customers made purchases while Plaintiff was out on FMLA leave, the commissions still went to Plaintiff and not to the Account Managers who actually entered the order. [Davis Dec. ¶¶ 12, 22]. Account Managers helping to field calls at Plaintiff's desk when she was absent were having a hard time keeping up, especially since they did not receive a commission for the work that they did for her accounts. [Pla. Dep. at 160; Davis Dec. ¶ 22; DSMF ¶ 39]. Plaintiff was concerned that "her accounts were neglected" while she was on FMLA leave, and both she and her supervisors acknowledged that the arrangement was not working effectively or fairly. [Pla. Dep. at 151, 160, 168-70; Davis Dec. ¶ 13; DSMF ¶¶ 40, 41]. Plaintiff testified that during her meeting with Ms. Davis and Ms. Matthews on January 21, 2016, Ms. Davis informed her to choose five accounts to be reassigned to other Account Managers. [Pla. Dep. at 174; DSMF ¶ 42].
While Plaintiff argues that Ms. Davis' instruction constitutes an adverse [*25]  employment action, the Eleventh Circuit addressed similar facts offered in support of an FMLA retaliation claim and found that no adverse action had taken place. In Hyde v. K.B. Home, Inc., 355 Fed. Appx. 266 (11th Cir. 2009), the plaintiff was pregnant and informed the defendant-employer of her intention to take maternity leave under the FMLA. Id. at 269-70; see also Hyde v. K.B. Home, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26081, 2009 WL 812355, at **1-2 (N.D. Ga. March 25, 2009), aff'd, 355 Fed. Appx. 266 (11th Cir. 2009). The employer responded by withdrawing substantially all of the plaintiff's job responsibilities a month and a half before she began taking FMLA leave. Hyde, 355 Fed. Appx. at 269-70. The plaintiff acknowledged "that she was given as much time off as needed under the FMLA." Id. at 270. Approximately a month after the plaintiff returned to work from FMLA leave, she was terminated as part of a reduction in force. Hyde, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26081, 2009 WL 812355, at *1. The Eleventh Circuit explained that under FMLA regulations, an employer may make temporary reassignments and alter duties or responsibilities to accommodate leave. Hyde, 355 Fed. Appx. at 269 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.204). The court noted that while the plaintiff's responsibilities were reduced and reassigned, her job title did not change, she was not transferred or demoted, and she did not receive a reduction in pay for taking FMLA leave. Id. at 270. In evaluating the plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim, the Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiff's claim could not [*26]  survive summary judgment because the plaintiff had failed to establish an adverse employment action prior to her termination. Id. at 273. The court wrote: "As to [plaintiff's] pre-termination FMLA retaliation claim, although there is direct evidence that [plaintiff's supervisor] withdrew [her] work and reassigned her duties because [she] chose to take FMLA leave, the reduction and reassignment of duties did not constitute adverse employment actions, but were a means of accommodating [plaintiff's] FMLA leave." Id.
Like the plaintiff in Hyde, Plaintiff Sutherland cannot show that she was subjected to an adverse employment action when Ms. Davis allegedly informed Plaintiff to choose five accounts to be reassigned. Defendant Global told Plaintiff to pick the accounts to be reassigned as an accommodation to her FMLA leave. Plaintiff's accounts were being neglected while she was on FMLA leave, and the Account Managers helping to field calls at Plaintiff's desk when she was absent were having a hard time keeping up with the work. Furthermore, the Account Managers who were performing work on Plaintiff's accounts while she was out were not receiving a commission for this work. Both Plaintiff and her supervisors [*27]  acknowledged that the arrangement was not working effectively or fairly.3
Defendant Global was permitted under the FMLA to make temporary reassignments and alter duties or responsibilities to accommodate leave. Hyde, 355 Fed. Appx. at 269 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 825.204). As was the case in Hyde, Plaintiff Sutherland's job title did not change, she was not transferred or demoted, she was not denied leave under the FMLA, and she did not receive a reduction in pay for taking FMLA leave. Plaintiff does not even allege that Global took away certain customer accounts from her, even though this would have been permissible under the FMLA. Id. Instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that her managers asked her to choose five accounts that would be reassigned to other Account Managers, and the evidence reveals that Plaintiff could have chosen the least desirable and least profitable accounts for reassignment. This action was taken by Defendant as a means of accommodating Plaintiff's FMLA leave, and a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that it rose to the level of an adverse employment action.
Plaintiff also argues that her resignation from her employment with Global constituted a retaliatory constructive discharge. [Doc. 38-1 at 20-21]. The court [*28]  disagrees. "To establish a constructive discharge, a plaintiff must show that working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have been compelled to resign." Menzie v. Ann Taylor Retail Inc., 549 Fed. Appx. 891, 894-95 (11th Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Circuit has explained that "[t]his objective standard sets a high threshold; it requires a plaintiff to show harassment that is more severe or pervasive than the minimum level required to establish a hostile working environment." Id. (citation omitted). Plaintiff cannot come close to meeting this standard.
Plaintiff's work schedule was from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. [DSMF ¶ 4]. However, Plaintiff was often tardy throughout her employment with Global, including her final month of January 2016. Plaintiff arrived at work after her scheduled time of 8:00 a.m. on four out of five days during the week of January 4-8, 2016, and she arrived after 8:00 a.m. on all four days she worked during the week of January 11-15, 2016. [Pla. Aff. ¶ 18; Matthews Aff. ¶ 5]. On January 21, 2016, after Plaintiff arrived for work ten minutes late, Ms. Davis and Ms. Matthews met with Plaintiff and told her that she needed to get to work on time and improve her [*29]  attendance for the days that she did not take FMLA leave. [Pla. Dep. at 160; Davis Dep. at 72; Davis Dec. ¶¶ 17, 19; Matthews Aff. ¶¶ 10-12; DSMF ¶¶ 36, 37]. During this meeting, as discussed supra, Ms. Davis informed Plaintiff to choose five accounts to be reassigned to other Account Managers. [Pla. Dep. at 174; DSMF ¶ 42]. According to Plaintiff, at the end of the meeting, Ms. Davis asked her if she had anything to say, and she said "no." [Pla. Dep. at 161]. A reasonable jury could not view these facts, or any other facts alleged by Plaintiff, and conclude that her working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her situation would have been compelled to resign. Menzie, 549 Fed. Appx. at 894-95.
In addition, there is no evidence that Plaintiff allowed Defendant Global adequate time to correct any allegedly hostile working conditions. This is relevant because, as the Eleventh Circuit has explained, "A constructive discharge will generally not be found if the employer is not given sufficient time to remedy the situation." Kilgore v. Thompson & Brock Management, Inc., 93 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir. 1996). Immediately after the January 21, 2016, meeting ended, Plaintiff left Ms. Davis' office and walked into the office of Ms. Nourie and resigned. [Pla. Dep. at 161; DSMF ¶ 46]. [*30]  Ms. Nourie asked Plaintiff if she had spoken with Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis about her decision to resign, and Plaintiff said "no." Plaintiff also said that she did not respect Ms. Matthews and Ms. Davis enough to talk with them. [DSMF ¶ 49]. Five days later, on January 26, 2016, Ms. Nourie received an e-mail from Plaintiff that was identified as her resignation letter. [DSMF ¶ 50; Pla. Dep. at 167, Ex. 32]. Given these facts, the court finds that even if Plaintiff had been subjected to intolerable working conditions, her constructive discharge claim would fail because she is unable to show that she allowed Global adequate time to correct the hostile conditions.
In summary, although Plaintiff has asserted a retaliation claim based on the FMLA, she has failed to offer evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to find that she was subjected to an adverse employment action. Plaintiff has also failed to show that her resignation constituted a retaliatory constructive discharge or that she gave Global adequate time to correct any allegedly hostile working conditions. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 31] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation [*31]  claim [Doc. 3, Count 5].

B. ADAAA Claim
Plaintiff Sutherland next claims that Defendant Global violated the ADAAA by discriminating against her because of her association with her disabled husband. [Doc. 3, Count 6]. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation to enable her to care for her husband. [Doc. 38-1 at 22-23]. The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Under the ADA, the term "discriminate" is defined to include, among other factors, "excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(4). "A plaintiff attempting to establish a prima facie case of 'association discrimination' under the ADA must establish: (1) that she was subjected to an adverse employment action; (2) [*32]  that she was qualified for the job at that time; (3) that her employer knew at that time that she had a relative with a disability; and (4) that 'the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that the disability of the relative was a determining factor in [the employer's] decision.'" Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Hilburn v. Murata Electronics North America, Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1230-31 (11th Cir. 1999)).
In her response brief, Plaintiff does not argue that Defendant took an adverse employment action against her because of the disability of her husband. [Doc. 38-1 at 22-23]. Instead, as discussed infra, Plaintiff's only argument regarding her ADAAA claim is that Defendant violated the statute by failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodation to care for her disabled husband. [Id.]. But even assuming that Plaintiff were asserting a claim that she was subjected to an adverse action based on her husband's disability, this claim would fail because Plaintiff has not offered evidence that she was subjected to an adverse employment action. As previously discussed, the evidence before the court reveals that Defendant, in an effort to accommodate Plaintiff's FMLA leave, asked her to choose five accounts that would be reassigned to other Account [*33]  Managers, and Plaintiff could have chosen the least desirable and least profitable accounts for reassignment. Furthermore, even if Plaintiff were able to show that she was subjected to an adverse employment action, she has failed to point to any evidence which would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that any possible adverse action "'occurred under circumstances which raised a reasonable inference that the disability of the relative was a determining factor in [the employer's] decision.'" Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242 (quoting Hilburn, 181 F.3d at 1230-31). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiff is alleging that Defendant Global took an adverse employment action against her because of her husband's disability, this claim could not survive summary judgment. The court turns next to Plaintiff's ADAAA reasonable accommodation claim.
The ADA's definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of an individual with a disability. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "To state a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that: (1) [she] is disabled; (2) [she] is a qualified individual; and (3) [she] was discriminated against by way of the defendant's failure to provide a reasonable accommodation." [*34]  McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)). Plaintiff argues that Defendant Global violated the ADAAA by not providing her with a reasonable accommodation to care for her disabled husband. [Doc. 38-1 at 22-23]. Plaintiff alleges that a "reasonable accommodation was being provided [by Global] to the Plaintiff before 12/28/15, but that accommodation was withdrawn by the acts/actions of her managers. The Plaintiff has established that the accommodations were being provided, worked and were suitable for her increased needs in order to care for her husband. The Plaintiff has met her burden in this regard and her claims for violations should be recognized and protected by the Court. . . ." [Id.]. Plaintiff's argument is unpersuasive.
Plaintiff Sutherland does not allege that she is disabled. Instead, she alleges that her husband is disabled. But, as previously noted, to assert a reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. See McKane, 363 Fed. Appx. at 681; Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255. Because Plaintiff has offered no evidence that she is disabled, her ADAAA failure to accommodate claim fails.
With regard to Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant Global was required under the ADAAA to provide her with a reasonable [*35]  accommodation to care for her disabled husband, the Interpretive Guidelines to the ADA specifically contradict Plaintiff's assertion. The Guidelines provide that in cases where an employee has a disabled spouse, the "employer need not provide the . . . employee without a disability with a reasonable accommodation because that duty only applies to qualified . . . employees with disabilities. Thus, for example, an employee would not be entitled to a modified work schedule as an accommodation to enable the employee to care for a spouse with a disability." 29 C.F.R. § Pt. 1630, App.; accord Pollere v. USIG Pennsylvania, Inc., 136 F. Supp. 3d 680, 684 (E.D. Pa. 2015) ("In particular, an employer is not required to provide an employee with a modified work schedule as an accommodation to enable the employee to care for a spouse with a disability.") (emphasis in original). In summary, although Plaintiff attempts to bring an "association discrimination" claim under the ADAAA based on Defendant's alleged failure to provide her with a reasonable accommodation to care for her disabled husband, dismissal is warranted on this claim because the ADAAA does not require employers to provide accommodations for employees to care for disabled relatives. It is, therefore, RECOMMENDED [*36]  that Defendant's summary judgment motion [Doc. 31] be GRANTED on Plaintiff's ADAAA claim [Doc. 3, Count 6].

C. State Law Claims
In addition to Plaintiff's FMLA and ADAAA claims, she brings state law claims for breach of contract, fraud, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. [Doc. 3, Counts 1-4]. Twenty-eight U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) provides, in pertinent part, "The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction . . . ." The Supreme Court has held, "[I]f the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as well." United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). As discussed supra, summary judgment has been recommended on all of Plaintiff's federal claims. "When coupled with the Court's discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under § 1367(c), this Court finds that the state law claims remaining in this action are best resolved by the Georgia courts." Baggett v. First National Bank of Gainesville, 117 F.3d 1342, 1353 (11th Cir. 1997).
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that supplemental jurisdiction not be exercised over Plaintiff's state law claims [Doc. 3, Counts 1-4]. Because the present case was originally filed [*37]  in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, and removed to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the state law claims "be remanded back to the state court from which this case was removed." Hayden v. Coppage, 533 F. Supp. 2d 1186, 1199 (M.D. Ala. 2008) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); Halford v. Deer Valley Home Builders, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30696, 2007 WL 1229339, *5 (M.D. Ala. April 25, 2007)); accord Mines v. Barber, 610 Fed. Appx. 838, 841 (11th Cir. 2015) ("As we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Mr. Mines' federal claims, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. Mines' state law claims. Simply stated, the district court had the authority to decline supplemental jurisdiction over Mr. Mines' state claims.") (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3)), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 821, 193 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2016); Cook ex rel. Estate of Tessier v. Sheriff of Monroe County, Florida, 402 F.3d 1092, 1123 (11th Cir. 2005) ("Because this case was originally filed in state court and removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, if the district court declines to continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, Cook's remaining claim should be remanded to state court.") (citation omitted); Mergens v. Dreyfoos, 166 F.3d 1114, 1119 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[T]his Court has noted that if the federal claims are dismissed prior to trial, Gibbs strongly encourages or even requires dismissal of state claims.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

IV. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant Global's [*38]  motion [Doc. 31] for summary judgment be GRANTED on Plaintiff Rebecca Sutherland's federal claims brought pursuant to the FMLA and the ADAAA [Doc. 3, Counts 5, 6] and that these claims be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. It is further RECOMMENDED that supplemental jurisdiction not be exercised over Plaintiff's state law claims [Doc. 3, Counts 1-4] and that these claims be REMANDED to the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia.
All pretrial matters have been concluded with the issuance of this Report and Recommendation in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), this Court's Local Rule 72.1, and Standing Order 18-01 (N.D. Ga. February 12, 2018). The Clerk, therefore, is DIRECTED to terminate the reference to the Magistrate Judge.
SO RECOMMENDED, this 5th day of June, 2018.
