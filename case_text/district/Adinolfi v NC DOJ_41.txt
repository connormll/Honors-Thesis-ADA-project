Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
This matter is before the court on Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second amended complaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 12(h)(3). [DE-42]. David J. Adinolfi, II ("Plaintiff" or "Adinolfi") filed a response in opposition to the motion [DE-46], and Defendants filed a reply [DE-47]. All' issues raised in the parties' briefing are ripe for decision, and the motion is referred here for a memorandum and recommendation to the district court. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B); Local Civ. R. 72.3(c). For the reasons set forth below, it is recommended that the motion to dismiss be allowed in part and denied in part.

I. BACKGROUND
Adinolfi's second amended complaint alleges claims of employment discrimination [*2]  and a hostile work environment in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and North Carolina law, as well as a failure to provide reasonable accommodation and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39].
The allegations asserted in the second amended complaint are as follows. Adinolfi was born in 1968, and he became employed by Defendant North Carolina Department of Justice ("NCDOJ") in 2000 as an Assistant Attorney General. The NCDOJ is organized into divisions led by Senior Deputy Attorneys General, and each division is subdivided into sections led by section heads. Adinolfi served in the Civil Division in the Revenue Section from 2000 to 2002. In 2002, he moved to the Special Prosecutions Section within the Criminal Division. In September 2012, Adinolfi was promoted to the position of section head of the Special Prosecutions Section. Adinolfi alleges that he never received negative performance reviews and received numerous merit pay increases. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 7-13.
In November 2017, the NCDOJ underwent a reorganization. The Special Prosecutions Section was absorbed into the Capital Litigation and Federal [*3]  Habeas Section, and Adinolfi was no longer a section head. He was asked to be the team leader for special prosecutions personnel within the Capital Litigation Section, but it was not a formal position. The reorganization resulted in a loss of supervisory responsibility, loss of job title, and reduction in pay grade for Adinolfi. Adinolfi alleges that he was promised that if the Special Prosecutions Section were ever reformed, he would be reinstituted as the section head. Also in November 2017, the NCDOJ created a new position called the Criminal Bureau Chief, who, in addition to the Senior Deputy Attorney General, supervised the entire Criminal Division. An attorney under the age of forty was hired to fill that position. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 14-18.
In January 2018, the Criminal Bureau Chief held a meeting at which Adinolfi was present, and she stated that NCDOJ personnel "serve at the pleasure of the Attorney General." Adinolfi alleges that the statement was false because he is a permanent career employee under the North Carolina Personnel Act, and he can only be discharged for just cause and with due process. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 20-21.
In March 2018, the NCDOJ reformed the [*4]  Special Prosecutions Section and made the Criminal Bureau Chief the section head in addition to her role as Criminal Bureau Chief The Criminal Bureau Chief informed Adinolfi that he was being transferred to the Law Enforcement Liaison Section of the Criminal Division. Adinolfi alleges that the matters handled by the Law Enforcement Liaison Section are outside of his area of expertise. He objected to the transfer, and the Criminal Bureau Chief again informed him that he "served at the pleasure of the Attorney General." Adinolfi filed grievances with the NCDOJ human resources office, and he requested written documentation of his transfer and demotion, but no documentation was provided to him. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 22-29.
Several days after Adinolfi was told he would be transferred, he was diagnosed with high blood pressure in the stroke range and severe anxiety. His physician advised him to stop working immediately, so he went on sick leave and has remained out of work since March 2018. On March 29, 2018, Adinolfi requested an accommodation in the form of a transfer to the Services to State Agencies Section of the Civil Division, the ability to work from home two days per week, a reduced [*5]  caseload, only two criminal appeals per year, and the ability to go to medical appointments and the gym during the week as needed. On June 29, 2018, the NCDOJ denied Adinolfi's request and informed him that his options were to return to his current position in the Criminal Division and take leave as needed for doctor's appointments, transfer to the Public Safety Section and take leave as needed for doctor's appointments, or continue his leave of absence and apply for short term disability. Adinolfi exhausted his leave time, and the NCDOJ terminated his employment on March 18, 2019. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 30-35.
On August 7, 2018 Adinolfi filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), in which he checked the box indicating he claimed he had been discriminated against on the basis of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") on March 14 and 15, 2018. [DE-43-3]. The charge form does not indicate a continuing action. Id. It appears, from the charge narrative that the charge stems from Adinolfi learning in March 2018 that he would not be restored to the position of Section Head in the Special Prosecutions Division following his [*6]  November 2017 demotion. Id. Adinolfi also mentions in the narrative that he had "requested a reasonable accommodation for health issues that have emerged from the demotions and transfer (i.e. high blood pressure in the stroke range, adjustment disorder, panic disorder, and extreme anxiety)." Id. at 2. He claims further that the Attorney General's office was attempting to force him to exhaust his sick and vacation time or file for disability then claim he is "unavailable" and terminate him. Id. The EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on August 8, 2018. [DE-43-4].
On November 2, 2018, Adinolfi filed a second EEOC charge in which he checked the boxes claiming disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Ex. 4 [DE-43-5]. Adinolfi indicates in his second charge that the earliest the discriminatory acts occurred was March 29, 2018 and the latest was October 17, 2018. The charge does not indicate a continuing action. Id. In his charge narrative, Adinolfi claims he applied for a reasonable accommodation to be transferred to the Civil Division and the Department of Justice denied his request on June 29, 2018, and had offered him positions [*7]  in the Criminal Division. Id. According to Adonolfi's charge, NCDOJ denied his accommodation request because it believed he did not have a medical disability. Id.
On November 6, 2018, Adinolfi filed a complaint in this court alleging claims of age discrimination, a hostile work environment, failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability, and retaliation. [DE-1]. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss contending, among other things, that Adinolfi failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding his ADA claims because the EEOC had not yet issued a right-to-sue letter. [DE-11] at 20-21. On February 12, 2019, Adinolfi filed a first amended complaint alleging claims of age discrimination and a hostile work environment, but not alleging violations of the ADA. [DE-12].
On April 22, 2019, Adinolfi filed a third EEOC charge, alleging discrimination on the basis of disability and retaliation in violation of the ADA. Ex. 6 [DE-43-7]. The date of alleged discrimination indicated on the charge form is March 18, 2019. Id. No continuing action is indicated. In his charge narrative, Adinolfi indicates he believes he was "retaliated [against] in the form of being denied a reasonable [*8]  accommodation . . ., and then being discharged, based on . . . filing two prior EEOC charges. . ., filing a lawsuit and filing with the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearing." Id. He indicates further that on or about March 18, 2019 he was advised he was being discharged because he had exhausted his leave and filed to return to work. Id On May 8, 2019, the EEOC issued its Notice of Rights by letter to Adinolfi's counsel. [DE-43-8].
On July 8, 2019, Adinolfi filed a second amended complaint, which is the subject of Defendants' motion. [DE-39]. In his second amended complaint, Adinolfi makes five claims: (1) age discrimination in violation of the ADEA, (2) a hostile work environment in violation of the ADEA, (3) age discrimination in violation of North Carolina law and public policy, (4) Defendants' failure to provide a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA, and (5) retaliation in violation of the ADA. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39]. In their motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, Defendants argue that Adinolfi's claims for violations of the ADEA should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, [*9]  his claim for age discrimination in violation of North Carolina public policy should be dismissed on the basis of sovereign immunity and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, his claims for violations of the ADA should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and his claims against Attorney General Stein should be dismissed because Attorney General Stein is immune from suit. [DE-42] at 2.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW

A. Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3)
Defendants contend that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Adinolfi's claims for violations of the ADEA. [DE-42]. A court must dismiss all or part of an action over which it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Whether subject matter jurisdiction exists is a threshold question that must be addressed before considering the merits of the case. Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 192 F.3d 417, 422 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) ("if the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action."). The plaintiff, as the party opposing a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, has the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction does, in fact, exist. Richmond, F. & P. R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982)). "In determining whether jurisdiction [*10]  exists, the district court is to regard the pleadings' allegations as mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment." Id. (citations omitted).

B. Rule 12(b)(6)
Defendants additionally contend that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for violations of the ADEA, North Carolina public policy, and the ADA. [DE-42] at 2. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) tests the complaint's legal and factual sufficiency. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-80, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554-63, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Coleman v. Md. Court of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir. 2010), aff'd, 566 U.S. 30, 132 S. Ct. 1327, 182 L. Ed. 2d 296 (2012); Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir. 2008). To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a pleading "must contain sufficient factual matter; accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quotation omitted); see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; Giarratano, 521 F.3d at 302. In considering the motion, the court must construe the facts and reasonable inferences "in the light most favorable to the [nonmoving party]." Massey v. Ojaniit, 759 F.3d 343, 352 (4th Cir. 2014); see Clatterbuck v. City of Charlottesville, 708 F.3d 549, 557 (4th Cir. 2013), abrogated on other grounds by Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 192 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2015). A court need not accept as true a complaint's legal conclusions, "unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments." Giarratano, 521 F.3d at 302; see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. Rather, a plaintiff's allegations must "nudge[ ] [his] claims," Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, beyond the realm of "mere possibility" into "plausibility." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. "When evaluating a motion to dismiss, a court considers the pleadings and any materials [*11]  'attached or incorporated into the complaint' and "may take judicial notice of public records without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment." Vlasaty v. Wake Cty. Pub. Sch. Sys. Bd. of Educ., No. 5:17-CV-578-D, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160808, 2018 WL 4515877, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 20, 2018) (citations omitted).

III. ANALYSIS

A. The ADEA Claims

1. The Statute of Limitations
Defendants contend that Adinolfi's ADEA claims are time barred because all of the alleged discriminatory acts occurred more than 180 days before he filed an EEOC charge. Defs.'. Mem. [DE-43] at 9-10. Before filing an ADEA claim in federal court, a plaintiff must first exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Jones v. Calvert Group, Ltd., 551 F.3d 297, 300 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1); 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)). The EEOC charge must be filed within 180 days "of each discrete adverse employment action described in the complaint." Hogan v. Fayetteville State Univ., No. 2:17-CV-45-FL, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135898, 2018 WL 3847094, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 13, 2018) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)); see Williams v. N.C. Admin. Office of Courts, 364 F. Supp. 3d 596, 2018 WL 6345367, at *4 (E.D.N.C. 2018) (dismissing claim as time barred under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c) because the plaintiff failed to file the EEOC charge within 180 days of the alleged violation).
Here, the EEOC charge alleging age discrimination was filed on August 7, 2018. [DE-43-3]. Accordingly, any discrete act of discrimination occurring prior to [*12]  February 8, 2018 would be time barred. See 29 U.S.C. § 626(d)(1)(A).
Contrary to Defendants' argument that "all of the alleged discriminatory conduct" is time barred, Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 10, Plaintiff alleges that the November 2017 demotion and the January 2018 statement that Adinolfi "serve[s] at the pleasure of the Attorney General" were the only events that occurred prior to February 8, 2018. The reconstitution of the Special Prosecutions Section, the failure to reinstate Adinolfi as the section head, the second statement that Adinolfi "serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General," and Adinolfi's transfer to the Law Enforcement Liaison Section occurred in March 2018, within 180 days of the filing of the August 7, 2018 charge. Accordingly, the potentially time barred discrete acts of alleged discrimination are the November 2017 demotion and the January 2018 statement, events that occurred more than 180 days prior to the filing of the EEOC charge. Nonetheless, Adinolfi contends that those events are not time barred because equitable tolling, equitable estoppel, and the continuing violation doctrine apply. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 13-15.

a. Equitable Tolling and Equitable Estoppel
Equitable tolling occurs when "the employer 'wrongfully deceived or misled the [*13]  plaintiff in order to conceal, the existence of the cause of action.'" Benedetti v. Computer Scis. Corp., 187 F.3d 628 [published in full-text format at 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18286], 1999 WL 536271, at *2 (4th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (quoting Olson v. Mobil Oil Corp., 904 F.2d 198, 201 (4th Cir. 1990)). It "is a narrow limitations exception that is to be used sparingly." Belton v. City of Charlotte, 175 F. App'x 641, 653 (4th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). "The doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply merely because [the plaintiff] later learned of additional information that appeared to make the alleged discrimination more obvious." Olson, 904 F.2d at 199 (holding that even though the employer concealed the fact that a younger individual was hired to fill the plaintiff's former position, equitable tolling did not apply because the plaintiff was aware of all the pertinent facts and could have filed an EEOC charge based on the information he did know). Additionally, equitable estoppel occurs "when the employer takes active steps to prevent the plaintiff from filing his case, for example by promising not to plead the statute of limitations." Belton, 175 F. App'x at 654.
Adinolfi contends that the promise to reinstate him as section head of the Special Prosecutions Section was an action on the part of the NCDOJ sufficient to constitute equitable tolling and equitable estoppel. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 13-14. Some courts have indicated that a promise of reinstatement may be sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. See Svensson v. Putnam Investments LLC, 558 F. Supp. 2d 136, 142 (D. Mass. 2008) ("When, [*14]  for example, the notice [of adverse employment action] . . . contains a promise to be reinstated to a specific position in the future, courts have deemed the notice equivocal."). However, this court has previously held that a "plaintiff's assertion that [the] defendant led plaintiff 'on to a promise of a job,' . . . is not sufficient to support a claim of equitable tolling." Ferrell v. FMR, LLC, No. 5:18-CV-217-FL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62996, 2019 WL 1578766, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 12, 2019); see also Price v. Litton Bus. Sys., Inc., 694 F.2d 963, 965 (4th Cir. 1982) ("the attempt to mitigate the harshness of a decision terminating an employee, without more, cannot give rise to an equitable estoppel.").
Here, the promise of reinstatement if the Special Prosecutions Section were ever reformed was not sufficient to constitute equitable tolling. The promise did not conceal the cause of action; Adinolfi knew in November 2017 that he was demoted. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 15. Adinolfi contends that the promise of reinstatement was more than a vague hope of promotion and that he did not discover its falsehood until much later, when the Special Prosecutions Section was actually reformed and he was not reinstated. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 13. However, the promise of reinstatement was conditional; Adinolfi was promised reinstatement if the Section were ever reformed. [*15]  The equivocal promise that he would be reinstated if the Special Prosecutions Section were ever reformed was more akin to an "attempt to mitigate the harshness of a decision," not an action by the NCDOJ designed to conceal the cause of action or mislead Adinolfi. See Price, 694 F.2d 963, 965; Benedetti, 187 F.3d at 628 (requiring "deception or misleading" by the employer). The second amended complaint does not allege deception or misleading by the NCDOJ. See 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 14-24 (alleging that the statement that Adinolfi serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General was false, but not alleging that the NCDOJ mislead or deceived Adinolfi to believe that his demotion was temporary).
Adinolfi was aware of all the pertinent facts in November 2017, yet he did not file a timely EEOC charge. A conditional promise made and later broken does not mean that the NCDOJ deceived or misled Adinolfi into believing that he was not demoted. Adinolfi knew in November 2017 that he was demoted; the cause of action was not concealed. Accordingly, equitable tolling and equitable estoppel do not apply here, despite the NCDOJ's attempt to mitigate the harshness of the demotion by informing Adinolfi that he would be reinstated as section head if [*16]  the Section was ever reformed. See Olson, 904 F.2d at 199.

b. The Continuing Violation Doctrine and the November 2017 Demotion
Adinolfi also contends that the November 2017 demotion is not time barred because it was part of a continuing violation. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 14-15. The Supreme Court has made clear that "discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). However, if the violation is not a discrete act but instead "involves repeated conduct," then it may not be time barred even if part of the continuing violation occurred beyond the limitations period. Id. at 114. "In other words, if the plaintiff can show that the illegal act did not occur just once, but rather 'in a series of separate acts[,] and if the same alleged violation was committed at the time of each act, then the limitations period begins anew with each violation.'" Brown v. Gibson, No. 4:17-CV-180-FL, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147032, 2018 WL 4113339, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 29, 2018) (quoting Nat'l Adver. Co. v. City of Raleigh, 947 F.2d 1158, 1166 (4th Cir. 1991)); see also Brown & Pipkins, LLC v. SEIU, Local 32BJ, 846 F.3d 716, 726 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that the premise behind the continuing violation doctrine is that "a violation which is continuous in nature gives rise to a new grievance each day"). "In order to rely on the 'continuing violations' doctrine, plaintiffs must '(1) identify a series of acts or omission [*17]  that demonstrate [the . . . violation]; and (2) place one or more of these acts or omissions within the applicable statute of limitations.' Patten v. Hall, No. 5:15-CT-3118-FL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 167764, 2019 WL 4858845, at *7 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 30, 2019) (quoting DePaola v. Clarke, 884 F.3d 481, 487 (4th Cir. 2018)).
Here, Adinolfi has not identified a series of acts involving repeated conduct regarding the November 2017 demotion. The second amended complaint alleges that the November 2017 elimination of the Special Prosecutions Section, Adinolfi's accompanying demotion, the March 2018 reconstitution of the Section, and the failure to reinstate Adinolfi were pieces of a larger scheme to reorganize the NCDOJ and replace older employees with younger individuals. However, the November 2017 demotion and the March 2018 failure to reinstate Adinolfi were not "repeated conduct," Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 114, in which "the same alleged violation was committed at the time of each act," Brown v. Gibson, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147032, 2018 WL 4113339, at *4. The demotion and the failure to reinstate may be factually connected in that they were both part of a larger reorganization scheme, but they are discrete alleged discriminatory acts, and they are not a continuing violation. See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 113. Accordingly, the November 2017 demotion is time barred.

c. The Continuing Violation Doctrine and the January 2018 Statement
Adinolfi alleges [*18]  that in January 2018, the Criminal Bureau Chief informed Adinolfi that he "serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General." That statement falls outside of the statute of limitations. However, it is not time barred because it is one of the bases for Adinolfi's hostile work environment claim. "A hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one 'unlawful employment practice.' . . . Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability." Morgan, 536 U.S. at 117 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)). Here, Adinolfi alleges that a similar statement was made in March 2018, which is an act contributing to the claim that occurred within the filing period. Accordingly, the January 2018 statement is not time barred as it relates to the hostile work environment claim. See id.
In summary, the November 2017 demotion and January 2018 statement occurred more than 180 days prior to the filing of the EEOC charge, so they fall outside of the limitations period. Equitable tolling and equitable estoppel do not apply here because Adinolfi does not allege [*19]  being deceived or misled into believing he was not being demoted; he knew he was demoted in November 2017, and the cause of action was not concealed. Additionally, the November 2017 demotion was not part of an alleged continuing violation because it was a discrete discriminatory act. The November 2017 demotion is time-barred, but the January 2018 statement is part of an alleged continuing violation because it is one of the bases for the hostile work environment claim, and it is therefore not time-barred in regards to that claim.

2. Failure to State a Claim for Age Discrimination
Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to state a claim under the ADEA for age discrimination. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 10-13. The ADEA prohibits an employer from "fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire or discharge[ing] any individual or otherwise discriminat[ing] againk any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). To state a claim for age discrimination under the ADEA, plaintiff must allege sufficient facts showing: (1) membership in a protected class; (2) satisfactory job performance; (3) adverse employment action; and (4) that similarly situated employees [*20]  outside the protected class received more favorable treatment. White v. BFI Waste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir. 2004); Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Transp., No. 5:15-CV-606-FL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147230, 2017 WL 4012676, at *5 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 12, 2017) (applying White to Title VII and ADEA). "An adverse employment action is a discriminatory act which adversely affects the terms, conditions, or benefits of the plaintiff's employment." Harris, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147230, 2017 WL 4012676, at *5 (quoting James v. Booz—Allen Hamilton, Inc., 368 F.3d 371, 375 (4th Cir. 2004)). "While [c]onduct short of ultimate employment decisions can constitute adverse employment action, the typical requirements for a showing of an adverse employment action are discharge, demotion, decrease in pay or benefits, loss of job title or supervisory responsibility, or reduced opportunities for promotion[.]" Id. (citations omitted).
Adinolfi has alleged sufficient facts that, if taken as true, state a plausible claim for age discrimination in violation of ADEA. First, Adinolfi alleges membership in a protected class in that he was born in 1968, making him forty-nine and fifty years old when the relevant events took place. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 7. Second, Adinolfi alleges satisfactory job performance in that he was promoted several times and received numerous commendations, no negative performance reviews, and numerous merit pay increases. Id. ¶¶ 11-13. Third, [*21]  Adinolfi alleges adverse employment action in that. the NCDOJ failed to reinstate1 him as the head of the Special Prosecutions Section. Id. ¶¶ 14-16; see Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 536 U.S. at 114 (holding that a "failure to promote [or] denial of transfer" is an "easy to identify" adverse employment action). Fourth, Adinolfi alleges that similarly situated younger employees received more favorable treatment because a younger individual was hired to fill the newly created position of Criminal Bureau Chief and took on the supervisory duties previously performed by Plaintiff, as the Criminal Bureau Chief supervised the entire criminal division and later expressly supervised the Special Prosecutions Section in Adinolfi's stead when it was reconstituted. Id. ¶¶ 18, 22-23. Accordingly, Adinolfi has plausibly stated a claim for age discrimination, and it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss on that basis be denied.

3. Failure to State a Claim for a Hostile Work Environment
Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to state a claim that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his age. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 14. In order to state a claim for a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must allege "that the offending conduct [*22]  (1) was unwelcome, (2) was because of [his] [age], (3) was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive work environment, and (4) was imputable to [his] employer." Berry v. S. States Coop., Inc., No. 5:17-CV-635-FL, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155902, 2018 WL 4365499, at *2 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 13, 2018) (quoting Bonds v. Leavitt, 629 F.3d 369, 385 (4th Cir. 2011)). A plaintiff must also show that his protected characteristic under the ADEA was the "but for" cause of the alleged harassment. Coleman v. Altec, Inc., No. 5:16-CV-954-D, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153257, 2018 WL 4289610, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 7, 2018) (citing Gilliam v. S.C. Dep't of Juvenile Justice, 474 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2007)).
Adinolfi contends that the entirety of the facts alleged in the complaint state a claim for a hostile work environment, including the two statements made by the Criminal Bureau Chief that Adinolfi serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General, his two demotions,2 the failure to reinstate him as section head, and the agency-wide effort to replace older employees with younger ones. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 21-23. Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to plead facts showing that the unwelcome conduct was severe, pervasive, or because of his age. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 14-17.
"To determine whether conduct is severe or pervasive, the court considers a variety of factors, including the 'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, [*23]  or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance."' Berry, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155902, 2018 WL 4365499, at *2 (quoting Okoli v. City of Balt., 648 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir. 2011)). The number of occurrences is not dispositive, for "[s]ufficiently severe conduct can constitute harassment, even if the conduct occurs in only one instance." Id. (citing Boyer-Liberto v. Fontainebleau Corp., 786 F.3d 264, 280-81 (4th Cir. 2015)). "However, '[a]ctivities like simple teasing, offhand comments, and off-color jokes, while often regrettable, do not cross the line into actionable misconduct."' Id. (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Fairbrook Med Clinic, PA., 609 F.3d 320, 328 (4th Cir. 2010)). In considering severity and pervasiveness, "the court examines the allegations both subjectively and objectively." Coleman, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153257, 2018 WL 4289610, at *3 (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). "First, the employee must subjectively consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter his conditions of employment." Id. (citing Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270-71, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001). "Second, a court views the conduct from the perspective of a reasonable person in the employee's position to determine whether it is objectively severe or pervasive." Id. (citing Breeden, 532 U.S. at 271). To be actionable, "discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult," based on the protected characteristic, must permeate the work environment in a manner "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions" of the plaintiff's employment and to "create an abusive [*24]  working environment." Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (quotations omitted).
Here, Adinolfi has not alleged facts showing that unwelcome conduct was "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive work environment." See Berry, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155902, 2018 WL 4365499, at *2. The Criminal Bureau Chiefs alleged statement that Adinolfi serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General was made twice, once in January 2018 and once in March 2018. Although the frequency of the unwelcome conduct is not dispositive, two statements made three months apart can hardly be described as pervasive. See Walton v. NC Dep't of Health & Human Servs., No. 5:17-CV-85-BR, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149109, 2017 WL 4080459, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 14, 2017) (denying a motion to dismiss a hostile work environment claim when the offensive statements were made "on a daily basis over an eight-month period"), aff'd, 765 Fed. Appx. 1 (4th Cir. 2019). Moreover, even considering the entire context of the alleged reorganization and demotions, the statements were not sufficiently severe; even if Adinolfi subjectively considered the statements to be physically threatening or humiliating, a reasonable person would not consider them to be so insulting and humiliating that they alter the conditions of employment. See Spriggs v. Diamond Auto Glass, 242 F.3d 179, 185 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding that the use of the word "monkey" as a racial slur [*25]  was severe because it was "degrading and humiliating in the extreme"); Innocenti v. WakeMed, No. 5:18-CV-907FL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131362, 2019 WL 3683606, at *6 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 6, 2019) (holding that selective enforcement of rules was not severe); Gates v. Waffle House Corp., No. 4:18-CV-140-BO, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24036, 2019 WL 613555, at *5 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 9, 2019) (holding that unequal treatment plus a threat of bodily injury was severe), adopted by 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23042, 2019 WL 615364 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 13, 2019); Buckner v. Lew, No. 5:13-CV-199-FL, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36798, 2014 WL 1118428, at *7 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 20, 2014) (holding that "abrupt shifts in workload, reassignments, negative reviews, a supervisor's rejection of plaintiff's work product, mandatory meetings with a director, and a supervisor's occasional angry and agitated demeanor, are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an abusive working environment) (quotations omitted). Adinolfi has not alleged facts showing that the statements were pervasive or severe, even when taken in context of the reorganization of the NCDOJ.
Additionally, the facts alleged in the second amended complaint do not plausibly allege that the Criminal Bureau Chief's conduct was because of Adinolfi's age. In the second amended complaint, Adinolfi states, "Upon information and belief, this unwelcome and disparate treatment was based on Plaintiff's age." 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 48. That statement is conclusory. The Criminal Bureau [*26]  Chief's comments that Adinolfi serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General do not reference Adinolfi's age either expressly or implicitly, and the first statement was directed to a group of employees, not Adinolfi exclusively. See Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Transp., No. 5:15-CV-606-FL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147230, 2017 WL 4012676, at *8 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 12, 2017) (holding that statements were made because of the plaintiff's age when the plaintiff alleged that "he has been asked when he will retire, that he has been called 'old man' by both supervisors and coworkers, and that one person approached him with a measuring tape stating he was 'measuring' plaintiff for his 'coffin/grave.'"). As alleged, it is not plausible to conclude that Adinolfi's age was the but-for cause of a statement that Adinolfi serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General.
Adinolfi alleges that the entire reorganization of the NCDOJ, including his two demotions, was motivated by a desire to replace older employees with younger ones, and the discriminatory reorganization amounted to a hostile work environment. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 21-22. However, a plaintiff cannot bootstrap a discrimination claim into a hostile work environment claim. 0 'Neal v. Harrison, No. 5:14-CV-198-FL, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30584, 2015 WL 1084321, at *7 n.5 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 11, 2015) (citations omitted). "Courts have been reluctant [*27]  to allow discrete acts of discrimination to 'be transformed, without more, into a hostile work environment claim.'" Id. (quoting Kilby—Robb v. Spellings, 522 F. Supp. 2d 148, 164 (D.D.C. 2007), aff'd, 309 Fed. Appx. 422 (D.C. Cir. 2009)). According to Adinolfi, the reorganization of the NCDOJ is an alleged act of discrimination, and it is therefore not sufficient to also state a claim for a hostile work environment. See id. It is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss the claim be allowed.

B. ADA Claims
Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to state a claim for a failure to accommodate because he has not adequately pled that he qualifies as an individual with a disability or that the NCDOJ refused to make any reasonable accommodation. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 20-25. Additionally, Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to state a claim for retaliation in violation of the ADA. Id. at 25-28.

1. Failure to Accommodate
Adinolfi alleges that after the events of March 14, 2018, he become physically ill and consulted a physician. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 30. On March 22, 2018 he was diagnosed with high blood pressure in the stroke range and severe anxiety and was advised by his physician to stop working immediately or he could suffer a stroke. Id. Adinolfi's diagnoses were communicated to Defendants. Id.
In further [*28]  support of his ADA claim, Adinolfi has alleged the following:
31. As a result of the actions of Defendants described herein, Plaintiff has been diagnosed with high blood pressure in the stroke range, and has also been diagnosed with severe anxiety, panic, and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. Plaintiff never suffered from these conditions or high blood pressure in the stroke range prior to March 2018. Plaintiff's physical and mental conditions interfere with major life activities, in multiple ways.
32. As a result of the actions of Defendants described herein, Plaintiff is "disabled" within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and has been since at least 22 March 2018. Plaintiff has been found to have a qualifying disability by the Medical Board of the Disability Income Plan of North Carolina. Plaintiff; a licensed attorney, has also had his CLE requirements for 2018 waived based on his medical and psychological conditions.
33. Because of his health conditions and disabilities, Plaintiff on 29 March 2018 sought a reasonable accommodation from Defendants, in the form of a transfer to the Services to State Agencies section of the civil division of NCDOJ. In this position, [*29]  Plaintiff could handle representation of AOC officials (i.e. judges, district attorneys, magistrates, and their staff members) which he had done for 16 years in the Special Prosecutions Section with considerable success and with the approval of AOC officials (i.e., in 16 years there were no financial losses to AOC in any case handled by Plaintiff in the form of settlements, damages awards, costs, or attorney's fees). Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation in the form of a transfer to the civil division was substantiated with evidence from his treating physician and mental health professional, as well as by an examination of Plaintiff conducted by a health professional employed by Defendants.
34. On or about 29 June 2018, Defendants denied Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation, and informed Plaintiff that his only options were to (a) return to work in the criminal division, or (b) apply for disability. Defendants took this position despite the fact that all the medical and mental health professionals who had examined Plaintiff had stated, in writing, that Plaintiff could not safely work in the criminal division, but could work safely in the civil division.
Id. ¶¶ [*30]  31-34.
The ADA makes it unlawful to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job, application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). To "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability" includes "not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To state a claim for failure to accommodate under the ADA, a plaintiff must allege "(1) that he was an individual who had a disability within the meaning of the 'statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337,344-45 (4th Cir. 2013) (internal citations and quotations omitted).

a. Impairment
Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to establish the first element of a failure to accommodate claim—that he has a disability within the meaning of the statute. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 20-22. A plaintiff is disabled [*31]  if he can show '(1) that he has a physical or mental impairment, (2) that this impairment implicates at least one major life activity, and (3) that the limitation is substantial.'" Wicomico Nursing Home v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 739, 751 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Heiko v. Colombo Say. Bank, F.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 254 (4th Cir. 2006)); see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A).
Adinolfi has sufficiently alleged that he has a physical or mental impairment. He alleges that he suffers from high blood pressure in the stroke range, severe anxiety, panic, and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 31. Anxiety and high blood pressure may be impairments for purposes of the ADA. Jacobs v. Admin. Office of the Court, 780 F.3d 562, 572 (4th Cir. 2015) (anxiety); Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 527 U.S. 516, 518, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 144 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1999) (unmedicated high blood pressure).
However, the second amended complaint does not contain sufficient factual matter to plausibly allege that Adinolfi's impairments substantially limit at least one major life activity. "The ADA provides a nonexhaustive list of major life activities, including 'speaking,' 'concentrating,' 'thinking,' 'communicating,' and 'working.'" Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 572 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A)); see also Class v. Towson Univ., 806 F.3d 236, 244-45 (4th Cir. 2015). "[W]hether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity requires an individualized assessment" into a plaintiff's ability "to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii), (iv). "The term 'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in [*32]  favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i); see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(B).
The second amended complaint alleges that Adinolfi suffers from high blood pressure in the stroke range, severe anxiety, panic, and Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 31. It conclusively states that those conditions "interfere with major life activities, in multiple ways," id.; however, the complaint does not allege which major life activities are limited. The complaint states that Adinolfi cannot safely work in the Criminal Division of the NCDOJ but that he can safely work in the Civil Division. Id. ¶¶ 33-34. It does not explain what, specifically, Adinolfi cannot do in the Criminal Division. See Bordonaro v. Johnston Cty. Bd. of Educ., 938 F. Supp. 2d 573, 579 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 11, 2013) (holding that the plaintiff adequately pled how her vision impairment substantially limited her ability to work when she alleged that she bumped into people and objects, had to extend her arm while moving, and could not drive). Adinolfi asks the court to take note of Murphy v. Cty. of New Hanover, where this court held that the plaintiff was disabled. No. 7:17-CV-229-FL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119400, 2019 WL 3244112, at *3 (E.D.N.C. July 18, 2019). However, in that case the plaintiff alleged [*33]  that his ADHD substantially limited his ability to concentrate, think, interact with others, work, and sleep and that due to the distraction of coworkers he found it difficult to perform all of his duties, including timely completion of necessary paperwork. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119400, [WL] at *1. Conversely, Adinolfi has not made specific allegations here as to how his impairments limit his ability to work. This case is more akin to Clausell v. Bayer Corp., in which the court held that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that her anxiety substantially limited her ability to work where her allegations were limited solely to the fact that she suffered from anxiety. No. 5:15-CV-50-BO, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116282, 2015 WL 5146704, at *6 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 1, 2015).
For example, Adinolfi's complaint does not adequately explain the difference between the Criminal and Civil Divisions in regards to Adinolfi's impairments. Without the necessary factual enhancements to this conclusion, Defendants are left to guess how Adinolfi's impairments interfere with his ability to work in the Criminal Division but not the Civil Division.3 In his brief, Adinolfi states that his ability to work in the Criminal Division is impaired because his doctors have said that he cannot safely work in that Division but can work [*34]  in the Civil Division. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 25-26. Again, his statement is conclusory. Without an identification of the major life activity that is substantially limited by Adinolfi's impairments (i.e., what it is, specifically, that he cannot do in the Criminal Division), Adinolfi's complaint falls short. It is recommended that the court allow Defendants' motion to dismiss Adinolfi's failure to accommodate claim and dismiss the claim without prejudice. See McKernan v. Hayes, No. 4:18-CV-27-FL, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67494, 2019 WL 1767563, at *12 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 22, 2019) (dismissing ADEA and ADA claims without prejudice for failure to state a claim).

b. Reasonable Accommodation
Defendants also contend that if Adinolfi had sufficiently alleged that he has a disability, he has not pled that he was denied a reasonable accommodation. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 25-28. Reasonable accommodations include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). "An employer is not required to grant even a reasonable accommodation unless it would enable the employee [*35]  to perform all of the essential functions of her position." Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 581. Moreover, "[a]n employer may reasonably accommodate an employee without providing the exact accommodation that the employee requested. Rather, the employer may provide an alternative reasonable accommodation." Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., Maryland, 789 F.3d 407, 415 (4th Cir. 2015).
Adinolfi requested a transfer from the Criminal Division to the Civil Division, the ability to work from home two days per week, a reduced caseload, a limit of two criminal appeals per year, and the ability to visit the doctor and, gym during the week as needed. [DE-43-2] at 1. In response, the NCDOJ gave Adinolfi three options: he could return to his current position and take leave as needed for doctor's appointments, transfer to the Public Safety Section and take leave as needed for doctor's appointments, or continue on his leave of absence and apply for short term disability. Id. at 2-3. Defendants contend that Adinolfi's proposed accommodation is unreasonable, and the NCDOJ's offered accommodation was reasonable, so Adinolfi has failed to state a claim for a failure to accommodate. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 22-25. However, "[t]he reasonableness of plaintiff's requested accommodation is a question of fact. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion emphatically 'does not resolve contests [*36]  surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.' Moss v. Pasquotank Cty., No. 2:10-CV-56-BR, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84491, 2012 WL 2325846, at *6 (E.D.N.C. June 19, 2012) (quoting Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992)) (other citations omitted).
In the event the court determines Adinolfi to have sufficiently alleged that he is a qualifying individual with a disability, Adinolfi has alleged sufficient facts showing that he requested an accommodation and that his request was denied. The reasonableness of the requested and offered accommodations is a question of fact, and it is therefore recommended that the court deny Defendants' motion to dismiss on that basis.

2. Retaliation
Defendants contend that Adinolfi has failed to state a claim for retaliation under the ADA. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 25-28. The ADA expressly prohibits retaliation, providing, "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead sufficient factual matter showing he: (1) "engaged in protected conduct, (2) he suffered an adverse action, and [*37]  (3) a causal link exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action." Reynolds v. Am. Nat. Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 154 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing A Soc'y Without a Name v. Virginia, 655 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2011)). "Importantly, a plaintiff is not required to prove the conduct he opposed was actually an ADA violation. Rather, he must show he had a 'good faith belief' the conduct violated the ADA." Id. at 154 (citing Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health, 313 F.3d 205, 216 (4th Cir. 2002)).
First, Adinolfi has pled facts showing that he engaged in protected conduct under the ADA. The second amended complaint states that "Defendants have retaliated against Plaintiff after he filed a grievance with the human resources office of NCDOJ and requested a reasonable accommodation, by first repeatedly denying his request for a reasonable accommodation under the ADA and then by terminating him on 18 March 2019." 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 71. In their motion to dismiss, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's March 28, 2018 and May 8, 2018 grievance did not allege disability discrimination and therefore cannot constitute a protected activity. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 17. Adinolfi responds that the protected activity was not the filing of grievances; rather, it was his request for a reasonable accommodation. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 28. A request for a reasonable accommodation is protected conduct under the ADA, and here, the second amended complaint adequately [*38]  alleges that Adinolfi requested a reasonable accommodation. See Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 577 ("Jacobs clearly engaged in protected activity by submitting a request for accommodation"); 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶ 33.
Second, Adinolfi has also pled facts showing that the next element—adverse employment action—is satisfied. The second amended complaint states that Adinolfi was terminated, and termination is an adverse employment action.4 See Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 577 ("the AOC clearly took an adverse employment action by firing her"); Adams, 789 F.3d at 431 (calling a discharge an "immediate and apparent" adverse employment action).
Third, the second amended complaint plausibly alleges a causal connection between Adinolfi's protected conduct and the adverse employment action. Defendants contend that Adinolfi has not pled facts showing a causal link between his request for an accommodation and his termination because there is no close temporal connection. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 27. Adinolfi requested a reasonable accommodation on March 29, 2018, and he was terminated nearly a year later on March 18, 2019. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 33, 35. Although one year is a large temporal gap between the two events, Adinolfi was on leave during that time,5 and this court has been wary of dismissing retaliation [*39]  claims at the motion to dismiss stage for too long of a time lapse between the protected conduct and the adverse action. Moss, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84491, 2012 WL 2325846, at *9 (declining to dismiss when the plaintiff alleged a nine month gap between the filing of an EEOC charge and her termination) (citing McNairn v. Sullivan, 929 F.2d 974, 977 (4th Cir. 1991) (eight months), Rehman v. State Univ. of N.Y., 596 F. Supp. 2d 643, 653-54 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (also eight months)). Construing the facts alleged in a light most favorably to Adinolfi, the second amended complaint alleges a causal connection between the protected conduct and an adverse employment action. Moreover, even though the complaint does not sufficiently allege that Adinolfi is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, it is not necessary for Adinolfi to allege that he has a disability in order to state a claim for retaliation. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12203 (making it unlawful to retaliate against "any individual" for engaging in protected activity); Jacobs, 780 F.3d at 577 ("A plaintiff need not show that she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA" in order to state a claim for retaliation). Accordingly, it is recommended that the court deny Defendants' motion to dismiss the retaliation claim at this stage.

C. Sovereign Immunity and the Eleventh Amendment
First, Defendants contend that Plaintiff's North Carolina law and public policy claims against both defendants are [*40]  barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 17-18. Plaintiff does not respond to that argument. See Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46]. Second, Defendants contend that all claims against Defendant Attorney General Stein are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 28-30. Plaintiff responds that there is no Eleventh Amendment immunity for violations of the ADA, and there is no immunity for his claims for prospective relief Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 30.

1. North Carolina Law and Public Policy Claims Against Both Defendants
The second amended complaint alleges that "North Carolina law and public policy prohibit[] discrimination against employees on account of age," and "Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiff on account of his age." 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] ¶¶ 54-55. The complaint does not identify the particular North Carolina tort allegedly committed by Defendants. See id. The Eleventh Amendment limits the authority of the federal courts to hear claims against the States. U.S. Const. amend. XI. "The ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not be sued by private individuals in federal court." Garrett, 531 U.S. at 363. Likewise, "North Carolina has a well-established common law doctrine of sovereign immunity which prevents a claim for relief against the State except where the State has consented or waived its immunity." DeMurry v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., 195 N.C. App. 485, 492, 673 S.E.2d 374, 380 (2009) (citations omitted). This [*41]  immunity from suit applies not only to claims against the State itself, but also to claims against state agencies and state officials acting in an official capacity. See Myers v. North Carolina, No. 5:12-CV-714-D, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116324, 2013 WL 4456848, at *3 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 16, 2013) ("State agencies and state officials acting in their official capacities also are protected against a claim for damages because a suit against a state office is no different from a suit against the state itself.") (citing Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429, 117 S. Ct. 900, 137 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1997)); Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45 (1989); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 666-68, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974); Constantine, 411 F.3d at 479; DeMurry, 195 N.C. App. at 493. However, sovereign immunity may be waived or abrogated where the state has waived its immunity or where Congress has overridden that immunity. Philips, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172121, 2015 WL 9462095, at *6 (citing Will, 491 U.S. at 66).
Adinolfi is a private citizen suing a state agency, the NCDOJ, and a state official acting in his official capacity, Attorney General Josh Stein. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39]. Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment generally bars all claims for which North Carolina has not waived its immunity and Congress has not overridden North Carolina's immunity. Philips, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172121 , 2015 WL 9462095, at *6. Defendants assert their immunity from Adiniolfi's claims of age discrimination in violation of North Carolina law, and Adinolfi cites no authority showing that Congress has overridden that immunity. Accordingly, Adinolfi's claims for discrimination in violation of North Carolina [*42]  law and public policy against both Defendants are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss those claims be allowed.

2. All Claims Against Attorney General Stein
Defendants contend that all of Adinolfi's claims against Attorney General Stein should be dismissed because he has immunity as a state official under the Eleventh Amendment, the ADA and ADEA do not impose individual liability, and, in any event, claims against Attorney General Stein in his official capacity are duplicative of claims against the NCDOJ.6 Defs.' Mem. [DE-43] at 28-30. Adinolfi responds that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar claims under the ADA or claims for prospective relief from an ongoing violation of federal law. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 30-31.
As noted above, the Eleventh Amendment generally bars claims by private citizens against states in federal court. Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala., 531 U.S. at 363. There are two general exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity: the state may waive its immunity, or Congress may override it. Philips, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172121, 2015 WL 9462095, at *6. Adinolfi contends that Congress overrode Eleventh Amendment immunity from ADA claims. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 30 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12202). However, in Garrett, 531 U.S. at 374, the Supreme Court held that in abrogating Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title I of the ADA, Congress overstepped its enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Congress lacked constitutional authority to override Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title I of the ADA, [*43]  its attempt to do so in 42 U.S.C. § 12202 was invalid. Id. Likewise, in Kimel, 528 U.S. at 92, the Supreme Court held that Congress did not validly abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in the ADEA. Accordingly, Defendant Attorney General Stein still enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims made under Title I of the ADA and the ADEA.
Adinolfi cites Constantine, 411 F.3d at 490 for the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar his ADA claim. Pl.'s Resp. [DE-46] at 30. However, as Defendants note in their reply, Constantine is a Title II case, and Adinolfi's claim is made under Title I of the ADA.. Defs.' Reply [DE-47] at 11. The Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power analysis for Title I is distinguishable from the analysis for Title II because Title II protects the fundamental right of access to the courts, while Title I, which addresses disability discrimination, does not trigger such a strict standard of review. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2004) ("In view of the significant differences between Titles I and II, however, Garrett left open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress' [14th Amendment] § 5 enforcement power," and holding that Congress's abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title II of the ADA was constitutionally valid). Under Garrett, Congress's attempt to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title I of the ADA was invalid; accordingly, despite Constantine's contrary holding regarding Title II of the ADA, Stein is [*44]  immune from Adinolfi's Title I claims.
Adinolfi additionally contends that his request for prospective injunc6e relief is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. State officials do not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity if a plaintiff requests prospective relief for a continuing violation of federal law. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-56, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908); Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1985). In that scenario, the Supremacy Clause, not Congress acting pursuant to its enforcement power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Green, 474 U.S. at 68 ("Remedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law. But compensatory or deterrence interests are insufficient to overcome the dictates of the Eleventh Amendment."); Westminister Nursing Ctr. v. Cohen, No. 5:17-CV-96-FL, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193330, 2017 WL 5632661, at *5 (E.D.N.C. Nov. 22, 2017) ("State agencies can be sued for prospective injunctive relief to comply with the federal Constitution and federal statutes.").
In the second amended complaint, Adinolfi requests that Defendants be ordered to reinstate Plaintiff's employment and provide a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. 2d Am. Compl. [DE-39] at 15. That claim is for prospective, non-compensatory relief, so Attorney General Stein, as a state official, does not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity for that claim. See Green, 474 U.S. at 68. However, Defendants additionally contend that the ADA and ADEA do not impose [*45]  individual liability, and claims made against Attorney General Stein are duplicative of claims made against Defendant NCDOJ. Defendants are correct that the ADA and ADEA do not impose individual liability. See J.W. v. Johnston Cty. Bd. of Educ., No. 5:11-CV-707-D, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136300, 2012 WL 4425439, at *6 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 24, 2012) (collecting cases holding that the ADA does not impose individual liability); Jiggetts v. Sharpe, 141 F. App'x 162, 163 (4th Cir. 2005) ("Individuals cannot be held liable for employment discrimination under the ADEA"). Accordingly, it is recommended that Adinolfi's claim for prospective relief against Attorney General Stein be dismissed because Attorney General Stein cannot be individually liable for violations of the ADA and ADEA.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is recommended that Defendants' motion to dismiss [DE-42] be ALLOWED in part and DENIED in part, as follows:
1. It is recommended that the court find that the November 2017 promotion is time-barred as it relates to Plaintiff's ADEA discrimination claim, but the statements that form the basis of Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim are not time-barred because they were a continuing violation;
2. Defendants' motion to dismiss the ADEA age discrimination claim for failure to state a claim be DENIED because the [*46]  second amended complaint plausibly alleges facts stating a claim for age discrimination in violation of the ADEA;
3. Defendants' motion to dismiss the ADEA hostile work environment claim be ALLOWED and the claim be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE because the second amended complaint does not plausibly allege facts stating a claim for a hostile work environment in violation of the ADEA;
4. Defendants' motion to dismiss the ADA failure to accommodate claim be ALLOWED and the claim be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE because Adinolfi has not stated sufficient facts to plausibly allege that he has a disability;
5. Defendants' motion to dismiss the ADA retaliation claim be DENIED because the second amended complaint plausibly alleges facts stating a claim for retaliation in violation of the ADA;
6. Defendants' motion to dismiss the claims for violations of North Carolina law and public policy be ALLOWED because both defendants are immune from those claims under the Eleventh Amendment; and
7. Defendants' motion to dismiss all claims against Attorney General Stein be ALLOWED because he has Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims for retrospective relief, and there is no individual liability under the ADA or ADEA for claims for prospective relief. [*47] 
IT IS DIRECTED that a copy of this Memorandum and Recommendation be served on each of the parties or, if represented, their counsel. Each party shall have until January 24, 2020 to file written objections to the Memorandum and Recommendation. The presiding district judge must conduct his or her own review (that is, make a de novo determination) of those portions of the Memorandum and Recommendation to which objection is properly made and may accept, reject, or modify the determinations in the Memorandum and Recommendation; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); Local Civ. R. 1.1 (permitting modification of deadlines specified in local rules), 72.4(b). Any response to objections shall be filed by within 14 days after service of the objections on the responding party.
If a party does not file written objections to the Memorandum and Recommendation by the foregoing deadline, the party will be giving up the right to review of the Memorandum and Recommendation by the presiding district judge as described above, and the presiding district judge may enter an order or judgment based on the Memorandum and Recommendation without such review. In [*48]  addition, the party's failure to file written objections by the foregoing deadline will bar the party from appealing to the Court of Appeals from an order or judgment of the presiding district judge based on the Memorandum and Recommendation. See Wright v. Collins, 766 F.2d 841, 846-47 (4th Cir. 1985).
