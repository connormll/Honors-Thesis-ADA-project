Opinion



FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Plaintiff Rosana Jones filed the above-styled civil action on May 12, 2015. Plaintiff alleges that she was employed by Defendant Aaron's, Inc. ("Defendant" or "Aaron's") from March 19, 2012, until November 1, 2013, when her employment was terminated. She alleges that she is a qualified individual with a disability and that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, and retaliated against her for opposing discrimination, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. Plaintiff also asserts claims against Defendant for interference and retaliation under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq., and asserts a claim for relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2).
The action is before the Court on the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] and the Plaintiff's [*2]  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68]. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment on all of the claims asserted in the Complaint. For the reasons discussed below, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims.
The undersigned further RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68] be DENIED as moot. Plaintiff has not moved for summary judgment on any of the claims she has asserted against Defendant. Instead she requests that the Court enter summary judgment in her favor as to some of the Defendant's affirmative defenses asserted in its Answer. Because the undersigned finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on all of the Plaintiff's claims asserted in the Complaint, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68] be denied as moot.

I. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
A. FACTS
Unless otherwise indicated, the Court draws the following facts from "Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment" [70-2] ("Def. SMF") and "Plaintiff's Additional [*3]  Statement of Material Disputed Facts" [79-1] ("Pl. SMF"). The Court also draws some facts from "Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts" [79-2] ("Pl. Resp. SMF") and "Defendant's Responses and Objections to Plaintiff's Additional Statement of Material Disputed Facts in Support of her Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment" [87] ("Def. Resp. SMF").
For those facts submitted by the Defendant that are supported by citations to record evidence, and for which the Plaintiff has not specifically disputed and refuted with citations to admissible record evidence showing a genuine dispute of fact, the Court deems those facts admitted, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B). See LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa ("This Court will deem each of the movant's facts as admitted unless the respondent: (i) directly refutes the movant's fact with concise responses supported by specific citations to evidence (including page or paragraph number); (ii) states a valid objection to the admissibility of the movant's fact; or (iii) points out that the movant's citation does not support the movant's fact or that the movant's fact is not material or otherwise has failed to comply with the provisions set [*4]  out in LR 56.1(B)(1).").
For those facts submitted by the Plaintiff, the Court notes that the Defendant violated Local Rule 56.1 in its response to the Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts. Local Rule 56.1 provides that, if a respondent provides a statement of additional material facts, the movant shall file a response to each of the respondent's facts, but the "range of acceptable responses is limited to" an objection to admissibility, an objection on the ground that the cited record evidence does not support the fact, an objection on the ground of materiality, or a concession that the court may consider the respondent's evidence. LR 56.1(B)(3), NDGa. In its response to the Plaintiff's facts, Defendant went beyond the "range of acceptable responses," and in several instances, the Defendant states that the Plaintiff's allegation is "disputed" or "disputed in part," with citations to evidence demonstrating that the fact is disputed. See, e.g., Def. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 1-3. Because that is beyond the "range of acceptable responses," the Court has largely excluded the Defendant's efforts to "dispute" the Plaintiff's facts, but notes when the Defendant has demonstrated that the Plaintiff has failed to cite to admissible evidence in support [*5]  of a material fact, or has presented another valid objection under Local Rule 56.1 regarding a material fact.
The Court has also excluded assertions of fact by either party that are immaterial or presented as arguments or legal conclusions, and has excluded assertions of fact unsupported by a citation to admissible evidence in the record or asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B), NDGa ("The court will not consider any fact: (a) not supported by a citation to evidence . . . or (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."). The Court has also viewed all evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required on a defendant's motion for summary judgment. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986); McCabe v. Sharrett, 12 F.3d 1558, 1560 (11th Cir. 1994); Reynolds v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 989 F.2d 465, 469 (11th Cir. 1993).
Both parties have objected to some of the opposing party's proffered facts on the ground that an asserted fact is not relevant or material to the claims and defenses presented in this case. The Court nevertheless includes some of those facts because they provide background information that is helpful to explain the context of the parties' asserted facts and contentions. The parties also attempt to dispute some of the opposing [*6]  party's proffered facts, but the majority of these disputes are over minor and immaterial issues. Accordingly, the Court will not rule on each and every objection or dispute presented by the parties, and will discuss those objections and disputes in the analysis section only when necessary to do so regarding a genuine dispute of a material issue of fact.

Defendant's Statement of Facts
Defendant Aaron's hired Plaintiff Rosana Jones as a Customer Service Representative ("CSR") on March 19, 2012, and she transferred to the Conyers, Georgia store in or about June of 2012. Def. SMF at ¶ 1; Pl. Dep. [67] at 83:17-84:4, 92:5-8. As a CSR at Aaron's, Plaintiff was responsible for accepting and maintaining new customers, maintaining the appearance and organization of the showroom by cleaning, organizing, merchandising, and pricing, as well as any other tasks as assigned by management. Def. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. Dep. at 92:5-93:12, Ex. 7. The job description provides that CSRs must be able to lift 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep. at 92:5-93:12, Ex. 7. Plaintiff admits that the job description accurately describes her prior position as a CSR. Def. SMF at ¶ 4 Pl. Dep. at 93:1-4, 93:9-12.
Plaintiff took [*7]  leave under the FMLA from June 3, 2013 through June 16, 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 5; Pl. Dep. at 101:18-102:2, Exs. 11, 12. When she returned to work on June 18, 2013, Plaintiff submitted a release to return to work with restrictions on not lifting more than ten pounds and not standing for more than twenty minutes. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 6, 95; Pl. Dep. at 105:16-23, Ex. 15; Scott-Dyer Dec., Def. Ex. 5 [70-7], at ¶¶ 23, 63, Att. 12, 28. Plaintiff admits that she was permitted to take leave as needed and that no one interfered with her leave under the FMLA. Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-24, 101:5-10, 109:7-15. Although Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant permitted her to take FMLA leave, she claims that Defendant "interfered" with her right to take FMLA leave "by cutting her hours when she returned from FMLA leave." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 7; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-13.
On October 1, 2013, Chris Cooper1 became the General Manager of the Aaron's store in Conyers, Georgia. Def. SMF at ¶ 8; Pl. Dep. at 98:1-3. Approximately one week later, Plaintiff notified Todd Smith, the newly assigned Regional Manager and Cooper's direct supervisor, that Cooper was not following her medical restrictions. Def. SMF [*8]  at ¶ 9; Pl. Dep. at 29:8-33:14, 112:3-6; 130:4-16; Smith Dep. [64] at 45:18-46:7, 64:18-65:9. Plaintiff told Smith that she could not stand for more than 15 minutes, lift more than 10 pounds, bend, or raise her arms. Def. SMF at ¶ 10; Pl. Dep. at 105:16-23; Smith Dep. at 90:2-13; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 22. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's stated medical restrictions were not in her file at the store, and Smith asked her to provide updated restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 11; Pl. Dep. at 131:20-132:8; Smith Dep. at 63:5-15; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 22. Plaintiff does not dispute that Smith asked her to provide updated restrictions, but she disputes the Defendant's contention that her restrictions were not in file at the store. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 11. It is undisputed, however, that Smith told Plaintiff that until Aaron's received updated medical restrictions, he would ensure that Cooper followed her medical restrictions as Plaintiff had described them. Def. SMF at ¶ 12; Pl. Dep. at 134:15-20; Smith Dep. at 61:18-23, 64:18-65:9; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 22.
Smith then called Cooper and Sandy Scott-Dyer2 and they discussed Plaintiff's medical restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 13; Smith Dep. at 59:15-63:18. [*9]  According to Defendant, Scott-Dyer told Smith that the restrictions that Plaintiff had on file were not consistent with her stated restrictions because they provided only that she was not to lift more than 10 pounds and was not to stand for more than 20 minutes. Def. SMF at ¶ 14; Smith Dep. at 59:15-63:18; Pl. Dep. at 105:10-106:1 (Plaintiff testified that her restrictions had changed at some point after June 18, 2013, to a restriction on lifting no more than five pounds rather than ten), Ex. 15. Scott-Dyer agreed that they needed updated restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 15; Smith Dep. at 59:15-63:15; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 22-24. During Smith's conversation with Cooper, Cooper agreed that he would follow Plaintiff's stated medical restrictions until she provided updated restrictions.3 Def. SMF at ¶ 16; Smith Dep. at 59:15-63:18; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 22.
Plaintiff does not dispute that Smith called Scott-Dyer, but she disputes that the purpose of the call was to discuss her medical restrictions or that her restrictions were not consistent with what she claimed. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 13-14. Instead, Plaintiff contends that the purpose of the call was to report "a concerning comment" that [*10]  Plaintiff made about Cooper and to inform Scott-Dyer that Plaintiff was "pushing back and not complying with Cooper's instructions." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 13; Aaron's Dep. 5/4/6 [64] at 60:1-63:18 (Smith testified that he told Scott-Dyer that "the situation could escalate" because Plaintiff "was continually pushing back and challenging every decision that Chris was making in the store").
During the four weeks that Plaintiff worked with Cooper, she made multiple complaints to Smith about how Cooper managed the store including that Cooper did not allow associates in the Sales Department to take customer calls about payment plans or to discuss their accounts. Def. SMF at ¶ 17; Pl. Dep. at 164:8-15; Smith Dep. at 57:14-58:1; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 26, 40. According to Smith, the general practice is that the "Accounts" Department handles customer calls regarding "accounts." Def. SMF at ¶ 18; Smith Dep. at 57:18-58:1. Plaintiff complained that Cooper asked the CSRs to highlight the customer agreements differently from the way the last manager had required. Def. SMF at ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. at 164:16-22; Smith Dep. at 57:14-58:1; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 26. According to Defendant, Plaintiff complained that [*11]  the requirement to highlight agreements was "stupid" and that she did not think she needed to do it. Def. SMF at ¶ 20; Pl. Dep. at 164:16-22; Smith Dep. at 78:24-79:3 (Plaintiff said that all of the operational changes that Cooper wanted to make were "stupid"). Scott-Dyer testified that Cooper was acting appropriately because it is typical for CSRs to highlight certain information so that General Managers can review agreements quickly for the most important information to decide whether to approve the customer agreement. Def. SMF at ¶ 21; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 42.
Plaintiff complained that Cooper changed her schedule from a start time of 9 a.m. to a start time of 10 a.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 22; Pl. Dep. at 34:24-36:5; Smith Dep. at 58:3-16; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 30. The schedule shows that Cooper allowed each CSR to work only one 9 a.m. shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 23; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 30, Att. 13. According to Smith, it was standard practice not to schedule CSRs to start work prior to 10 a.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 24; Smith Dec., Def. Ex. 6 [70-8], at ¶ 21. Plaintiff contends, however, that CSRs were permitted to work 9 a.m. shifts. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 24; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 30, Att. 13. On October 28, [*12]  2013, Plaintiff informed Scott-Dyer and Smith that she no longer had an issue with her work schedule. Def. SMF at ¶ 25; Pl. Dep. at 162:22-163:6.
Cooper took issue with the frequency and length of the associates' breaks. Def. SMF at ¶ 26; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 31. As a result, Cooper asked all associates to clock out for their breaks. Def. SMF at ¶ 27; Pl. Dep. at 38:1-39:9. Plaintiff complained to Scott-Dyer, the Associate Resources Representative4 for the store. Def. SMF at ¶ 28; Pl. Dep. at 37:21-38:1. Scott-Dyer informed Plaintiff that Aaron's did not want any associates clocking out for break, but if there was an issue with associates taking too many breaks or taking excessively long breaks that Cooper may address it through discipline. Def. SMF at ¶ 29; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 31. On October 26, 2013, Scott-Dyer sent an e-mail to all General Managers in the Division regarding how to handle associates who are abusing smoking breaks. Def. SMF at ¶ 30; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 32, Att. 15. Plaintiff admits that the associates were immediately given their breaks back. Def. SMF at ¶ 31; Pl. Dep. at 37:21-38:1. Plaintiff never reported any other issues related to her breaks. [*13]  Def. SMF at ¶ 32; Pl. Dep. at 38:1-39:9.
Plaintiff admits that one incident was the "triggering" event that caused her and Cooper's relationship to deteriorate. Def. SMF at ¶ 33; Pl. Dep. at 188:18-20. Plaintiff called Smith to complain that Cooper would not approve the lease agreement for a stripper. Def. SMF at ¶ 34; Pl. Dep. at 187:23-188:8. Smith explained to Plaintiff that it is Cooper's decision as the manager to decide which lease agreements to approve. Def. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Dep. at 188:7-12 (Plaintiff testified that Smith told her, "If Chris says she can't be a customer, she can't be a customer. Basically, it's his store."). According to Defendant, Plaintiff admits that it was her complaint about this incident, not about her work restrictions, that "triggered" Cooper to treat her negatively. Def. SMF at ¶ 36; Pl. Dep. at 188:18-20. Plaintiff admits that she testified that "it started" when she complained to Smith, but contends that when she said "it started" she meant: "Everything. Him. I guess the humiliation, the retaliation, him making me do things, you know, out of my restrictions." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 36; Pl. Dep. at 188:13-17.
On one occasion, Plaintiff [*14]  complained to Smith that she did not like the way Cooper spoke to her. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Smith II Dep. [65] at 26:5-17. In particular, Plaintiff complained that Cooper would say "this is my store" and it is an "at-will" state and she could leave if she wants to.5 Def. SMF at ¶ 38; Pl. Dep. at 41:22-23, 164:23-165:3. Scott-Dyer discovered that Cooper made this comment about it being his store and being "at-will," but it was not just to Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 39; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 33. Rather, Cooper told other associates the same thing, including Jessica Fraga-Cano, who was the Sales Manager at that time. Def. SMF at ¶ 40; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 33.
Plaintiff also said to Smith that Cooper was "a young cocky black male with something to prove." Def. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Dep. at 156:17-25; Smith Dep. at 59:9-60:23; Smith II Dep. at 26:5-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 27. Smith believed that Plaintiff's comments about Cooper were unacceptable racist comments that stereotype young black men as being cocky and out to prove something. Def. SMF at ¶ 42; Smith Dep. at 59:9-60:23. Plaintiff explained that she felt it was necessary to point out Cooper's race: "Because I know as an African-American—when [*15]  you get power, you tend to kind of brag about it, you know. So that's how I saw him." Def. SMF at ¶ 43; Pl. Dep. at 158:7-9. Plaintiff does not dispute that she called Cooper a "young cocky black male with something to prove," but contends that what she meant by that statement was that "Cooper was prejudiced against African Americans, was an African American man who had power, did what he wanted to do." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Dep. at 157-58.
Plaintiff admits that this statement about Cooper being a young cocky black man could be considered racist, but she contends that she "didn't mean for it to be a racist comment." Def. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. Dep. at 157:3-4, 159:9-17. Plaintiff admits that the statement would be racist if a Caucasian person said it, explaining that "it's the same thing as if two black people were calling each other n*gger, that's what they do." Def. SMF at ¶ 45; Pl. Dep. at 159:7-17. Smith reported this conversation to Scott-Dyer as the Associate Resources Representative. Def. SMF at ¶ 47; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 27; Smith Dec. at ¶ 23.
On October 25, Plaintiff contacted Scott-Dyer to again complain about an operational issue at the store. Def. SMF [*16]  at ¶ 48; Pl. Dep. at 139:22-140:8. Plaintiff was scheduled to get off work early that day, and she requested a lunch break in addition. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 49-50; Pl. Dep. at 138:17-23. Cooper told her that instead she could leave an hour earlier than scheduled. Def. SMF at ¶ 51; Pl. Dep. at 138:17-23. Plaintiff, however, was not willing to do so and, therefore, she called Scott-Dyer to complain. Def. SMF at ¶ 52; Pl. Dep. at 140:3-19. Scott-Dyer told Plaintiff not to be so confrontational with Cooper. Def. SMF at ¶ 53; Pl. Dep. at 140:9-12. Scott-Dyer then told Plaintiff that they were going to need to meet in person. Def. SMF at ¶ 54; Pl. Dep. at 140:13-16.
On or about October 28, 2013, Plaintiff clocked in to work at around 10:00 a.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 55; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 36-39; Smith II Dep. at 51:24-52:14. Plaintiff was not certain of the date of this event. Def. SMF at ¶ 56; Pl. Dep. at 39:18-21; 40:24-41:11. Scott-Dyer's handwritten notes taken at the time of the events in question show that it occurred on October 28, 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 57; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 36, Att. 16. Almost immediately, Plaintiff asked Cooper if she could take a break to [*17]  take her medicine with a honey bun. Def. SMF at ¶ 58; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22. Cooper responded that he did not know and needed to check the Handbook. Def. SMF at ¶ 59; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17. Plaintiff admits that she could have taken the medication before arriving to work, but contends that she usually took her medication at work with a snack. Def. SMF at ¶ 60; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 60; Pl. Dep. at 41:25-42:21; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39. Plaintiff responded by asking if she should clock out, or go home. Def. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Dep. at 41:12-24. According to Plaintiff, Cooper told her "I don't care what you do. It's an at-will state." Def. SMF at ¶ 62; Pl. Dep. at 41:12-24. Plaintiff then left the store and did not return the remainder of the day. Def. SMF at ¶ 63; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17.
Plaintiff does not dispute that she asked Cooper if she should clock out or go home, but she contends that she said that only after she told Cooper that she needed to take her medication and "Cooper responded by stating that was not his problem." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Dep. at 41:12-21. In support of that allegation, she cites [*18]  to her deposition testimony, in which she testified that she was just "like, 'Okay, whatever.' So I need to take my medicine, I mean, 'How am I going to take my medicine?' And he was just like—basically, that was not his problem." Pl. Dep. at 41:15-19.
Smith and Scott-Dyer set up an in-person meeting with Plaintiff on October 30, 2013, to discuss what was going on. Def. SMF at ¶ 64; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 38, Att. 14, 16. During the meeting, Plaintiff was asked why she left work early on October 28, 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 65; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39. Plaintiff responded that she was sick and tired of Cooper. Def. SMF at ¶ 66; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39; Smith Dep. at 78:4-7. Plaintiff said that shortly after arriving at work, she asked Cooper if she could take a break and take her medicine with a honey bun, and when Scott-Dyer asked Plaintiff if there was any reason that she could not have done so before work or during her lunch break, Plaintiff responded that there was not. Def. SMF at ¶ 67; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22; Pl. Dep. at 39:22-42:15.
Because Cooper had recently taken issue with associates' breaks being too frequent and lasting too long, Scott-Dyer and Smith believed [*19]  that Plaintiff was purposely trying to provoke Cooper by requesting the break at the start of her shift. Def. SMF at ¶ 68; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22. Plaintiff admits that prior to this day, she had always taken her medicine with food at work and had never requested permission to do so. Def. SMF at ¶ 69; Pl. Dep. at 42:9-18. Smith and Scott-Dyer believed that there was really no reason for her to ask Cooper to take medicine on this day other than to antagonize him. Def. SMF at ¶ 70; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39; Smith Dec. at ¶ 25. Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that Cooper took issue with the frequency and length of associates' breaks and asked them to clock out for their breaks. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 70; Pl. Dep. at 38:1-39:9. Smith and Scott-Dyer talked with Plaintiff about her unacceptable behavior of walking out on her shift because she disagreed with her manager's response to her request for a break. Def. SMF at ¶ 71; Smith Dep. at 82:10-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39. Smith and Scott-Dyer encouraged Plaintiff to comply with Cooper's operational and management decisions. Def. SMF at ¶ 72; Smith Dep. at 82:10-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39.
Only one day after that meeting, on October 31, [*20]  2013, Plaintiff claims that she sold a camera to a customer that did not have a price on it. Def. SMF at ¶ 73; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16. She asked Cooper for assistance, but he told her that he did not want to assist her because he believed the camera was stolen. Def. SMF at ¶ 74; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16. Plaintiff admits that Cooper told her that it may be stolen because there was no price on it and "it didn't have numbers. It didn't have anything." Def. SMF at ¶ 75; Pl. Dep. at 167:22-168:4. Plaintiff called Smith to complain about Cooper's handling of the camera sale. Def. SMF at ¶ 76; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16. Smith told Plaintiff that he would take care of it and that he would talk to Cooper about it. Def. SMF at ¶ 77; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16.
Instead of waiting for Smith to look into the situation, Plaintiff asked to meet with Cooper in one of the offices. Def. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-20. Cooper told Plaintiff that he wanted to talk where they were so that there would be a witness. Def. SMF at ¶ 79; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-20. Plaintiff responded by saying: "Witnesses for what? . . . You know what? . . . Chris, just be a man. . . . Tell me what your problem is with me." [*21]  Def. SMF at ¶ 80; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-170:25. Plaintiff admits that when she said "be a man, and tell me, you know, what your problem is," it "sparked something" because Cooper started yelling. Def. SMF at ¶ 81; Pl. Dep. at 169:21-170:13.
That same day, Cooper informed Scott-Dyer about Plaintiff's comment and asked for direction on how to handle the situation. Def. SMF at ¶ 82; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:9; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 51. Cooper reported to Scott-Dyer that Plaintiff told him "to be a man." Def. SMF at ¶ 83; Smith Dep. at 80:25-81:9; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 51, Att. 18. On the advice of Scott-Dyer, Cooper sent Plaintiff home for the rest of the day so they could determine their next steps. Def. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. Dep. at 169:4-171:1, 172:19-173:2; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 51. After this final incident, and considering her history of disrespect and insubordination toward Cooper coupled with her admissions to Smith that she did not respect Cooper, Smith decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Def. SMF at ¶ 85; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 52. On November 1, 2013,6 Cooper met with Plaintiff at the direction of Associate Resources and terminated her employment. Def. SMF [*22]  at ¶ 89; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:17; Pl. Dep., Ex. 29.
Plaintiff admits she had previously received a copy of the Handbook, which included the Rules of Conduct.7 Def. SMF at ¶ 86; Pl. Dep. at 84:13-85:4, 87:11-88:12, 89:14-25, Ex. 4, 5. Plaintiff understood that if she violated the Rules of Conduct that it could lead to immediate termination. Def. SMF at ¶ 87; Pl. Dep. at 89:14-25. Plaintiff admits that she also understood that Aaron's values include "accountability, communication, truth, respect, integrity, teamwork and excellence," which she agrees are important. Def. SMF at ¶ 88; Pl. Dep. at 88:19-89:1.
Prior to October 18, 2013, Plaintiff complained to Smith about Cooper's failure to follow her medical restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 91; Pl. Dep. at 131:9-13. According to Defendant, the only task that he allegedly asked her to perform that violated her actual medical restrictions was to lift a computer. Def. SMF at ¶ 92; Pl. Dep. at 29:15-17. Plaintiff admits that it only occurred on one occasion and that it never occurred again after she talked to Smith. Def. SMF at ¶ 93; Pl. Dep. at 31:23-32:5 (Plaintiff testified that Cooper asked her to move a computer on one occasion, and he did [*23]  not ask her to do so after she complained to Smith). Plaintiff informed Smith that she had medical restrictions that prohibited her from bending and from lifting her arms above her shoulders and that Cooper had violated those restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 94; Pl. Dep. at 30:9:-33:14.
When Plaintiff returned from her FMLA leave in June of 2013, Plaintiff was given restrictions of not lifting more than 10 pounds and not standing for more than 20 minutes. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 6, 95; Pl. Dep., Ex. 15. On October 8, Plaintiff was given restrictions of not lifting more than 10 pounds and not standing longer than 15 minutes. Def. SMF at ¶ 96; Pl. Dep., Ex. 18. Defendant contends that Scott-Dyer and Smith followed up with her several times regarding providing a doctor's note related to no bending and no lifting her arms above her shoulders, but she was never able to produce one. Def. SMF at ¶ 97; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 29, 35; Smith Dec. at ¶¶ 17. Plaintiff disputes that she was asked "several times" for her medical restrictions, and contends that she gave Cooper "papers from her doctor and he told her he didn't want the papers." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 97. She does not dispute, however, that she failed [*24]  to provide any documentation that included a restriction on bending or lifting her arms above her shoulders. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 97.
Shortly after leaving her employment at Aaron's, Plaintiff decided that she no longer had any medical restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 98; Pl. Dep. at 70:17-71:15 (Q: "So how did you determine that they [medical restrictions] ended in February of 2014?" A: "Because I was—I mean I just did it myself, because I was able to stand for long periods of time. I was able to lift things. I lost weight, so . . . ."). Plaintiff contends, however, that she "continued with shots and treatment until February 2014 when she noticed she was able to stand for longer periods of time and lift things." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 98; Pl. Dep. at 71:5-15. It is undisputed that the job requirements of a CSR include assisting customers on the showroom floor, maintaining the showroom through cleaning, organizing, merchandising and pricing, and lifting up to 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 99; Pl. Dep. at Ex. 7; Smith II Dep. at 28:7-9.
According to the Defendant, it terminated Plaintiff's employment due to her repeated violations of the Rules of Conduct policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 100; Scott-Dyer Dec. at [*25]  ¶ 53. Defendant contends that Smith and Scott-Dyer, who were involved in the final decision, were sensitive to the fact that Plaintiff had raised issues regarding Cooper not following her medical restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 101; Smith Dec. at ¶ 38. While a General Manager generally would make the final decision regarding termination, Defendant contends that Scott-Dyer and Smith did not allow him to do so in this case to ensure that the decision was not motivated by retaliation, discrimination, or any other impermissible reason.8 Def. SMF at ¶ 102; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 54; Smith Dec. at ¶ 39.
Plaintiff admits that bending, lifting her arms above her shoulders, lifting more than 10 pounds, and standing more than 15 minutes were part of her job duties as a CSR. Def. SMF at ¶ 105; Pl. Dep. at 92:5-93:12, Ex. 7. Defendant contends that, once the Plaintiff brought it to Smith's attention that Cooper was not following her restrictions, it never occurred again. Def. SMF at ¶ 106; Pl. Dep. at 31:23-32:2; 32:17-19; 33:5-6. It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not have any medical restrictions related to lifting her arms or bending while Cooper was her General Manager. Def. SMF at ¶ 107; Pl. Resp. [*26]  SMF at ¶ 107; Pl. Dep. at 105:10-106:1, Ex. 15; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 23, 63, Atts. 12, 28.
Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination against Aaron's with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") on April 22, 2014. Def. SMF at ¶ 90; Smith Dec. at ¶ 50, Ex. E. Plaintiff's EEOC Charge does not contain any allegations regarding an ADA retaliation claim that: (1) Plaintiff was not scheduled to attend a Friday meeting; (2) she was not allowed to take medication at work on one occasion; or (3) she had to clock out for smoke breaks. Def. SMF at ¶ 108; Smith Dec. at ¶ 50, Ex. E. Plaintiff admits that she was included in the Friday morning meeting when she brought it to Cooper's attention, that she could have taken her medication before reporting to work, and that she was not required to clock out for smoking breaks once she brought it to Scott-Dyer's attention. Def. SMF at ¶ 109; Pl. Dep. at 38:1-39:9, 41:25-42:21.
Plaintiff had disputes with Cooper over operational decisions, such as the time CSRs were to report to work each day, the manner in which CSRs were to highlight agreements, and whether the Sales Department should be handling customer account calls. Def. SMF at ¶ 110; [*27]  Pl. Dep. at 164:8-15. On one occasion on an unspecified date, the Plaintiff told CSR Savannah Carter to "shut the f*ck up, shut the f*ck up, or I will come over and slap you," which resulted in Carter's complaining to Smith about Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 111; Pl. Dep. at 164:3-7; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 67, Att. 22 at 1.
During her deposition, the Plaintiff testified as follows with respect to her FMLA claim:
Q. . . . can you tell me in what way Aaron's interfered with your right to take FMLA leave?
A. When I came back from FMLA, they cut my hours.
Q. Did they interfere with your right to take FMLA leave in any other way?
A. Not that I can recall.
Def. SMF at ¶ 112; Pl. Dep. at 27:14-15.
According to Defendant, it reinstated Plaintiff to 40 hours immediately upon being alerted to the issue and has since paid Plaintiff for all hours that she was not scheduled to work in June 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 113; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-13; 47:17-48:8; Reinert Dec. at ¶ 17. During her deposition, Plaintiff also admitted that she did not "believe that [she was] terminated for having taken a Family and Medical Leave Act leave." Def. SMF at ¶¶ 114-15; Pl. Dep. at 27:17-24. Plaintiff admits that she said that at her [*28]  deposition, but she contends that she was only discussing the two weeks of leave she took in June of 2013 and not any subsequent days she requested off for follow-up medical treatment. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 114-15; Pl. Dep. at 27:6-24.
Aaron's maintains comprehensive anti-discrimination policies that are distributed to all of its associates. Def. SMF at ¶ 116; Pl. Dep. at 85:9-86:11, Ex. 5; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 7. According to Aaron's, it makes good-faith efforts to educate its associates, managers, and Associate Resources personnel on these antidiscrimination policies and the relevant statutory prohibitions. Def. SMF at ¶ 117; Smith Dec. at ¶¶ 4-5; Reinert Dec. at ¶¶ 4-6; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 4-5. It is undisputed that the Associate Resources Manager Scott-Dyer attended trainings regarding Aaron's ADA, FMLA, and EEO policies specifically. Def. SMF at ¶ 118; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 4-5. According to Aaron's, it terminated Plaintiffs prior General Manager "Piper" based on complaints Plaintiff raised about Piper's not treating her appropriately with regard to her restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 119; Smith Dep. at 36:16-37:2, 43:14-24; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 16-17.
Defendant contends that Plaintiff [*29]  made misrepresentations on her job application with Aaron's regarding her reasons for leaving a former employer, LA Fitness. Def. SMF at ¶ 121; Pl. Dep. at 53:22-54:11. Plaintiff stated in her application that she left for "personal reasons," but in her deposition she revealed that she was terminated after she refused to allow a customer to enter the gym. Def. SMF at ¶ 122; Pl. Dep, Ex. 3. Aaron's has terminated former associates for lying on their job applications, which is a violation of the Rules of Conduct policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 123; Reinert Dec. at ¶¶ 24-25. According to Aaron's, had it learned of the Plaintiff's falsification on her job application, that would have resulted in her immediate termination. Def. SMF at ¶ 120; Pl. Dep., Ex. 5; Reinert Dec. at ¶ 26; Smith Dec. at ¶ 48. Plaintiff contends that she "did not divulge the complete back story as to why she left LA Fitness," and further, that Defendant has named only one employee that it allegedly terminated for lying on a job application. Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 121-23; Pl. Dep. at 53-55; Reinert Dec. at ¶¶ 24-25.

Plaintiff's Statement of Facts
Plaintiff contends that the core job duties of Aaron's CSRs concerned sales: in store [*30]  sales, telephone sales, direct marketing, new customer growth and renewal payment processing in the store. Pl. SMF at ¶ 1; Pl. Dep., Ex. 7. The CSR position also requires strong sales skill in the showroom and on the telephone. Pl. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. Dep., Ex. 7. Although the CSR position description states that it requires the ability to lift 50 pounds, the Defendant could provide an accommodation outside of the lifting requirement if a CSR were to get hurt and it was a short-term situation. Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Aaron's Dep. 6/9/16 [65] at 38:1-9.9 Plaintiff contends that CSRs rarely had to lift 50 pounds, and other employees were assigned duties of moving heavy furniture. Pl. SMF at ¶ 8; Pl. Dec. [79-3] at ¶ 4.
A CSR's primary responsibility also involves processing order forms and references, inputting customer information into the store computer for new lease agreements, accepting and processing current customer payments, and updating customer information and account status in the stores computer system. Pl. SMF at ¶ 9; Pl. Dep., Ex. 7. Cooper instructed Plaintiff, however, that no one on the sales team was to deal with customers on the phone or in person that have questions about account [*31]  payments. Pl. SMF at ¶ 10; Scott-Dyer Dec., Def. Ex. 5 [70-7], Att. 18, 1. Instead, Cooper instructed the sales team and all CSRs that their job was to sell. Pl. SMF at ¶ 11; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 18, 1. After Plaintiff complained about Cooper's operational changes, she was told by Scott-Dyer and Smith that this is how Cooper wanted to run the store and she needed to comply. Pl. SMF at ¶ 15; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 14, at 2; Carter Dec. [68-10] at ¶¶ 11,14; Carla Smith Dec. [80-1] at ¶ 3.10
Plaintiff took FMLA leave from June 2, 2013 through June 17, 2013. Pl. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. Dep. at 100:21-23. On June 18, 2013, Plaintiff's doctor released her to return to work. Pl. SMF at ¶ 17; Pl. Dep. at 105:16-18. Upon returning to work, Plaintiff's hours were cut from 40 hours to 32 hours. Pl. SMF at ¶ 18; Pl. Dep. at 47:8-18. In response, Plaintiff complained to Aaron's regional manager Tom Stacks who reinstated her back to a 40-hour work week. Pl. SMF at ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. at 47:19-48:9. After returning from FMLA leave, Plaintiff continued to see doctors for lumbar injections and physical therapy at least once a month. Pl. SMF at ¶ 23; Pl. Dep. at 109:16-24.
Chris Cooper became General Manager of [*32]  the Defendant's Conyers store on October 1, 2013. Pl. SMF at ¶ 24. Plaintiff contends that Cooper was "very hard to work with," and was both "sexist" and "arrogant" towards the CSRs. Pl. SMF at ¶ 24; Carter Dec. at ¶ 4. According to Plaintiff, Cooper would yell at employees in front of customers, would use a sarcastic tone, and showed his disdain through his facial expressions. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 25, 49; Carter Dec. at ¶ 5. Cooper took away employee privileges such as smoking breaks and eventually implemented the rule that employees had to clock out for smoking breaks. Pl. SMF at ¶ 26; Pl. Dep. at 37:15-20; Carter Dec. at ¶ 4; Carla Smith Dec. at ¶ 3. Plaintiff contends that Cooper told Plaintiff and other employees "I'm here regardless of what you think, I'm here, so either get with it or find another job." Pl. SMF at ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. at 202:9-13.
According to Plaintiff, Cooper did not follow her medical restrictions and had her lifting, bending, and filing. Pl. SMF at ¶ 29; Pl. Dep. at 29: 8-14. 30. For example, Cooper asked Plaintiff to move heavy objects such as end tables and heavy rugs. Pl. SMF at ¶ 30; Carter Dec. at ¶ 13. Cooper requested that Plaintiff reach in high areas to dust, [*33]  and had Plaintiff filing for an entire shift which required her to bend and file in a 2-foot-high file cabinet. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 36-37; Pl. Dep. at 30:3-8, 31:7-22. Cooper also had Plaintiff lift a desktop computer that was outside of her restrictions. Pl. SMF at ¶ 32; Pl. Dep. at 29:15-30:1-2. Plaintiff contends that she made Cooper aware of her medical restrictions and informed him several times that bending and reaching aggravated her disability. Pl. SMF at ¶ 34; Pl. Dec. at ¶ 6. Anytime Plaintiff went to the doctor and received paperwork, she would go to work and hand them to Cooper the very next day. Pl. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Dec. at ¶ 7.
On one occasion, a customer asked Plaintiff what was wrong with her and Plaintiff responded that she had a back injury. Pl. SMF at ¶ 38. According to Plaintiff, Cooper then came over and told the customer "she's handicapped. She needs a wheelchair," and the customer responded, "that's not nice." Pl. SMF at ¶ 38; Pl. Dep. at 155:21-156:4. On another occasion on an unspecified date, Cooper also sprayed Lysol in Plaintiff's face. Pl. SMF at ¶ 39; Pl. Dep. at 121:18-19. Plaintiff contends that she told Sandy Scott-Dyer and Todd Smith about these incidents. [*34]  Pl. SMF at ¶ 39; Pl. Dep. at 121:14-122:5. Cooper commented to another employee regarding Plaintiff's absences because of her "procedures" and that he was tired of having to make it work for her. Pl. SMF at ¶ 40; Carla Smith Dec. at ¶ 6. On another occasion, Cooper saw Plaintiff take her medication and said to her, "you really do have a lot of issues." Pl. SMF at ¶ 42; Pl. Dep. at 197:21-25.
In addition to her prior complaints, Plaintiff claims that she also relayed to Scott-Dyer and Smith that Cooper had called her "handicapped" and told Carla Smith to give Plaintiff the neck brace she was wearing because "Plaintiff is the one who actually needs it." Pl. SMF at ¶ 43; Pl. Dep. at 150:8-20. In one of the employee meetings, Cooper discussed Plaintiff's restrictions and told everyone that she could not bend or lift, and that she basically could not do anything. Pl. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. Dep. at 199:16-200:9. Plaintiff contends that, on several occasions, she would go into the office and tell Cooper "my back is killing me" and ask to go home, but Cooper responded by saying "it's an at will company, I can't keep you here if you need to go-go." Pl. SMF at ¶ 50; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 23, at 5.
 [*35] Plaintiff was scheduled to work 9:00 am to 6:00 pm so she could pick up her daughter, but Cooper changed her schedule to 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. Pl. SMF at ¶ 53; Pl. Dep. at 34:24-35:3. Plaintiff also contends that Cooper would "jump in" when Plaintiff was talking to a customer and proceed to close the sale with the customer even when it was Plaintiff's sale. Pl. SMF at ¶ 54; Carter Dec. at ¶ 13; Pl. Dep. at 25:25-26:1-5.
Although all the associates were scheduled to attend the Friday morning meetings at 9:00 am, Plaintiff contends that she was "excluded" from the Friday meeting because Cooper scheduled her to come in after the meeting was over. Pl. SMF at ¶ 55. Pl. Dep. at 26:19-24, 34:1-21. Cooper told Plaintiff the reason he didn't put her on the schedule for the Friday meeting was because he wanted to give her a little rest because of her back issues. Pl. SMF at ¶ 56. Pl. Dep. at 46:8-19. Although Cooper knew that Plaintiff wanted Wednesdays off, he changed the schedule so the Plaintiff did not have Wednesdays off. Pl. SMF at ¶ 57. When questioned by Plaintiff, Cooper stated it would not be fair for her to have every Wednesday off. Pl. SMF at ¶ 57; Pl. Dep. at 144:7-145:1.11 On one occasion, [*36]  when Plaintiff asked Cooper if she could take her medication, Plaintiff claims that Cooper said "let me check the handbook." Pl. SMF at ¶ 59; Pl. Dep. at 26:25-27:1-5; 43:1-16.12
In order to bring attention to Cooper's behavior, Plaintiff contends that she made multiple calls to Regional Manager Todd Smith in order to relay that Cooper was not following her restrictions. Pl. SMF at ¶ 61; Pl. Dep. at 131:1-25 (Plaintiff testified that she had "lots of conversations" with Smith about Cooper's not following her restrictions). Smith responded by asking Plaintiff for a copy of her restrictions, and she told him that she already submitted her medical restrictions when she returned from FMLA leave. Pl. SMF at ¶ 62; Pl. Dep. at 132:24-133:6. Smith told Plaintiff that she would need to provide another copy because they could not find her restrictions. Pl. SMF at ¶ 63; Pl. Dep. at 133:7-13.
Plaintiff also called Scott-Dyer approximately three or four times to complain about Cooper as well. Pl. SMF at ¶ 64; Pl. Dep. at 143:2-10. On October 25, 2013, seven days before her termination, Plaintiff called Scott-Dyer to make multiple complaints about Cooper. Pl. SMF at ¶ 65; Pl. Dep. at 139:22-140:16; [*37]  Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 14. During this conversation, Plaintiff told Scott-Dyer that she still had medical restrictions but Cooper sometimes pushed her beyond what she is able to do. Pl. SMF at ¶ 66. Plaintiff stated she gave Cooper papers from her doctor and he told her he didn't want the papers, and when she tried to give them to him again his response was "what do you want me to do with it?" Pl. SMF at ¶ 66; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 14. Scott-Dyer told Plaintiff not to be confrontational and stated they were going to have to meet. Pl. SMF at ¶ 67; Pl. Dep. at 139:22-140:16.
While Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff complained to Scott-Dyer about Cooper, Defendant contends that, after Plaintiff complained to Smith prior to October 18, 2013, she admitted that Cooper never violated her restrictions again. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 66; Pl. Dep. at 31-32 (Plaintiff testified that Cooper only asked her to move a computer one time, but he stopped after she complained to Smith). Defendant also does not dispute that Scott-Dyer told Plaintiff not to be "confrontational" with Cooper, but contends that Plaintiff's own testimony indicates that was in response to Plaintiff's complaint that Cooper told [*38]  her to leave work early instead of taking a lunch break. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶ 67; Pl. Dep. at 140.
On October 30, 2013, Plaintiff had a meeting with Scott-Dyer, Smith, and Cooper. Pl. SMF at ¶ 68; Pl. Dep. at 149:18-25, 152:1-2; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 16. Plaintiff contends that the purpose of the meeting was to address the issues she was having with Cooper. Pl. SMF at ¶ 68. According to Plaintiff, she told Scott-Dyer and Smith that she could perform the essential functions of the CSR role but she believed that Cooper was trying to make her quit. Pl. SMF at ¶ 69; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 16. Plaintiff contends that Scott-Dyer told her she was being emotional. Pl. SMF at ¶ 70; Pl. Dep. at 152:1-8. Scott-Dyer also said that either Plaintiff or Cooper will go, and more than likely Cooper is not going anywhere. Pl. SMF at ¶ 71; Pl. Dep. at 152:1-8. Plaintiff responded that she is not going anywhere either.13 Pl. SMF at ¶ 72; Pl. Dep. at 152:9-10.
After Scott-Dyer and Smith met with Plaintiff and Cooper, the next day, October 31, 2013, Plaintiff called Smith to inform him that Cooper refused to help her sell a camera that had no price, and Smith responded by saying he would take care of it and [*39]  talk to Cooper. Pl. SMF at ¶ 73; Pl. Dep. at 167:11-18. After returning from lunch, Plaintiff asked to speak to Cooper in private, and Cooper responded by saying he would not talk to Plaintiff in private because he needed a witness. Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 74-75; Pl. Dep. at 169:8-14. Plaintiff responded by saying "you know what? Chris, just be a man and tell me what your problem is with me." Pl. SMF at ¶ 76; Pl. Dep. at 169:15-19. During this exchange, Plaintiff contends that she was not yelling at Cooper, but he was shouting and yelling at her in front of customers who were in the store. Pl. SMF at ¶ 77; Pl. Dep. at 169:20; Carter Dec. at ¶ 15; Carla Smith Dec. at ¶ 4.
After this conversation, Plaintiff contends that Cooper sent her home for the rest of the day. Pl. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. Dep. at 171:1-4 (Plaintiff testified "I think he sent me home. I can't even remember. I think he sent me home that day too."); Pl. Dep. at 173:20 (Plaintiff also testified, "[h]e just told me to go home."). Before leaving, Plaintiff asked Cooper if she was fired and he responded, "it's at will" and "I'll let you know if you can come in tomorrow." Pl. SMF at ¶ 79; Pl. Dep. at 173:18-23. According to Plaintiff, Cooper [*40]  stated to the remaining employees that Plaintiff did not know how to do her job and then called Scott-Dyer. Pl. SMF at ¶ 80; Pl. Dep. at 173:3-6; Carter Dec. at ¶ 15; Carla Smith Dec. at ¶ 4. Plaintiff called Cooper to find out if she should report to work on November 1, 2013, and Cooper responded by telling her to come in. Pl. SMF at ¶ 82; Pl. Dep. at 174:1-5.
Plaintiff contends that, at approximately 10:00 am on November 1, 2013, Plaintiff called Scott-Dyer to discuss an incident between her and Cooper regarding a customer with Falcons tickets and how they just had a meeting about her problems with Cooper two days prior. Pl. SMF at ¶ 85. According to Plaintiff, she asked Scott-Dyer if she needs to take further action and call the EEOC, and Scott-Dyer said, "Don't worry about it, Rosana. Let me talk to Todd Smith and we'll get this squared away." Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 85-86; Pl. Dep. at 178:8-179:8. According to Defendant, Scott-Dyer denies that this conversation ever took place, and further, her telephone records indicate that she did not receive a telephone call from the store until 16:22. Def. Resp. SMF at ¶¶ 85-86; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 44; Reinert Dec. at ¶ 9.
Also on November 1, 2013, [*41]  Plaintiff reported to work, worked a full shift, and at the end of her shift, Cooper called her into the closing room. Pl. SMF at ¶ 84; Pl. Dep. at 177:14-21. At around 7:30 p.m., Cooper asked Plaintiff to vacuum the store, and after she was finished Cooper told her to clock out and stated he needed to speak with her. Pl. SMF at ¶ 87; Pl. Dep. at 182:12-16. After Plaintiff clocked out, she waited for Cooper for thirty minutes, and then he took her into the closing room and told her Aaron's was terminating her. Pl. SMF at ¶ 88. Plaintiff contends that Cooper showed her a paper on which she could see the words "customer complaints." Pl. SMF at ¶ 88; Pl. Dep. at 182:12-24. Plaintiff then asked Cooper which customer complained but he stated, "that's not important."14 Pl. SMF at ¶ 90; Pl. Dep. at 183:5-9.
As Plaintiff attempted to read the paper, Cooper kept pulling the paper further and further away from Plaintiff so she could not read it. Pl. SMF at ¶ 90; Pl. Dep. at 182:23-183:4. Because Cooper was not letting Plaintiff read the paper she stated, "you know what? I don't even care what it says. That's fine," and asked Cooper for a copy, but he said that she could not have a copy if she did [*42]  not sign it. Pl. SMF at ¶ 91; Pl. Dep. at 183:5-9. Plaintiff replied that she would not sign if she could not read the document. Pl. SMF at ¶ 92; Pl. Dep. at 186:24-187:1. The document that Cooper showed to Plaintiff also had Cooper's signature on it. Pl. SMF at ¶ 93; Pl. Dep. at 186:24-187:1. The termination document provided to Plaintiff in her deposition did not have Cooper's signature on it, nor was it the document that Cooper was holding the day she was terminated. Pl. SMF at ¶ 94; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 24, 2; Pl. Dep. at 185:10-186:3, 186:22-187:2.
After Aaron's terminated Plaintiff's employment, Scott-Dyer took statements from the employees regarding the events that took place on October 31, 2013. Pl. SMF at ¶ 95; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 18-23. When Plaintiff left the store on October 31, 2013, no one from Aaron's ever called Plaintiff or asked her what happened. Pl. SMF at ¶ 96; Pl. Dec. at ¶ 12. One month after Plaintiff's termination, Cooper's statement was taken on December 2, 2013. Pl. SMF at ¶ 97; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 18. Carla Smith's statement was taken on November 15, 2013, and then again on January 2, 2014. Pl. SMF at ¶ 98; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 19, 20. Savannah Carter's [*43]  statement was taken on November 13, 2013, and then again on January 2, 2014. Pl. SMF at ¶ 99; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 21, 22. Although Jessica Fragacano was not working on October 31, 2013, her statement was taken on January 3, 2014. Pl. SMF at ¶ 100; Scott-Dyer Dec., Att. 24.
Plaintiff also contends that Cooper asked Carla Smith to change her statement and when she declined, Cooper did not turn her statement in.15 Pl. SMF at ¶ 101; Carla Smith Dec. at ¶ 5. According to Plaintiff, Cooper also asked Savannah Carter to write things that were untrue in her statement, such as Plaintiff was the one who started the situation and yelled at him, and that Plaintiff started this situation out of the blue. Pl. SMF at ¶ 102; Carter Dec. at ¶ 17. Plaintiff contends that, when Carter refused, Cooper stated that it did not matter what she wrote because it would be his and Carla Smith's word against hers. Pl. SMF at ¶ 102; Carter Dec. at ¶ 17. Plaintiff further contends that, although Carter had made multiple complaints to both managers and HR about Cooper's treatment of Plaintiff before the October 31, 2013 incident, she was not interviewed by anyone about these claims until Plaintiff was terminated. [*44]  Pl. SMF at ¶ 103; Carter Dec. at ¶ 19. Generally, if an employee complains about a manager before she is terminated, ideally Aaron's would have someone else involved in the termination of that employee. Pl. SMF at ¶ 104; Aaron's Dep. 6/27/16 [66] at 154:15-20.
Although Smith's resume contained start times and date times which were different from what was put on his employment application with Aaron's, he was not aware of anyone who has had any kind of employment action taken against them for discrepancies in their resume or applications while he has been employed at Aaron's. Pl. SMF at ¶ 106; Aaron's Dep. 5/4/16 at 30:17-31:9, 32:14-18.
Plaintiff contends that the Department of Labor found that she was terminated when her employer received complaints from customers. Pl. SMF at ¶ 106; Farahany Dec. [79-4] at ¶ 4, Att. 2 [79-4, at 81]. Plaintiff further contends that "[it] was reported to the EEOC that Plaintiff was terminated for poor performance," although the Plaintiff's cited record evidence does not support that allegation. Pl. SMF at ¶ 108; Farahany Dec. at ¶ 3, Att. 1 [79-4 at 7] (Aaron's statement to the EEOC dated August 7, 2014, states that "Charging Party's employment was [*45]  terminated on November 1, 2014 [sic] because she engaged in inappropriate behavior."). On March 17, 2013, Plaintiff received a performance review which gave her score of 2.8, but she claims that this number was incorrect as Piper changed the numbers on the evaluation when he reviewed it with Plaintiff and asked for her input. Pl. SMF at ¶ 109; Pl. Dep. at 114:7-115:7. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant also reported to the EEOC that Plaintiff was terminated for engaging in inappropriate behavior, which was disruptive to the operations of the store.16 Pl. SMF at ¶ 110; Farahany Dec. at ¶ 3, Att. 1.
After the filing of her complaint, on June 17, 2016, Defendant's counsel sent Plaintiff's counsel a letter with a check enclosed as payment for the hours that Plaintiff was not scheduled for when she returned from FMLA leave. Pl. SMF at ¶ 111; Farahany Dec. at ¶ 3, Att. 5. Plaintiff contends that this payment only reflected payment for actual hours, without interest, liquidated damages or attorney's fees. Pl. SMF at ¶ 111; Farahany Dec. at ¶ 3, Att. 5.
B. DISCUSSION
1. Defendant's Evidentiary Objections
On October 27, 2016, the same day Aaron's filed its Reply in Support of its Motion [*46]  for Summary Judgment [86], Aaron's also filed its "Notice of Objections to Declarations Filed by Plaintiff in Support of Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment" [87-1] ("Objection"). Defendant states that it objects to the Court's consideration of the Declarations of David Piper, Savannah Carter, and Carla Smith filed by the Plaintiff in connection with her Motion for Summary Judgment [68] and her response to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [79], on the ground that Plaintiff failed to comply with Rule 26 in providing the timely disclosure of the witnesses. Objection at 1-2; see Piper Dec. [68-8]; Carter Dec. [68-10]; Carla Smith Dec. [80-1].
According to Defendant, Plaintiff failed to provide timely disclosure of either Carter or Piper during the discovery period, and under Rule 37, the consequence of that failure is automatic exclusion of those witnesses. Defendant contends that Plaintiff "attempted to skirt her witness disclosure obligations under Rule 26 by surprising Aaron's with 23 newly identified witnesses in her Supplemental Initial Disclosures after the close of the main discovery period, including Carter and Piper." Objection at 2 (emphasis in original). Defendant further [*47]  contends that Plaintiff failed to disclose the Declarations from Carter and Piper by withholding them for six weeks and two months respectively, "so as to surprise Aaron's with them after the close of discovery and just before the filing of Motions for Summary Judgment." Id. Although Piper's Declaration is dated May 26, 2016, and Carter's Declaration is dated June 13, 2016, the Plaintiff failed to produce either Declaration to the Defendant until July 26, 2016. Id. at 6. Defendant also claims that the Declarations of both Carter and Piper contain inadmissible hearsay that should be excluded by the Court. Id. at 14.
Defendant also argues that the Court should not consider paragraphs four through seven of Carla Smith's Declaration because those paragraphs contain inadmissible hearsay and information that is lacking a proper foundation. Id. at 3.
Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part:
(e) Supplementing Disclosures and Responses.
(1) In General. A party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission—must supplement or correct its disclosure or response:
(A) In a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response [*48]  is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing . . . .
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(1)(A).
The Plaintiff has failed to file any response to the Defendant's Objection. Consequently, she has not refuted the Defendant's contentions that she did not timely disclose the identities of Carter or Piper, or timely produce to Defendant the Declarations of Carter or Piper. Moreover, the record on its face supports Defendant's objection. Although Plaintiff presumably obtained these Declarations many weeks beforehand as they were executed, Plaintiff did not disclose the identity of these witnesses until the very last day of a limited extended discovery period, thereby depriving Defendant any chance to depose these witnesses. This timing plainly frustrates the purpose of having required initial disclosures. The Court thus finds that the Defendant has established that the Plaintiff failed to meet her obligations under Rule 26(e)(1)(A) to supplement her discovery responses regarding the identity of these witnesses and the information contained in their Declarations. Accordingly, because the Plaintiff has failed to dispute the [*49]  Defendant's contentions, the Defendant's Objection on the ground of untimeliness is SUSTAINED.
Furthermore, although the Court has included some of Plaintiff's factual allegations based on these Declarations, the Court notes that, even if it considered the information in those Declarations, for the reasons discussed infra, the Defendant would still be entitled to summary judgment. In addition, as the Defendant argues, evidence which would be inadmissible hearsay at trial may not be considered by the Court on a motion for summary judgment. Macuba v. DeBoer, 193 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Fed.R.Evid. 801 ("'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted."). In the facts section above, the Court has noted some of the Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's factual allegations based on hearsay and lack of a foundation. Because the Defendant has made numerous evidentiary objections on various grounds, the Court has not ruled on every specific objection, but has noted Defendant's objections in the facts section above when necessary regarding a disputed material fact.
2. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is authorized when [*50]  "the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 175, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Bingham, Ltd. v. United States, 724 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir. 1984). The movant carries this burden by showing the court that there is "an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In making its determination, the court must view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
Once the moving party has adequately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The nonmoving party is required "to go beyond the pleadings" and to present competent evidence designating "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324. Generally, "[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence" supporting the nonmoving party's case is insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986).
When considering motions for summary judgment, the court does not make decisions [*51]  as to the merits of disputed factual issues. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249; Ryder Int'l Corp. v. First American Nat'l Bank, 943 F.2d 1521, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991). Rather, the court only determines whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried. Applicable substantive law identifies those facts that are material and those that are irrelevant. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. Disputed facts that do not resolve or affect the outcome of a suit will not properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Id.
If a fact is found to be material, the court must also consider the genuineness of the alleged factual dispute. Id. An issue is not genuine if it is unsupported by evidence, or if it is created by evidence that is "merely colorable" or is "not significantly probative." Id. at 250. A dispute is genuine "if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 242. Moreover, for factual issues to be genuine, they must have a real basis in the record. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 587. The nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'" Id. at 587 (quoting First Nat'l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S. Ct. 1575, 20 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1968)). Thus, the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for a directed [*52]  verdict: "whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 259.
3. Plaintiff's Claims
In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts multiple claims against Defendant. She alleges that she is a qualified individual with a disability and that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, and retaliated against her for opposing discrimination, in violation of the ADA. Plaintiff also asserts claims against Defendant for interference and retaliation under the FMLA, and asserts a claim for relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2). The Court will first address Plaintiff's claims under the ADA, then her claims under the FMLA, and finally, her claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
a. ADA Claims
In the Complaint, Plaintiff has asserted two separate claims against Aaron's under the ADA. Comp. [1] at ¶¶ 27-38. In Count I, she asserts a claim for discrimination in violation of the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 27-34. In Count II, she asserts a claim for retaliation in violation of the ADA. Id. at ¶¶ 35-38.
(1) Standards of Proof under the ADA
The ADA was "designed to prohibit discrimination [*53]  against disabled persons and enable those persons 'to compete in the workplace and the job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). Title I of the ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.").
In general, the burden of proof for a claim of disability discrimination under the ADA is based [*54]  on the framework established by the Supreme Court for Title VII employment discrimination cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (McDonnell Douglas framework generally applies to disability discrimination claims under the ADA). Under this framework, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, a plaintiff may establish a claim under the ADA by first presenting a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence of discrimination under the same burden shifting analysis used in Title VII employment discrimination cases. Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1242; see also Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999). If a plaintiff is able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability, the burden would shift to the defendant to show a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action, such as termination. See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., 369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004). The burden would then shift back to the plaintiff to "demonstrate that the defendant's articulated reason for the adverse employment action is a mere pretext for discrimination." Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1997).
For those cases in which an employee claims that an employer violated the ADA by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee's disability, however, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting framework does [*55]  not apply. Nadler v. Harvey, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *9 (11th Cir. August 24, 2007) ("An employer must reasonably accommodate an otherwise qualified employee with a known disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship in the operation of the business. . . . Thus, applying McDonnell Douglas to reasonable accommodation cases would be superfluous, since there is no need to prove discriminatory motivation.") (emphasis in original); see also Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) (in an ADA failure to accommodate case, there are no additional burdens on defendant to show that it had a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating plaintiff or on plaintiff to establish that defendant's proffered reasons were pretextual); Jones v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22142, 2008 WL 779326, *6 (N.D. Ga. March 18, 2008) ("The Eleventh Circuit came to the logical conclusion that the McDonnell Douglas test does not apply to reasonable accommodation claims in [Nadler], but it inexplicably did not publish the opinion and provide trial courts with a clear answer to this previously unaddressed issue.").
(2) Discrimination Claim
In Count I of the Complaint, the Plaintiff asserts a claim for discrimination under the ADA. Comp. [1] at ¶¶ 27-34. Plaintiff alleges that she "suffered from a disability that substantially limited her in major life activities, including but not limited [*56]  to lifting and standing." Id. at ¶ 28. She further alleges that she was a qualified person under the ADA because she was capable, with or without reasonable accommodation, of performing the essential functions of her job. Id. at ¶ 30. She alleges that Defendant's actions in subjecting her "to different terms and conditions of her employment, by inter alia, terminating her constitute unlawful discrimination on the basis of her disability in violation of the ADA." Id. at ¶ 31.
(a) Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
In order to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she: (1) has a disability as defined in the ADA, (2) is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job she holds; and (3) was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Witter v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 138 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). In addition, a plaintiff must present evidence establishing that her employer had either actual or constructive knowledge of her alleged disability or considered her to be disabled. See Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910-911 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447-48 (11th Cir. 1996).
The first prima facie element requires the Plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined [*57]  under the ADA. The relevant provision of the ADA defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA") amended the ADA in 2008 to further provide that, for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B).17
The ADA, as amended by the ADAAA, provides that "[t]he definition of disability in this Act shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(A). Thus, it is clear that a major purpose of the ADAAA was to amend the ADA to make it easier for plaintiffs to establish that a serious medical condition, such as cancer, is covered as a disability under the ADA. "[B]y enacting the ADAAA in 2008, Congress eased in part the evidentiary burden on ADA plaintiffs," and "announced that 'the question of whether an individual's [*58]  impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.'" Vaughan v. World Changers Church Int'l, Inc., No. l:13-CV-0746-AT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 16, 2014) (Totenberg, J.) (quoting Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014)); see also Coker v. Enhanced Senior Living, Inc., 897 F.Supp.2d 1366, 1374 (N.D.Ga.2012) (Story, J.) ("The ADAAA amended the ADA to, among other things, promulgate a more liberal standard of the term 'disabled,' making it significantly easier for a plaintiff to show disability." (internal quotation omitted)).
Indeed, the regulations implementing the ADAAA state that:
The term "substantially limits" shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. "Substantially limits" is not meant to be a demanding standard. . . .
The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether an individual's impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i) and (iii).
Under this more lenient standard, a court should consider whether an impairment "substantially limits the ability of [*59]  an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." 29 C.F.R.§ 1630.2(j)(ii). Further, an episodic impairment may be a disability under the ADA "if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active." 42 U.S.C. 12102(4)(D). Even temporary impairments lasting less than six months can be substantially limiting within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A). 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ix). But despite this more relaxed standard, not every medical condition or impairment will constitute a disability with the meaning of the ADA. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(ii); see also Vaughan, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439, at *9.
In this case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA because, it argues, she has failed to present sufficient evidence that she suffered from a disability under the ADA, or that Aaron's regarded her as having a disability. Def. Br. [70-1] at 16-17. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff's allegation that she had vague "back issues" does not constitute a disability under the ADA because the Plaintiff has not cited to any admissible record evidence that she was significantly limited in a major life activity. At most, Defendant argues, Plaintiff had some temporary restrictions on lifting heavy objects, but that [*60]  temporary restriction did not constitute a disability under the ADA. See Vaughan, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439, at *10 (a plaintiff who was diagnosed with cervical sprain/strain, a lumbar sprain/strain, muscle spasms, and an ankle sprain who had temporary medical restrictions did not present sufficient evidence to establish that she had a disability under the ADA); see also Flieger v. E. Suffolk Boces, No. 13-CV-6282(JS)(GRB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81987, at *28 (E.D.N.Y. June 23, 2016) (finding plaintiff's back injury did not constitute a disability under ADA).
Significantly, Plaintiff did not include any factual allegations supporting her claim that she had a disability in her Statement of Facts. Plaintiff alleges only that she took FMLA leave from June 2, 2013 through June 17, 2013. Pl. SMF at ¶ 16; Pl. Dep. at 100:21-23. Plaintiff contends that, after returning from FMLA leave, she continued to see doctors for lumbar injections and physical therapy at least once a month. Pl. SMF at ¶ 23; Pl. Dep. at 109:16-24. She also contends that, on one occasion on an unspecified date, a customer asked Plaintiff what was wrong with her and Plaintiff responded that she had a back injury. Pl. SMF at ¶ 38. But Plaintiff does not include any facts supporting her claim that she was diagnosed with any serious [*61]  medical condition that substantially limited her in a major life activity.
Although the Plaintiff fails to include any factual allegations about her alleged disability in her Statement of Facts, in her brief, she contends that, in June of 2013, she was diagnosed with "quadratus lumborum myofascial pain." Pl. Br. [79] at 3.18 As noted above, the Court cannot consider any facts asserted only in the party's brief and not the statement of facts. See LR 56.1(B), NDGa ("The court will not consider any fact: . . . (d) set out only in the brief and not in the movant's [or respondent's] statement of undisputed facts."). Nevertheless, even if the Court considered the Plaintiff's allegation that she was diagnosed with "quadratus lumborum myofascial pain," that diagnosis by itself cannot establish that Plaintiff was a person with a disability as defined under the ADA, without evidence that she was substantially limited in a major life activity.
As Judge Totenberg explained in a similar case, in which she found that a plaintiff claiming disability discrimination under the ADA did not demonstrate that her back pain was disabling under the ADA:
The Court recognizes that an ADA plaintiff does not necessarily [*62]  need medical evidence to substantiate her disability assertions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(v). But in this case, given the conclusory nature of her own affidavit, and vague nature of her deposition testimony, without additional clarity from, for example, a medical professional regarding the specific pain her medical condition caused and the limitations on major life activities resulting from the condition and pain, a jury has no evidence from which to infer that Vaughan's condition was substantial. C.f. Barlow v. Walgreen Co., No. 8:11-cv-71-T-30EAJ, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34026, 2012 WL 868807, at *4 (M.D.Fla. Mar. 14, 2012) (holding that plaintiff's specific contention that her "impairments of spinal stenosis, cervical disc disease, neural foraminal stenosis, and cervical radiculopathy, substantially limit her major life activity of the operation of her musculoskeletal system" and in particular caused great difficulty in lifting relatively light objects and great difficulty crouching for more than short periods of time, was sufficient to establish that she qualifies as disabled under the ADAAA); Harty v. City of Sanford, No. 6:11-cv-1041-Orl-31KRS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111121, 2012 WL 3243282, at *4 (M.D.Fla. Aug. 8, 2012) (holding that the record contained sufficient evidence to prove disability under the ADAAA based on evidence that the Veterans Administration [*63]  assigned the plaintiff a disability rating of 40% and two physicians stated that the plaintiff was permanently restricted from squatting, using stairs, kneeling, running or jumping).
Vaughan, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141912, 2014 WL 4978439, at *10; see also Poper v. SCA Americas, Inc., No. 10-3201, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113653, 2012 WL 3288111, at *8-9 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 13, 2012) (holding that the plaintiff's unspecific testimony regarding her disability "standing alone is not enough to overcome contradictory medical documentation and a general absence of supporting evidence" and concluding that the plaintiff was not disabled under the ADA).
In response to the Defendant's argument that she was not disabled under the ADA, the Plaintiff argues that her "quadratus lumborum myofascial pain" substantially limits her ability to "lift weights or perform manual tasks including everyday activities such as walking long distances, standing, bending, lifting and twisting." Pl. Br. [79] at 14. Again, the Plaintiff has not cited to any admissible record evidence in support of that allegation, and cites only to a website. See id. Plaintiff has not cited to record evidence indicating that her condition actually limited her in all of those life activities.
Nevertheless, the undisputed evidence reflects that, when Plaintiff returned to work after her FMLA leave on June 18, 2013, she submitted [*64]  a medical release to return to work with restrictions on not lifting more than ten pounds and not standing for more than twenty minutes. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 6, 95; Pl. Dep. at 105:16-23, Ex. 15; Scott-Dyer Dec., Def. Ex. 5 [70-7], at ¶¶ 23, 63, Att. 12, 28. Thus, under the more inclusive standards under the ADAAA, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to, at a minimum, create a genuine issue of material fact whether she was substantially limited in a major life activity. For that reason, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish the first element of her prima facie case of disability discrimination, that she was disabled under the ADA.
Plaintiff argues further that, even if she were not disabled, she can establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because Aaron's "perceived" her as being disabled. Pl. Br. at 21-23; see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(C). The ADA protects not only individuals with actual disabilities, but also individuals who are wrongfully perceived as having disabilities. See School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987). Such protections were "intended to combat the effects of archaic attitudes, erroneous perceptions, and myths that have the effect of disadvantaging [*65]  persons with, or regarded as having, disabilities." Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 913 (11th Cir. 1996).
To establish that an employer "regarded" an employee as disabled, a plaintiff must first present evidence that the employer regarded her as having a permanent or long-term impairment. Sutton v. Lader, 185 F.3d 1203, 1209 (11th Cir. 1999); Gordon, 100 F.3d at 912-913. The Supreme Court has further limited claims based on an employer's "perception" of a disability to those circumstances when an employer mistakenly believes that an employee has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, even if there is no factual basis for that perception. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 2149, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999); Williams, 303 F.3d at 1290. As with actual impairments, however, the perceived impairment must be one that, if real, would substantially limit a major life activity of the individual. See Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir. 1999).
In support of her argument that Aaron's "perceived" her as disabled, the Plaintiff cites to "Cooper's repeated derogatory comments regarding Plaintiff's disability," and contends that those comments "demonstrate not only that he perceived or regarded her as disabled but show his disdain for her condition." Pl. Br. [79] at 22-23. In her brief, Plaintiff does not explain which specific comments Cooper allegedly made that indicated that he "perceived" her as being disabled. A [*66]  review of Plaintiff's factual allegations suggests the following comments: On one occasion, a customer asked Plaintiff what was wrong with her and Plaintiff responded that she had a back injury. Pl. SMF at ¶ 38. According to Plaintiff, Cooper then came over and told the customer "she's handicapped. She needs a wheelchair." Pl. SMF at ¶ 38; Pl. Dep. at 155:21-156:4. On another occasion, Cooper saw Plaintiff take her medication and said to her, "you really do have a lot of issues." Pl. SMF at ¶ 42; Pl. Dep. at 197:21-25. Plaintiff also claims that she also told Scott-Dyer and Smith that Cooper had called her "handicapped" and told Carla Smith to give Plaintiff the neck brace she was wearing because "Plaintiff is the one who actually needs it." Pl. SMF at ¶ 43; Pl. Dep. at 150:8-20. In one of the employee meetings, Cooper discussed Plaintiff's restrictions and told everyone that she could not bend or lift, and that she basically could not do anything. Pl. SMF at ¶ 44; Pl. Dep. at 199:16-200:9.
In response to the Plaintiff's argument that Aaron's "perceived" her as being disabled, the Defendant argues that many of the statements allegedly made by Cooper suggest that he did not view her [*67]  as disabled at all, and instead perceived that she should be able to perform the same job duties that other employees are required to perform. Def. Reply Br. [86] at 12-13. The Defendant points to several statements that Plaintiff claims that Cooper made to her: "you need to get up and do something," "your problem is not that big of a deal," and "I don't know why you always have to sit down." See Pl. Br. at 6.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Aaron's "perceived" her as disabled, or regarded her as disabled. Although Defendant argues that Cooper's comments indicate that he did not view her as disabled at all, and instead perceived that she should be able to perform the same job duties that other employees are required to perform, the Court must view all inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. She has presented evidence that Cooper actually called her "handicapped," and said that she "needs a wheelchair." Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether [*68]  Aaron's perceived her as having a disability under the ADA.
Defendant argues further that, even if Plaintiff's "back issues" could be considered a disability under the ADA, or she was perceived as having a disability, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination because the evidence shows that Plaintiff was not a qualified individual under the ADA, and further, that Plaintiff was not discriminated against on the basis of any alleged disability.
The second element of the prima facie case requires the Plaintiff to establish that she is a "qualified individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).
"Accordingly, an ADA [*69]  plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "Courts consider the employer's judgment regarding whether a function is essential, as well as (1) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, (2) the consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function, (3) the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement, (4) the work experience of individuals who held the job in the past, and (5) the work experience of individuals currently in similar jobs." Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927-28 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007)). If a plaintiff cannot perform an essential function of his or her job, even with a reasonable accommodation, then he or she is not a "qualified individual" and is unable to establish a prima facie case. See Davis v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). Moreover, "[a]n employee's ability to handle reasonably necessary stress and work reasonably well with others are essential functions of any position." Williams v. Motorola, Inc., 303 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). "Absence of such skills prevents the employee from being 'otherwise qualified.'" Id. at 1290-91.
Defendant argues that the undisputed [*70]  evidence establishes that Plaintiff is not a qualified individual because she could not perform the essential functions of the CSR position. In particular, Defendant argues that the Plaintiff could not perform the job requirements of a CSR, which include assisting customers on the showroom floor, maintaining the appearance and organization of the showroom by cleaning, organizing, merchandising, and pricing, as well as any other tasks as assigned by management. Def. SMF at ¶ 2; Pl. Dep. at 92:5-93:12, Ex. 7. It is undisputed that the job description also provides that CSRs must be able to lift 50 pounds. Def. SMF at ¶ 3; Pl. Dep. at 92:5-93:12, Ex. 7. Plaintiff admits that the job description accurately describes her prior position as a CSR. Def. SMF at ¶ 4 Pl. Dep. at 93:1-4, 93:9-12.
In response, the Plaintiff argues that she could perform the essential functions of her CSR job even with her alleged disability "with reasonable accommodations such as being permitted to sit rather than stand for extended periods of time, not being required to lift more than 5 pounds and not being required to do other nominal tasks that affected her disability such as bending for long periods or having [*71]  to reach over her head." Pl. Br. at 17. She argues further that she could perform the essential functions that are stated in Defendant's job description, which includes "Major emphasis on in-store sales, telephone sales, direct marketing, new customer growth and renewal payment processing in the store." Id. at 18. Plaintiff has also presented evidence that, although the CSR position description states that it requires the ability to lift 50 pounds, Aaron's could provide an accommodation outside of the lifting requirement if a CSR were to get hurt and it was a short-term situation. Pl. SMF at ¶ 6; Aaron's Dep. 6/9/16 [65] at 38:1-9. According to Plaintiff, CSRs rarely had to lift 50 pounds, and other employees were assigned duties of moving heavy furniture. Pl. SMF at ¶ 8; Pl. Dec. [79-3] at ¶ 4.
The Eleventh Circuit follows a two-step approach to determining when a disabled person is otherwise qualified. Reed v. Heil Co., 206 F.3d 1055, 1062 (11th Cir. 2000). First, the court determines whether the person has the requisite qualifications for the positions, such as sufficient experience and skills, education, and any appropriate licenses. Id. Second, the court assesses whether the person can perform the essential functions of the job in question, [*72]  either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id. Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the employment position and do not include marginal functions. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001); Frix v. Fla. Tile Indus., Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1027, 1034 (N.D. Ga. 1997); Sidaris v. Runyon, 967 F. Supp. 1260, 1266 (M.D. Ala. 1997). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes: (1) the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential; (2) written job descriptions; (3) the amount of time spent performing the particular function; and (4) the consequences of not requiring the job holder to perform the function. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000); Frix, 970 F. Supp. at 1034.
In determining what functions of a given job are deemed to be essential, "consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment . . . and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); see also Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1258; Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. The regulations also state three factors that make it more likely that a specific duty is an essential function of the job: (1) the reason the position exists is to perform the function; (2) there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; [*73]  and (3) the function is highly specialized so that the person holding the position was hired for his or her ability to perform the particular function. See Holbrook, 112 F.3d at 1526 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(2)(i)-(iii)).
It is not enough for an employer to merely label a function essential; the employer must instead actually require employees in the position at issue to perform those functions that the employer claims are essential to the position. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n); see also Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266. Performing essential functions means that an employee is "able to perform those functions without risk of serious physical harm to oneself or others." Sidaris, 967 F. Supp. at 1266 (citing Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, 2 F.3d 1112, 1126 (11th Cir. 1993)). If a plaintiff cannot perform the essential functions of her position without a reasonable accommodation, she must make a prima facie showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible, and that such an accommodation would enable her to perform those essential functions. See Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56.
Upon a review of the facts and evidence in the record, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she could perform the essential functions of the CSR position, at least with a reasonable accommodation.
The Court perceives an issue of fact as to what the "essential" [*74]  duties of the CSR position were and whether Plaintiff could perform them, even though she was limited in her ability to lift more than ten pounds. At a minimum, Plaintiff presents evidence to suggest that lifting was rarely required in this position and that plenty of personnel were available to assist on the rare occasion requiring lifting. See Pl. SMF at ¶ 8; Pl. Dec. [79-3] at ¶ 4. The Eleventh Circuit has noted that whether job functions are essential is "evaluated on a case-by-case basis by examining a number of factors," and has favorably cited authority stating that this issue is "'typically not suitable for resolution on a motion for summary judgment.'" Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting Keith v. Cnty. of Oakland, 703 F.3d 918, 926 (6th Cir. 2013)); see also Jernigan v. BellSouth Telecomms., LLC, 17 F. Supp. 3d 1317, 1322-23 (N.D. Ga. 2014). Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate on this issue.
The third and final element of the Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient evidence to establish that she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff must show that she suffered an adverse employment action and that her disability was the determining factor in her termination. Haines v. Cherokee County, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71544, 2010 WL 2821853, at *16 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010). The ADA requires that the Plaintiff show that her disability was the "but for" cause of the adverse action. McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir. 1996). Thus, [*75]  a "plaintiff complaining of discriminatory discharge under the ADA must show that his or her employer would not have fired him but for his actual or perceived disability." Savage v. Secure First Credit Union, 107 F. Supp. 3d 1212, 1217 (N.D. Ala. 2015). Further, once a defendant articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination, Plaintiff must show that the reason is pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. See Cusick v. Yellowbook, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30896, 2014 WL 949947 at *3 (N.D.Ga. Mar. 11, 2014).
In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability by subjecting her "to different terms and conditions of her employment, by inter alia, terminating her," and that the Defendant's actions "constitute unlawful discrimination on the basis of her disability in violation of the ADA." Comp. at ¶ 31. Thus, it is clear that Plaintiff is alleging that the Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability when it terminated her employment. Although Plaintiff did not assert a specific claim based on the Defendant's failure to provide her with a "reasonable accommodation," Plaintiff argues in her brief that Defendant's failure to provide her with a reasonable accommodation was another act of discrimination against her. Pl. Br. [79] at 18-20.
To show discrimination [*76]  based on a failure-to-accommodate, Plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she is disabled; (2) she was a "qualified individual" when she suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) that she was discriminated against because of her disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow her to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cnty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). As discussed above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether she is disabled under the ADA. Defendant argues that, even if she had done so, she has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on a failure to accommodate, because, even if she had asserted any such claim in her Complaint, that claim is time-barred under the ADA. Def. Br. [70-1] at 14-15.
Before a plaintiff may pursue any claim of employment discrimination under the ADA, she first must exhaust the administrative remedies required by filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC. See Zillyette v. Capital One Financial Corp., 179 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) ("It is settled law that, under the ADA, plaintiffs must comply with the same procedural requirements to sue as exist under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a))). A plaintiff must file an EEOC charge [*77]  within 180 days of the allegedly unlawful employment practice in order to later bring suit under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a).
In this case, it is undisputed that Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination against Aaron's with the EEOC on April 22, 2014. Def. SMF at ¶ 90; Smith Dec. at ¶ 50, Ex. E. Thus, Defendant argues, any claim based on any actions that occurred prior to October 23, 2013,19 outside of the 180-day window prior to her filing an EEOC charge, is time-barred under the ADA. Def. Br. at 14. According to Defendant, Plaintiff has not cited to any admissible evidence that Cooper, or anyone else at Aaron's, failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability at any time after October 23, 2013. Id. at 14-15.
In response, Plaintiff argues that "[d]espite Plaintiff reporting Cooper violating her medical restrictions it continued until her termination, or least October 25, 2013." Pl. Br. at 5. But Plaintiff has not cited to any specific action that Cooper allegedly took that violated her medical restrictions after October 23, 2013. It is undisputed that, prior to October 18, 2013, Plaintiff complained to Smith about Cooper's failure to follow her medical restrictions. Def. SMF at ¶ 91; Pl. Dep. at 131:9-13. [*78]  Although Plaintiff complained about Cooper requiring her to lift her arms over her head, she has not shown that she had any restrictions about lifting her arms over her head, only lifting heavy objects. According to Defendant, the only task that Cooper allegedly asked her to perform that violated her actual medical restrictions was to lift a computer. Def. SMF at ¶ 92; Pl. Dep. at 29:15-17. Plaintiff admits that it only occurred on one occasion and that it never occurred again after she talked to Smith. Def. SMF at ¶ 93; Pl. Dep. at 31:23-32:5 (Plaintiff testified that Cooper asked her to move a computer on one occasion, and he did not ask her to do so after she complained to Smith).
The Court thus agrees with Defendant that any claim of disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate is time-barred under the ADA. Nevertheless, Defendant does not argue that the Plaintiff's claim based on her termination, which occurred on November 1, 2013, is time-barred. Defendant argues, however, that Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because the "record evidence is devoid of any support for the theory that Jones' termination had anything to do [*79]  with any alleged disability." Def. Br. at 19.
As discussed above, the third and final element of the Plaintiff's prima facie case requires her to present sufficient to establish that her alleged disability was the "but for" cause of the adverse action. McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir. 1996). Thus, a "plaintiff complaining of discriminatory discharge under the ADA must show that his or her employer would not have fired him but for his actual or perceived disability." Savage v. Secure First Credit Union, 107 F. Supp. 3d 1212, 1217 (N.D. Ala. 2015). In the Plaintiff's response brief, it is not clear what evidence the Plaintiff has presented that she cites as sufficient evidence that her termination would not have occurred "but for" her alleged disability, because the Plaintiff does not discuss this element of her prima facie case. See Pl. Br. [79] at 12-23.20
Nevertheless, the Court assumes that Plaintiff can show a prima facie case of causation by relying upon Cooper's arguably demeaning comments about Plaintiff's alleged limitations. Regardless, however, even assuming that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish all the elements of a prima facie case, the Court finds that Defendant has provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Plaintiff's employment. [*80]  As a result, for the Plaintiff to defeat the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on her claim of disability discrimination, she must present significant evidence of pretext, as discussed below.
(b) Defendant's Reason
Defendant argues that it has presented sufficient evidence to establish that it had a legitimate reason to terminate the Plaintiff's employment that was unrelated to her alleged disability. The facts surrounding the Plaintiff's termination are set forth above in detail. In sum, the Defendant contends that Plaintiff's employment was terminated because of her repeated violations of the Rules of Conduct policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 100; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 53.
It is undisputed that, shortly after Cooper was named the General Manager of the Conyers store on October 1, 2013, Plaintiff immediately had multiple complaints about the various changes he was making in the store. Plaintiff had disputes with Cooper over operational decisions, such as the time CSRs were to report to work each day, the manner in which CSRs were to highlight agreements, and whether the Sales Department should be handling customer account calls. Def. SMF at ¶ 110; Pl. Dep. at 164:8-15. Defendant has also shown [*81]  that Plaintiff had a dispute with a co-worker; on one occasion, Plaintiff told CSR Savannah Carter to "shut the f*ck up, shut the f*ck up, or I will come over and slap you," which resulted in Carter's complaining to Smith about Plaintiff. Def. SMF at ¶ 111; Pl. Dep. at 164:3-7; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 67, Att. 22 at 1.
During the four weeks that Plaintiff worked with Cooper, she made multiple complaints to Smith about how Cooper managed the store, including that Cooper did not allow associates in the Sales Department to take customer calls about payment plans or to discuss their accounts. Def. SMF at ¶ 17; Pl. Dep. at 164:8-15; Smith Dep. at 57:14-58:1; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 26, 40. Plaintiff also complained that Cooper asked the CSRs to highlight the customer agreements differently from the way the last manager had required. Def. SMF at ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. at 164:16-22; Smith Dep. at 57:14-58:1; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 26. According to Defendant, Plaintiff complained that the requirement to highlight agreements was "stupid" and that she did not think she needed to do it. Def. SMF at ¶ 20; Pl. Dep. at 164:16-22; Smith Dep. at 78:24-79:3 (Plaintiff said that all of the operational changes that [*82]  Cooper wanted to make were "stupid"). Plaintiff also complained that Cooper changed her schedule from a start time of 9 a.m. to a start time of 10 a.m. Def. SMF at ¶ 22; Pl. Dep. at 34:24-36:5; Smith Dep. at 58:3-16; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 30. Cooper took issue with the frequency and length of the associates' breaks, and Plaintiff complained to Scott-Dyer about that. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 26, 28; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 31.
On one occasion, Plaintiff called Smith to complain that Cooper would not approve the lease agreement for a particular customer. Def. SMF at ¶ 34; Pl. Dep. at 187:23-188:8. Smith explained to Plaintiff that it is Cooper's decision as the manager to decide which lease agreements to approve. Def. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 35; Pl. Dep. at 188:7-12 (Plaintiff testified that Smith told her, "If Chris says she can't be a customer, she can't be a customer. Basically, it's his store."). On another occasion, Plaintiff complained to Smith that she did not like the way Cooper spoke to her. Def. SMF at ¶ 37; Smith II Dep. [65] at 26:5-17.
Plaintiff also said to Smith that Cooper was "a young cocky black male with something to prove." Def. SMF at ¶ 41; Pl. Dep. [*83]  at 156:17-25; Smith Dep. at 59:9-60:23; Smith II Dep. at 26:5-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 27. Smith believed that Plaintiff's comments about Cooper were unacceptable racist comments that stereotype young black men as being cocky and out to prove something. Def. SMF at ¶ 42; Smith Dep. at 59:9-60:23.
On or about October 28, 2013, Plaintiff clocked in to work at around 10:00 a.m., and almost immediately, asked Cooper if she could take a break to have a snack and take medicine. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 55-58; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶¶ 36-39, Att. 19; Smith Dep. at 78:8-22; Smith II Dep. at 51:24-52:14. Cooper responded that he needed to check the Handbook. Def. SMF at ¶ 59; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17. After Plaintiff asked if she should clock out, or go home, Cooper told her "I don't care what you do. It's an at-will state." Def. SMF at ¶¶ 61-62; Pl. Dep. at 41:12-24. It is undisputed that Plaintiff then left the store and did not return the remainder of the day. Def. SMF at ¶ 63; Pl. Dep. at 39:10-41:24, 162:2-17.
On October 30, 2013, Smith and Scott-Dyer met with Plaintiff was asked why she left work early on October 28, 2013. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 64-65; Scott-Dyer [*84]  Dec. at ¶¶ 38-39, Att. 14, 16. Plaintiff responded that she was sick and tired of Cooper. Def. SMF at ¶ 66; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39; Smith Dep. at 78:4-7. Smith and Scott-Dyer talked with Plaintiff about her unacceptable behavior of walking out on her shift because she disagreed with her manager's response to her request for a break. Def. SMF at ¶ 71; Smith Dep. at 82:10-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39. Smith and Scott-Dyer encouraged Plaintiff to comply with Cooper's operational and management decisions. Def. SMF at ¶ 72; Smith Dep. at 82:10-17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 39.
Only one day after that meeting, on October 31, 2013, Plaintiff claims that she sold a camera to a customer that did not have a price on it. Def. SMF at ¶ 73; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16. She asked Cooper for assistance, but he told her that he did not want to assist her because he believed the camera was stolen. Def. SMF at ¶ 74; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16. Plaintiff called Smith to complain about Cooper's handling of the camera sale, and Smith told her that he would take care of it and that he would talk to Cooper about it. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 76-77; Pl. Dep. at 166:22-167:16.
Instead of waiting for Smith to look into the situation, [*85]  Plaintiff asked to meet with Cooper in one of the offices. Def. SMF at ¶ 78; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-20. Cooper told Plaintiff that he wanted to talk where they were so that there would be a witness. Def. SMF at ¶ 79; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-20. Plaintiff responded by saying: "Witnesses for what? . . . You know what? . . . Chris, just be a man. . . . Tell me what your problem is with me." Def. SMF at ¶ 80; Pl. Dep. at 169:7-170:25. That same day, Cooper told Scott-Dyer that Plaintiff told him "to be a man," and asked for direction on how to handle the situation. Def. SMF at ¶¶ 82-83; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:9; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 51, Att. 18.
After this final incident, and considering her history of disrespect and insubordination toward Cooper coupled with her admissions to Smith that she did not respect Cooper, Smith decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Def. SMF at ¶ 85; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:17; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 52. On November 1, 2013, Cooper met with Plaintiff at the direction of Associate Resources and terminated her employment. Def. SMF at ¶ 89; Smith Dep. at 79:19-82:17; Pl. Dep., Ex. 29. According to the Defendant, it terminated Plaintiff's employment due to her repeated violations [*86]  of the Rules of Conduct policy. Def. SMF at ¶ 100; Scott-Dyer Dec. at ¶ 53.
Thus, the Court finds that the Defendant has presented a legitimate reason for its decision to terminate the Plaintiff's employment that was unrelated to her alleged disability. Thus, because the Defendant has met its burden of presenting a legitimate reason for its decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment, Plaintiff must present sufficient evidence of pretext in order to defeat the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.
(c) Pretext
A plaintiff may carry her burden of showing that the employer's proffered reasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact, that they were not the true factors motivating the decision, or that the stated reasons were insufficient to motivate the decision. A plaintiff can either directly persuade the court that a discriminatory or retaliatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the employer's ultimate justification is not believable. See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1522 (11th Cir. 1991). In other words, the plaintiff has the opportunity to come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable [*87]  factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
To demonstrate pretext, a plaintiff must cite to evidence that "reveal[s] 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.'" Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. School Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 771 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 725 (11th Cir. 2004)). "[T]o avoid summary judgment [the plaintiff] must introduce significantly probative evidence showing that the asserted reason is merely a pretext for discrimination." Brooks v. County Comm'n of Jefferson County, Ala., 446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217, 1228) (11th Cir. 1993)).
"Conclusory allegations of discrimination, without more, are not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext or intentional discrimination where [a defendant] has offered extensive evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions." Young v. General Foods Corp., 840 F.2d 825, 830 (11th Cir. 1988). "When the proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is plaintiff's violation of a work rule" the Eleventh Circuit has held that the "work rule" defense "may be pretextual when a plaintiff submits evidence (1) that he did not violate the cited work rule, or (2) that if he did violate the rule, other employees outside the protected class, who engaged [*88]  in similar acts, were treated differently." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999).
As discussed, the Defendant has submitted evidence establishing that the Plaintiff's employment was terminated because of her numerous disputes with Cooper, her General Manager, that led to her repeated violations of the Rules of Conduct policy. Plaintiff does not dispute that she had numerous disputes with Cooper. She does not dispute that she referred to him as "a young cocky black male with something to prove." She does not dispute that, on October 28, 2013, she walked out on her shift shortly after she arrived without permission to do so, and when she was asked on October 30, 2013, why she walked out, she responded that she was sick and tired of Cooper. She also does not dispute that, after she was told not to be so confrontational with Cooper, later that same day, October 30, 2013, she confronted him and said: "You know what? . . . Chris, just be a man. . . . Tell me what your problem is with me." Plaintiff does not dispute that all of these events occurred.
Plaintiff nevertheless argues that she has presented evidence that the Defendant's reasons are pretextual because the Defendant has given "changing reasons" for her termination. [*89]  Pl. Br. at 31-32. Plaintiff first points to the evidence that Cooper waved a paper in front of her that said "customer complaints" on it as evidence that Defendant has given changing reasons. Id. at 31. Plaintiff also argues that the Defendant "furthered" the "customer complaint" argument in front of the Department of Labor, which found that she violated no rule. Id. at 32. As noted above, Plaintiff also contends that "[it] was reported to the EEOC that Plaintiff was terminated for poor performance," although the Plaintiff's cited record evidence does not support that allegation. Pl. SMF at ¶ 108; Farahany Dec. at ¶ 3, Att. 1 [79-4 at 7] (Aaron's statement to the EEOC dated August 7, 2014, states that "Charging Party's employment was terminated on November 1, 2014 [sic] because she engaged in inappropriate behavior.").
Plaintiff also argues that other co-workers had issues and complaints about Cooper, but they were not terminated as a result, but "these other, non-disabled employees were not subjected to the same scrutiny or accusations as Plaintiff. This demonstrates pretext." Pl. Br. at 33. She argues that Cooper "targeted" her disability by making comments about how she was "handicapped" and "needed [*90]  a wheelchair," and made "disdainful" comments about Plaintiff's absences. Id. at 34. Plaintiff also contends that her behavior on October 31, 2013, was not "misconduct," and it was Cooper who committed the misconduct when he yelled at her. Id. at 35-36. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Defendant did not even conduct an investigation into the incident, but merely took Cooper's word for it. Id. at 36.
The Court finds that, upon a review of all of the facts and evidence in the record, and viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, she has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Defendant's proffered reason for her termination was merely a pretext to hide disability discrimination.
First, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that would be sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant has given "changing reasons" for the decision to terminate her employment. Plaintiff's allegation that Cooper waved a paper in front of her that said "customer complaints" on it is not evidence that Defendant has given changing reasons for its decision. She does not allege that Cooper actually told her that she was being terminated because of "customer complaints." That she saw a paper that happened [*91]  to include this phrase, without more context, is not of evidentiary significance. There is absolutely no evidence that the form actually included any specifics or details as to any "customer complaints," or whether any "customer complaints" were cited as a specific reason for termination. Perhaps the employer simply used a form with a generic reference to "customer complaints" in some fashion. There are simply too many possibilities for a factfinder to infer that Defendant was advancing "customer complaints" as the rationale for termination, simply because Plaintiff saw those two words on a form that her supervisor was "waving around."
Furthermore, Plaintiff has not produced any admissible record evidence indicating that Smith, Scott-Dyer, or anyone else at Aaron's actually reported to the Department of Labor that Plaintiff was terminated because of customer complaints. Plaintiff does not refer to anything Defendant stated or submitted to the Department of Labor but rather to the Department of Labor's summary statement in its Claim Determination that "[Plaintiff] was fired when [Defendant] received complaints from customers." Pl. SMF at ¶ 106; Farahany Dec. [79-4] at ¶ 4, Att. 2 [79-4, [*92]  at 81]. Plaintiff does not show the source of this remark or, more specifically, that it was based on any statement attributable to Defendant that Plaintiff was terminated for customer complaints. In the end, a comment by a third party (the Department of Labor), based on unknown evidence, is not competent evidence upon which to overcome a motion for summary judgment.
That other non-disabled co-workers had issues and complaints about Cooper, but they were not terminated as a result, also does not suggest pretext. Significantly, Plaintiff has not cited to any evidence that any other co-worker walked out on a shift without permission after having a dispute with Cooper, or told him to "be a man." She also has not shown that any co-worker had other numerous repeated violations of the conduct policy that could be considered even remotely similar to her violations. Instead, she merely argues that other co-workers complained about Cooper. No comparison can be made on these facts probative of the question of pretext.
The Plaintiff's argument that she did not engage in "misconduct" on October 31, 2013, and that the Defendant did not conduct a proper "investigation" into the incident, is not competent [*93]  evidence either. As noted above, Plaintiff does not dispute that, on October 31, 2013, she confronted Cooper and said to him, "you know what? Chris, just be a man and tell me what your problem is with me." Thus, Plaintiff cannot argue that, if only the Defendant's investigation been more thorough, it would have learned that Plaintiff did not make that statement. She admits that she did. She simply argues that she did not consider it to be "misconduct" to tell her General Manager to "be a man." Plaintiff's argument is nothing more than a disagreement with her employer regarding the seriousness of that incident, but even if the Court agreed with Plaintiff that her comment did not rise to the level of "misconduct," that does not probative evidence in this discrimination case as a matter of law.
The law is clear that "[a]n employer who fires an employee under the mistaken but honest impression that the employee violated a work rule is not liable for discriminatory conduct." Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354, 1363 n.3 (11th Cir. 1999). As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, in cases in which an employee brings a claim for employment discrimination under Title VII:
Title VII does not take away an employer's right to interpret its rules as it chooses, and [*94]  to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules. Title VII addresses discrimination. . . . Title VII is not a shield against harsh treatment at the workplace. Nor does the statute require the employer to have good cause for its decisions. The employer may fire an employee for a good reason, a bad reason, a reason based on erroneous facts, or for no reason at all, as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason. While an employer's judgment or course of action may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question is simply whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination. The employer's stated legitimate reason . . . does not have to be a reason that the judge or jurors would act on or approve.
Nix v. WLCY Radio/Rahall Comm., 738 F.2d 1181, 1187 (11th Cir. 1984) (internal quotes and citations omitted, emphasis added). The same rationale applies to claims of disability discrimination brought under the ADA. Thus, when determining when an employer's proffered rationale is pretextual, courts must focus on the employer's "good faith belief" and not the employee's interpretation of the events at issue. E.E.O.C. v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 221 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000).
Finally, the Plaintiff's allegations regarding the statements made by Cooper regarding her alleged disability are [*95]  insufficient to show pretext. She has failed to show that these alleged statements by Cooper had any relation or connection to the decision to terminate her employment. Also, while Smith obviously discussed the matter with Cooper, Plaintiff cites no evidence to suggest that Cooper made the decision or even a recommendation to terminate her.21 The Eleventh Circuit has held that, although such "stray remarks" may contribute to circumstantial evidence of pretext, isolated comments unrelated to the employment decision at issue "is insufficient to establish a material fact on pretext." See Rojas v. Florida, 285 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir. 2002) (comment made by plaintiff's supervisor to another female that she "did not deserve her job because she was a woman" was not sufficient evidence to establish pretext on plaintiff's claim of sex discrimination); see also Silvestri v. Jupiter Inlet Colony, Fla., 614 Fed. Appx. 983, 2015 WL 3619652, at *1 (11th Cir. 2015) ("Moreover, a stray remark, isolated and unrelated to the challenged employment decision, standing alone, is insufficient to establish a material fact on pretext.").
In the end, Plaintiff's argument is nothing more than a dispute with the wisdom or fairness of Defendant's decision to terminate her employment and the way it went about doing it, and relies on arguably disparaging comments [*96]  unrelated to her termination by someone who was not the ultimate decisionmaker. As cited above, the Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly rejected these things as evidence of pretext. Thus, upon a review of the evidence in the record, the Court concludes that, even if Plaintiff could establish that she had a disability as defined by the ADA, she has not presented sufficient evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that Defendant's decision to terminate her employment was the result of any intent to discriminate against her because of her alleged disability. Defendant has presented evidence that it had a legitimate reason to terminate Plaintiff's employment, and Plaintiff has not presented evidence that the Defendant's reason was a pretext to disguise unlawful discrimination.
Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of pretext. Even viewing all of the evidence in the lights most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that she has failed to cite to sufficient evidence in the record showing that Defendant's reason for terminating Plaintiff's employment was false, or that the reason given was not the true reason for Defendant's decision. Accordingly, [*97]  the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED as to Count I of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA.
(3) Retaliation Claim
In Count II of the Complaint, the Plaintiff asserts a claim for retaliation in violation of the ADA. Comp. at ¶¶ 35-38. Plaintiff alleges that, "[i]n complaining to management and Human Resources about Defendant's failure to abide by reasonable accommodations and about Defendant's retaliatory actions, Plaintiff engaged in protected opposition to illegal activity under the ADA." Id. at ¶ 36. She further alleges that Defendant retaliated against her in violation of the ADA when it took certain actions against her, "including but not limited to changing her schedule, taking away clients and terminating her." Id. at ¶ 37.
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). The Eleventh Circuit has held that, because this provision [*98]  creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to the prohibition on retaliation found in Title VII, courts should evaluate ADA retaliation claims under the same framework used for Title VII retaliation claims. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997); see also McNely v. Ocala Star—Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1075-77 (11th Cir. 1996) (relying on Title VII jurisprudence to interpret meaning of ADA provisions in a retaliation case).
(a) Plaintiff's Prima Facie Case
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there is some causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. "An employment action is considered 'adverse' only if it results in some tangible, negative effect on the plaintiff's employment." Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1261 (11th Cir. 2001). "Once a prima facie case is established, the burden then shifts to the defendant employer to come forward with legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for its actions that negate the inference of retaliation." Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. If the defendant meets that burden, the plaintiff must then present evidence demonstrating [*99]  that the employer's proffered legitimate reasons are merely a "pretextual ruse designed to mask retaliation." Id.; see also Isenbergh v. Knight—Ridder Newspaper Sales, Inc., 97 F.3d 436, 440 (11th Cir. 1996).
The first prima facie element requires the Plaintiff to show that she engaged in a protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. Plaintiff is not required to show that she has an actual disability under the ADA to establish this element. See, e.g., Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 391 (4th Cir. 2001) (a claim of retaliation under the ADA "does not require that the claimant be disabled"); see also Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., 291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir. 2002) (a plaintiff need only show that she "had a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices" in order to establish that a complaint was a protected activity under either the ADA or Title VII).
In its brief, the Defendant does not appear to dispute that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish this element that she engaged in a protected expression under the ADA. Accordingly, the Court will assume for the purpose of this discussion that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence that her complaints about Cooper's failure to follow her medical restrictions were a protected expression under the ADA.
The second prima facie element [*100]  requires Plaintiff to show that Defendant subjected her to an adverse employment action after she engaged in a protected activity. As discussed, claims of retaliation under the ADA are generally analyzed under the same standards applicable to claims of retaliation under Title VII. The Eleventh Circuit held in Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453 (11th Cir. 1998), that, as used in the context of a claim of retaliation under Title VII, adverse employment actions are not limited strictly to ultimate employment decisions such as a termination or a failure to promote. Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998) ("Title VII's protection against retaliatory discrimination extends to adverse actions which fall short of ultimate employment decisions.").
Nevertheless, although actions falling short of ultimate decisions may still constitute adverse employment actions, "there is some threshold level of substantiality that must be met for unlawful discrimination to be cognizable." Id.; see also Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir. 2000). For an employment action to be considered an "adverse action" that triggers liability under Title VII or the ADA, the law is clear that the decision must result in a material alteration on the terms of employment. See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, 245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. 2001) (in the context of a Title VII claim, "Whatever the benchmark, it is clear that [*101]  to support a claim under Title VII's anti-discrimination clause the employer's action must impact the 'terms, conditions, or privileges' of the plaintiff's job in a real and demonstrable way"); see also Kerns v. Capital Graphics, Inc., 178 F.3d 1011, 1016-17 (8th Cir. 1999) ("Minor changes in duties or working conditions that cause no materially significant disadvantage do not meet the standard of an adverse employment action").
It is undisputed that Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment on or about November 1, 2013, and the Defendant does not dispute that her termination was an adverse employment action under the ADA. The Defendant argues, however, that the Plaintiff's other allegations of retaliatory conduct regarding Cooper's making a change in her work schedule, and taking away a customer, are not adverse employment actions under the ADA. Plaintiff in response does not specifically argue otherwise and the Court agrees. Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that those other alleged adverse actions affected her in a substantial and material way.22
Finally, the third and final element of a prima facie case requires Plaintiff to present some evidence that there was a causal link between her protected activity and the adverse employment action. A [*102]  plaintiff is not required to establish "the sort of logical connection that would justify a prescription that the protected participation in fact prompted the adverse action. Such a connection would rise to the level of direct evidence of discrimination, shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant." Simmons v. Camden County Bd. of Educ., 757 F.2d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., 9 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir. 1993); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1525 (11th Cir. 1991).
Rather, to establish a causal connection, a plaintiff was traditionally required to show that the relevant decision maker was aware of the plaintiff's protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action "were not wholly unrelated." Shannon v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotations omitted). The Supreme Court has ruled, however, that "Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation." Univ. of Texas S.W. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). This standard "requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Id. As discussed, retaliation claims brought under the ADA are generally held to the same standard as claims brought under Title VII.
In order to establish a causal connection between protected conduct and an adverse employment action, however, "[a]t a minimum, a plaintiff must [*103]  generally establish that the employer was actually aware of the protected expression at the time it took the adverse employment action." Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, 996 F.2d 1155, 1163 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004) ("A plaintiff satisfies this element if she provides sufficient evidence of knowledge of the protected expression and that there was a close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse action."); Gupta v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 212 F.3d 571, 590 (11th Cir. 2000) ("To establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-maker[s] [were] aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.") (emphasis added). As the Eleventh Circuit has stated, this requirement "rests upon common sense. A decision maker cannot have been motivated to retaliate by something unknown to him." Brungart v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir. 2000). The defendant's awareness of the protected statement, however, may be established by circumstantial evidence. Goldsmith, 996 F.2d at 1163.
A plaintiff may establish an inference of causation merely by showing that she suffered the adverse action shortly after she engaged in the protected activity. Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1220; Bass v. Board of County Comm., Orange County, Fla., 256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir. 2001); Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798. For a plaintiff to establish such a link by mere temporal relationship, however, the challenged decision must follow almost immediately after the protected expression to support [*104]  the logical inference that the two events were related. See Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) ("The cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be very close.") (internal quotes omitted).
The Eleventh Circuit has held that a gap of three months or more between the protected activity and the challenged personnel action, absent any other evidence linking the events, is too long to support the inference that the two events were connected. See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (three-month period does not rise to the level of "very close" to support an inference of a causal link); Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1221 (three-month period does not allow a reasonable inference of causation); see also Conner v. Schnuck Markets, Inc., 121 F.3d 1390, 1395 (10th Cir. 1997) (lapse of four months between protected activity and termination did not support inference of casual connection); Feltmann v. Sieben, 108 F.3d 970, 977 (8th Cir. 1997) (passage of six months between plaintiff's complaint and firing insufficient, without more, to establish causation); Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992) (four-month gap between filing discrimination complaint and receipt of disciplinary letter did not give rise to inference of causal relation).
In this case, Defendant [*105]  argues that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence of a causal link between her protected activity and the adverse employment action, or any evidence showing that her termination would not have occurred "but for" her complaints about Cooper and his alleged failure to adhere to her medical restrictions. Def. Br. at 28-31. Defendant further argues that the Plaintiff's "series of back-to-back outbursts and highly inappropriate conduct . . . were intervening acts of misconduct that severed any possible causal connection between [her] complaint and Aaron's decision to terminate her employment." Id. at 30; see also Hankins v. AirTran Airways, 237 F. App'x 513, 521 (11th Cir. 2007).
In response, Plaintiff argues that she has presented evidence showing "incredibly close proximity between her protected speech and adverse actions." Pl. Br. at 28. She claims that she was terminated "the day after she asked for leave for a medical procedure." Id. She further claims that "[t]here was not more than a couple of days between her speech and the adverse actions and causation should be inferred." Id. The Court notes that Plaintiff has not cited to any admissible record evidence that, on October 31, 2013, she "asked for leave for a medical procedure." Although Plaintiff claims [*106]  that she intended to ask Cooper for leave for a medical procedure, the Plaintiff's cited deposition testimony does not indicate that she ever asked him for leave for medical procedure on that date. See Pl. SMF at ¶ 74; Pl. Dep. at 169.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff also contends that, at approximately 10:00 am on November 1, 2013, she called Scott-Dyer to discuss an incident between her and Cooper. Pl. SMF at ¶ 85. According to Plaintiff, she asked Scott-Dyer if she needs to take further action and "call the EEOC," and Scott-Dyer said, "Don't worry about it, Rosana. Let me talk to Todd Smith and we'll get this squared away." Pl. SMF at ¶¶ 85-86; Pl. Dep. at 178:8-179:8. While it is not entirely clear that Plaintiff's question to Scott-Dyer if she could "call the EEOC," would be a protected expression under the ADA, the Court will assume for the purpose of this discussion that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. In order for the Defendant to establish that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim, it must present evidence that it had a legitimate reason to terminate the Plaintiff's employment that was unrelated [*107]  to Plaintiff's protected expression. As discussed in detail above, the Defendant has done so. Thus, as with the Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination under the ADA, her claim of retaliation rests on her ability to establish pretext.
(b) Pretext
As discussed above, a plaintiff may carry her burden of showing that the employer's proffered reasons are pretextual by showing that they have no basis in fact, that they were not the true factors motivating the decision, or that the stated reasons were insufficient to motivate the decision. A plaintiff can either directly persuade the court that a discriminatory or retaliatory reason more likely motivated the employer or show indirectly that the employer's ultimate justification is not believable. See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); Weaver v. Casa Gallardo, Inc., 922 F.2d 1515, 1522 (11th Cir. 1991).
Plaintiff's arguments on the issue of pretext are the same on her claim of retaliation as they are on her claim of disability discrimination. See Pl. Br. at 30-37. Plaintiff argues that she has presented evidence that the Defendant's reasons are pretextual because Defendant has given "changing reasons" for her termination. Pl. Br. at 31-32. Plaintiff also argues that other co-workers had issues and complaints about Cooper, but they were [*108]  not terminated as a result, but "these other, non-disabled employees were not subjected to the same scrutiny or accusations as Plaintiff. This demonstrates pretext." Pl. Br. at 33. She further argues that Cooper "targeted" her disability by making comments about how she was "handicapped" and "needed a wheelchair," and made "disdainful" comments about Plaintiff's absences. Id. at 34. Plaintiff also contends that her behavior on October 31, 2013, was not "misconduct," and it was Cooper who committed the misconduct when he yelled at her. Id. at 35-36. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Defendant did not even conduct an investigation into the incident, but merely took Cooper's word for it. Id. at 36.
Based on the same reasons discussed above in connection with her claim of disability discrimination, the Court finds that, upon a review of all of the facts and evidence in the record, and viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, she has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Defendant's proffered reason for her termination was merely a pretext to disguise an intent to retaliate against her for opposing discrimination or otherwise engaging in a protected activity under the ADA. Accordingly, [*109]  the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED as to Count II of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under the ADA.23
b. FMLA Claims
Plaintiff also asserts claims against Defendant under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. Plaintiff has asserted two separate claims against Aaron's under the FMLA. Comp. [1] at ¶¶ 42-51. In Count IV, she asserts a claim for interference under the FMLA. Id. at ¶¶ 42-47. In Count V, she asserts a claim for retaliation under the FMLA. Id. at ¶¶ 48-51.
(1) Standards of Proof under the FMLA
The FMLA provides that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(1). It is also "unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter." 29 U.S.C. § 2615(a)(2). An employee alleging that her rights under the FMLA have been violated by an employer may assert two types of claims: interference claims, in which the employee asserts that her employer refused to provide her with the rights granted under the FMLA, and retaliation [*110]  claims, in which the employee alleges that her employer retaliated against her for exercising her rights under the FMLA or for opposing any activity made unlawful under the FMLA. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001); see also Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1305-08 (11th Cir. 2006); O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc., 200 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir. 2000).
In order for an employee to establish a claim based on alleged interference with her rights under the FMLA, "an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07. An interference claim may be based on an employee's termination prior to the start of her FMLA leave, and the employee need not allege that her employer intended to deny the benefit, because "the employer's motives are irrelevant." Id. at 1208.
However, "the right to commence FMLA leave is not absolute, and . . . an employee can be dismissed, preventing her from exercising her right to commence FMLA leave, without thereby violating the FMLA, if the employee would have been dismissed regardless of any request for FMLA leave." Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., 602 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2010). In Krutzig, the court held that an employer was entitled to summary judgment on an FMLA interference claim because "unrebutted evidence that the decision maker was not aware, at the time of the decision to terminate [the employee], of her request to commence FMLA [*111]  leave establishes as a matter of law that [the employee's] termination was for reasons other than her requested leave." Id.
(2) Interference Claim
In Count IV of the Complaint, the Plaintiff asserts a claim for interference under the FMLA. Id. at ¶¶ 42-47. She claims that she "was entitled under the FMLA to request and take leave because of her serious health condition, and to her position or an equivalent position upon return from leave." Id. at ¶ 46.
It is undisputed that Plaintiff took leave under the FMLA from June 3, 2013 through June 16, 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 5; Pl. Dep. at 101:18-102:2, Exs. 11, 12. Plaintiff admits that she was permitted to take leave as needed and that no one interfered with her leave under the FMLA. Def. SMF at ¶ 7; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-24, 101:5-10, 109:7-15. Plaintiff contends that, upon returning to work, her hours were cut from 40 hours to 32 hours. Pl. SMF at ¶ 18; Pl. Dep. at 47:8-18. Plaintiff admits, however, that after she complained to Aaron's regional manager Tom Stacks, he reinstated her back to a 40-hour work week. Pl. SMF at ¶ 19; Pl. Dep. at 47:19-48:9. Although Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant permitted her to take FMLA leave, she claims [*112]  that Defendant "interfered" with her right to take FMLA leave "by cutting her hours when she returned from FMLA leave." Pl. Resp. SMF at ¶ 7; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-13.
During her deposition, the Plaintiff testified as follows with respect to her FMLA claim:
Q. . . . can you tell me in what way Aaron's interfered with your right to take FMLA leave?
A. When I came back from FMLA, they cut my hours.
Q. Did they interfere with your right to take FMLA leave in any other way?
A. Not that I can recall.
Def SMF at ¶ 112; Pl. Dep. at 27:14-15.
It is undisputed that Defendant reinstated Plaintiff to 40 hours immediately upon being alerted to the issue and has since paid Plaintiff for all hours that she was not scheduled to work in June 2013. Def. SMF at ¶ 113; Pl. Dep. at 27:10-13; 47:17-48:8; Reinert Dec. at ¶ 17. Plaintiff does not dispute that, since filing the Complaint, Defendant has paid her for all hours that she was not scheduled to work in June of 2013.
As discussed above, in order for an employee plaintiff to establish a claim based on alleged interference with her rights under the FMLA, "an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied." [*113]  Strickland, 239 F.3d at 1206-07. To prevail on an interference claim, an employee must show that the employer's conduct resulted in the denial of a benefit to which she was entitled. See Spakes v. Broward Cnty. Sheriff's Office, 631 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011) ("To prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that he was denied a benefit to which he was entitled under the FMLA.") (internal citation omitted).
Although Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that she was denied any FMLA leave to which she was entitled, she argues that Defendant nevertheless "interfered" with her rights under the FMLA when it cut her hours upon her return to work. The Court finds that, under the circumstances of this case, the Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that Aaron's "interfered" with her rights under the FMLA. First, Plaintiff has failed to show that she was denied any leave to which she was entitled under the FMLA. See Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir. 1999) ("[A] plaintiff suffers no FMLA injury when she receives all the leave she requests."). Indeed, it is undisputed that Plaintiff received all the FMLA leave she requested.
Second, the Court finds that Plaintiff has also failed to show that Aaron's "interfered" with her rights under the FMLA when her hours were cut upon returning from FMLA leave. [*114]  There is no dispute that she was returned to the same position that she worked before she took FMLA leave. Although Defendant scheduled Plaintiff to work 32 hours during her first week back from FMLA leave (8 hours less than the 40 hour week she apparently expected), this "reduction" was immediately reversed after just one week after Plaintiff spoke to a regional manager. See Pl. Dep [67-1] at 48-49. And Plaintiff does not dispute that she has since received back pay for those 8 hours. See Pl. SMF ¶ 113.
As an initial matter, the Court has difficulty locating any specific facts in this record supporting the conclusion that Plaintiff was entitled to a 40-hour week. But pretermitting that Plaintiff had such a right, the record conclusively shows that Defendant fully complied with it after just one week, and thereafter paid the entire 8 hours of back wages arguably at issue. The Eleventh Circuit has held that, when a plaintiff fails to present evidence that she suffered actual damage that would rise to the level of an "adverse employment action" under the law, she has failed to establish a colorable claim of interference under the FMLA. Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir. 2006).
Finally, [the employer] paid Drago for all the leave [*115]  that he took (including the two business days between October 3 and October 8). Drago simply offers no evidence that he suffered any damage as a result of [his employer's] requirement that he take an additional two days' paid leave. This court has previously held that, even where there may have been technical violations of the FMLA, those violations are not compensable where, as here, a plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that he suffered any "adverse employment action" for purposes of stating a prima facie case under the statute. See Graham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 1274, 1284 (11th Cir.1999). Quite simply, in this case, no interference with FMLA rights occurred.
Id.; see also Cianci v. Pettibone Corp., 152 F.3d 723, 1998 WL 498544 (7th Cir. Aug.19, 1998); Beal v. Rubbermaid Commercial Prods., Inc., 972 F.Supp. 1216 (S.D.Iowa 1997), aff'd, 149 F.3d 1186 (8th Cir. 1998); Fisher v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 999 F.Supp. 866, 871 (E.D.Tex. 1998); Dodgens v. Kent Mfg. Co., 955 F.Supp. 560, 564-65 (D.S.C. 1997).
Plaintiff notes that the amount she was paid does not include interest, liquidated damages or attorney's fees. On the facts of this case, however, there is no basis to go forward to a jury trial on these issues when even the minimal actual damages originally alleged were corrected and remedied. See, e.g., Spurlock v. Postmaster General, 19 Fed. Appx. 338 (6th Cir. 2001) (affirming grant of summary judgment in FMLA claim, when the employer briefly docked part of an employee's pay for one week after she returned from pregnancy leave, which shortage was promptly repaid; court reasoned that no actual damages existed and [*116]  no liquidated or other non-actual damages would be awarded on the de minimis injury that allegedly originally occurred.); see Cooper v. Fulton Cnty., Ga, 458 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006) (liquidated damages unavailable if the employer demonstrates "that its violation was in good faith and that it had a reasonable basis for believing that its conduct was not in violation of the FMLA.").
As with the plaintiff in Drago, the Court finds that Plaintiff in this case has failed to demonstrate that she suffered any "damage" from an "adverse employment action." Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED as to Count IV of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of interference under the FMLA.
(3) Retaliation Claim
In Count V of the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for retaliation under the FMLA. Comp. at ¶¶ 48-51. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant's conduct—including terminating Plaintiff's employment—constitutes unlawful retaliation against Plaintiff for her attempts to exercise her rights under the FMLA." Id. at ¶ 50.
In order to establish a claim for retaliation under the FMLA, the employee must present evidence that her employer subjected her to an adverse employment action and intentionally intended [*117]  to discriminate against her for having exercised her rights under the FMLA. Strickland v. Water Works & Sewer Bd., 239 F.3d 1199, 1207 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing King v. Preferred Technical Group, 166 F.3d 887, 891 (7th Cir. 1999)). Unlike a plaintiff asserting a claim of interference, a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim under the FMLA faces the increased burden of showing that the adverse employment action was "motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus." Id. In the absence of direct evidence, a claim that an employee has been retaliated against for attempting to exercise her rights under the FMLA is analyzed using the McDonnell-Douglas framework applied to Title VII retaliation claims. Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000).
In order to establish a prima facie case of an FMLA violation, Plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she availed herself of a protected right under the FMLA; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the exercise of her rights under the FMLA and the adverse employment action. Brungart, 231 F.3d at 798; Parris v. Miami Herald Pub. Co., 216 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 2000). If Plaintiff meets this burden, Defendant must come forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. The burden then shifts back to Plaintiff to demonstrate that the asserted reason is pretextual. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973).
In this case, there is no dispute that the Plaintiff availed herself of a protected [*118]  right under the FMLA when she took medical leave in June of 2013, and that she suffered an adverse employment action when her employment was terminated on November 1, 2013. Nevertheless, even assuming that the Plaintiff would be able to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA (which Defendant disputes, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence of a causal link), the Court finds that, for the reasons discussed above in connection with Plaintiff's retaliation claim brought under the ADA, Defendant has presented evidence that it had a legitimate reason to terminate the Plaintiff's employment that was unconnected to her FMLA leave, and Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of pretext, casting doubt on the Defendant's reason.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED as to Count V of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claim of retaliation under the FMLA.
c. The Civil Rights Act of 1991
In Count III of the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim for relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2). Comp. at ¶¶ 39-41. Plaintiff alleges that "Defendant Aaron's discriminated against Plaintiff. In failing [*119]  and refusing to take any appropriate remedial action to remedy the unlawful employment practices, Defendant has not only deprived Plaintiff of equal employment opportunities, but has exhibited malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Plaintiff." Id. at ¶ 40. Plaintiff requests compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a)(2). Id. at ¶ 41.
The relevant portion of the statute, provides as follows:
§ 1981a. Damages in cases of intentional discrimination in employment
(a) Right of recovery . . .
(2) Disability
In an action brought by a complaining party under the powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5 or 2000e-16] (as provided in section 107(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12117(a)), and section 794a(a)(1) of Title 29, respectively) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) under section 791 of Title 29 and the regulations implementing section 791 of Title 29, or who violated the requirements of section 791 of Title 29 or the regulations implementing section 791 of Title 29 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation, or section 102 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12112), or committed [*120]  a violation of section 102(b)(5) of the Act, against an individual, the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent.
42 U.S.C. § 1981a(a)(2).
In Defendant's brief, it argues that "[w]hile unclear, it appears as though Jones asserts Count III for the sole purpose of asserting a claim for punitive and compensatory damages under the ADA. As discussed herein, her claims under the ADA are deficient and should be dismissed, so any separate count for punitive or compensatory damages under the ADA should also be dismissed." Def. Br. at 2 n.2. As discussed above, the Court agrees with the Defendant that the Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to establish her claims of discrimination or retaliation under the ADA. Thus, her claim for compensatory and punitive damages based on alleged disability discrimination also fails.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED as to Count III of the Complaint, Plaintiff's claim for damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

II. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
This action is [*121]  before the Court on both the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] and the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68]. In Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Plaintiff has not moved for summary judgment on any of the claims she has asserted against Defendant in the Complaint. Instead, Plaintiff requests that the Court enter summary judgment in her favor as to some of the Defendant's affirmative defenses asserted in its Answer: Plaintiff has stated a claim against Defendant for which no relief can be granted; Plaintiff's claims are barred by judicial estoppel or waiver; Plaintiff has unclean hands; Defendant has after-acquired evidence; Plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrines of laches or acquiescence; Plaintiff's claims are barred by ratification, and/or accord and satisfaction; Plaintiff has failed to mitigate her damages; Plaintiff has failed to exhaust all administrative remedies applicable to her claims; Plaintiff failed to request a reasonable accommodation; Plaintiff's disability caused an undue hardship; and the actions of the employees and managers of Aaron's were not taken within the scope of their employment or in the furtherance of Aaron's [*122]  business. Pl. Br. [68-1] at 1-14.
In response, the Defendant contends that it has waived most of the challenged defenses, making most of the Plaintiff's motion moot. Def. Br. at 3-4. Defendant states that it has waived the following defenses: Plaintiff's claims are barred by judicial estoppel or waiver; Plaintiff has unclean hands; Plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrines of laches or acquiescence; Plaintiff's claims are barred by ratification, and/or accord and satisfaction; and Plaintiff's disability caused an undue hardship. Id. at 2-3; see Ex. A, B. Thus, to the extent that the District Court does not adopt the Recommendations herein regarding the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, the undersigned notes that Defendant has stated on the record its intention to waive those defenses, and thus, it should be barred from attempting to assert those defenses at trial. With respect to the remaining defenses that Defendant has not waived, because the undersigned finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on all of the Plaintiff's claims asserted in the Complaint, the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to the remaining defenses is moot.
Plaintiff also requests that [*123]  the Court enter summary judgment in her favor on various issues related to her claims: that she has a disability under the ADA, that she requested a reasonable accommodation for that disability, that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct under the ADA, and that she was subjected to an adverse employment action under the ADA. Pl. Mot. [68] at 1. Those issues are all discussed in detail above, in connection with the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. As discussed, Defendant disputes that Plaintiff has a disability under the ADA, that she requested a reasonable accommodation for that disability, or that she engaged in statutorily protected conduct under the ADA. The Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action under the ADA when her employment was terminated. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established that she is entitled to summary judgment under Rule 56 on this issue.
Pursuant to Rule 56(a), "[a] party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Rule 56(a) thus permits the court to grant summary judgment "with respect to all claims in an [*124]  action or only some claims in a multiple claim action." Evergreen Int'l, S.A. v. Marinex Constr. Co., Inc., 477 F.Supp.2d 697, 699 (D.S.C. 2007). Some courts, however, have concluded that a party is not entitled to partial summary judgment unless such judgment would be dispositive of an entire claim. Id. (holding that the "piecemealing" of select elements on a single claim is not permitted by Rule 56, citing cases); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) ("One of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims or defenses, and we think it should be interpreted in a way that allows it to accomplish this purpose.") (emphasis added).
Thus, it appears that a majority of courts have held that "a motion for summary judgment may not properly seek to dispose of only a factual allegation or element of a single indivisible claim for relief." Collins v. Cottrell Contracting Corp., 733 F. Supp. 2d 690, 698 (E.D.N.C. 2010) ("The court agrees with the holding of these cases as a general matter, although summary judgment may be appropriate as to a part of a claim in rare circumstances not presented here.") (citing Franklin-Mason v. Penn, 259 F.R.D. 9, 11 (D.D.C. 2009)); see also Air Express Int'l v. Log-Net, Inc., No. CV121732MASTJB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129409, 2016 WL 5334659, at *6 (D.N.J. Sept. 22, 2016); Silicon Knights, Inc. v. Epic Games, Inc., No. 5:07-CV-275-D, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31039, 2011 WL 1134453, at *4 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, No. 5:07-CV-275-D, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31036, 2011 WL 1134447 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 24, 2011); N.J. Auto. Ins. Plan v. Sciarra, 103 F.Supp.2d 388, 396 (D.N.J. 1998).
In sum, the general rule is that Rule 56 does not [*125]  permit a party to seek partial summary judgment on a discrete issue, unless such judgment would be dispositive of an entire claim. The Court would ordinarily not enter a "judgment" on a single issue that is not dispositive of an entire claim, and Plaintiff has cited to no binding authority that the Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit would permit such a request for summary judgment under Rule 56 under the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68] be DENIED as moot.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the above reasons, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [70] be GRANTED, and that judgment be entered in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiff's claims asserted in the Complaint.
IT IS FURTHER RECOMMENDED that the Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [68] be DENIED as moot.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 31st day of January, 2017.
