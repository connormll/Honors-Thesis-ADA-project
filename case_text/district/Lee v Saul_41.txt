REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
SARAH NETBURN, United States Magistrate Judge.
TO THE HONORABLE PAUL G. GARDEPHE:
Plaintiff Danny Lee ("Plaintiff" or "Lee") brings this employment discrimination action against defendant Andrew Saul ("Defendant"), Commissioner of the Social Security Administration ("SSA"), Lee's former employer. Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, asserts claims under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 701, et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. ("ADA"), and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq., ("FMLA"). Defendant moves to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. I recommend the Court GRANT in part and DENY in part Defendant's motion.

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, a resident of California, is a former employee of the SSA in Brooklyn, NY. ECF No. 2 ("Compl.") at 2. Plaintiff alleges the SSA failed to accommodate his disabilities—hip pain and depression—and also engaged in unlawful disparate treatment, retaliation, and harassment in violation of the Rehabilitation [*2]  Act, the ADA, and the FMLA. Compl. at 3-5.1 Plaintiff's Complaint alleges, under the section entitled "Facts":
Social Security Administration removed reasonable accommodations and harassed plaintiff. Plaintiff was told if he filed another EEO that he would become the receptionist. Disparate treatment and discrimination based on disability and EEO complaint. Receptionist work area did not have reasonable accommodations. Instructions from management prevented Plaintiff from doing his job. Assigned 4x more work than co-worker. Disparate treatment. Time and leave incorrect. Leave procedure not followed by SSA. Reasonable Accommodations procedure not followed by SSA. SSA failed in interactive process and destroyed medical evidence and emails.
Compl. at 5. Attached to the Complaint is an agency "Decision on Request for Reconsideration," affirming the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's ("EEOC") denial of administrative relief on Plaintiff's claims of discrimination and ongoing harassment based on his alleged disability, and including a Right to Sue notice dated May 31, 2019. Id. at 9-11. Defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiff submitted an opposition, attaching the Equal [*3]  Employment Opportunity Commission's Final Agency Decision from December 6, 2015. See ECF No. 17 ("Opposition" or "Pl. Opp.").

DISCUSSION

I. Legal Standard
A complaint must be dismissed if it fails "to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). To state a legally sufficient claim, a complaint must plead "enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 554, 570 (2007). In evaluating a complaint under this standard, a court must accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations set forth in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Id. at 555-56. While the plausibility standard "does not require detailed factual allegations," it "demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); see also Cantor Fitzgerald Inc. v. Lutnick, 313 F.3d 704, 709 (2d Cir. 2002) (stating that a court need not give "credence to [a] plaintiff's conclusory allegations"). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). "A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action" is insufficient [*4]  to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Where, as here, a plaintiff proceeds pro se, his complaint "must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)). When considering a motion to dismiss a pro se complaint, "courts must construe [the complaint] broadly, and interpret [it] to raise the strongest arguments that [it] suggest[s]." Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of New York, 287 F.3d 138, 145-46 (2d Cir. 2002).
A complaint is deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference. See, e.g., Hart v. FCI Lender Servs., Inc., 797 F.3d 219, 221 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c) ("A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.")). A complaint does not include allegations raised for the first time in opposition to a motion to dismiss and such allegations do not automatically amend the complaint. See O'Brien v. Nat'l Prop. Analysts Partners, 719 F. Supp. 222, 229 (S.D.N. Y. 1989) ("[I]t is axiomatic that the Complaint cannot be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."); Capers v. Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Ctr., 13-cv-6953 (AJN), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23007, 2016 WL 817452, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2016) (applying rule against [*5]  amending complaint by the briefs to pro se plaintiff). A court may, however, consider new allegations in an opposition brief "in determining whether to grant [the plaintiff] leave to file a[n] . . . Amended Complaint." Capers, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23007, 2016 WL 817452, at *2; see also Jordan v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 91 F. Supp. 3d 491, 500 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).

II. ADA Claims
42 U.S.C. § 12112 of the ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." A "covered entity" means "an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(2). The term "employer," however, does not include "the United States." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(5)(B)(i). Accordingly, courts have concluded that, while the ADA prohibits discrimination and retaliation by certain private sector employers as well as state and local government employers, it does not provide a cause of action against the federal government for employment discrimination. Hodges v. Att'y General of the U.S., 976 F. Supp. 2d 480, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (holding that the Rehabilitation Act, not the ADA, provides "the exclusive route by which federal employees may raise claims of employment discrimination on the basis of disability"); see also Rivera v. Heyman, 157 F.3d 101, 103 (2d Cir. 1998) ("As a federal employee, [Plaintiff] has no remedy for employment discrimination under the ADA."). I conclude that Plaintiff's ADA claim should be dismissed accordingly. [*6] 

III. Rehabilitation Act Claims
Pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff checks boxes indicating allegations of failure to provide reasonable accommodation, disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and retaliation. I address each of these potential claims in turn.

A. Reasonable Accommodation
Under the Rehabilitation Act, it is unlawful for "a covered entity not to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9. In order to establish a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show "(1) that he is an individual who has a disability within the meaning of the [Rehabilitation Act], (2) that an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability, (3) that with reasonable accommodation, he could perform the essential functions of the position sought, and (4) that the employer has refused to make such accommodations." Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 96-97 (2d Cir. 1997). "While a plaintiff need not allege specific facts establishing a prima facie case of [*7]  discrimination in order to withstand a motion to dismiss, the elements of a prima facie case often provide an outline of what is necessary to render a plaintiff's claims for relief plausible." See Carter v. Verizon, 13-cv-7579 (KPF), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6370, 2015 WL 247344, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 2015).
The Complaint's only allegations supporting a claim of failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act are: (1) "Social Security Administration removed reasonable accommodations and harassed plaintiff"; (2) "Receptionist work area did not have reasonable accommodations"; (3) "Reasonable Accommodations procedure not followed by SSA"; and (4) "SSA failed in interactive process and destroyed medical evidence and emails." Compl. at 5. Regarding the disability at issue, Plaintiff alleges that he suffers "hip pain" and "depression." Id. at 4.
These allegations do not meet the pleading standard required to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) because they do not contain sufficient non-conclusory claims to suggest that the SSA denied Plaintiff accommodations necessary for him to perform the essential functions of his position. Plaintiff's allegations that Defendant "removed reasonable accommodations," "did not have reasonable accommodations," did not follow "Reasonable Accommodations [*8]  procedure," without more, are simply conclusory statements that do not state a plausible claim of employment discrimination. See Wilson v. New York City Dep't of Corr., 11-cv-9157 (PAE), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33275, 2013 WL 922824, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2013). Likewise, Plaintiff's claim that the "SSA failed in interactive process" (Compl. at 5) is conclusory in that it lacks a factual basis from which Defendant would have fair notice of the grounds upon which Plaintiff's claim rests. The Rehabilitation Act requires the federal government, as an employer, to engage in an "interactive process with [an] individual" under certain circumstances "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Plaintiff, however, provides no details or specific facts describing how the Defendant failed to engage in the interactive process. Plaintiff's complaint also lacks allegations as to the connection between his disability and the accommodation sought. The Complaint "fails to state that Plaintiff requested and was denied a specific accommodation," as required to state a plausible claim under the Rehabilitation Act. Getso v. City University of New York, 08-cv-7469 (LAP), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108316, 2009 WL 4042848, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2009) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the claim should be dismissed.

B. Disparate Treatment
To state a disparate [*9]  treatment claim under the Rehabilitation Act, an individual must show: "(1) plaintiff's employer is subject to the [Rehabilitation Act]; (2) plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the [Rehabilitation Act]; (3) plaintiff was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) plaintiff suffered [an] adverse employment action because of her disability." Jacques v. DiMarzio, Inc., 386 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir. 2004).
Here, as with Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation claims, the Complaint contains conclusory statements that, without more, do not adequately plead a claim for disparate treatment under the Rehabilitation Act. See Compl. at 5 ("Disparate treatment and discrimination based on disability . . ."); id. ("Disparate treatment."). Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged that he "suffered [an] adverse employment action." Jacques, 386 F.3d at 198. "A plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment." Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). This action "must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities." Id. For example, "[a] materially adverse change might be indicated by a [*10]  termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "Actions that are 'trivial harms'—i.e., 'those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience'—are not materially adverse." Tepperwien v. Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., 663 F.3d 556, 568 (2d Cir. 2011) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)).
Construing Plaintiff's Complaint liberally, the allegations which may allude to adverse employment actions include: (1) "[i]nstructions from management prevented Plaintiff from doing his job;" (2) "[a]ssigned 4x more work than co-worker," and (3) "[t]ime and leave incorrect." Compl. at 5. None of these allegations constitutes adverse employment actions. Instructions from management that "prevented Plaintiff from doing his job" do not rise to the level of an "adverse employment action" because, without more, Plaintiff's description of "instructions from management" is not sufficiently detailed to allow the Court to find that the instructions themselves amounted to alterations of the terms and conditions [*11]  of Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff's claim that he received four times more work than his coworkers also does not amount to a claim of an adverse employment action because receipt of additional work within an individual's job description is not adverse so long as it is not paired with a loss in pay or benefits. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Coca Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., 12-cv-234 (BMC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131860, 2013 WL 5230037, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2013) ("[I]t is well established that assignments that are part of an employee's normal responsibilities are not 'adverse employment actions' where . . . the rate of pay and benefits remains the same."); see also id. (collecting cases). "Time and leave incorrect" similarly does not amount to a claim of adverse employment action because Plaintiff provides no detail as to how the "time and leave" were incorrect such that the Court could find a "material loss or change" of his benefits. See Galabya, 202 F.3d at 640. Moreover, even if any of Plaintiff's allegations were of "materially adverse changes," he has not pleaded a connection between his disability and those changes by claiming they occurred "because of [his] disability." Jacques, 386 F.3d at 198. "A complaint must specifically allege the events claimed to constitute intentional discrimination as well as [*12]  circumstances giving rise to a plausible inference of discriminatory intent." Brodt v. City of N.Y., 4 F. Supp. 3d 562, 568 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff has not met that burden here. Plaintiff has not alleged circumstances giving rise to an inference that the SSA took materially adverse employment actions because of Plaintiff's disability. The claim should be dismissed accordingly.

C. Hostile Work Environment
The Court of Appeals "has not yet decided whether a hostile work environment claim may be made under the ADA" and by extension, the Rehabilitation Act. See Wesley-Dickson v. Warwick Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 586 F. App'x 739, 745 n.2 (2d Cir. 2014). For the purposes of this Report and Recommendation, I assume a hostile work environment claim is actionable under the Rehabilitation Act. See Kelly, 200 F. Supp. 3d at 399 (assuming hostile work environment claim is actionable under the Rehabilitation Act and applying standards used in Title VII context); see also Monachino v. Bair, 769 F. Supp. 2d 431, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).
In order to state a claim for hostile work environment, a plaintiff "must first show that his workplace 'was permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,' that was 'sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions' of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment." Martinez v. City of N.Y., 338 F. App'x 71, 73 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 352 F.3d 733, 745 (2d Cir. 2003)). This requires a plaintiff to [*13]  "plead facts that would tend to show that the complained of conduct: (1) is objectively severe or pervasive—that is, . . . creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive; (2) creates an environment that the plaintiff subjectively perceives as hostile or abusive; and (3) creates such an environment because of the plaintiff's [membership in a protected class]." Patane v. Clark, 508 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim cannot succeed. As a threshold matter, as discussed above, Plaintiff has not adequately pled that his disability was "perceived" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, a prerequisite to stating a claim for a hostile work environment in the disability context. See Kelly, 200 F. Supp. at 399. Even assuming Plaintiff had adequately pled that he suffers a perceived disability, his hostile work environment claim fails for additional reasons. First, Plaintiff has not alleged actionably "severe or pervasive" conduct. Plaintiff alleges that the "Social Security Administration . . . harassed" him by keeping his time incorrectly, disproportionately assigning him work, threatening to demote him, and providing him instructions [*14]  that prevented him from doing his job. Compl. at 5. Incidents occurring infrequently are generally not considered "severe." Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 374 (2d Cir. 2002) ("As a general rule, incidents must be more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive."). Plaintiff does not allege the frequency of any particular act of harassment, but the nature of his allegations does not lend itself to an inference of repeated conduct. For example, "providing . . . instructions" and "threatening to demote" are more likely one-time events than ongoing conditions of employment imposed upon an employee rising to the level of objective harassment. Similarly, the alleged statements and behavior cannot be objectively characterized as particularly insulting, abusive, or intimidating. See Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 150 (2d Cir. 2004) (evaluating the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening, and whether it unreasonably interferes with the employee's performance to determine whether a hostile work environment objectively exists). Because Plaintiff has not alleged "severe or pervasive" harassment, a protected disability, or a nexus between the two, his hostile work environment claim must [*15]  be dismissed.

D. Retaliation
The Rehabilitation Act prohibits an employer from "discriminat[ing] against any individual because such individual . . . made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [the Act]" 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); see also 29 U.S.C. § 794(d). Claims for retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act are "analyzed under the same burden-shifting framework established for Title VII cases." Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002). "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that (1) [he] was engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of that activity; (3) the employee suffered a materially adverse action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action." Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, 157 (2d Cir. 2012). "An employer's action is 'materially adverse' within the context of a retaliation claim where it is 'harmful to the point that it could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.'" Atencio v. U.S. Postal Serv., 14-cv-7929 (GHW), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156686, 2015 WL 7308664, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2015) (quoting White, 548 U.S. at 57). "The standard for an adverse employment action in a retaliation claim, however, is not as demanding as it is in a discrimination claim." Quadir v. New York State Dep't of Labor, 39 F. Supp. 3d 528, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). While a discrimination claim must [*16]  demonstrate adverse actions affecting the terms and conditions of employment, a retaliation claim may be based on "employer actions that are likely to deter victims of discrimination from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and employers." White, 548 U.S. at 68.
Here, Plaintiff alleges that he "was told if he filed another EEO that he would become the receptionist." Compl. at 5. I fairly interpret "file[] another EEO" to mean file a complaint with the SSA's Equal Employment Opportunity Office regarding Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims, and find that the allegation, while lacking detail, plausibly alleges a claim for retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act.
Plaintiff's participation in the SSA's internal EEO process is participation in a legally protected activity. See Lee v. Colvin, 15-cv-1472 (KPF), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16269, 2017 WL 486944, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 2017) (citing Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719). Defendant does not dispute this point but makes several arguments related to whether Plaintiff alleges an materially adverse employment action and whether Plaintiff has alleged that, if a materially adverse employment action is found, it can be imputed to the SSA.
First, Defendant argues that transfer to a "receptionist" position is not necessarily an adverse employment action, citing Fletcher v. ABM Building Value, 775 F. App'x 8 (2d Cir. 2019). Key [*17]  to the Fletcher Court's finding was that, despite a change to the nature of her work assignments from "HR Administrator" to "receptionist position," the plaintiff "retained her salary and title." Id. at 12-13. Here, Plaintiff does not allege, and the Court cannot infer from the pleadings, that Defendant's statement that Plaintiff "would become the receptionist" would merely involve a similar shift in workload but no corresponding change in title or pay. Similarly, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's sole allegation of a threat to demote—as opposed to an actual or constructive demotion—does not constitute an adverse employment action. The cases Defendant cites in support of this proposition are not entirely persuasive. First, in Lucenti v. Potter, the Court found in resolving defendant's motion for summary judgment that, while the plaintiff had alleged her employer threatened to fire her, she had not testified as to any comment by her supervisor regarding her EEO claims (therefore not alleging a causal connection between protected activity), and that the record reflected that those comments were, in fact, motivated by a concern over plaintiff's job performance. 432 F. Supp. 2d 347, 364 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). By contrast, Plaintiff has specifically [*18]  drawn a connection between the protected activity (filing an EEO complaint) and the threatened material adverse employment action (a fairly interpreted demotion). Second, in Alexander v. Westbury Union Free School Dist., the Court held that a threat of lateral transfer without corresponding pay reduction was not a material adverse employment action. 829 F. Supp. 2d 89, 109 (E.D.N.Y. 2011). By contrast, Plaintiff's allegations in this case do not establish that the benefits and pay of the receptionist position to which Plaintiff would have been reassigned if he had raised another EEO complaint equaled his current benefits and pay as a Case Intake Technical/Legal Assistant. See Compl. at 9. Moreover, while "threats of disciplinary action," increased scrutiny of an employee, or "reprimands that do not lead to materially adverse employment consequences" are not actionable, see Lucenti, 432 F. Supp. 2d at 364, Defendant cites no cases directly supporting its argument that a threatened demotion to a position with worse pay and benefits cannot be a materially adverse employment action—even if the demotion never actually occurs.
Interpreting the Complaint to raise the strongest claims suggested, as required considering Plaintiff's pro se status, I find that Plaintiff's [*19]  allegation that he was told that if he filed another complaint with the EEO, he would be demoted from his position as a Case Intake Technical/Legal Assistant to a "receptionist" constitutes a materially adverse employment action because the statement was "likely to deter" him—a purported "victim of discrimination"—"from complaining to the EEO[C]." White, 548 U.S. at 68. It is true that not all threats of demotion may be materially adverse employment actions. See Durkin v. Verizon New York, Inc., 678 F. Supp. 2d 124, 138 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) ("threat of demotion" was not materially adverse employment action where it followed plaintiff's leave of absence and thus her inability to continue in training program). Because evaluations of whether employment actions are materially adverse for purposes of analyzing retaliation claims are context-specific, see White, 548 U.S. at 69, I nonetheless find that here, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the threat to make him a receptionist would likely deter a reasonable employee from lodging another complaint with the EEO and that Plaintiff's claim under the Rehabilitation Act for retaliation should proceed accordingly.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has not identified the alleged comment maker, such that it is "impossible to deduce whether the alleged threat [*20]  can be imputed onto the SSA." Def. Mem. at 16. Drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor and construing the Complaint's allegations broadly, I find that Plaintiff fairly alleges that the comment can be attributed to the SSA because it would be reasonable to infer that the unidentified source of the comment was a supervisor or manager.
Finally, examining the remainder of the Complaint's allegations, I do not find Plaintiff states any other ground for a claim of retaliation. Even if any Plaintiff's allegations could be read to state claims of materially adverse employment actions taken against him, Plaintiff does not adequately plead a causal nexus between any of those actions and Plaintiff's engagement in protected activity. See Lee v. Berryhill, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14767, 2019 WL 367834, at *4 (noting that a plaintiff alleging retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act must "adequately plead but for causation, which can either be shown by direct evidence of retaliatory animus or inferred through temporal proximity to the protected activity." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).
In sum, construing Plaintiff's complaint liberally, I find for the above reasons that Plaintiff fails to state a claim of discriminatory treatment under the Rehabilitation [*21]  Act on a theory of failure to accommodate, disparate treatment, or hostile work environment, because the Complaint makes only conclusory allegations and does not provide any indication of how Defendant's alleged adverse employment action was connected to Plaintiff's disability. I find, however, that Plaintiff's retaliation claim, while lacking detail, contains the minimum amount of information necessary to plausibly allege a claim under the Rehabilitation Act. I recommend the Court grant Defendant's motion to dismiss the Rehabilitation Act claims with regard to the failure to accommodate, disparate treatment, and hostile work environment claims; I further recommend the Court deny Defendant's motion as to Plaintiff's claim under the Rehabilitation Act based on retaliation.

III. FMLA Claims
Plaintiff's Complaint contains two allegations concerning leave: "Time and leave incorrect," Compl. at 5; and "Leave procedure not followed by SSA," id. Plaintiff also checks the box on his Complaint form indicating that he brings claims under the FMLA.
Although the FMLA grants a private right of action to an employee in the private sector who alleges violation of his FMLA rights, see 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2) (1994), the [*22]  FMLA does not afford a private right of action to an employee of the federal government, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 6381-6387; see also Beauchat v. Mineta, 03-cv-03196 (DRH)(ETB), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67844, 2006 WL 2711608, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2006) ("The courts have recognized the distinction between private sector employees and federal government employees with regard to enforcement rights and have held that no independent right of action is available to federal government employees to enforce their FMLA rights."). Because Plaintiff is a federal employee, he does not have a private right of action under the FMLA and his claim should be dismissed. Id.
Even if Plaintiff had a right of action under the FMLA, I conclude that he has failed to state a claim because he has not specifically alleged that he exercised or attempted to exercise any FMLA-protected rights. Plaintiff's references to "time and leave" and "leave procedure," Compl. at 5, without more, do not establish that Plaintiff was "entitled to take leave under the FMLA" and that he was "denied benefits to which [he] was entitled under the FMLA." Graziadio v. Culinary Inst. of Am., 817 F.3d 415, 424 (2d Cir. 2016). I recommend the Court grant the motion to dismiss Plaintiff's FMLA claim accordingly.

IV. Leave to Amend
Courts "should not dismiss [a pro se complaint] without granting leave to amend at least [*23]  once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated." Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000). "Where it appears that granting leave to amend is unlikely to be productive, however, it is not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend." Lucente v. Int'l Bus. Machines Corp., 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). "One appropriate basis for denying leave to amend is that the proposed amendment is futile. . . . An amendment to a pleading is futile if the proposed claim could not withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)." Id. (internal citations omitted). Leave to amend may also be denied "when a party has been given ample prior opportunity to allege a claim." De Jesus v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., Inc., 87 F.3d 65, 72 (2d Cir. 1996).
Plaintiff's Opposition consists of new factual allegations as referenced in the EEOC's final decision. See Pl. Opp. at 16-36. The factual allegations in Plaintiff's Opposition do not cure the pleading deficiencies in the Complaint identified above because the Complaint "cannot be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss." O'Brien, 719 F. Supp. at 229 ("[I]t is axiomatic that the Complaint cannot be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."); see also Capers, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23007, 2016 WL 817452, at *2. Based on a comparison of the facts outlined in the Opposition with those claims Plaintiff put [*24]  forward by a previous complaint, it appears that—should Plaintiff be given leave to amend his Complaint—he would seek to re-litigate several of the accommodation claims already dismissed by a Court in this district. Compare Pl. Opp. at 18, with Lee v. Colvin, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16269, 2017 WL 486944, at *11 ("Plaintiff has claimed since September 25, 2010, that he could have performed all of the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodation, specifying that he could so perform if given a desktop printer and electronic caseload."). That amendment, insofar as it would allege claims previously adjudicated and dismissed, would be futile. Indeed, Defendant argues by its Reply (ECF No. 19) that Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed with prejudice and without leave to amend to the extent that the Opposition alleges—albeit insufficiently—facts in support of the Complaint's claims.
At this stage, I recommend the Court deny with prejudice Plaintiff's claims under the ADA and the FMLA because Plaintiff's conclusory allegations do not give any indication that Plaintiff would state a valid claim upon amendment. Further, given that the Court has previously ruled on several of the claims referenced by the newly raised facts in Plaintiff's Opposition, [*25]  and given the lack of additional grounds for relief under the Rehabilitation Act suggested by the complaint as to failure to accommodate, disparate treatment, or hostile work environment, I recommend the Court also deny those claims with prejudice.

CONCLUSION
Even construing Plaintiff's allegations under the liberal standard afforded to pro se litigants, I find that the Complaint does not plausibly allege claims under the ADA, the FMLA, or the Rehabilitation Act for failure to accommodate, disparate treatment, or hostile work environment. I conclude that Plaintiff does, however, plausibly allege a claim of retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act. Accordingly, I recommend the Court grant Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA, FMLA, and Rehabilitation Act claims based on a failure to accommodate, disparate treatment, or hostile work environment, and DENY Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Rehabilitation Act claims based on retaliation.
