ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS
On December 4, 2014, Greg Pruitt filed this action in Los Angeles Superior Court against Swift Pork Company ("Swift"), JBS USA, LLC ("JBS") (collectively "defendants"), and various fictitious defendants.1 Defendants were served with the summons and state court complaint on December 10, 2014, and timely removed the action to this court on January 9, 2015.2 On January 23, 2015, Pruitt filed an amended complaint,3 which defendants moved to dismiss on February [*2]  6, 2015.4 Pruitt opposes defendants' motion.5

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Parties
Pruitt is a California citizen who is a former employee of JBS. JBS hired Pruitt in May 2012 to work as a packer on its meat production line.6 Swift is a Delaware corporation, which is allegedly the parent company of JBS, a Colorado limited liability company.7 During the course of his employment with JBS, Pruitt consistently met and exceeded performance goals set by his supervisors; he was ultimately promoted to "Sato Packer."8
Pruitt allegedly suffers from congenital talipes equinovarus, which is commonly referred to as "club foot."9 This condition purportedly limits his ability to walk, run, and climb stairs.10 Because club foot is a condition and/or cosmetic disfigurement that affects the musculoskeletal system and limits major life activities, it allegedly constitutes a physical disability for purposes of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), California Government Code § 12900, et seq. 11 Pruitt asserts that it also constitutes a medical condition under the act because its manifestation is associated with a genetic characteristic.12

B. Plaintiff's Surgery and Medical Leave
In September 2013, Pruitt allegedly advised defendants' [*3]  human resources department that he was scheduled to have surgery on his club foot that would require taking a medical leave.13 On September 23, 2013, Pruitt purportedly gave defendants a doctor's note concerning the surgery, which indicated that he would be unable to work for a period of time as he recuperated from the surgery, but that he would be able to return to work in late December 2013 or early January 2014 with no restrictions.14 The same day, Pruitt allegedly completed the paperwork required to take medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") and submitted it to defendants.15
On December 27, 2013, Pruitt allegedly gave defendants a note from his treating physician stating that he was being treated and would be able to return to work without restriction on January 16, 2014.16 Pruitt's recuperation purportedly took longer than expected and he was thus unable to return on January 16 as previously indicated.17 On January 13, 2014, Pruitt allegedly gave defendants another doctor's note, which stated that he was under a physician's care and required additional medical leave.18 Two days later, Pruitt allegedly received a letter from JBS stating that he had exhausted [*4]  his FMLA leave as of December 13, 2013.19 The letter confirmed that JBS had received the January 13 doctor's note and stated that it "w[ould] be addressing any additional request for leave time."20 JBS purportedly told Pruitt, however, that until it could address his request for further leave, he could use his additional week of vacation time to cover the leave he required.21
The next day, Pruitt's physician allegedly extended his return date to February 15, 2014.22 The doctor gave Pruitt a note, which he in turn purportedly gave JBS. The note stated that he was under medical care at the University of California at Los Angeles Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and that he would have no restrictions upon his return to work.23 The next week, on January 23, 2014, Pruitt allegedly received a letter from JBS advising that he would be granted a maximum of eight weeks of additional medical leave after he exhausted his accrued vacation time.24 JBS also purportedly stated that it would require that Pruitt provide medical documentation releasing him to work without restrictions no later than February 14, 2014.25 It advised that, "if [Pruitt] was unable to return [to work] by Feb[ruary] 17th[,] [*5]  his employment would be terminated."26
Pruitt alleges that, on February 7, he saw his physician for a check-up.27 The doctor purportedly noticed a bacterial growth on his foot and referred him to an orthopedic surgeon for further examination.28 On February 13, the orthopedic surgeon evaluated Pruitt; following his evaluation, the surgeon extended Pruitt's medical leave to March 14, 2014.29 Pruitt allegedly faxed the doctor's note extending his leave to defendants the same day.30 After receiving the doctor's note, defendants' human resources personnel allegedly helped Pruitt complete the paperwork necessary to secure a additional medical leave.31 On February 18, 2014, however, JBS terminated Pruitt's employment; the reason given for the termination was "no return from leave."32

C. Defendants' Purported Failure to Pay Plaintiff Wages
As a sato packer, Pruitt was allegedly required to wear a uniform consisting of coveralls, boots, gloves, and other gear each day.33 He asserts he was required to put the uniform on each morning before clocking in and remove it each day after clocking out.34 During meal periods, Pruitt was purportedly required to take the uniform off and put [*6]  it back on while off the clock.35 Pruitt alleges that he spent seven to ten minutes donning and doffing his uniform while off the clock at the beginning and end of his shift and at the beginning and end of his meal period.36

D. Plaintiff's Claims
Pruitt pleads twelve causes of action: (1) discrimination based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(a);37 (2) failure to prevent discrimination based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k);38 (3) retaliation based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(h);39 (4) failure to prevent retaliation based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(k);40 (5) failure to provide a reasonable accommodation based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(m);41 (6) failure to participate in the interactive process based on actual physical disability and perceived physical disability in violation of California Government Code § 12940(n);42 (7) violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), California Government Code § 12945.1 et seq.;43 (8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy;44 (9) failure to pay minimum wages in violation of California Labor Code §§ 1194 [*7] , 1194.2, and 1197;45 (10) failure to pay overtime wages in violation of California Labor Code § 510;46 (11) failure to furnish accurate wage statements in violation of California Labor Code § 226;47 and (12) failure to pay wages due on termination in a timely fashion in violation of California Labor Code §§ 201-203.48

II. DISCUSSION

A. Legal Standard Governing Motions to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)
A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. A Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper only where there is either a "lack of a cognizable legal theory," or "the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory." Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988). The court must accept all factual allegations pleaded in the complaint as true, and construe them and draw all reasonable inferences from them in favor of the nonmoving party. Cahill v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996); Mier v. Owens, 57 F.3d 747, 750 (9th Cir. 1995).
The court need not, however, accept as true unreasonable inferences or conclusory allegations cast in the form of factual allegations. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 540 U.S. 544, 553-56 (2007) ("While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do"). Thus, a plaintiff's complaint must "contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' . . . A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content [*8]  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 545 ("Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)" (citations omitted)); Moss v. United States Secret Service, 572 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) ("[F]or a complaint to survive a motion to dismiss, the non-conclusory 'factual content,' and reasonable inferences from that content, must be plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief," citing Iqbal and Twombly).

B. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's First Cause of Action for Discrimination
The FEHA makes it an unlawful employment practice to discharge a person from employment or to discriminate against a person because of a physical or mental disability or medical condition. CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12940(a). "In order to state a claim of disability discrimination, a plaintiff must allege that he or she (1) suffers from a disability, (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of his or her disability." King v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc., No. CIV 2:13-01560 WBS, 2013 WL 5305907, *7-8 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2013) (citing McCarthy v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 819 F.Supp.2d 923, 934 (E.D. Cal. 2011); Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 886 (2007)); see also Hatfield v. DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc., No. C 13-5206 SBA, 2015 WL 106632, *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2015) ("FEHA makes it an unlawful [*9]  employment practice to discriminate against any person because of a physical or mental disability. To 'prevail on a discriminatory discharge claim under section 12940(a), an employee bears the burden of showing (1) that he or she was discharged because of a disability, and (2) that he or she could perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation (in the parlance of the [ADA], that he or she is a qualified individual with a disability),'" quoting Liu v. City and County of San Francisco, 211 Cal.App.4th 962, 971 (2012) (emphasis original)).
Pruitt's disability discrimination claim alleges that he was terminated by defendants and that his "physical disability and/or medical condition was a substantial motivating factor for [defendants'] termination of [his] employment."49 Defendants argue it is unclear from this allegation what "disability" or "medical condition" allegedly led to the purported discrimination — his club foot or his bacterial growth.50 The court agrees that Pruitt's allegations — particularly those incorporated in his FEHA causes of action — do not specify which "disability" purportedly gave rise to defendants' discrimination. This is particularly problematic given that Pruitt's factual allegations identify two separate conditions that could [*10]  be the basis for his FEHA claims. The allegations are thus insufficient under Twombly and Iqbal to state a plausible claim for relief, and Pruitt's first cause of action must be dismissed. See McKenna v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc., 894 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1278 (E.D. Cal. 2012) ("Ms. McKenna offers nothing to support a FEHA disability discrimination claim. She articulates a termination-based complaint and fails to substantiate prima facie elements of disability discrimination. A[t] best, the FAC is vague as to her alleged disability and fails to identify it precisely. Ms. McKenna's termination during medical leave fails to establish that her alleged disability contributed to her termination"); see also Nelson v. Original Smith & Wesson Business Entities and/or Corporations, No. 10-35562, 2011 WL 3855852, *2 (9th Cir. Sept. 1, 2011) (Unpub. Disp.) ("Iqbal, however, requires that a complaint include specific allegations of fact supporting recovery, a standard the Nelsons' vague and speculative language fails to satisfy. Accordingly, the district court was correct in granting the motion to dismiss"); Harrington v. Daiso Japan, No. 10-3876 SC, 2011 WL 2110764, *4 (N.D. Cal. May 26, 2011) (dismissing a claim that was "replete with factual generalizations and legal conclusions").
In his opposition, Pruitt clarifies that the claim is based on defendants' alleged discrimination due to the bacterial growth his doctor discovered on February 7, 2014.51 Addressing this basis for the claim, defendants assert [*11]  that it must be dismissed because the complaint does not adequately allege that the growth qualifies as a disability under the FEHA, that it was related to the club foot disability, or that defendants knew the two conditions were related. Pruitt counters that it "can be reasonably inferred" from his allegations that the growth qualifies as a disability under the FEHA or was related to his club foot.52 The court cannot agree.
As an initial matter, to the extent Pruitt contends that the bacterial growth upon which he bases his FEHA discrimination claim qualifies as a disability under the FEHA, he has failed to state a plausible claim. Although Pruitt alleges that his club foot is a physical disability because it limits major life activities,53 the first amended complaint contains no similar factual allegations regarding the bacterial growth. Indeed, apart from a passing reference to his club foot and the bacterial growth , the complaint contains nothing but vague and generalized allegations concerning a "disability and/or medical condition."54 Absent factual allegations, Pruitt's assertion that the bacterial growth constitutes a disability under the FEHA is insufficient to allege a discrimination [*12]  claim plausibly. See McKenna, 894 F.Supp.2d at 1277-78.55
The court is similarly unpersuaded by Pruitt's argument that the complaint adequately alleges the bacterial growth was related to his club foot. Indeed, the facts alleged in the complaint seem to suggest that the bacterial growth was a separate condition from the club foot for which he had surgery. The complaint asserts that Pruitt told defendants in September 2013 he would have to take medical leave to have surgery on the club foot and to recuperate from the surgery, and that he would not be able to return to work until December 2013 or January 2014.56 Pruitt completed paperwork for the leave time associated with his surgery and recuperation.57 On several occasions thereafter, he gave defendants documentation indicating that he needed to take additional leave time; defendants granted him additional leave.58 The last note he provided stated that he would return without restrictions on February 14, 2014.59 Based on these factual allegations, it would appear that Pruitt's recovery from the club foot surgery was to be complete by February 14.
On February 7, 2014, Pruitt was evaluated by his internist who noticed a bacterial growth on one of Pruitt's [*13]  feet; he made a referral to an orthopedic surgeon, who provided a note extending his medical leave to March 14, 2014.60 The same day, Pruitt completed separate medical leave paperwork and submitted it to defendants.61 The fact that Pruitt submitted a separate application for leave based on the bacterial growth on his foot is significant, as it suggests that the growth was a condition that was separate from the club foot and the surgery; when he requested additional leave time to recuperate from the club foot surgery, he did not complete a new leave application as he alleges he did for leave based on the bacterial growth.
Additionally, although the complaint alleges that the bacterial growth was observed on one of his feet, it does not, as defendants note,62 plead that the growth was located on the club foot or was in any other way associated with the club foot surgery or recovery from that surgery. Given the facts actually alleged in the complaint, Pruitt has not sufficiently pled that the bacterial growth was related to his club foot.
Even had Pruitt adequately alleged that the bacterial growth was a disability under the FEHA — either independently or because it was associated with [*14]  his club foot — the court would nonetheless have to dismiss the claim because Pruitt fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting that defendants had knowledge of the disability.
A FEHA claim requires that "the employer ha[ve] knowledge of the employee's disability when the adverse employment decision [is] made." Foster v. City of Oakland, 649 F.Supp.2d 1008, 1018 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (citing Brundage v. Hahn, 57 Cal.App.4th 228, 236-37 (1997)); see also Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 54 n. 7 (2003) ("If [defendant] were truly unaware that such a disability existed, it would be impossible for her hiring decision to be based, even in part, on [plaintiff's] disability . . . [Plaintiff] cannot, ipso facto, be subject to disparate treatment"). An employee's "vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the FEHA." Brundage, 57 Cal.App.4th at 237.
Although Pruitt allegedly gave defendants a doctor's note after an orthopedic surgeon told him he would need to take medical leave due to the bacterial growth, the complaint does not allege facts giving rise to a reasonable inference that defendants knew the bacterial growth was a disabling condition. Pruitt alleges only that the note advised defendants he had an "orthopedic problem" for which he was under a physician's care.63 This is insufficient to [*15]  allege that defendants were on notice that Pruitt had a disabling condition related to the bacterial growth rather than a general health problem; only notice of the former will support a claim under the FEHA. See, e.g., King, 2013 WL 5305907 at *7-8 ("Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that defendant was aware of her disability. Plaintiff alleges that she took sick leave on three occasions in January and March. These allegations establish that defendant was aware that plaintiff took sick leave for an illness, but are insufficient to impute knowledge of her alleged disability to defendant. Nor does it follow that defendant knew of plaintiff's alleged disability because she submitted notes from her doctor stating that she was unable to work. Even taking this allegation as true, plaintiff has alleged no facts suggesting that these notes 'contain[ed] sufficient information to put [defendant] on notice that plaintiff suffered from a disability,'" citing Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1249 (2008)); Dirks v. The Permanente Medical Group, Inc., No. 2:09-CV-03399-JAM—EFB, 2010 WL 1779932, *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2010) ("Although Plaintiff's allegations demonstrate that Defendant knew about plaintiff's health problems, these allegations are not sufficient to state a claim that Defendant knew about Plaintiff's [*16]  disability").
To the extent Pruitt contends the bacterial growth was related to his club foot and that defendants knew the growth was a disability because they knew the club foot was disabling, his failure to allege any facts showing that defendants knew the two conditions were related or that he was requesting additional leave associated with the club foot and related surgery renders Pruitt's claim deficient. See Harper v. Senior Aerospace Jet Products, No. 09CV2105 JAH RBB, 2010 WL 2012008, *3-4 (S.D. Cal. May 17, 2010) ("Defendant does not dispute that plaintiff's alleged diabetes qualifies him as a 'disabled' person under FEHA nor whether he was qualified to perform essential functions of his job. However, defendant contends plaintiff offers no facts establishing, or even suggesting, that defendant knew plaintiff's neck and shoulder pain or his request to leave work was related to his disability. . . . [D]efendant notes the complaint alleges plaintiff informed Steward that he believed the pain was caused by a muscle strain and admits plaintiff had previously been accommodated by Jet Products whenever he needed to attend to his diabetic condition. . . . This Court agrees with defendant. . . . The complaint clearly alleges plaintiff requested to leave work that day to tend to a muscle strain [*17]  and that he told his supervisors he needed to leave because the severe muscle pain was caused by a strained muscle incurred at home. As noted by defendant, there was no allegation indicating any mention of plaintiff's diabetes during the conversations conducted prior to plaintiff's unauthorized absence from work on June 25, 2009. . . . [P]laintiff's factual allegations of intentional disability discrimination by defendant, taken as true, fail to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' Therefore, plaintiff's first cause of action must be dismissed," citing Iqbal). Thus, Pruitt's discrmination claim must also be dismissed because he has failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting that defendants knew the bacterial growth was a disabling condition or related to his club foot.
For the reasons stated, the court grants defendants' motion to dismiss the first cause of action for disability discrimination under the FEHA.

C. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent Discrimination
Pruitt has failed to allege sufficient facts to plead plausibly that he suffered discrimination due to an actual or a perceived physical disability. Because [*18]  Pruitt has failed sufficiently to allege a disability discrimination claim under § 12940(a), he is unable to state a claim for failure to prevent discrimination in violation of § 12940(k). The court thus grants defendants' motion to dismiss Pruitt's second cause of action.

D. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action for Retaliation
Defendants next move to dismiss Pruitt's third cause of action for retaliation. Under the FEHA, "[t]o establish a claim for retaliation, the plaintiff has the initial burden to show that (1) [ ]he engaged in a protected activity; (2) [ ]he was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action." Kelley v. Corrections Corp. of America, 750 F.Supp.2d 1132, 1143 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (citing Jadwin v. County of Kern, 610 F.Supp.2d 1129, 1185 (E.D. Cal. 2009)); see also Alatorre v. Wastequip Manufacturing Co., LLC, No. 2:12-CV-02394-MCE, 2013 WL 796717, *7 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 2013) ("Under FEHA, '[t]o establish a claim for retaliation, the plaintiff has the initial burden to show that (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action'" (citations omitted)); CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12926(h).
Pruitt does not respond to defendants' arguments concerning dismissal of the retaliation [*19]  claim. This alone provides a sufficient basis upon which to dismiss the claim. See, e.g., Ioane v. C.I.R., No. 3:09-CV-00243-RCJ-(RAM), 2010 WL 2600689, *3-4 (D. Nev. Mar. 11, 2010) (dismissing a cause of action based on plaintiff's failure to oppose or respond to defendant's arguments for dismissal). The claim, moreover, is implausible as pled.
This is because Pruitt fails to allege that defendants retaliated against him after he engaged in a "protected activity." He pleads that his "request for a reasonable accommodation was a motivating reason for DEFENDANTS' decision to terminate PLAINTIFF's employment."64 "Under [the] FEHA, [however,] requesting accommodation is not 'protected activity' unless the plaintiff first makes a complaint regarding the denial of accommodations.'" Violan v. On Lok Senior Servs., No. 12-CV-05739 WHO, 2013 WL 6907153, *11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 31, 2013); see also Burch v. California Department of Motor Vehicles, No. CIV S-13-1283 LKK, 2013 WL 6844493, *8 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2013) ("[R]equesting reasonable accommodation is not the type of protected activity that can lead to a claim for retaliation"); Alcala v. Best Buy Stores, LP, No. EDCV 11-00798 JVS (OPx), 2012 WL 6138332, *11 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2012) ("Alcala's first 'protected activity' - his request for disability accommodations—is not a FEHA-protected activity and cannot be the basis for this action," citing Flait v. North American Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 476 (1992) (discussing the need for an employee to raise discrimination or harassment issues or oppose such activities as the first step in the analysis)). Indeed, as one district court [*20]  has noted, such an interpretation of "protected activity" "would significantly blur and perhaps obliterate the distinction between an action for failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process and retaliation." Kelley, 750 F.Supp.2d at 1144.
As Pruitt alleges only that defendants retaliated against him because he sought an accommodation — i.e., additional medical leave — and pleads no facts indicating that he complained about a denial of accommodation before the alleged retaliation took place, he fails to state a FEHA retaliation claim, and his third cause of action must be dismissed.

E. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action for Failure to Prevent Retaliation
Pruitt's failure to plead a plausible FEHA retaliation claim compels the dismissal of his failure to prevent retaliation claim. The court therefore grants defendants' motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action.

F. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action for Failure to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation and Sixth Cause of Action for Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
"With certain exceptions, FEHA makes it an "unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . to fail to make [*21]  reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee.'" Olson v. Mono County Superior Court, No. CIV 13-2445 LKK/CKD, 2014 WL 1671586, *4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 28, 2014) (citing CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12940(m)). "The essential elements of a failure to accommodate claim are: (1) the plaintiff has a disability covered by FEHA; (2) the plaintiff is a qualified individual (i.e., he or she can perform the essential functions of the position); and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff's disability." Cuiellette v. City of Los Angeles, 194 Cal.App.4th 757, 766 (2011).
"Implicit in the third prong is the employer's knowledge of the disability, as provided for in the statute." Olson, 2014 WL 1671586 at *4 (citing Prilliman v. United Airlines, Inc., 53 Cal.App.4th 935, 950-51 (1997) ("[W]e conclude that an employer who knows of the disability of an employee has an affirmative duty to make known to the employee other suitable job opportunities with the employer . . .")); see also Arn v. News Media Group, 175 Fed. Appx. 844, 846 (9th Cir. Apr. 4, 2006) (Unpub. Disp.) ("To establish a failure to accommodate in violation of the FEHA, [the plaintiff] must demonstrate that his employer was aware of his disability and refused to accommodate it"); Alatorre v. Wastequip Manufacturing Co. LLC, No. 2:12-CV-02394-MCE, 2013 WL 796717, *4 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 4, 2013) ("In other words, 'to succeed on a FEHA claim for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show that he (1) has a disability of which the employer is aware, and (2) is a qualified individual,'" citing [*22]  Diaz v. Federal Express Corp., 373 F.Supp.2d 1034, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2005)).
"As a separate cause of action, California makes it an unlawful employment practice: 'For an employer . . . to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Burch, 2013 WL 6844493 at *8 (citing CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12940(n)). This cause of action likewise requires that plaintiff allege defendant knew of the purported disability.
Defendants argue that Pruitt's fifth and sixth causes of action must be dismissed because Pruitt does not allege facts showing "that at the time he was terminated [ ] he had a disability. . . [,] [that] [d]efendants knew he had a disability or perceived him as having a disability, or [that they] made any challenged decision due to any alleged disability (of which they had no knowledge)."65 As the court has concluded that Pruitt has not adequately alleged that the bacterial growth was a disability, and that defendants knew the growth was a disability or was related to his club foot or surgery, it grants defendants' motion to dismiss Pruitt's claims for failure to provide a reasonable [*23]  accommodation and failure to participate in the interactive process. See, e.g., King, 2013 WL 5305907 at *9 ("[P]laintiff's failure to accommodate claim also fails for the same reason as her disability discrimination claim: she has alleged no facts to support her ultimate allegation that defendant failed to accommodate a 'known disability,' as required by Section 12940(m). Accordingly, because plaintiff does not state a claim that defendant failed to accommodate a known disability, the court must grant defendant's motion to dismiss her claim that defendant failed to accommodate her disability" (citation omitted)); id. at *10 ("As with her other FEHA claims, plaintiff's allegation that she 'requested that [d]efendant accommodate her disability by allowing her to take certain days off due to her medical condition,' is insufficient, even taken alongside her other factual allegations, to show that defendant was aware that plaintiff had a disability requiring accommodation. Because plaintiff does not sufficiently allege that defendant had knowledge of her disability, she has not stated a claim that defendant failed to engage in an interactive process to accommodate a known disability. Accordingly, the court must grant defendant's motion to [*24]  dismiss plaintiff's failure to interact claim" (citation omitted)); Dirks, 2010 WL 1779932 at *6 ("As explained previously, Plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts to demonstrate that Defendant had notice of her alleged disability. As such, Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second cause of action for failure to engage in the interactive process is GRANTED with leave to amend").

G. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Seventh Cause of Action for Violation of the CFRA
Defendants make only passing reference to Pruitt's seventh cause of action for violation of the CFRA, asserting, without citation to authority, that it must be dismissed because they granted Pruitt's request for leave and extended the leave several times after receiving doctors' notes.66 Defendants contend "nothing in [the] CFRA requires an employer to allow an employee to extend his leave, nor does it prohibit an employer from terminating an employee who overstays his leave."67 The court cannot agree.
The CFRA was "intended to give employees an opportunity to take leave from work for certain personal and family reasons without jeopardizing security." Nelson v. United Technologies, 74 Cal.App.4th 597, 406 (1999). "Under the CFRA, an employee is entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave from [*25]  work in the event of a serious illness or injury to the employee or close family member." Delgado v. United Facilities, Inc., No. 2:11-CV-00485-MCE, 2012 WL 10717266, *6-7 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2012) (citing CAL. GOV'T CODE § 12945.2).
"Violations of the CFRA generally fall into two types of claims: (1) 'interference' claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave, and (2) 'retaliation' claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to CFRA leave." Rogers v. County of Los Angeles, 198 Cal.App.4th 480, 4887-88 (2011) (citing Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare System, LLC, 277 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir. 2001); Dudley v. Department of Transportation, 90 Cal.App.4th 255, 260-61 (2001)). Although Pruitt does not identify the theory on which he proceeds, it is apparent from the nature of his allegations that he asserts a CFRA retaliation claim.68
"'[T]he elements of a cause of action for retaliation in violation of [the] CFRA . . . are as follows: (1) the defendant was an employer covered by [the] CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination . . . , because of her exercise of her right to CFRA leave." Cross v. United Airlines, 317 Fed. Appx. 615, 618 (9th Cir. Aug. 29, 2008) (Unpub. Disp.) (citing Avila, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1253-54; Dudley, 90 Cal.App.4th at 262).
The crux of defendants' argument appears to be that, because Pruitt was terminated after having [*26]  exhausted his CFRA leave, his CFRA retaliation claim is foreclosed as a matter of law. The California Court of Appeal has rejected this very argument, however:
"Caltrans contends Dudley cannot state a cause of action under [the] CFRA because '[i]n the 12 months prior to her termination on June 30, 1997, Dudley took significantly over 6 months leave.' That argument misses the mark. It is quite likely that Dudley exhausted any CFRA leave for which she was eligible some time before she was terminated in June 1997, because by that point she had been off work continuously for approximately 6 months, and CFRA leave is limited to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period. That fact, however, does not necessarily preclude Dudley from establishing that Caltrans retaliated against her in violation of [the] CFRA. If any of the leaves Dudley took qualified as CFRA leave, and if Caltrans took any adverse employment action against Dudley because she exercised her right to take that leave, then Dudley has established a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of CFRA, regardless of whether Dudley had exhausted her CFRA leave by the time Caltrans terminated her employment." Dudley, 90 Cal.App.4th at 262.
Given Dudley's holding, [*27]  and defendants' failure to offer any substantive argument or authority challenging the sufficiency of Pruitt's allegations, the court denies their motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action for violation of the CFRA.

H. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Eighth Cause of Action for Termination in Violation of Public Policy
To prove a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he was employed by defendants; (2) that he was discharged by defendants; (3) that an alleged violation of public policy was a motivating reason for his discharge; and (4) that the discharge caused him harm. Haney v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc., 121 Cal.App.4th 623, 641 (2004); see also Stoval v. Basin Street Properties, No. 12-cv-04661-JST, 2013 WL 6002758, *3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2013) ("To prevail on a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must establish that (1) an employer-employee relationship existed; (2) plaintiff's employment was terminated; (3) the violation of public policy was a motivating reason for the termination; and (4) the termination was the cause of plaintiff's damages" (citation omitted)).
"To support a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, the underlying policy must be (1) supported by either constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) 'public' [*28]  in the sense that it 'inures to the benefit of the public' rather than merely serving the interests of individuals; (3) well-established at the time of plaintiff's discharge; and (4) 'fundamental' and 'substantial.'" Stoval, 2013 WL 6002758 at *3 (citing Stevenson v. Superior Court, 16 Cal.4th 880, 889-90 (1997)); see also Holmes v. General Dynamics Corp., 17 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1426 (1993) ("To recover in tort for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, the plaintiff must show the employer violated a public policy affecting 'society at large rather than a purely personal or proprietary interest of the plaintiff or employer.' In addition, the policy at issue must be substantial, fundamental, and grounded in a statutory or constitutional provision," citing Gantt v. Sentry Insurance, 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1089-90 (1992); Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 669-71 (1988); Sequoia Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 13 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1479-80 (1993)).
Pruitt bases his wrongful termination claim on the public policies underlying the FEHA and the CFRA.69 "[T]he public policy embodied in the CFRA satisfies all the requirements identified in Gantt[,] . . . 1 Cal.4th . . . [at] 1095, . . . and Stevenson[,] . . . 16 Cal.4th . . . [at] 889-890. . . . Therefore, an employee may 'bring a tortious wrongful discharge claim against an employer subject to the CFRA based upon the policy prohibiting discrimination under the . . . CFRA." Faust v. California Portland Cement Co., 150 Cal.App.4th 864, 886 (2007).70 Pruitt has plausibly alleged a CFRA claim. Because defendants do not challenge the adequacy of [*29]  the allegations supporting the remaining elements of a wrongful termination claim, the court concludes that the claim is adequately alleged. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the eighth cause of action must be denied.

I. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Ninth Cause of Action for Failure to Pay Minimum Wages
Defendants also move to dismiss Pruitt's ninth cause of action for failure to pay minimum wages in violation of California Labor Code §§ 1194, 1194.2, and 1197.71 They argue that the first amended complaint pleads insufficient facts to support the claim.72 The court cannot agree.
Under California law, an employee is entitled to be paid at least a minimum wage for each hour worked. See Armenta v. Osmose, Inc., 135 Cal.App.4th 314, 320 (2005) ("Under California law, [employees] [a]re entitled to compensation for all hours worked. The court noted that section 1194 entitles an employee receiving less than the minimum wage to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the 'full amount of this minimum wage'" (citation omitted)). Pruitt alleges that he was required to wear a uniform comprised of coveralls, boots, gloves, and other gear.73 He asserts that he had to don and doff his uniform off the clock at the start and end of each shift, as well as during meal periods.74 Pruitt [*30]  contends he spent seven to ten minutes off the clock donning and doffing at the beginning and end of his shift and at the beginning and end of his meal period.75 He alleges, as a consequence, that defendants "failed to pay [him] minimum wages for all hours worked," including the donning and doffing time.76
Defendants first argue that the claim must be dismissed because Pruitt's allegation that they failed to pay a minimum wage for all hours worked is a legal conclusion and implausible under Twombly and Iqbal.77 While such an allegation, standing alone, would be insufficient to state a plausible claim, see Anderson v. Blockbuster, Inc., No. 2:10-CV-00158-MCE (GGH), 2010 WL 1797249, *3 (E.D. Cal. May 4, 2010) (concluding an allegation that "Defendants regularly failed to pay minimum wage to Plaintiff" was insufficient under Twombly and Iqbal, and dismissing a claim for failure to pay minimum wages), Pruitt has alleged more in this case. Contrary to defendants' contentions that Pruitt offers "only a single factual allegation supporting all four of the wage-related causes of action,"78 the first amended complaint includes other allegations that are sufficient to support a claim that defendants failed to pay Pruitt for all hours worked. Pruitt alleges he was not compensated for all time worked each day because [*31]  he was required to don and doff his uniform off the clock. This allegation gives rise to a plausible inference that he was not paid minimum wages for all hours worked in any given day, and is sufficient to survive defendants' motion to dismiss.
This conclusion is not altered by defendants' assertion that the time Pruitt spent donning and doffing is not compensable under California law.79 They contend that the court must dismiss the claim because his allegations show Pruitt spent de minimis time — seven to ten minutes each day — donning and doffing, and that compensable time, if de minimis, cannot be recovered.80 The court is not persuaded. Pruitt alleges that he "spent approximately seven (7) to ten (10) minutes donning and doffing his uniform while off the clock at the beginning and ending of his shift and at the beginning and ending of his meal period."81 Although the allegation could be understood to plead that Pruitt spent a total of seven to ten minutes each day donning and doffing, an equally reasonable interpretation is that Pruitt spent seven to ten minutes donning and doffing twice a day — once before and after his shift and once while he was on his meal period — or even that [*32]  he spent seven to ten minutes donning his uniform before work began and again as he prepared to return from his meal period, and seven to ten minutes doffing his uniform as he began his meal period and again at the end of the day. Defendants recognize that the allegation is susceptible of these interpretations, but argue "it [is] improbable that it would take [p]laintiff that long to put on and take of[f] three articles of clothing."82 Beyond the fact that it may well not be unreasonable to assume that, given his club foot, it might have taken Pruitt this long to don and doff, defendants misapprehend the standard of review at this stage. In deciding a motion to dismiss, the court must accept all factual allegations pleaded in the complaint as true, and construe them and draw all reasonable inferences from them in favor of the nonmoving party. Cahill, 80 F.3d at 337-38. "[A] claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully." [*33]  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Here viewing the pleadings in the light most favorable to Pruitt, a reasonable inference arises that he spent as much as twenty (or even forty) minutes each day donning and doffing his uniform. As defendants recognize, this amount of time is not de minimis.83
Consequently, Pruitt has plausibly alleged a claim for violation of California Labor Code §§ 1194, 1194.2, and 1197. Defendants' motion to dismiss the ninth cause of action is therefore denied.

J. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Tenth Cause of Action for Failure to Pay Overtime Wages
Pruitt's tenth cause of action alleges a claim for failure to pay overtime wages in violation of California Labor Code § 510.84 That statute states, in relevant part, that "[a]ny work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee." Any employee receiving less than the overtime compensation to which he is legally entitled can sue to recover the unpaid balance, as well as interest, reasonable attorneys' fees, and costs of suit. CAL. LAB. CODE § 1194.
Defendants move to [*34]  dismiss Pruitt's § 510 claim, asserting that it merely "recites boilerplate legal conclusions that [Pruitt] was required to work in excess of eight hours in one workday and 40 hours per week without premium compensation," and pleads no facts "to suggest this was beyond the de minimis time it took to put on his coveralls, boots, and gloves."85 Pruitt does not respond directly to this argument; rather, he asserts, in conclusory fashion, that he "clearly alleges that he worked off-the-clock for extensive periods of time on a daily, let alone a weekly, basis."86 The court agrees with defendants that, as currently pled, Pruitt's overtime cause of action fails to state a plausible claim for relief.
As a threshold matter, defendants' contention that Pruitt's donning and doffing time cannot support the § 510 claim because it is de minimis and thus cannot qualify as time worked "in excess of eight hours in one workday and 40 hours per week" is incorrect. As noted earlier, Pruitt's allegations give rise to a reasonable inference that this time was compensable under California law. As a result, it can support an overtime claim under § 510 if the complaint plausibly pleads that Pruitt was required to work more than [*35]  eight hours in a single workday or more than forty hours in one workweek. Pruitt fails to allege facts demonstrating that he worked more than eight hours in a day or more than forty hours in a week, however, such that he should have been paid overtime under § 510.
As defendants note,87 Pruitt pleads only that defendants "required, allowed, suffered, and/or permitted [him] to work in excess of eight hours in one workday and 40 hours per week without being compensated at the applicable overtime rate of pay."88 This is but a "threadbare recital[ ] of a cause of action's elements," however, and is insufficient to state a plausible claim for relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; see also Lefevre v. Pacific Bell Directory, No. 14-cv-03803-WHO, 2014 WL 5810530, *2-3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2014) ("Plaintiff's first cause of action alleges that 'Plaintiff and members of the California Class routinely worked in excess of 8 hours in a day and/or 40 hours in a week without receiving time and a half pay, and worked in excess of 12 hours in a day and on the seventh of seven consecutive day [sic] but were not paid for that work time at double time pay.'. . . Here, plaintiff states only the bare elements of his claims for failure to pay overtime wages. He does not include any facts that support these elements or that go beyond 'legal [*36]  conclusions.' The FAC does not specify the time periods that plaintiff worked overtime, the company policy regarding overtime, or any concrete actions taken by the defendants. Instead, its language is similar to claims in other cases that courts dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). The first and sixth causes of action do not contain sufficient factual allegations under Twombly and Iqbal" (citations omitted)); Anderson v. Blockbuster, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-00158-MCE-GGH, 2010 WL 1797249, *2-3 (E.D. Cal. May 4, 2010) ("Here, Plaintiff does not meet this standard for any of the causes of action he attempts to assert. Plaintiff's First Cause of Action, for example, alleges a violation of California Labor Code §§ 510 and 1198 (Unpaid Overtime). The FAC contends that 'Plaintiff and class members consistently worked in excess of eight hours in a day, in excess of 12 hours in a day and/or in excess of 40 hours in a week.' Plaintiff further alleges that 'Defendants willfully failed to pay all overtime.' These conclusory allegations do not meet minimum pleading requirements. Plaintiff fails to state when or how Defendant failed to pay the required wages. Without more, such legal conclusions do not suffice" (citations omitted)); DeLeon v. Time Warner Cable LLC, No. CV 09-2438 AG (RNBx), 2009 WL 9426145, *3 (C.D. Cal. July 17, 2009) ("Here, the FAC amounts to the 'threadbare recitals of a cause of action's [*37]  elements, supported by mere conclusory statements' that the Iqbal Court warned against. Plaintiff argues that the FAC contains 'numerous paragraphs' that 'are sufficient to allege the enumerated causes of action.' To support this argument, Plaintiff offers the following list of allegations: ¶ 33 - 'During the relevant time period, Plaintiff and class members consistently worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a day, in excess of twelve (12) hours in a day, and/or in excess of forty (40) hours in a week.' ¶ 46 - 'During the relevant time period, Defendants willfully required Plaintiff and class members to work during meal periods and failed to compensate Plaintiff and class members for work performed during meal periods.' ¶ 55 - 'During the relevant time period, Defendants willfully required Plaintiff and class members to work during rest periods and failed to compensate Plaintiff and class members for work performed during rest periods.' Plaintiff argues that these passages allege sufficient facts to satisfy Rule 12(b)(6). The Court disagrees. . . . If Plaintiff wishes to survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must plead sufficient 'factual content' to allow the Court to make a reasonable inference [*38]  that Defendants are liable for the claims alleged by Plaintiff. In the FAC, Plaintiff has not pled sufficient factual content" (citations omitted)).
More fundamentally, although it is true that Pruitt has plausibly alleged that he was not paid a minimum wage for time he spent donning and doffing his uniform off the clock, he pleads no facts that give rise to a reasonable inference that he was entitled to premium pay for such time — i.e., that it constituted hours in excess of eight hours in one day or forty in one workweek. He does not allege, for example, whether he worked part-time or full-time during the relevant period. Nor does he allege how many hours he worked each week. Absent such allegations, no plausible inference arises that unpaid time associated with donning and doffing his uniform should have been compensated at an overtime rate. Compare Davenport v. Wendy's Co., No. 2: 14-cv-00931 JAM DAD, 2014 WL 3735611, *4 (E.D. Cal. July 28, 2014) ("Defendant argues that Plaintiff's first cause of action for failure to pay overtime wages must be dismissed because 'not a single instance of overtime is factually alleged as to anyone.' . . . Plaintiff does not merely allege that Defendant improperly failed to pay General Managers for overtime [*39]  work. Rather, Plaintiff makes the additional allegation that 'all of [Defendant's] California based salaried General Managers are/were expected and required to work five (5) ten (10) hour shifts per week and generally averaged fifty (50) or more hours per week.' This factual allegation distinguishes the present case from those cases relied upon by Defendant, in which plaintiffs made conclusory allegations that merely mimicked the statutory language. As Plaintiff has alleged a specific number of hours worked by General Managers each week (50 hours), the present case is analogous to Yuckming Chiu v. Citrix Sys., Inc., in which the plaintiff 'alleged that he worked a specific number of hours — between 50 and 60 a week[.]' Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for failure to pay overtime wages," citing Yuckming Chiu v. Citrix Sys., Inc., No. SACV 11-1121 DOC (RNBx), 2011 WL 6018278, *4 (C.D. Cal. Nov.23, 2011)).
Because Pruitt fails to plead facts plausibly suggesting that he worked more than eight hours in a day and forty hours in a week, and rather relies only on "threadbare recitals" of the elements of a § 510 claim, his tenth cause of action must be dismissed.

K. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Eleventh Cause of Action for Failure to Furnish Accurate Wage Statements [*40] 
Defendants next seek to dismiss Pruitt's eleventh cause of action for failure to furnish accurate wage statements in violation of California Labor Code § 226.89 Section 226 provides:
"Every employer shall, semimonthly or at the time of each payment of wages, furnish each of his or her employees, either as a detachable part of the check, draft, or voucher paying the employee's wages, or separately when wages are paid by personal check or cash, an accurate itemized statement in writing showing (1) gross wages earned, (2) total hours worked by the employee . . . , (3) the number of piece-rate units earned and any applicable piece rate if the employee is paid on a piece-rate basis, (4) all deductions, provided that all deductions made on written orders of the employee may be aggregated and shown as one item, (5) net wages earned, (6) the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid, (7) the name of the employee and only the last four digits of his or her social security number or an employee identification number other than a social security number, (8) the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer . . . , and (9) all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding [*41]  number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee." CAL. LAB. CODE § 226(a).
Defendants argue that Pruitt's § 226 claim must be dismissed because "it does not identify what was inaccurate about the wage statements, [or] what they purported to show versus what they should have shown." They assert that, at most, the complaint shows that the "'violation' was to omit the same de minimis 'uniform time'" that forms the basis of Pruitt's other Labor Code claims.90 Pruitt alleges that defendants "knowingly and intentionally failed to accurately maintain and furnish records of the wages earned by [Pruitt]."91 Viewing in the context of Pruitt's other factual allegations, it is apparent that he pleads the wage statements were inaccurate because they did not reflect minimum wages owed for time spent donning and doffing his uniform. Because, as noted, Pruitt's allegations are sufficient, at the pleadings stage, to give rise to a plausible inference that he was owed wages for donning and doffing that he was not paid, he has also alleged a plausible inaccurate wage statement claim because § 226 requires, among other things, that an employer "furnish each of his or her employees . . . an accurate itemized statement in writing [*42]  showing (1) gross wages earned, (2) total hours worked by the employee." CAL. LAB. CODE § 226(a). The court therefore declines to dismiss Pruitt's § 226 claim on the basis of defendants' first argument. The court also concludes that Pruitt has alleged a sufficient injury as required by § 226. Section 226(e) sets forth the injury requirement for § 226 claims. The version of § 226(e) in effect prior to January 2013 stated:
"(e) An employee suffering injury as a result of a knowing and intentional failure by an employer to comply with subdivision (a) is entitled to recover the greater of all actual damages or fifty dollars ($50) for the initial pay period in which a violation occurs and one hundred dollars ($100) per employee for each violation in a subsequent pay period, not exceeding an aggregate penalty of four thousand dollars ($4,000), and is entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorney's fees." CAL. LAB. CODE § 226(e) (2012).
The legislature amended § 226(e), effective January 2013, to "provide further clarity" concerning "what constitutes 'suffering injury'" for purposes of the statute in light of the "vastly different views" expressed by courts as to its meaning. Escano v. Kindred Healthcare Operating Co., Inc., No. CV 09-04778 DDP (CTx), 2013 WL 816146, *12 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2013) (quoting S.B. 1255 Bill Analysis). As amended effective January 2013, the statute states in relevant part:
"(e)(2)(B) [*43]  An employee is deemed to suffer injury for purposes of this subdivision if the employer fails to provide accurate and complete information as required by any one or more of items (1) to (9), inclusive, of subdivision (a) and the employee cannot promptly and easily determine from the wage statement alone one or more of the following:
(I) The amount of the gross wages or net wages paid to the employee during the pay period or any of the other information required to be provided on the itemized wage statement pursuant to items (2) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (9) of subdivision (a). . . . (c) For purposes of this paragraph, 'promptly and easily determine' means a reasonable person would be able to readily ascertain the information without reference to other documents or information." CAL. LAB. CODE § 226(e).
In his complaint, Pruitt alleges that he "suffered damage" as a result of defendants' failure to furnish accurate, itemized wage statements.92 Contrary to defendants' assertion,93 Pruitt does allege "what was inaccurate about the wage statements" or "what they purported to show versus what they should have shown." He pleads that he was damaged by defendants' failure to "maintain accurate records of . . . wages earned at each hourly rate and the [*44]  accurate number of total hours worked," presumably because the wage statements did not reflect time spent donning and doffing his uniform.94 Based on these allegations, it is reasonable to infer that Pruitt's purported damages arise from his inability to identify, promptly and easily from the wage statement alone, the total number of hours he worked and the wages to which he was entitled. Such allegations satisfy the "minimal" showing required under amended § 226(e). Torchia v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 304 F.R.D. 256, 274 (E.D. Cal. 2014) ("[T]he [2013] amendment . . . clarified [the] prior version of the statute, to state that 'the injury requirement is minimal' for a plaintiff," citing Fields v. West Marine Products, Inc., No. C 13-04916 WHA, 2014 WL 547502, *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2014)); see, e.g., Contreras v. Performance Food Group, Inc., No. C 14-3380 PJH, 2014 WL 6481365, *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2014) ("Plaintiff alleges that the wage statements did not accurately show all wages earned (because of the piece-rate compensation system alleged in the second cause of action, and the failure to provide meal/rest break payments alleged in the first cause of action), which the court finds sufficient to constitute 'injury' under the statute"); Rosas v. Hua Ping Chang, No. 5:13-cv-01800 HRL, 2014 WL 4925122, *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2014) (concluding that plaintiff had sufficiently alleged injury under the pre-and post-amendment versions of § 226, where he alleged that "Defendants knowingly and intentionally failed to provide Plaintiff [*45]  with accurate, itemized wage statements in compliance with Labor Code § 226," and "further allege[d] that these failures included, 'among other things, not accurately showing the rate for overtime hours worked and amount of overtime pay, in each pay period and/or incorrectly reporting gross wages earned'"); Fields, 2014 WL 547502 at *8 ("Because West Marine allegedly failed to provide accurate pay-stub information as to the employees' rest-periods and meal-periods in violation of Section 226(a), plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 8. Accordingly, West Marine's motion to dismiss is DENIED").
As a result, the court concludes that Pruitt has plausibly pled a § 226 claim. The court therefore denies defendants' motion to dismiss the eleventh cause of action.

L. Whether the Court Should Dismiss Plaintiff's Twelfth Cause of Action for Failure to Pay Timely Wages Upon Termination
Defendants move finally to dismiss Pruitt's cause of action for violation of Labor Code §§ 201-203. They assert he alleges nothing more than that they failed to pay him wages for time spent donning and doffing upon termination, that that time is de minimis, and thus that it is not compensable.95 As discussed, the first amended complaint adequately alleges that defendants failed to pay Pruitt [*46]  for time spent donning and doffing his uniform each day and susceptible of the interpretation that such time was not de minimis. As defendants do not challenge Pruitt's twelfth cause of action on any other basis, the court denies their motion to dismiss the claim for failure timely to pay wages upon termination.

M. Whether the Court Should Grant Leave to Amend
The final question is whether leave to amend should be granted. "'[A] district court should grant leave to amend . . . unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.'" Doe v. United States, 58 F.3d 494, 497 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting Cook, Perkiss & Liehe v. N. Cal. Collection Serv., 911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th Cir. 1990)). It is well established that the district court not only has discretion to, but should deny, leave to amend where a proposed amendment would be futile. See Klamath-Lake Pharmaceutical Ass'n v. Klamath Med Sery Bureau, 701 F.2d 1276, 1293 (9th Cir. 1983) ("[F]utile amendments should not be permitted"). Cf. Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir. 1995) (stating that futility of amendment can, "by itself, justify the denial of a motion for leave to amend"), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1051 (1996). Where a court concludes that a pleading should be dismissed, however, it must afford the litigant leave to amend unless it is clear the complaint could not be saved by amendment. Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) ("Dismissal with prejudice and without leave to amend is not appropriate unless it is clear [*47]  . . . that the complaint could not be saved by amendment"). See also Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep't ., 839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir. 1988) (stating that the court "must . . . give[ a pro se litigant] leave to amend . . . unless it is 'absolutely clear that the deficiencies of the complaint could not be cured by amendment,'" quoting Noll v. Carlson, 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987)).
This is the first time the court has had opportunity to pass on the adequacy of Pruitt's allegations, and it appears he may be able to amend to state plausible claims for relief. Because it is not clear that amendment would be futile, the court grant Pruitt leave to amend the claims that have been dismissed. See Kendall v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 518 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008) ("Dismissal without leave to amend is proper if it is clear that the complaint could not be saved by amendment"); California ex rel. California Department of Toxic Substances Control v. Neville Chemical Co., 358 F.3d 661, 673 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[D]enial of leave to amend is appropriate if the amendment would be futile," citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).

III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated, the court grants in part and denies in part defendants' motion to dismiss. The court denies the motion to dismiss Pruitt's seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth causes of action, but grants the motion to dismiss the balance of the claims. Pruitt may file an amended complaint within twenty (20) days of the date of this order if he can remedy the deficiencies the court [*48]  has noted.
Pruitt may not plead new claims. Should the scope of any amendment exceed the scope of leave to amend granted by this order, the court will strike the offending portions of the pleadings under Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See FED.R.CIV.PROC. 12(f) ("The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act: (1) on its own; or (2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being service with the pleading"); see also Barker v. Avila, No. 2:09-cv-0001-GEB-JFM, 2010 WL 31701067, *1-2 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 11, 2010) (striking an amendment to a federal law claim where the court granted leave to amend only state law claims).
