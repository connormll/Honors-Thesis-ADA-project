Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
A. KATHLEEN TOMLINSON, Magistrate Judge:

I. Preliminary Statement
Darryl Jeffries ("Plaintiff" or "Jeffries"), appearing pro se, brings this action against Verizon New York Inc. ("Defendant" or "Verizon") alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. Verizon now moves for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety. The motion has been referred to this Court by Judge Bianco for a Report and Recommendation. Based upon my review of the record, the arguments advanced by both parties in their written submissions and the applicable law, I respectfully recommend to Judge Bianco that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part.

II. Background
The following facts are drawn from the submitted declarations and exhibits.1 In this  [*2] case, the Court construes the facts in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff since he is the non-moving party. See Capobianco v. New York, 422 F.3d 47, 50 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005); Woodman v. WWOR-TV, Inc., 411 F.3d 69, 75 (2d Cir. 2005).

A. Employment History
Jeffries served in the military from 1982 to 1988. See Supp. Decl. of Martin Aron ("Aron Supp. Decl."), Ex A ("Jeffries Dep.") at 33:4-7. After his military service ended, Plaintiff held some small jobs, including working at McDonalds, until he was hired by the Defendant in 1988. Id. at 34:19-25. At Verizon, Jeffries served as a Technician, working as a telephone installer repairman, until he was laid off in 1988 or 1989. Id. at 47:14-19. Jeffries was subsequently re-hired as a Technician in 1989, working as an installer repairman in Brooklyn for the next nine to ten years. Id. at 47:22-48:5. Plaintiff was reassigned to work out of Verizon's Garden City facility in 1999. Id. at 121:9-18. By 1999, Jeffries had become a manager. Id. at 122:8-9. Plaintiff was ultimately promoted to team leader six months later. Id. at 123:11-13. Then, in 2001, Plaintiff's  [*4] title changed to local manager of Customer Operations. Id. at 126:7-10. From approximately 2004 to 2009, the Plaintiff was moved to different Verizon locations from Yaphank to Westchester. Id. at 125:19-126:6. Plaintiff worked for Verizon up until August 2009, when he went out on FMLA leave related to complications from pneumonia. Id. at 19:14-18; 59:17-18; 168:20-169:10. A week before Plaintiff was set to return to work, he was involved in a car accident which subsequently prevented him from returning to work since that time. Id. at 49:9-18; 169:10-11.

B. Facts Related to ADA Claims
Jeffries states that he is disabled due to his hearing loss. Jeffries Dep. at 38:10-11; 40:20-22. According to the Plaintiff, his hearing was damaged while serving in the military, working on the flight deck and at the rifle range. Id. at 45:25-46:7. Plaintiff testified that he knew when he left the service that he had a hearing loss. Id. at 45:18-24.
In October 2008, the Plaintiff contacted Donna Barone ("Barone"), the HR Business Partner responsible for Jeffries' group, to advise her that he was having problems with his hearing. According to Jeffries, he requested an accommodation at that time. Id. at 60:11-14;  [*5] 134:22-135:17. It is undisputed that Plaintiff's exchange with Barone occurred on October 9, 2008, via e-mail. Id. at 137:7-138:22; 149:12-18. In that October 9, 2008 e-mail, Jeffries stated: "I have a need to self identify with the company that I have a [military] service connected hearing disability" and that the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") "is going to help me secure a hearing aid." Decl. of Martin Aron ("Aron Decl."), Ex. M; Jeffries Ex. 6. Jeffries' e-mail further stated that "I'm not sure if I need to ask the company to help me with this situation. . . . Please[] Let me know if I need to complete any forms, provide proof, or address any concerns." Aron Decl., Ex. M; Jeffries Ex. 6. Barone sent an e-mail to Jeffries that same morning in which she inquired "will you be requesting an accommodation?" Jeffries Ex. 6.
Later that day, Barone sent another e-mail to Jeffries telling him that his previous e-mail "doesn't qualify as an accommodation under ADA." Id. Barone continued, "[i]f you are looking for an accommodation under the ADA, please advise, I will send you the paperwork for you and your Doctor to complete and submit for review and consideration and/or approval, and  [*6] if special equipment is needed and approved you will receive it." Id. Jeffries responded to Barone's e-mail by stating: "Thanks for the information. . . . The VA is getting me a hearing aid, if i need a different model or another type of accommodation for work I'll let you know." Aron Decl., Ex. L. In response to this e-mail, Barone again stated to Jeffries "I'm not sure what you need. If you are going to request an accommodation under ADA, let me know and I will send you the forms and you can file them." Id. Plaintiff did not request forms or follow-up with Barone at that time. Jeffries Dep. at 142:18-21; 149:12-18.
On December 1, 2008, less than two months after his exchange with Barone, Jeffries was transferred from a Verizon facility located in Roslyn, New York, to a facility in Greenburgh, New York. See Decl. of Stephen Broderick ("Broderick Decl.") ¶ 12; Jeffries Dep. at 153:19-154:22. Plaintiff claims that in November 2008, he was informed by his supervisor, without justification, that he was being transferred to another job location in Westchester. Aron Decl., Ex. C. According to the Defendant, Verizon needed to transfer several employees from Long Island to Westchester where  [*7] additional managers were needed after reductions in force had been conducted. Broderick Decl. ¶¶ 6-11. Jeffries continued in his role as local manager when he was transferred to the Westchester facility. Jeffries Dep. at 168:10-13.
On February 6, 2009, just over two months after being transferred, Jeffries completed an Employee Accommodation Request Form ("Request Form"). Aron Decl., Ex. P; Jeffries Dep. 156:9-157:6. In the Request Form, Plaintiff explained that his hearing had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer effectively communicate in groups nor on the phone if background noise was present. Aron Decl., Ex. P; Jeffries Ex. 8. Under the section titled "Accommodation Requested" Jeffries wrote the following:
I'm requesting reassignment. I feel that I can better serve the business in a different position, where my hearing loss / issues aren't so promin[ent] as to effect my daily success at work or cause me to be carried by my peers. I have worked in many positions and can still be a value to Verizon despite my hearing disability if given the opportunity. I have worked over 20 years in both associate and manager positions, I'm sure that there's a opportunity in Verizon that  [*8] will accommodate me.
Id. Jeffries reiterated in the Request Form that he was seeking "[a] manager or associate job which doesn't have much phone time or include meeting in large groups" and specifically highlighted the "technician group setting" as an example. Id. The Plaintiff admitted that his goal was to be moved out of the "noisy garage" to which he was currently assigned. Jeffries Dep. at 157:13-16; 158:17-19.
The Request Form was submitted by e-mail on February 16, 2009 to the Workforce Intervention Team ("WFI") and Donna Barone through Jeffries' supervisor, Rafael Quintero. Jeffries Ex. 16; Decl. of Gina Spath ("Spath Decl.") ¶ 5. WFI was a small team within the HR department. Aron Decl., Ex. E ("Spath Dep.") at 25:8-9. The WFI was responsible for providing advice/guidance for employees in need of reasonable accommodations and to work with the local management and/or the local human resource department to provide reasonable accommodations. Spath Dep. at 12:3-16; Aron Decl., Exs. J-K. The following day, Gina Spath, Manager of WFI, e-mailed Quintero acknowledging receipt of the request and providing him with a medical release form. Spath stressed that "it is important to engage  [*9] Mr. Jeffries in the interactive process at every opportunity regarding this request." Jeffries Ex. 16.
According to Spath, WFI first attempted to determine whether there was an appropriate accommodation that could be provided to the Plaintiff by local management pursuant to Verizon policy. Spath Decl. ¶ 8. Quintero reviewed Jeffries' Request Form and advised WFI that "[t]here is no position available, within my Director's group, that would meet the accommodation request made by Mr. Jeffries. Mr. Jeffries is asking to be re-assigned." Spath Decl., Ex. 2. Since Jeffries indicated on the Request Form that he would be willing to work as a manager or associate and provided the "field tech" position as an example, WFI explored the possibility of Plaintiff working in a non-managerial position as a Field Technician. Spath Decl. ¶ 9. In particular, Verizon sought a medical review from Dr. Jerry H. Berke of AllOne Health, an independent vendor hired by Verizon, to determine whether it was feasible for Jeffries to be reassigned to a Field Technician position. Id. ¶ 10; Spath Dep. at 58:6-15. By letter dated March 17, 2009, Dr. Berke advised Spath that Jeffries' medical condition included incidents  [*10] of vertigo which prevented him from climbing heights greater than six feet and made him ineligible for a commercial driver's license. Spath Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 3; Spath Dep. at 61:10-25. One of the enumerated duties for a Field Technician was the ability to climb ladders or poles and work aloft for long periods of time. Spath Decl., Ex. 4. On March 24, 2009, Spath communicated to Quintero and Jeffries that Verizon was denying Jeffries' request for reassignment. Spath Decl., ¶ 12 & Ex. 2.
The very next day, March 25, 2009, Jeffries sent an e-mail to Spath indicating that he had learned from Quintero that his "request for an accommodation (relocation) because of my hearing issues was basically denied." Spath Decl., Ex 5. This e-mail, in which Jeffries also stated that he was looking forward to any assistance that Spath could give him, resulted in a further exchange of e-mails between Spath and Jeffries regarding "exploring alternative accommodations." Id. ¶ 13 & Ex. 5. Spath recommended that (1) Jeffries speak with his medical provider about his hearing issues and any equipment that may assist him with his job; (2) try to speak with the technicians in less noisy locations; and (3) apply  [*11] for other open management positions or discuss job opportunities with his manager or HR Business Partner. Id. ¶¶ 14-15, 19 & Ex. 5.
At the same time, Spath exchanged e-mails with Barone over a two-day period regarding the prospect of Jeffries laterally moving to a management position in a different garage. Id. ¶ 16. In one such e-mail, Barone mentioned to Spath that Jeffries advised his supervisor that he was not interested in a managerial job but only wanted to "retreat"2 to a Field Technician position. Id. ¶ 17 & Ex. 5. Jeffries denies ever saying that he was only interested in going back to being a Field Technician. Jeffries Dep. at 157:7-158:7; 159:12-160:8. In any event, Barone represented to Spath that she would explore the option of Jeffries making a lateral move to another management position. Spath Decl. ¶ 22 & Ex. 5. There is no indication in the record that Barone ever got back to Spath regarding this option. Notwithstanding this, Spath claims that to her knowledge, "no such position was identified despite genuine efforts on [Barone's] part." Id. Barone also advised Spath that a "retreat" was not possible since Verizon declared a surplus condition on multiple job titles,  [*12] including Field Technicians, with the Union representing nonmanager employees. Spath Decl. ¶¶ 17-18 & Ex. 5; Decl. of Donna Barone ("Barone Decl.") ¶¶ 6-14. When Verizon declared surplus positions, non-union employees and union employees in titles other than the surplus titles were prohibited from receiving positions designated as surplus. Barone Decl. ¶ 7.
The next exchange between Spath and Jeffries did not occur until July 8, 2009, when Jeffries sent Spath an e-mail inquiring whether "any opportunities have come in that might be good for a person with my qualifications." Spath Decl. ¶ 24 & Ex. 6; Jeffries Ex. 19. Jeffries noted that he had seen "quite a few associate positions" come through on the Verizon system. Spath Decl. ¶ 24 & Ex. 6; Jeffries Ex. 19. Interpreting this e-mail as one asking solely about retreating to an associate position, Spath contacted Barone regarding the "retreat policy for managers at this time." Spath Decl. ¶ 25 & Ex. 6. Barone responded that "[t]here are no retreats." Id., Ex. 6. Other than the above, Spath does not recall  [*13] having any further communications with Jeffries. Id. ¶ 28. Therefore, it appears that no response was ever made to Jeffries' July 8, 2009 e-mail.

C. Facts Related to Title VII Claim
Plaintiff states that he is Native American, affiliated with the Occaneechi and Tuscarora tribes. Jeffries Dep. at 21:23-22:11. Jeffries was a member and at one point served as chair of the Native American People of Verizon ("NAPV"), an employee resource group sanctioned by Verizon. Id. at 75:24-76:9. Every few months, Verizon held a Diversity Council meeting where corporate members and members from each employee resource group would gather. Aron Decl., Ex. Q.3 According to the Plaintiff, during a Diversity Council meeting held in September 2002, Ezra Singer, Senior Vice-President of HR, stated that Native Americans would never be permitted to attend the Development Leadership Institute ("DLI"). Id. Jeffries identified Joanne Gray as one of the individuals present at this meeting. Id. According to Gray — who was a co-founder of NAPV — the DLI was comprised of training and development initiatives offered to the employee resource groups. Aron Decl. Ex. G ("Gray Dep.") at 23:2-6. While Gray confirmed that during  [*14] one of the quarterly meetings Ezra Singer stated that there would never be a DLI program for Native Americans, she believed that this comment was made sometime in the Spring of 2007. Id. at 23:19-25; 24:9-13.
Jeffries also alleges that one of his bosses, John Fanning, was "not happy" with his ponytail and advised Plaintiff in March 2003 that "it was unprofessional, and did not look business like." Aron Decl. Ex. Q. Lastly, Plaintiff contends that in August 2003, while he was working in Yaphank as a field manager, another manager brought in from out-of-state "kept making inappropriate comments" and called him a "Buckwheat." Id.; Jeffries Dep. at 89:8-10.

III. Standard of Review
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a "court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and  [*15] the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of establishing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir. 2008). To determine whether the moving party has satisfied this burden, the Court is required to view the evidence and all factual inferences arising from that evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Doro v. Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n, 498 F.3d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 2007); Woodman v. WWOR-TV, Inc., 411 F.3d 69, 75 (2d Cir. 2005).
Where the movant shows a prima facie entitlement to summary judgment, "the burden shifts to the nonmovant to point to record evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact." Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 273 (2d Cir. 2006). "[T]he nonmovant cannot rest on allegations in the pleadings and must point to specific evidence in the record to carry its burden on summary judgment." Id.; see also McPherson v. N.Y.C Dep't of Educ., 457 F.3d 211, 215 n.4 (2d Cir. 2006) ("[S]peculation alone is insufficient  [*16] to defeat a motion for summary judgment."); Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, Bd. of Educ., 243 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) ("Even where facts are disputed, in order to defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party must offer enough evidence to enable a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor."). Summary judgment is mandated if the non-moving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Dobbs v. Dobbs, No. 06-CV-6104, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62382, 2008 WL 3843528, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2008) ("The Court's goal should be to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims.") (internal quotation marks omitted). However, if "there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the opposing party, summary judgment is improper." Fischl v. Armitage, 128 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Hetchkop v. Woodlawn at Grassmere, Inc., 116 F.3d 28, 33 (2d Cir. 1997)).

IV. Discussion
The Plaintiff's Complaint can be read to assert three separate claims  [*17] against Verizon. First, Jeffries maintains that Verizon discriminated against him based on his race/ethnic origin as a Native American. Second, Jeffries claims that Verizon discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability of hearing loss. Lastly, Jeffries alleges that Verizon retaliated against him after he had requested an accommodation.4 These claims and Verizon's arguments for dismissal as to each of them will be addressed in turn.

A. Title VII Claim
Title VII states that it is "an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). In this action, Jeffries claims that Verizon discriminated against him based on his race, which he lists as Native American.
Without addressing the allegedly discriminatory conduct, Verizon seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's Title VII claim based on the fact that Jeffries did not exhaust his administrative remedies. Defendant's argument is twofold. First, Verizon argues that Jeffries' claim must fail since his EEOC charge did not identify any race discrimination. Verizon further argues that Plaintiff's claim of race discrimination also fails because the charge of race discrimination raised in Plaintiff's Complaint was not filed with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory acts.
"Exhaustion of administrative  [*19] remedies through the EEOC is 'an essential element' of [] Title VII . . . and, as such, a precondition to bringing such claims in federal court." Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A., 274 F.3d 683, 686 (2d Cir. 2001). Before commencing a Title VII action, a plaintiff must file a timely EEOC charge. See McPherson v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 457 F.3d 211, 213 (2d Cir. 2006) ("Under Title VII . . . a plaintiff can sue in federal court only after filing timely charges with the EEOC."); Legnani, 274 F.3d at 686 (finding that, under Title VII, "a claimant may bring suit in federal court only if she has filed a timely complaint with the EEOC and obtained a right-to-sue letter."). "A Title VII claim is time-barred if the plaintiff, after filing a charge with an appropriate state or local agency, does not file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days after 'the alleged unlawful employment practice.'" Elmenayer v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., 318 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)).5 "This requirement functions as a statute of limitations . . . in that discriminatory incidents not timely charged before the EEOC will be time-barred upon the plaintiff's suit in  [*20] district court." Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., 159 F.3d 759, 765 (2d Cir. 1998).
Also "[p]ursuant to the exhaustion requirement, a district court only has jurisdiction over Title VII claims that are either included in an EEOC charge or are 'reasonably related' to the discrimination alleged in the EEOC charge." Wilson v. Family Dollar Stores, No. 06-CV-639, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23083, 2007 WL 952066, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2007) (citing Butts v. City of New York Dep't of Hous. Pres. & Dev., 990 F.2d 1397, 1401 (2d Cir. 1993)). A claim is  [*21] found to be "reasonably related" if the conduct complained of in the federal action "would fall within the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge that was made." Fitzgerald v. Henderson, 251 F.3d 345, 359-60 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). In making this determination, the focus should be "on the factual allegations made in the EEOC charge itself, describing the discriminatory conduct about which a plaintiff is grieving." Deravin v. Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 201 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and alternations omitted).
In the form Complaint filed in Federal Court, Jeffries checked off boxes indicating discrimination based on "disability" and "race." However, on Plaintiff's July 2009 EEOC "Charge of Discrimination," Jeffries checked off "retaliation" and "disability" as the basis for the discrimination claim asserted. Aron Decl., Ex. C. Jeffries did not check off race, color, national origin or any other protected category under Title VII. Id. In addition, the narrative attached to Plaintiff's EEOC charge only references events beginning in October 2008 — all in connection with his alleged request for an accommodation  [*22] based on a hearing disability and his transfer to a different facility two weeks after making such an accommodation request. Id. Verizon received the Notice of Charge of Discrimination from the EEOC on September 9, 2009, with Plaintiff's charge attached. The Notice of Charge, like Plaintiff's charge itself, reflects boxes checked off only for "disability" and "retaliation."6
Jeffries maintains that he included a Title VII claim in the charge filed with the EEOC, but that he inadvertently did not check the "race" box located on the form. Aside from this representation, the Plaintiff offers no evidence suggesting that the EEOC ever considered or investigated the purported racial discrimination now alleged in his Complaint. There is no mention of racial discrimination in the EEOC's March 26, 2010 Notice of right-to-sue. Aron Decl., Ex. B. In any event, Plaintiff's failure to check off the "race" box is not dispositive on the issue since a court may consider those claims that are "reasonably related" to the discrimination that was alleged in the EEOC charge. See Fitzgerald, 251 F.3d at 359-60; Butts, 990 F.2d at 1401. The bigger concern, and what the Court ultimately considers to be determinative, is the fact that none of the factual allegations of disability discrimination in Plaintiff's EEOC charge even infer, let alone reference, the alleged racial discrimination contained in Plaintiff's  [*24] federal Complaint.
"Courts in the Second Circuit have generally held that claims alleging discrimination based upon a protected classification which are different than the protected classification asserted in administrative filings are not reasonably related." Culbertson v. Charosa Found. Corp., No. 03-CV-3742, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21064, 2004 WL 2370686, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2004); see also Wilson, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23083, 2007 WL 952066, at *4 (concluding that the exception "does not encompass claims based on an entirely different type of discrimination from what was alleged in the initial EEOC charge"). Such is the case where a plaintiff seeks to have a race discrimination claim be designated as reasonably related to a disability discrimination charge raised before the EEOC. See, e.g., Wilson, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23083, 2007 WL 952066, at *6 (finding plaintiff's race discrimination claim not reasonably related to claims of disability discrimination, among others); James v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., No. 01-CV-1106, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43493, 2005 WL 1889859, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2005) (same).
While the Court appreciates the fact that Plaintiff was not represented by an attorney when filling out the EEOC charge, that factor has already been taken into account by various courts recognizing  [*25] the "reasonably related" exception to the exhaustion requirement. See Deravin, 335 F.3d at 201 (concluding that the reasonably related exception "is essentially an allowance of loose pleading and is based on the recognition that EEOC charges frequently are filled out by employees without the benefit of counsel" ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, based on what has been presented to the Court, there is no basis to conclude that Plaintiff's racial discrimination allegations raised in his federal Complaint are reasonably related to the claims of disability discrimination contained in the EEOC charge.
Even had the Court concluded that Jeffries' allegations of racial discrimination were reasonably related to the claims contained in his July 27, 2009 EEOC charge, Plaintiff's Title VII race discrimination claim would nonetheless fail on another exhaustion principle, namely, the 300 day limitations period for filing an EEOC charge. While it is unclear on what basis Jeffries brings his Title VII claim,7 the fact of the matter is that Plaintiff's Title VII claim is premised on three isolated incidents. These incidents included: (1) the comment from Ezra Singer that Native Americans  [*26] would not participate in Verizon's DLI training program; (2) the comments from Jeffries' supervisor about his pony-tail; and (3) the "Buckwheat" reference. The Supreme Court has held that "[e]ach discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002). Since the Plaintiff asserts that these three incidents occurred prior to 2004, which is more than 300 days before Plaintiff filed his EEOC charge, the Court finds that the Plaintiff waited too long to bring his Title VII race discrimination claim and is precluded from doing so now.8
Because Plaintiff's Title VII claim fails under either exhaustion analysis, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Bianco that summary judgment be granted in Defendant's favor on Plaintiff's Title VII claim and that this specific claim be dismissed.

B. ADA Claims
The ADA provides that "[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The Complaint alleges two separate ADA claims against Verizon: (1) failure to accommodate Plaintiff's hearing loss; and (2) retaliation. Each claim will be addressed separately.

1. Failure  [*28] to Accommodate
Under the ADA, the term "discriminate" includes:
not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.
Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A); accord 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a); see also Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 134 (2d Cir. 2008). To establish a prima facie case in reasonable accommodation cases, "the plaintiff's burden 'requires a showing that (1) plaintiff is a person with a disability under the meaning of the ADA; (2) an employer covered by the statute had notice of his disability; (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue; and (4) the employer has refused to make such accommodations.'" Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Rodal v. Anesthesia Grp. of Onondaga, P.C., 369 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 2004)). Once Plaintiff puts forth a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the employee's  [*29] proposed accommodation would result in an undue hardship. See Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997); E.E.O.C. v. Yellow Freight Sys. Inc., No. 98 CIV. 2270, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16826, 2002 WL 31011859, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2002).
Jeffries identifies two instances during his employment where he contends that Verizon should have reasonably accommodated his hearing disability: (1) after the Plaintiff contacted Donna Barone in HR on October 9, 2008; and (2) when he submitted his Request form for an accommodation on February 18, 2009.

a. Accommodation Request in October 2008
With regard to Plaintiff's allegation that a reasonable accommodation should have been provided to him in October 2008, Verizon first argues that Jeffries did not make out a prima facie claim because he has not established that he was "disabled" as that term was defined under the statute in October 2008.
As a threshold matter, the Court acknowledges that the scope of protection afforded by the ADA was expanded with the passage of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"). See McCowan v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 689 F. Supp. 2d 390, 398 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) ("The ADAAA rejects the Supreme Court's interpretation of the term 'disability'  [*30] in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999), and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002), and thereby expands the class of individuals who are entitled to protection under the ADA."). However, courts in this Circuit have concluded that the ADAAA does not apply retroactively. See, e.g., id.; Schroeder v. Suffolk Cnty. Cmty. Coll., No. 07-CV-2060, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52533, 2009 WL 1748869, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. June 22, 2009); White v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., No. 07 Civ. 4286, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35554, 2009 WL 1140434, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 27, 2009). Because the initial conduct placed at issue here by the Plaintiff occurred in October 2008 — prior to the January 1, 2009 effective date of the ADAAA — the Court must evaluate whether Plaintiff is considered disabled under the more demanding preamendment standard set forth under Sutton and Toyota Motor Mfg. for purposes of the 2008 interactions with Verizon.
Prior to the January 1, 2009 effective date of the ADAAA, the ADA defined "disability" to include "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A).  [*31] Concluding that no alleged impairment is a per se disability, the Supreme Court instructed that the existence of a disability is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. See Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 198; Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471, 483, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999). The Supreme Court noted that "[a]n individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person." Toyota Motor Mfg., 534 U.S. at 199. Therefore, in analyzing whether an individual has a disability, courts follow the three-step analysis set forth by the Supreme Court. See Colwell v. Suffolk Cnty. Police Dep't, 158 F.3d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998)). Under this analysis, a "plaintiff must first show that she suffers from a physical or mental impairment. Second, plaintiff must identify the activity claimed to be impaired and establish that it constitutes a 'major life activity.' Third, the plaintiff must show that her impairment 'substantially limits' the major life activity previously identified." Weixel v. Bd. of Educ., 287 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir. 2002)  [*32] (internal citations omitted); accord Fall v. N.Y. State United Teachers, 289 F. App'x 419, 420 (2d Cir. 2008). While not contesting that hearing loss is an impairment and that hearing is considered to be a major life activity,9 Verizon challenges Plaintiff's ability to show that his alleged hearing loss substantially limited his major life activity of hearing.
Prior to the ADAAA, the applicable EEOC regulation explained that an impairment "substantially limits" a major life activity when a plaintiff is "[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform" or  [*33] is "[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner, or duration under which [the plaintiff] can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform the same major life activity." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i)-(ii). The regulations recommend the following factors be considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity: "(i) [t]he nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) [t]he duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long-term impact, or the expected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(2). Lastly, "if a person is taking measures to correct for, or mitigate, a physical or mental impairment, the effects of those measures—both positive and negative—must be taken into account when judging whether that person is 'substantially limited' in a major life activity and thus 'disabled' under the Act." Sutton, 527 U.S. at 482.
Jeffries claims that his hearing loss is "progressively deteriorating" and "is not treatable with medication or other measures." See  [*34] Pl.'s Mem. at 22. Jeffries testified at his deposition that he has approximately 99 percent hearing loss in his right ear and 60 percent hearing loss in his left ear. Jeffries Dep. at 103:13-104:2. According to Jeffries, his hearing loss is permanent since it is "sensorial," due to nerve damage. Id. at 101:22-24. However, "[d]istrict courts in the Second Circuit have repeatedly held that a plaintiff's personal testimony which describes the alleged limits that affect a major life activity, 'without supporting medical testimony, simply is not sufficient to establish his prima facie case under the ADA.'"10 Sussle v. Sirina Prot. Sys. Corp., 269 F. Supp. 2d 285, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (quoting Douglas v. Victor Capital Grp., 21 F. Supp. 2d 379, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)); see also Missick v. City of New York, 707 F. Supp. 2d 336, 352 n.9 (E.D.N.Y. 2010); Baerga v. Hosp. For Special Surgery, No. 97 Civ. 230, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17201, 2003 WL 22251294, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2003).
Jeffries maintains that he has provided proof through his own medical records and Verizon's medical vendor that his loss of hearing and other hearing impairments substantially limit the major life activity of hearing. See Pl.'s Mem. at 21-22. To support his claim, the Plaintiff relies on the following medical evidence: (1) a March 17, 2009 letter from Dr. Jerry H. Berke ("Berke Letter"); (2) a January 13, 2011 letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA letter"), (3) a partial copy of a "Confidential Summary" dated March 23, 2010, from audiologist Lynn Janet Amsel ("Amsel Report"), (4) two pages from an August 19, 2009 Audiological Evaluation by Valerie Savarino ("Savarino Evaluation"); and (5) an August 23, 1982 Report of Medical Examination ("August 1982 Report"). See Pl.'s Exs. 9, 41. As an initial matter, the August 1982 Report and the VA letter do not offer any evidence as to the specific limitations of Plaintiff's  [*36] hearing. Nor does the Savarino Evaluation, standing alone, since it consists of nothing more than two pages of indecipherable test results.11
As for the Amsel Report, this document could be construed as offering support for the fact that Plaintiff's hearing loss substantially limited his major life activity of hearing. The Amsel Report indicates that Jeffries suffers from severe to profound hearing loss in his right ear and normal to moderate hearing loss in his left ear and that this hearing loss has significant effects on his occupation. See Pl.'s Ex. 41. Unfortunately, the Court is unable to consider this document since it constitutes inadmissible hearsay evidence. See Raskin v. Wyatt Co., 125 F.3d 55, 66 (2d Cir. 1997) ("[O]nly admissible evidence need be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment."); Fall v. N.Y. State United Teachers, 289 Fed. App'x 419, 421 n.3 (2d Cir. 2008) ("The unsworn audiologist reports offered by [plaintiff] constitute inadmissible hearsay evidence.").
The Berke Letter also lends support to the  [*37] fact that Plaintiff's hearing loss substantially limited his major life activity of hearing. In that letter, Dr. Berke states that "Mr. Jeffries has documented limitations in his communication skills due to significant and irreversible hearing loss." Pl.'s Ex. 9. Notwithstanding the content of the Berke Letter, Verizon maintains that the Court may likewise not consider this document since it also constitutes inadmissible hearsay. The Defendant is correct that unsworn letters from a doctor are generally not admissible. See Weltz v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. 3932, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17036, 2004 WL 1907309, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2004) ("Doctor's letters are inadmissible hearsay and may not properly be considered.") (internal quotation marks omitted); Burgos v. City of Rochester, No. 99-CV-6480, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22454, 2003 WL 22956907, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2003) ("The only medical evidence plaintiff has submitted or referred to are doctors' letters which are clearly inadmissible hearsay and may not properly be considered."). However, in the specific circumstances giving rise to the Berke Letter, the Court finds that this document falls within the category of statements "that are not hearsay" as codified in Fed. R. Evid. 801.
First,  [*38] Dr. Berke was hired by Verizon to offer his opinion on Plaintiff's request for an accommodation. Dr. Berke appears to be an outside medical consultant (referred by Verizon as an "independent vendor") engaged by Verizon to provide various medical assessments of employees when requested by Verizon. In order to render his opinion, Dr. Berke reviewed Darryl Jeffries' medical information. In light of the relationship between Verizon and Dr. Berke, the Court finds the statements contained in the Berke Letter to be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In particular, the statements in Dr. Berke's letter regarding Jeffries' hearing loss are being offered by Jeffries against Verizon and were "made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject" and/or "was made by the party's agent . . . on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed." Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C)-(D). In addition, the Court notes that Verizon has submitted the Berke Letter in support of its own motion. The Berke Letter is annexed to the Declaration of Gina Spath. See Spath Decl., Ex. 3. Although Verizon offers the Berke Letter to support its position  [*39] that Jeffries was not able to be reassigned to a Field Technician position, the Defendant has relied on this document in seeking summary judgment. Therefore, the Court finds that Verizon has waived any objection to the admissibility of the Berke Letter in light of the fact that Verizon itself has offered the letter as evidence. See Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 55 (2d Cir. 2005).
While the Plaintiff could have certainly helped his cause by submitting the Amsel Report with a jurat executed by audiologist Amsel or certified records from the VA Hospital or other admissible evidence establishing his disability, the Court finds Plaintiff's testimony coupled with the Berke Letter to be sufficient evidence to create a question of fact whether Jeffries meets the definition of disability under the ADA.12 However, despite raising an issue of fact whether he was disabled at the time, Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim based on circumstances occurring in October 2008 nevertheless fails because Jeffries never requested an accommodation at that time.
"[G]enerally, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). After reviewing the record, particularly the email exchange between Barone and Jeffries, the Court finds that no reasonable juror would infer that Jeffries requested an accommodation from Verizon in October 2008. The initial e-mail Jeffries sent to Barone merely indicated that the VA was going to help him secure a hearing aid. After receiving this e-mail, Barone, on three separate occasions, specifically asked Jeffries if he was requesting an accommodation. See Aron Decl., Exs. L-M; Jeffries Ex. 6. In response to one such e-mail, Jeffries indicated that the VA was getting him the hearing aid but, if another type of accommodation was necessary, he would let her know. Aron Decl., Ex. L. Notwithstanding this response, Barone again advised Jeffries that  [*41] if he was requesting an accommodation, he should let her know so that the appropriate forms could be sent. Id. Plaintiff did not respond or contact Barone again at that time.
Plaintiff's deposition testimony and opposition papers further evidence that no accommodation request was made in October 2008. During his deposition, Jeffries stated that he did not have a specific accommodation request on October 9, 2008. See Jeffries Dep. at 143:17-19. In addition, Plaintiff admits "he decided to see how he made out with the hearing aids he was to get from his medical provider" before initiating the accommodation process. See Pl.'s Mem. at 24. In light of the content of the relevant e-mails, coupled with Jeffries' admissions, the Court concludes that Jeffries' failure to accommodate claim regarding his October 2008 interactions with Donna Barone is without merit as no accommodation was ever requested.13 Therefore, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Bianco that Plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, as it relates to conduct occurring in October 2008, be dismissed.

b. Accommodation Request in February 2009
Jeffries also asserts that Verizon failed to accommodate him in February 2009. In this instance, there is no dispute that Jeffries requested an accommodation from the Defendant, namely a "reassignment," which was ultimately denied by Verizon.14 Notwithstanding this fact, Verizon contends that Plaintiff's claim fails since Jeffries (1) failed to identify a vacant position which Defendant purportedly should have placed him, and (2) unreasonably cut off the interactive process.
According to the express terms of the ADA, a reasonable accommodation  [*43] includes "reassignment to a vacant position." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). However, the Second Circuit has determined that "a plaintiff seeking to hold the employer liable for failing to transfer her to a vacant position as a reasonable accommodation must demonstrate that there was a vacant position into which she might have been transferred." Jackan v. N.Y. State Dep't of Labor, 205 F.3d 562, 567 (2d Cir. 2000); see also McBride v. BIC Consumer Prods. Mfg. Co., 583 F.3d 92, 97-98 (2d Cir 2009) ("An ADA plaintiff does not satisfy her burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that her employer could have reassigned her. Instead, she must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which she could have been reassigned."); Douglas v. Long Island Jewish Med. Ctr., No. 08-CV-1370, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77464, 2010 WL 3187929, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2010) ("An employer is not required to transfer the employee if no position is vacant."). A plaintiff bears both the burden of production and persuasion on the question of whether a suitable vacancy existed at the time a transfer was sought.  [*44] See Jackan, 205 F.3d at 567. The identified position must also be one for which the plaintiff is qualified, meaning he or she can perform its essential functions. See McBride, 583 F.3d at 98; Douglas, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77464, 2010 WL 3187929, at *8.
In this case, Jeffries specifically indicated on the accommodation Request Form that he was looking to be reassigned to a manager or associate position. Verizon argues that at the time Jeffries requested a reassignment in February 2009, he never identified any available positions to which he could be transferred. See Def.'s Reply at 7. The standard being proffered by Verizon here goes beyond what is required of the plaintiff to establish a claim for failure to accommodate. This Circuit requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that there was a vacant position to which he or she could have been transferred, not that a plaintiff must identify such a position at the time the request was made. See Jackan, 205 F.3d at 567; McBride, 583 F.3d at 97-98. Here, the Plaintiff has satisfied his burden. In addition to his July 2009 e-mail to Spath indicating that quite a few associate position vacancies have come through on the Verizon system, see Pl.'s Ex. 19, Jeffries has also  [*45] submitted proof of two managerial openings that existed around the time of his request for reassignment, one in Lakewood and the other in Morristown, New Jersey. See Pl.'s Ex. 20. During his deposition, Jeffries also testified that there were job openings in Virginia as a Dispatch Manager and DRC Manager job openings in Florida. Jeffries Dep. 160:9-19.
There is clearly a factual dispute between the parties regarding the accommodation which Jeffries requested in February 2009. Verizon insists that Jeffries never asked for anything other than reassignment to a Field Technician position. As a result, Verizon maintains that it could not reassign Jeffries to that job category based on his being diagnosed with Vertigo. Nor were they able to assign Jeffries, they argue, to any other non-management position since such a "retreat" would violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement to which Verizon was bound. Plaintiff, on the other hand, completely disagrees, as evident in his testimony:
Q. Is it correct that the accommodation that you were seeking was to be moved back to a Field Technician job?
A. Incorrect. Not correct.
Q. It is not correct?
A. No.
Q. Can you tell me what it was that you were looking  [*46] for, what accommodation?
A. I was looking just to be moved out of that garage. I was looking for an open dialogue with myself and somebody from Work Force Development or HR.
I know by reading that I could have been -- I needed to be qualified for whatever job I did. I was qualified as a Technician, I thought, except for my little issue with vertigo. I'm qualified as a Dispatch Manager. So I could have had just dialogue with somebody from Work Force Development, I would have gladly gone to DRC -- went back inside to the Dispatch Resource Center. Or I could have went back to the INR Garage as a Manager, or went back to my tools.
* * *
I was trying to get out of the noisy garage. I never asked to be transferred to a Construction garage. I enjoyed working for Ralph Quintero. He taught me. He is a very nice manager.
* * *
But I never said all I wanted to take was a Technician. It is a downgrade. I wanted to do a job that I know by the rules as an accommodation I needed to be qualified. I'm qualified as a DRC Manager, I'm qualified as a PSC Manager, a person that answers complaints. That is what I first did when I had got to Garden City . . . . There were other job functions I qualified for. That  [*47] was the accommodation I wanted, just to get out of the noisy garage that I never asked for.
* * *
Nowhere in writing do I ask to be a Technician.
Q. Did you identify any particular job that was vacant for which you believed you were qualified and wanted to be transferred to?
A. Yes. There were job openings in Virginia as a Dispatch Manager. There were actually -- I am sorry. I think I saved it. I believe I saved it. I thought I saved it, I couldn't find it. There were DRC Manager job openings in Florida.
Jeffries Dep. 157:7-160:8.
Verizon claims that subsequent to submitting the Request Form, Jeffries advised his supervisor that he was only interested in going back to a Field Technician position.15 Jeffries, however, vehemently denies that he ever told this to his supervisor:
Q. In or about March of 2009, did you have a discussion with your Management team about your hearing loss issue and what might be done to accommodate you, with Mr. Quintero?
A. I believe so. I believe so.
Q. Did you tell Mr. Quintero that you only wanted to go back to your tools, as you put it, being a Technician at that time?
A. No. I believe what I said to Ralph was, I needed a function that I was qualified for. And if  [*48] I had to, I would go back to my tools.
Q. So if Mr. Quintero was to testify in this case that you said to him that you were not interested in another Manager job, but you only wanted to go back to your tools as a Technician, are you saying he would be lying?
A. I am saying he would be incorrect he must have misheard me. As I said, Ralph is a good man. I don't think he is a liar. Somehow it must have been a miscommunication.
Q. What, if anything, happened -- tell me to the best of your recollection everything that you said to Mr. Quintero and everything he said to you in this March 2009 meeting.
A. I don't remember much about the meeting. Except I know that as I said to him, what I would say to him or say about that topic would be that, if I go back to -- I would never say only go back to my tools. That's not something I would say. That is not the only option I would want to have. The option I would want is to leave the building. I'm sure I said -- you talk to him. He will tell you. I said to him many different times in many different ways, that the building is no good for me. It is noisy in this building.
Q. Did you say to Mr. Quintero that you weren't interested in another Manager job?
A.  [*49] No. I don't know how -- as I said to you, I don't know how he might have misunderstood it. I know I said many different ways, this building -- they gave me a job there, three different jobs. Air compressors, what they call Air Manager, high-tech all-around diesel trucks all around loud things. And I explained to him. Once I explained to him about my hearing loss, he had a better understanding of what my situation was. And I took the time. I had to explain it to him because he had to try and explain it to other people for me. There was no direct line of communication. As I said, nobody came to me to hear me tell my story.
Id., 169:23-172:13.
Looking to the document itself, the Request Form clearly indicates that Jeffries requested a reassignment to either a managerial or associate position. Therefore, as noted, there is, at the very least, a factual dispute over whether there was a position to which Jeffries  [*50] could have been transferred.
Finally, Verizon contends that summary judgment is warranted based on the fact that Plaintiff unreasonably cut off the interactive process. The Court disagrees. The federal regulations implementing the ADA state the following:
To determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation. This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3); see also Jackan, 205 F.3d at 566 ("The ADA envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated."). At least one court in this Circuit has adopted the view that if an employee withdraws from the interactive process, that employee is precluded from later alleging that the employer failed to accommodate him. See Noel v. BNY-Mellon Corp., No. 10 Civ. 9143, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115828, 2011 WL 4633884, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2011). In reaching that conclusion, the court in  [*51] Noel relied on the following language from the Seventh Circuit:
A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith. In essence, courts should attempt to isolate the cause of the breakdown and then assign responsibility.
Id. (quoting Beck v. Univ. of Wisc. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996)).
Verizon argues that summary judgment should be granted in its favor since Jeffries unreasonably cut off the interactive process when he failed to respond to an e-mail sent to him by Spath in March 2009. As an initial matter, this e-mail was part of a back-and-forth Spath had with Jeffries after Verizon denied his accommodation request. The Court also notes that while Jeffries did not respond to this particular e-mail in March 2009, he did send another e-mail to Spath in July 2009 following-up on his previous discussions with her. Therefore, a reasonable jury could conclude that Jeffries never withdrew from the interactive process. Ultimately, Jeffries' failure to respond to the March 2009 e-mail does not provide this Court with a basis to conclude,  [*52] as a matter of law, that he caused a breakdown in the interactive process. See Sclafani v. PC Richard & Son, 668 F. Supp. 2d 423, 446 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (concluding that court was not in a position to find that plaintiff caused the interactive process to fail notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff did not respond to two letters from defendant and defendant invited further discussion after denying plaintiff's accommodation request). This is a determination to be made by a jury.
In light of the fact that Defendant has not provided the Court with a basis to dismiss Plaintiff's claim for failure to accommodate as it relates to his February 2009 accommodation request, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Bianco that summary judgment be denied on this claim.

2. Retaliation
Finally, Jeffries claims that he was subjected to retaliation under the ADA. Specifically, the Plaintiff alleges that within two months after his exchange with Barone, he was transferred to the garage facility in Westchester. Verizon contends that this claim fails as a matter of law because (1) Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation and (2) that Plaintiff's transfer to Westchester was a pretext for  [*53] discrimination.
The ADA forbids an employer from retaliating against its employees for opposing or otherwise challenging conduct pursuant to the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a). Claims for retaliation are analyzed under the three-step burden-shifting analysis set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Treglia v. Town of Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002); Weixel, 287 F.3d at 148. In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that "(1) the employee was engaged in an activity protected by the ADA, (2) the employer was aware of that activity, (3) an employment action adverse to the plaintiff occurred, and (4) there existed a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action." Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives., Inc., 183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 1999); accord Treglia, 313 F.3d at 719. A plaintiff's burden at this stage is de minimis. See Zimmermann v. Assocs. First Capital Corp.., 251 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir. 2001). "In determining whether a plaintiff has satisfied this initial burden, the court's role in evaluating a summary judgment request is 'to determine  [*54] only whether proffered admissible evidence would be sufficient to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a retaliatory motive." Sclafani, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 435 (quoting Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir. 2005)).
"Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment decision." Treglia, 313 F.3d at 721. The defendant's burden is merely one of production of evidence rather than one of persuasion. See Krinsky v. Abrams, No. 01-CV-5052, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38376, 2007 WL 1541369, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. May 25, 2007) (citing Fisher v. Vassar Coll., 70 F.3d 1420, 1433 (2d Cir. 1995)). If defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to "point to evidence that would be sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the employer's explanation is merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation." Cifra v. Gen. El. Co., 252 F.3d 205, 216 (2d Cir. 2001).
Verizon primarily challenges Plaintiff's ability to establish the last two elements necessary to make out a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA. Verizon first alleges that Plaintiff  [*55] cannot show that his transfer to Westchester constituted a material adverse change in the terms and conditions of his employment. Verizon's position, however, is a misapplication of the law. Unlike claims of discrimination, which limit what qualifies as an "adverse employment action" to changes in the terms and conditions of employment, adverse employment actions in the context of a claim of retaliation are much broader. See Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006) ("The scope of the antiretaliation provision extends beyond workplace-related or employment-related retaliatory acts and harm."); Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 165 (2d Cir. 2010) (concluding that "[p]rior decisions of this Circuit that limit unlawful retaliation to actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment no longer represent the state of the law.") (internal citations omitted); Solomon v. Southampton Union Free Sch. Dist., No. 08-CV-4822, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98252, 2011 WL 3877078, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2011) (concluding that the Supreme Court in White not only expanded the meaning of an adverse employment action in Title VII retaliation claims, but also in ADA retaliation  [*56] claims, as the same standard applies in both). The applicable test in the retaliation context is that a "plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." White, 548 U.S. at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, while the fact that Jeffries did not suffer a reduction in pay, benefits or title may be conclusive in a discrimination claim that there was no adverse employment action,16 the same cannot be said for claims grounded in retaliation. In this case, a reasonable jury could find Plaintiff's transfer from Long Island to Westchester — which significantly increased his commuting time and expenses—to be an adverse employment action in the context of a claim for retaliation.
Verizon also maintains that Plaintiff cannot show a causal connection between  [*57] any alleged protected activity and his transfer because (1) temporal proximity is not enough to show a causal connection, and (2) the decision-maker who recommended that Jeffries be transferred had no knowledge of his claimed disability or any request for accommodation. Both arguments, however, run counter to what is required from a plaintiff at the prima facie stage. Proof of causation can be established either "(1) indirectly, by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other circumstantial evidence . . . or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by the defendant." Gordon v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Braun v. Securitas Sec. Servs. USA, Inc., No. 07-CV-2198, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3808, 2009 WL 150937, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 2009). Therefore, contrary to Verizon's contention, a showing of proximity between the purported request for an accommodation and the transfer is enough to support an inference of retaliation. See Treglia, 313 F.3d at 721 ("The temporal proximity between this protected activity in February 1998 and the allegedly adverse employment actions in March 1998  [*58] is sufficient to establish the required causal link for a prima facie case."); Krinsky v. Abrams, No. 01-CV-5052, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38376, 2007 WL 1541369, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. May 25, 2007) ("The causal connection needed for proof of a retaliation claim can be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action."). Verizon's argument conflates what is required at the prima facie stage with what is required in order to show pretext. See Simpson v. N.Y. State Dep't of Civil Servs., 166 Fed. App'x 499, 502 (2d Cir. 2006) ("While the temporal proximity of these events gives rise to an inference of retaliation for the purposes of appellant's prima facie case, without more, such temporal proximity is insufficient to satisfy [plaintiff's] burden to bring forward some evidence of pretext."); Forde v. Beth Israel Med. Ctr., 546 F. Supp. 2d 142, 152 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (concluding that "while timing may be sufficient to establish an inference of discrimination," the close proximity of a protected activity and an adverse action "alone is insufficient to demonstrate a pretext").
Since temporal proximity is enough to satisfy the causation element of a prima facie case,  [*59] the fact that the decision-maker, who recommended that Jeffries be transferred, had no knowledge of his claimed disability or any request for accommodation is also not determinative.17 See Gordon, 232 F.3d at 117. The Second Circuit in Gordon was faced with an almost identical argument as the one being raised by Verizon here, namely, that the plaintiff must show that the individual who carried out the adverse employment action knew of plaintiff's protected activity. Id. In dismissing this argument, the Second Circuit concluded that "[t]he lack of knowledge on the part of particular individual agents is admissible as some evidence of a lack of a causal connection, countering plaintiff's circumstantial evidence of proximity." Id.
In this case, Jeffries was transferred within two months of his purported request for  [*60] an accommodation. See Jeffries Dep. at 153:19-25. In fact, Jeffries stated in his EEOC charge that he was notified of his transfer merely two weeks after communicating with Barone. See Aron Decl., Ex. C. Therefore, had Plaintiff requested an accommodation in October 2008, the above facts would be sufficient to infer a causal connection. See Quinn, 159 F.3d at 769 (finding less than two months between the protected activity and adverse action adequate to establish a causal connection), abrogated in part on other grounds by Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002); see also Gormon-Bakos v. Cornell Coop. Extension of Schenectady Cnty., 252 F.3d 545, 554 (2d Cir. 2001) (concluding that there is no "bright line to define the outer limits beyond which a temporal relationship is too attenuated to establish a casual relationship") (internal quotation marks omitted). However, Jeffries' prima facie claim of retaliation must fail as it is premised on a purported request for an accommodation in October 2008 which the Court has already found, as a matter of law, did not occur. Other than the circumstances occurring in October 2008, Plaintiff  [*61] has not articulated any other protected activity he engaged in that resulted in some sort of adverse action. Therefore, the first element of Plaintiff's prima facie case, namely, that the employee was engaged in an activity protected by the ADA, has not been satisfied.
Even assuming, arguendo, that Jeffries could set forth a prima facie claim of retaliation under the ADA, his retaliation claim would still ultimately fail. Verizon has articulated a non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's transfer to Westchester, based on its rebalancing of the workforce after a reduction in force ("RIF"). See Turner v. NYU Hosps. Ctr., 784 F. Supp. 2d 266, 277 n.19 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) ("A reduction in workforce and/or restructuring is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason."). Jeffries' supervisor Stephen Broderick declared that in the third quarter of 2008, he along with other directors was asked by their vice-president to provide the names of their lowest performing management employees to be considered in the RIF. Broderick Decl. ¶ 6. Within Broderick's group, four individuals including the Plaintiff were selected. Id. ¶ 7. Ultimately, eight local managers lost their jobs due to the RIF. Id. ¶¶ 8-9.  [*62] Broderick states that while Jeffries was not selected for the RIF, due to the number of employees in Westchester County who had accepted the RIF, it was necessary to transfer employees from Long Island. Id. ¶10. According to Broderick, Jeffries was selected since he was one of his lowest performing employees. Id. ¶ 11. Broderick also notes that other managers were relocated. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. Plaintiff has not rebutted these assertions
Based on the above evidence, Verizon has met its burden of production, thereby shifting the burden back to Jeffries to point to evidence that Verizon's explanation of his transfer was merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation. The Plaintiff fails to do so. Not only is the record void of any evidence that Defendant's reason is pretextual, but Jeffries does not provide any evidence to support the contention that his transfer was in any way related to his hearing impairment or any other activity protected under the ADA. Therefore, the record contains no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Verizon's stated reason for transferring Jeffries was a mere pretext for its real intention to retaliate.
Jeffries argues that the evidence  [*63] set forth by defendant for his transfer "itself presents questions of fact." Pl.'s Mem. at 30. However, Verizon's burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's transfer was one of production, not persuasion. Therefore, under the burden-shifting analysis, once Verizon met its burden, it was the Plaintiff's obligation to provide some evidence that Defendant's non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's transfer was pretextual. The Plaintiff has not done so. Jeffries also contends that "while defendant alleges that plaintiff was not retaliated against due to his disability, defendant has not set forth any evidence that no retaliation did in fact occur based upon some other reason." Id. However, it is the Plaintiff's responsibility to identify the ADA protected activity in order to make a prima facie case of discrimination. In the end, it is not Verizon's responsibility to present evidence to counter any and every hypothetical claim of retaliation based on an adverse employment action. Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended to Judge Bianco that Plaintiff's retaliation claim be dismissed.

V. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the Court respectfully recommends  [*64] to Judge Bianco that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to all claims with the exception of Plaintiff's February 2009 failure to accommodate claim. Counsel for Defendant is directed to serve a copy of this Report and Recommendation upon the Plaintiff pro se forthwith by overnight mail and first-class mail and to file proof of service on ECF.
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and (e). Such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court via ECF, except in the case of a party proceeding pro se. Pro Se Plaintiff Daryl Jeffries must file his objections in writing with the Clerk of the Court within the prescribed time period noted above. A courtesy copy of any objections filed is to be sent to the Chambers of the Honorable Joseph F. Bianco and to my chambers as well. Any requests for an extension of time for filing objections must be directed to Judge Bianco prior to the expiration of the (14) day period for filing objections. Failure to file objections will result  [*65] in a waiver of those objections for purposes of appeal. Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985); Beverly v.
