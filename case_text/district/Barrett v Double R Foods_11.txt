Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court is the defendants' motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. For the reasons discussed below, the motion to dismiss is granted.

I. Factual and Procedural History
On July 14, 2018, Plaintiff Craig Barrett was fired from his job at Ramey's Market Place. Barrett filed a Charge of Discrimination ("the Charge") with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on September 26, 2018. In the Charge, Barrett complained of a hostile work environment and harassment from the Ramey's Market Place co-manager. Barrett believed he was discriminated against and fired because of his age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He also alleged that "[y]ounger employees have violated store policy and have not been disciplined or discharged" and that younger employees "were not subject to harassment." [*2]  Docket No. 6, Exhibit 2. On January 28, 2019, the EEOC issued Barrett a Notice of Right to Sue under the ADEA. The notice indicated that the EEOC was closing Barrett's case and that his lawsuit under the ADEA must be filed in federal or state court within 90 days of receipt. Docket No. 1, Attachment 1.
Barrett subsequently filed a complaint in this Court on April 15, 2019. In his complaint, he alleges that the defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by ignoring requests to accommodate his disability. He also alleges that Defendants Keelan Jones and Monte Tullos made defamatory statements that led to his wrongful termination.

II. Legal Standard
A plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies before she may file her ADA claim in federal court. Patton v. Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., 874 F.3d 437, 443 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 1996) (per curiam)). She must "file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of 'the alleged unlawful employment practice.'" Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)).

III. Discussion
Barrett's complaint before this Court alleges that defendants violated the ADA by failing to accommodate his disability. The Charge filed with the EEOC alleged the defendants violated the ADEA by discriminating against Barrett based on his age. The ADA and the ADEA are two distinct statutes [*3]  — exhaustion of administrative remedies under one does not constitute exhaustion under the other.
Barrett did not file a Charge of Discrimination under the ADA with the EEOC, and the Charge he did file does not list any allegations that could be construed as a claim under the ADA. See Docket No. 6, Exhibit 2. Because Barrett's administrative remedies are not yet exhausted, his ADA claims cannot proceed in federal court.
Furthermore, a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of the incident in question. Given that Barrett's employment with Ramey's Market Place ended on July 14, 2018, any claims he may have had under the ADA against Ramey's Market Place are now time-barred.

IV. Conclusion
The motion to dismiss is granted. All ADA related claims against the defendants are dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c), because the remaining claims against Defendant Jones and Defendant Tullos are rooted in Mississippi state law, they are dismissed without prejudice. Should the plaintiff wish to pursue these defamation claims, he may do so in the appropriate state court.
A separate final judgment will issue on this day.
SO ORDERED, this the 3rd day of March, 2020. [*4]
