REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS OF THE DEFENDANT TDCJ
The Plaintiff Robert Back, an inmate of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division proceeding pro se, filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA) complaining of alleged violations of his rights. The lawsuit has been referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1) and (3) and the Amended Order for the Adoption of Local Rules for the Assignment of Duties to United States Magistrate Judges. The named defendants are the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions [*2]  Division and the University of Texas Medical Branch. This Report concerns the motions to dismiss filed by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division.1

I. Background

A. The Plaintiff's Complaint
Back states that he has been under the care of the Brace and Limb Clinic of the University of Texas Medical Branch, receiving bracing for his left leg disabilities and impairments. He was seen and evaluated by a specialist he identifies as "Mr. Zack" in late 2015. He told Zack that he was experiencing further injury and pain from the bracing, and Zack told him that the correct bracing was a knee-ankle-foot orthotic brace, known as a KAFO brace. Zack told him that Back had to be approved by a referral from Dr. Niak at the Jester Unit. Back asked for a referral to Dr. Niak, but has never seen him.
In January of 2016, Back complained of continuing pain and injury from his bracing, and the complaint was forwarded to Dr. Kendall at the Beto Unit. Dr. Kendall responded that under UTMB policy, Back was required to have a job or be in a vocational class in order for bracing over $1000 to be issued.
Back states that the University of Texas Medical Branch charges a medical [*3]  co-pay of $100 for the rendering of services, which he claims is "basically a contract." However, he maintains that the co-pay fee is a means to extort money from prisoners for services that UTMB has no intention of providing, based on the fact that he is physically unable to work based upon his physical limitations.
Thus, Back states that persons needing bracing over $1000 who are able to work are accommodated because they are not disabled, but because he cannot work, he is refused the bracing based on his disabilities. He argues this is a violation of his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Back also contends that he was unable to file grievances raising his allegation that these actions were criminal and amounted to extortion; he states that this amounts to "engaging in organized corrupt activities or omissions of civil or criminal nature to aid or encourage one another in acting in a combination as an enterprise of continuing violations in connection with the alleged violations of the ADA and RA." He also alleges a conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1985.
Back states that according to the grievance record, he was transferred to his current unit of assignment, which was the Powledge [*4]  Unit, so that he will receive the accommodations he requires for his disability-related needs.
For relief, Back asks for declaratory and unspecified equitable relief as well as compensatory damages and a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation into the criminal extortions. At the conclusion of the memorandum of law attached to his complaint, Back asks specifically for a declaratory judgment that: (1) UTMB and TDCJ-CID, acting in a collaboration scheme," violated the ADA and RA as well as the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) UTMB and TDCJ-CID aided and assisted one another's conduct through an "organized activity of numerous parties;" (3) it was the intentional and wanton intent to cause actual physical injury and pain to Back and to violate his rights; (4) it is necessary to take Back into federal custody if UTMB and TDCJ-CID fail to stop their conduct and fail to assist Back in his disability and mobility related needs. Back also asks for $50,000.00 in compensatory damages against UTMB and $50,000.00 in compensatory damages against TDCJ-CID.

2. The Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law
In an attached memorandum of law, Back argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to cases under the ADA and RA. He states [*5]  that under UTMB policy, bracing over $1000 will not be issued to Back if he cannot work; instead, he has substandard bracing which causes additional pain and injury. He argues that this policy is discriminatory based on disability and therefore null and void, and amounts to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Back further contends that TDCJ-CID officials refused to file his grievance, which he construes as showing intent to evade responsibility in the face of allegations which are true.

3. The Plaintiff's Exhibits
The first exhibit attached to the complaint is a health summary for classification form, known as an HS-18. This form shows that Back has no restrictions on facility assignment, no restrictions on his basic housing assignment, restrictions limiting him to ground floor only and bottom bunk only, and work assignments showing that he can perform only sedentary work, with no lifting over 10 pounds, no repetitive squatting, no climbing, and no walking on uneven surfaces. The form also shows that as of its date, January 3, 2013, Back was medically unassigned. He had no restrictions for the disciplinary process and did not have an individualized treatment plan or [*6]  transportation restrictions.
The next exhibit is the I-60 inmate request form from Back to Dr. Kendall. This form reads as follows:
Dr. Kendall, please be advised and advise Zack as well, I am still having problems with my braces. I was told by Zack he would refer me to Dr. Niak for possible approval for the KAFO Brace. You as well stated I had the type of and severity of the nerve damage and amount of atrophy, it would do no good to attempt to rehabilitate the leg. Even though I have no job assignment, I am still entitled to enjoy life's major activity of walking as those who are physically able to perform work functions. These braces are causing me a lot of pain butting up against each other and rubbing on my ankle. Thank you.
A note on the bottom reflects that the message was emailed to Dr. Kendall. The reply reads as follows:
The policy clearly states you must have a job or be in a vocational class in order for bracing over $1000 to be issued. At Powledge, they are aware and can provide you with a job built around your problem.
Back's third exhibit is a grievance complaining of discrimination under the ADA and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). [*7]  The grievance was screened (i.e. returned unprocessed) as being a submission in excess of one grievance every seven days, with a notation on the bottom saying "Application of the screening criteria for this grievance is not expected to adversely affect the offender's health."
Back's fourth exhibit is a letter from an attorney to a TDCJ investigator with the Patient Liaison Program dated September 10, 2012, complaining that Back is being denied braces and medical boots because he is unable to work.
In a "statement of additional facts" attached to a motion for preliminary injunctive relief, Back states that on March 18, 2016, he received a TDCJ lay-in pass to pick up indigent hygiene supplies. He noticed on the pass that his job assignment had changed from "medically unassigned" to "inside medical squad," with work hours from 00:00 to 00:00. Back contends that this shows he has no job hours, but has simply been given a "job assignment description" to prevent him from raising legitimate claims of discrimination.

II. TDCJ-CID's Motions to Dismiss
In its motions to dismiss, TDCJ-CID argues that Back's claims are frivolous on their face because he was told he had to have a job or take a vocational [*8]  class in order to obtain bracing and he never alleges that he is unable to take a vocational class, nor that requiring such a class unlawfully discriminates against him on the basis of his disability. TDCJ-CID also points out that according to Back's HS-18 form, attached as an exhibit to his complaint, he is able to perform sedentary work and thus is not unable to hold a job as he claims. Instead, TDCJ-CID contends that Back's evidence shows that TDCJ-CID accommodated his needs to the point of creating a job for him without any work hours in order to help him meet the policy requirements for the KAFO brace.
In any event, TDCJ-CID contends that as a state agency, it is immune from awards of monetary damages and that in order to overcome sovereign immunity under the ADA, he must show conduct which independently violates the Fourteenth Amendment, which Back failed to do. In order to obtain compensatory damages under the ADA, a plaintiff must show intentional discrimination, which Back likewise failed to do.
To the extent Back complains of criminal violations, TDCJ-CID argues that he does not have a right to have any other person criminally prosecuted. His civil conspiracy claim under §1985 fails because the action [*9]  was filed against TDCJ-CID, not any person, and the statute requires a showing of a conspiracy between "two or more persons."
Next, TDCJ-CID maintains that Back has failed to set out a valid cause of action under the ADA because his allegations demonstrate TDCJ-CID's efforts to accommodate him and do not show any discrimination against him by TDCJ-CID. Instead, he complains that he was transferred to another unit to receive needed accommodations and given a job change to help him qualify for the brace.
To the extent Back raises claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983, including deliberate indifference, TDCJ-CID argues that it has sovereign immunity and that Back has not shown deliberate indifference in any event. Nor does Back have any constitutional right in having his grievances resolved to his satisfaction. TDCJ-CID thus argues that Back's lawsuit should be dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

III. Back's Response to the Motions to Dismiss
In his response, Back sketches out the facts and states that the UTMB policy is designed to discriminate by basing a disability need for the brace on whether he can work or go to school, or even chooses to or not. He contends [*10]  that whether or not he works or goes to school, he is entitled not to be discriminated against or denied the ability to perform basic life functions such as walking. He argues that his medically unassigned status was designated as permanent and thus overrules the "sedentary work" status. Even though it appears that the "medically unassigned" status has been lifted, Back argues that he still has the same disabilities which occasioned the unassigned status.
Back acknowledges that TDCJ-CID has now provided him with a job assignment which operates to supposedly assist him in meeting the policy criteria for obtaining braces, but appears to allege that neither TDCJ-CID nor UTMB has tried to ensure that he receive the bracing for which he now ostensibly qualifies. Back argues this shows TDCJ-CID did not act in good faith.
Back further contends that he is entitled to report criminal actions to the court which are cognizable under federal law and that TDCJ-CID's argument it is not a person fails because TDCJ CID is a "corporate entity" which may be sued as a person. If TDCJ-CID is not a person, Back argues that it cannot testify by declaration, rendering his version of the facts unrebuttable. [*11]  He maintains that he has set out a viable claim under the ADA and again complains that he has not received a brace despite being allegedly given a job to qualify him for one. With regard to his grievances, Back asserts that he is not complaining his grievances were not resolved to his satisfaction, but that he was denied procedural due process in the fact that his grievance was not addressed.

IV. Prior Litigation History
In cause no. 6:14cv301, filed in the Western District of Texas, Back sued TDCJ-CID, UTMB, and two officials at the Hughes Unit, Valencia Pollard and Teri Smith. He complained that he is disabled in his left leg and has been under the care of the Brace and Limb Clinic. According to Back's complaint, on September 5, 2012, the medical director at the Hughes Unit, Dr. Greene, referred Back to the Brace and Limb Clinic to replace his orthotic footwear; however, on September 10, 2012, the Brace and Limb Clinic denied the referral because Back did not have a job.
When Back filed grievances, the Step Two response stated that an expedited prosthesis specialty referral was submitted on his behalf on January 3, 2013, which referral had been approved. Back asserted that on January [*12]  31, 2013, a specialist at the Brace and Limb Clinic determined that he should not have been denied the requested footwear and braces. He also complained of being denied a medical storage box.
In ruling on the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas concluded that Back was denied a benefit on September 10, 2012, when he was denied a referral to the Brace and Limb Clinic, but that he cannot show that this onetime denial of access to the clinic was based on his disability; instead, the summary judgment evidence showed that Back was denied the referral because his footwear was assigned on June 23, 2011, and should still be in good condition because Back was not working. Even if representatives of the Brace and Limb Clinic were negligent in failing to review the judgment of Dr. Greene, Back failed to show intentional discrimination and thus cannot obtain compensatory damages under the ADA or the RA. The court further determined that Back's §1983 claims against TDCJ and UTMB were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The district court therefore granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Back's appeal of this decision remains pending.
In cause no. 6:16cv15, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185483 (E.D.Tex., July 24, 2016), [*13]  Back complained that he was denied a medical storage box at the Powledge Unit, with the result that he was deprived of legal paperwork for over a month. He asserted that the denial of the storage box violated the ADA. This Court permitted him to proceed on his ADA claims, but ultimately dismissed the complaint because Back's claims for equitable relief became moot upon his transfer to another unit, while his claims for compensatory and punitive damages failed because he did not allege facts showing intentional discrimination and because his claims were barred by sovereign immunity.

V. Legal Standards and Analysis

1. The ADA Claim
Title II of the ADA provides that individuals with disabilities may not be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. Frame v. City of Arlington, 657 F.3d 215, 223 (5th Cir. 2011). Title II thus imposes an obligation on public entities to make reasonable accommodations or modifications for disabled prisoners, including prisoners. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004).
To state a claim under Title II of the ADA, a plaintiff must allege that he has a qualifying disability, that he is being denied the benefits of services, programs, [*14]  or activities for which the public entity is responsible, or is otherwise discriminated against by the public entity, and that such discrimination is by reason of his disability. Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2011); see also Davidson v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 91 F. App'x 963, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5180, 2004 WL 542206 (5th Cir., 2004) (affirming dismissal of ADA lawsuit where plaintiff failed to show that he was adversely treated because of his handicap); Shaw v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 46 F.App'x 225, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 16842, 2002 WL 1939847 (5th Cir., 2002) (inmate denied participation in program for handicapped prisoners because of a notation in his record labeling him a member of a militant organization failed to show an ADA violation because the adverse treatment was not due to his disability). In order to obtain compensatory damages for violations of the ADA or the RA, a plaintiff must show intentional discrimination. Delano-Pyle v. Victoria County, Texas, 302 F.3d 567, 575 (5th Cir. 2002).
The causation requirements for the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act differ in that the ADA prohibits discrimination by reason of disability, while the Rehabilitation Act premises liability only on discrimination which was solely by reason of a person's disability. See Soledad v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, 304 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2002). Other than causation, the rights and remedies afforded plaintiffs under Title II of the ADA are almost entirely duplicative of those provided under §504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Bennett-Nelson v. Louisiana Board of Regents, 431 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir. 2005).
The Supreme Court has set out a three-part [*15]  test to determine whether or not Title II of the ADA abrogates a state's sovereign immunity. United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 159, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006). First, the district court must consider which aspects of the State's alleged conduct violated Title II. After making this determination, the court must ask to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment. If the State's conduct violated both Title II and the Fourteenth Amendment, then Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity. See also Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 498 (5th Cir. 2011). If the conduct only violates Title II and not the Fourteenth Amendment, the court must then consider whether Congress' purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid. Id.
According to Back's pleadings, he was advised through the grievance procedure that he was transferred to the Powledge Unit so that he could receive the accommodations that he required. The I-60 which he attaches contains a response stating that he had to have a job or be enrolled in a vocational class in order to obtain bracing over $1000, and that officials at the Powledge Unit were aware of this requirement and could provide him with a job built around his needs. Back further alleges that he was given a job designated as "inside medical squad" which had no designated working [*16]  hours. He asserts that this was done to prevent him from bringing his complaint, but fails to show why this designation would not satisfy the requirement that he have a job in order to receive the bracing.
Back does not allege that he contacted the University of Texas Medical Branch or any medical personnel to advise them that he had a job as required by policy and therefore qualified for bracing. Nor does he provide any basis upon which to conclude that officials at the Powledge Unit, knowing he needed a job to qualify for bracing, gave him a job with no set working hours in order to discriminate against him. Back does not allege that he ever had to show up for work in the "inside medical squad," much less that any such work was beyond his physical capacity; evidence in other cases has indicated that assignments to an "inside medical squad" require no work. See, e.g., Dayne v. Stephens, civil action no. 6:14cv262, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184044, 2015 WL 3561292 (E.D.Tex., June 3, 2015) (plaintiff assigned to an inside medical squad which did no work); Witt v. Bell, civil action no. 9:13cv55, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79824, 2013 WL 2468736 (E.D.Tex., June 6, 2013) (plaintiff reassigned to inside medical squad and was not required to work after suffering a foot injury). Back has failed to show that TDCJ-CID officials intentionally [*17]  discriminated against him by reason of his disability and thus cannot obtain compensatory damages against TDCJ-CID. Nor do his allegations show a valid waiver of sovereign immunity.
Back also seeks a declaratory judgment that TDCJ-CID acted in concert with UTMB to violate his rights through an organized pattern of activity, with the wanton intent to cause physical injury and pain, and that it would be necessary to take him into federal custody if TDCJ-CID and UTMB fail to stop violating his rights. In order to obtain a declaratory judgment, a plaintiff must show that there is an actual case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution. Such a showing requires that the plaintiff allege facts from which it appears that there is a substantial likelihood that he will suffer injury in the future. This continuing controversy may not be conjectural, hypothetical or contingent, but must be real and immediate and create a definite rather than speculative threat of future injury. Bauer v. Texas, 341 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2003).
In this regard, the Fifth Circuit has explained that past exposure to illegal conduct does not itself show a present case or controversy for a declaratory judgment if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects. Society of Separationists, Inc. v. Herman, 959 F.2d 1283, 1285 (5th Cir. 1992), citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). In [*18]  Lyons, the Supreme Court held that an individual who had been subjected to a chokehold by police officers upon being stopped for a traffic violation lacked standing to obtain equitable relief because it was entirely speculative that police officers would stop him again and choke him without provocation. See also Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U.S. 171, 172, 97 S.Ct. 1739, 52 L.Ed.2d 219 (1997) (for a declaratory judgment to issue, there must be a dispute which calls, not for an advisory opinion upon a hypothetical basis, but for an adjudication of present right upon established facts).
Back has not shown a substantial likelihood that he will continue to suffer injury in the future, nor that he is otherwise entitled to a declaratory judgment in the face of the fact that he has failed to show TDCJ-CID violated the ADA or the RA. He is no longer at the Powledge Unit but has been transferred to the Darrington Unit, and his speculation that prison officials at the Darrington Unit will continue the course of conduct complained of is not enough to sustain an action for a declaratory judgment. Back's claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act are without merit.

B. Deliberate Indifference
Back acknowledges that deliberate indifference is a very high standard, but argues [*19]  that he is being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. He argues that the medical personnel at the Brace & Limb Clinic are aware of his medical condition, but have made a decision to deny him the proper bracing. Back further claims that TDCJ-CID staff at the Powledge Unit destroyed the grievance he submitted and refused to file instead, instead claiming that no adverse effects to his health are expected.
Deliberate indifference is an Eighth Amendment standard and thus falls under 42 U.S.C. §1983 rather than the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act. See, e.g., Walls v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 270 F.App'x 358, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 6103, 2008 WL 793792 (5th Cir., 2008). TDCJ-CID is an agency of the State of Texas and as such, is shielded from suit by the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity absent a waiver of this immunity. Harris v. Angelina County, 31 F.3d 331, 338 n.7 (5th Cir. 1994); Aguilar v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 160 F.3d 1052, 1053 (5th Cir. 1998). Back has offered nothing to suggest that TDCJ-CID waived its sovereign immunity with regard to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. See also Mayes v. University of Texas Medical Branch, civil action no. A-06-163, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39376, 2007 WL 1577670 (W.D.Tex., May 30, 2007) (dismissing deliberate indifference claims against TDCJ and UTMB as barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity), aff'd 294 F.App'x 137, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 20555, 2008 WL 4375778 (5th Cir., 2008).
Nor has Back pleaded a viable deliberate indifference claim even if he could overcome sovereign immunity. The Fifth Circuit has held [*20]  that deliberate indifference to a convicted inmate's serious medical needs could state a civil rights violation, but a showing of nothing more than negligence does not. Norton v. Dimazana, 122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Cain, 864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir. 1989). However, simple disagreement with the medical treatment received or a complaint that the treatment received has been unsuccessful is insufficient to set forth a constitutional violation. Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985); Norton, 122 F.3d at 293.
In Domino v. TDCJ-ID, 239 F.3d 752 (5th Cir. 2001), an inmate who was a psychiatric patient expressed suicidal ideations and the psychiatrist returned him to his cell after a five-minute examination; the inmate committed suicide two and a half hours later. The Fifth Circuit, in reversing a denial of summary judgment by the district court, stated as follows:
Deliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet. It is indisputable that an incorrect diagnosis by prison medical personnel does not suffice to state a claim for deliberate indifference. Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985). Rather, the plaintiff must show that the officials "refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs." Id. Furthermore, the decision whether to provide additional medical treatment [*21]  "is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 107, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1972). And, "the failure to alleviate a significant risk that [the official] should have perceived, but did not," is insufficient to show deliberate indifference. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 838, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994).
Domino, 239 F.3d at 756; see also Stewart v. Murphy, 174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir. 1999).
Back has offered nothing to show that prison officials engaged in conduct clearly evincing wanton disregard for serious medical needs. His pleadings and supporting documentation show that he was transferred to the Powledge Unit so that he could be given a job to satisfy a requirement for obtaining a brace, and that he was given a job on the "inside medical squad." Far from showing deliberate indifference, Back's pleadings indicate that TDCJ-CID officials attempted to accommodate him. This claim is without merit.

C. The Processing of the Grievance
Back complains that his grievance was "destroyed" and that he was not allowed to file it. He asserts that the response to his grievance stated that "no adverse effects to the offender's health are expected," but he was never evaluated by any medical personnel to make such a judgment.
Back attaches a copy of his Step One grievance, which was screened (i.e. returned unprocessed). The reason given was "submission in excess [*22]  of 1 every 7 days" and a notation written on it reading "#2, 699, special footwear/appliance issue." Another notation on the bottom reads "Application of the screening criteria for this grievance is not expected to adversely affect the offender's health," which was signed by a medical signature authority. The phrase "accept as original" is written at the top of the grievance form."
The TDCJ Offender Orientation Handbook, p. 75, in discussing grievance rules and procedures, provides that grievances which do not meet established screening criteria may be returned unprocessed. One of the screening criteria is "submission in excess of one every seven days." Back does not dispute that he had filed more than one grievance in the preceding seven days, but argues that the grievance should have been processed as an emergency because he complained of "criminal extortion."
The Fifth Circuit has held that prisoners do not have a constitutional right to have grievances resolved in their favor nor to have their claims reviewed through a grievance process that is responsive to their perceived injustices. Garrett v. Stephens, 675 Fed. Appx. 444, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 621, 2017 WL 128555 (5th Cir., 2017), citing Geiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir. 2005). The fact that Back's grievance was not processed to his satisfaction does not implicate [*23]  any constitutionally protected liberty interests and fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

D. Criminal Extortion
Back explains that the "criminal extortion" of which he complains is the fact that he is required to have a job or be enrolled in vocational classes to get bracing over $1000. He asserts that this shows organized criminal and civil corrupt activities in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
In order to maintain a civil cause of action under RICO, the plaintiff must show a pattern of racketeering activity connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an enterprise. In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741 (5th Cir.1993). A pattern of racketeering activity requires two or more predicate acts and a demonstration that the racketeering predicates are related and amount to or pose a threat of continuing criminal activity. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 441 (5th Cir.2000). Back's pleadings wholly fail to set out such a showing. In any event, his civil RICO claim is barred by sovereign immunity. Anderton v. Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, civil action no. 3:13cv1641, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185486, 2014 WL 11281086 (N.D.Tex., February 14, 2014), aff'd 605 F.App'x 339, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 4911 (5th Cir., March 26, 2015). To the extent he seeks to file criminal RICO charges, he cannot do so because private individuals do not have a right to file criminal [*24]  charges or to compel prosecutors to do so. United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); Oliver v. Collins, 914 F.2d 56, 60 (5th Cir. 1990). Back has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted in this regard.
Similarly, Back refers to a conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. §1985. This statute prohibits "two or more persons" from conspiring: (1) to prevent any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States; (2) to deter any party or witness in any court of the United States from attending court or from testifying therein; or (3) to deprive any person of the equal protection of the law or of equal protection and immunity under the law. Neither States nor state agencies such as prisons are "persons" within the meaning of §1985. See Small v. Chao, 398 F.3d 894, 898 (7th Cir. 2005), citing Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). This contention fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.

VI. Conclusion
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) permits dismissal if a plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) states a pleading must contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." The Supreme Court has made clear this pleading standard does not require detailed factual allegations, but does demand more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).
To survive a [*25]  motion to dismiss, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief which is plausible on its face. This plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility a defendant has acted unlawfully. When the complaint pleads facts which are "merely consistent" with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Montoya v. FedEx Ground Packaging System Inc., 614 F.3d 145, 149 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).
The Court assumes well-pleaded factual allegations to be true and then determines whether these allegations plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. However, this is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Thus, "threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice," and Rule 8 does not "unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. While legal conclusions can provide the framework for a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. Id. at 679; see also Hershey v. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., 610 F.3d 239, 245 (5th Cir. 2010).
In proceeding under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a plaintiff with an arguable claim is ordinarily accorded notice of a pending motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim [*26]  and an opportunity to amend the complaint before the motion is ruled upon. These procedures alert him to the legal theory underlying the defendants' challenge, and enable him meaningfully to respond by opposing the motion to dismiss on legal grounds or by clarifying his factual allegations so as to conform with the requirements of a valid cause of action. This adversarial process also crystallizes the pertinent issues and facilitates appellate review of a trial court dismissal by creating a more complete record of a case. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 329-30, 109 S. Ct. 1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1989).
Back received notice of the Defendant's motion to dismiss and filed an extensive response to this motion. A review of his pleadings shows that Back failed to plead factual content allowing the court to reasonably infer that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division can be held liable for the misconduct alleged. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Because Back's pleadings do not show he is entitled to relief, he has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted against TDCJ-CID.

RECOMMENDATION
It is accordingly recommended the motions to dismiss filed by the Defendant Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division (docket no.'s [*27]  17 and 18) be granted and the Plaintiff's claims against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
A party's failure to file objections to the findings, conclusions, and recommendations contained in this Report within 14 days after service with a copy thereof shall bar that party from de novo review by the district judge of those findings, conclusions, and recommendations and, except upon grounds of plain error, from appellate review of the unobjected-to factual findings and legal conclusions accepted and adopted by the district court. Douglass v. United Services Automobile Association, 79 F.3d 1415, 1430 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).
So ORDERED and SIGNED this 23rd day of January, 2017.
