REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Lisa Margaret Smith, U.S.M.J.1
Plaintiff pro se Purushottam Kalola ("Plaintiff") brings this action against International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Robert Murphy, and Vincent Granuzzo ("Defendants"). As modified by Judge Briccetti's February 4, 2015, Order (ECF 60), Plaintiff asserts the following claims against Defendant IBM under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"), the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), and the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"): (1) discrimination based on race and national origin in connection with Plaintiff's 2009 performance evaluation, (2) discrimination based on race and national origin in connection with Plaintiff's 2010 performance evaluation, (3) discrimination based [*2]  on race and national origin in connection with Plaintiff's placement on a performance improvement plan (PIP) in 2010, (4) discrimination based on race and national origin in connection with IBM's failure to transfer Plaintiff in 2009 and 2010, (5) retaliation in connection with Plaintiff's 2009 performance evaluation, and (6) failure to accommodate Plaintiff's disability. Plaintiff also asserts these claims under state law against IBM and individual Defendants Murphy and Granuzzo. Pl. Second Amended Complaint, ECF 15; Order on Motion to Dismiss, ECF 60.2 For the reasons that follow, this Court concludes, and respectfully recommends that Your Honor conclude, that Defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted.3

I. BACKGROUND
For the reasons stated in this Court's January 9, 2017, Order (ECF 204), all properly supported factual assertions in Defendants' Rule 56.1 statement are deemed admitted. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, the facts recounted below rely on Defendants' Rule 56.1 statement.4
Full-time employees of IBM prepare a Personal Business Commitment ("PBC") each year, which sets each employee's annual business and personal development goals for the upcoming [*3]  year. At the end of each year, IBM evaluates each employee's PBC and assigns a numerical rating to each employee's performance on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest score and 4 being the lowest score. A very small percentage of employees receive a 1 rating and approximately half of IBM employees receive a 2 rating. Prior to 2004, a PBC rating of 3 indicated that the employee achieved some/most of his or her commitments. After 2004, a PBC rating of 3 indicated that the employee was considered to be one of the lowest contributors based on the employee's individual performance and based on a comparison of the employee to his or her peers. A PBC rating of 4 indicated that the employee's performance was unsatisfactory.
IBM has an "Open Door" process whereby any employee can request that a senior manager conduct an investigation into the employee's complaint. An employee can also request a "Panel Review" process whereby a panel consisting of three employees and two managers (selected randomly), question the employee and his or her manager about a management decision which affects the employee.
Plaintiff is of Indian national origin and was employed by IBM as a Procurement Professional [*4]  in the Integrated Supply Chain Department from 1999 until he went on medical leave from June 2010 through July 2011. When Plaintiff sought to return to IBM in October of 2011, his position had been filled, he was unable to obtain another position at IBM, and his employment was terminated. During Plaintiff's period of employment with IBM, he was never demoted and his pay was never reduced.
In 2000, Plaintiff reported to Jeffrey A. Cohen. Plaintiff was assessed a PBC 3 rating for 2000, signifying that Plaintiff "Achieved some/most commitments." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 9.5 Mr. Cohen noted, in part, that although Plaintiff had established excellent relationships with many of his clients and that one of his projects would result in significant savings to IBM, Plaintiff could "improve his performance and contribution by putting additional focus on a number of additional tasks that are required of all sourcing professionals." Id.
In 2001, Plaintiff reported to Kurt Meiers. According to Meiers, during 2001, Plaintiff focused almost exclusively on one project and on trying to solicit positive feedback from his clients. Pl. Deposition, Ex. 10. Meiers noted that Plaintiff needed "to focus on spending [*5]  less time soliciting input from his client's [sic] about his performance and promoting his success on a single project and more time applying his skills to other procurement issues." Id. Meiers assessed Plaintiff a PBC 3 rating. Id. Alan Sullivan, to whom Meiers reported, noted that "excessive management time ha[d] been spent on trying to resolve [human resources] issues raised by [Plaintiff] on current and past managers." Id. Sullivan decided to transfer Plaintiff to a "new area to allow us to get a fresh start and let him focus on productive activities." Id.
On November 4, 2002, Plaintiff initiated an Open Door complaint regarding his 2001 PBC rating. Plaintiff made various assertions regarding his 2001 PBC rating, including that he had been given an unfair and biased performance review because of his race.
In 2002, Plaintiff reported to Robert Henke. In Plaintiff's 2002 PBC evaluation, Henke noted that Plaintiff delivered excellent "cost contribution results in 2002" and was "able to maintain a high level of client satisfaction while maintaining satisfactory business controls." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 12-13. Henke also noted that plaintiff needed "to focus on interpersonal skills including [*6]  his team work with other department members along with following the direction of his management chain." Id. Henke assessed Plaintiff a PBC 2 rating, which signified that Plaintiff "achieved/exceeded commitments." Id. In an e-mail to Sullivan dated January 6, 2003, Plaintiff wrote, in part, that he disagreed with the PBC 2 rating, that he believed the rating was unfair, and that he disagreed with the comments in the PBC evaluation. Id. Sullivan replied by e-mail on January 6, 2003, and wrote that although Plaintiff performed at a PBC level 1 in certain areas, he was assessed a PBC 2 rating because of his unwillingness to accept the management system and his interpersonal shortcomings. Id. Sullivan further noted that Plaintiff ignored his managers, that his perception of himself was "far different from others around [him]" and that on almost every occasion in which Plaintiff had been provided feedback regarding his areas of weakness he had responded by citing this feedback "as a form of discrimination." Id.
On January 27, 2003, Plaintiff supplemented his earlier "Open Door" complaint, and noted that he believed that his recent review had possibly been in retaliation for his having filed [*7]  a previous complaint. Pl. Deposition, Ex. 11. Plaintiff also concluded that he had been subjected to discriminatory and unfair treatment because the treatment was "contrary to good business thinking." Id. On February 24, 2003, Plaintiff submitted another supplement in which he elaborated that the basis for his claim of discrimination was that an individual who was less qualified than Plaintiff and who was "well-liked by management" had been given a particular assignment instead of Plaintiff. Pl. Deposition, Ex. 14. Plaintiff noted that "where friendship is the key to advancement and qualifications are ignored, those of us who belong to racial, religious and national origin minorities cannot compete on even terms." Id.
In response to Plaintiff's complaints, an IBM investigator spoke to Plaintiff and 15 additional witnesses. Jones Dee!., Ex. B; ECF 190, Ex, 1.6 The Open Door investigation upheld the 2001 and 2002 PBC ratings. Id. The investigator's 12 page report rejected Plaintiff's assertions and detailed numerous, specific examples regarding Plaintiff's issues with interpersonal skills, accepting directions from managers, repeated self-aggrandizement and teamwork. Id.
Plaintiff [*8]  remained under the management of Henke for the first eight months of 2003. During that time, there were numerous issues with Plaintiff's job performance including a continued failure to follow Henke's directions. On April 2, 2003, Henke sent Plaintiff an e-mail and follow-up memorandum in which he expressed dissatisfaction with seven "areas of concern," and noted that Plaintiff would be placed on a PIP if he did not improve. Jones Dee!., Ex. D-E; ECF 190, Ex. 1. On July 7, 2003, Plaintiff filed an Open Door complaint in which he asserted that the memorandum was in retaliation for Plaintiff having previously used the Open Door program and was the result of favoritism. Jones Decl., Ex. D; ECF 190, Ex. 1. An IBM investigator met with five employees and noted that, although Plaintiff was described by managers and co-workers as "very bright" and "technically very good," he was also described as "arrogant, egotistical, argumentative, belittling and belligerent." Id. The investigator concluded that there was no evidence of Plaintiff's claim of retaliation and recommended that Plaintiff be transferred to work under a new manager, Bob Bendernagel. Id.
On September 1, 2003, Plaintiff was transferred [*9]  to work for Thomas Forsberg, who reported to Bendernagel. On September 15, 2003, Henke sent Forsberg an e-mail with Henke's opinion of Plaintiff's performance during the first eight months of 2003, for use in Plaintiff's 2003 PBC evaluation. Forsberg Decl., Ex. A; ECF 189, Ex. 1. The e-mail noted that Plaintiff had exceeded his 2003 cost savings objectives. Id. The e-mail further noted that Plaintiff maintained a high level of client satisfaction. Id. Nevertheless, the e-mail recounted that Plaintiff had failed to work well with other members of the team and that many members of the department indicated that they would prefer not to work with Plaintiff. Id. The e-mail concluded with the observation that Plaintiff failed to follow the lead of his manager and often created a difficult work environment for his manager and teams members. Id. Notwithstanding this e-mail, Forsberg assessed Plaintiff a PBC 2 rating.
In 2004, Forsberg noted that Plaintiff's "accomplishments were few and did not lead to any substantive value to the client, Procurement or the IBM corporation." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 17. Forsberg and Bendernagel jointly concluded that Plaintiff's accomplishments were among the lowest [*10]  of all their employees, and assessed him a PBC 3 rating. Id.
Plaintiff requested a panel review of his 2004 PBC rating. Plaintiff also challenged the fact that Forsberg, and not Bendernagel had conducted the evaluation. On April 19, 2005, the panel upheld the 2004 PBC rating. In its report, the panel noted that it had been "provided extensive documentation" and that it had interviewed five witnesses — two at the request of the management team and three at the request of Plaintiff.
In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Forsberg assessed Plaintiff a PBC rating of 2+, which signified that he was an "above average contributor." Forsberg's reviews of Plaintiff during this three year period were positive. According to Plaintiff, in October 2006, he had a conversation with Forsberg in which Plaintiff asked Forsberg about the possibility of a promotion. During that conversation, Forsberg compared him to another Indian employee who "pisses people off as a leader."
In 2008, Forsberg assessed Plaintiff a PBC 2 rating, which meant that Plaintiff was a "solid contributor." Forsberg noted in the review that Plaintiff had achieved solid results, but that his contributions could be enhanced through "improved team [*11]  communication and collaboration." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 23. On January 25, 2009, Forsberg sent an e-mail to Bendernagel, in which he described the content of a meeting he had with Plaintiff the previous week. Forsberg Decl., Ex. I. At the meeting, Forsberg had informed Plaintiff that, although Plaintiff had achieved good results in 2009, there had been a number of issues with his performance including (1) poor interpersonal skills which added to tensions and inefficiency, (2) refusal to take management direction, and (3) poor judgment. Id. Forsberg also noted in the e-mail that he had received both positive and negative feedback involving Plaintiff, but that he had received five times the negative feedback from clients regarding Plaintiff as he had regarding the entire department combined. Id. Plaintiff had mentioned during his meeting with Forsberg that as an Indian, he had a "different style." Id. Forsberg informed Plaintiff that Plaintiff's issues related to individual and team effectiveness, not ethnicity. Id. In an e-mail dated April 7, 2009, Plaintiff thanked Forsberg "for the patience [he had] shown in 2008." Plaintiff further acknowledged that "there were issues during the last [*12]  year that I could have handled in a better manner." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 22.
Throughout 2009, Plaintiff had numerous issues regarding his interactions with clients, managers and suppliers. In January of 2009, Forsberg had received numerous complaints from various clients that Plaintiff had not been responsive to their requests. De Rule 56 Statement, ¶¶ 114-17. That same month, Craig Ignaszewski, Director of IBM's Integrated Supply Chain Equipment Technology Procurement group, met with Plaintiff and informed him that if he did not improve his performance it would impact his long term employment with IBM. Id. at ¶ 119. In April of 2009, Forsberg and Bendernagel moved Plaintiff into a new role in their group — lead buyer for procuring copper and precious metal requirements. Id. at ¶¶ 122-23. On May 1, 2009, Forsberg asked Plaintiff if he would take an expanded role and also handle Information Technology support. Id. at ¶ 124. Plaintiff did not respond and, after meeting with Bendernagel, declined to take on the project. Id. In June of 2009, Forsberg learned that Plaintiff had not been receptive to a client's feedback and that Plaintiff had reprimanded the client. Id. at ¶ 126.
In May of 2009, Forsberg [*13]  began reporting to Charles Maltrotti. Id. at ¶ 128. On September 8, 2009, Forsberg conducted a midyear review of Plaintiff and advised him that he was in the lower third of the organization. Id. at ¶ 129. In October of 2009, Maltrotti held a three hour meeting with Plaintiff during which Maltrotti shared his observations of Plaintiff's performance with Plaintiff and advised him that he was in the bottom of the group. Id. at ¶ 130.
In October of 2009, Plaintiff complained to Forsberg, upper management, and human resources that he was being harassed based on his national origin. Id. at ¶ 137. Plaintiff was unable to provide any examples of harassment. Id. According to Plaintiff, he expressed an interest in transferring. Id. at ¶ 139. Plaintiff testified as follows: "I tell them, you know, transfer me anywhere other than Forsberg, I can do better job anywhere I go. I gave them, you know, a big, you know, big entire USA. Just transfer me but they didn't want to transfer me anywhere." Id. (citing Pl. Deposition, p. 162). Plaintiff, however, did not apply for any particular vacant position at IBM. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 140.
On January 15, 2010, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to IBM's President and [*14]  CEO at that time, Samuel Palmisano, in which he asserted that there had been a "long-running campaign to discredit [Plaintiff's] accomplishments" in retaliation for his 2003 Open Door complaint. Id. at ¶ 141. Plaintiff concluded his e-mail by requesting that Palmisano help him transfer to another department or group. Id. at ¶ 142. On January 26, 2010, Plaintiff's complaint was sent to the appeals department and an Open Door investigation commenced. Id. at ¶ 143. On January 27, 2010, Plaintiff was assessed a PBC 3 rating for 2009, signifying that he was "among the lowest contributors." Id. at ¶¶ 144-45. According to Forsberg, the decision to asses Plaintiff a PBC 3 rating had been made prior to Plaintiff's January 15, 2010, complaint. Id. at ¶ 146. Plaintiff informed an investigator that he felt that the PBC 3 decision had been made in September 2009, when he was told that he was in the bottom of the group. Id. The 2009 PBC evaluation noted deficiencies in communication, collaboration, teamwork, leadership, following the direction of management, and problem-solving. Id. at ¶ 147.
An Open Door investigator spoke with Forsberg, Valerie Jones, Maltrotti, and four of Plaintiff's peers. Jones [*15]  Decl., Ex. I. The investigator upheld the PBC 3 rating for 2009. Id. The investigator could not find any evidence which connected Plaintiff's 2009 appraisal to his 2003 Open Door complaint. Id. The investigator's report noted that, according to each interviewed peer, Plaintiff was "self-absorbed," did not get along with "various people," and did not feel that teamwork was necessary. Id. The feedback from Plaintiff's peers was consistent "and ranged from his inability to follow department procedures, spreadsheet errors, verbal abuse, and attitude." Id. The report also noted that when Plaintiff was counseled by managers on how to improve, he responded "with defensive statements" and the assertion that he "was an expert that has mastered these key skill competencies...." Id. The report also noted that Plaintiff refused to be "trained, directed, measured, and assisted." Id.
On February 2, 2010, Forsberg e-mailed Plaintiff and noted that Plaintiff had declined Forsberg's invitation to meet regarding Plaintiff's 2009 assessment, and that Plaintiff had been avoiding a discussion with Forsberg. Also in February, Plaintiff declined assignments from Forsberg and was found to have significantly [*16]  overstated savings on a particular project. When Plaintiff was confronted about the discrepancy, Plaintiff responded in a loud voice and told the employee who had confronted him to "shut up." This exchange was corroborated by another employee who had overhead the exchange. The employee complained to Forsberg. In March of 2010, Rob Alley, an Advisory Engineer, e-mailed Jim Hannah, a Senior Engineering Manager, as follows:
Jim, just received a very disturbing call from [Plaintiff]. He accused Tom, Jane and Pete of talking about me behind my back, saying I was unable to run the plating subset etc. I've managed to run the plating subset for the last 6 years (with takedowns). Would someone please elaborate on this subject for me? And oh, by the way, I'm kinda tired of being in the middle of your little pissing contests with [Plaintiff]. Thanks....-Rob.
Forsberg Decl., Ex. V. Thereafter, Hannah e-mailed Forsberg the following e-mail:
Torn, I spoke with Rob at the end of the day and he was in a better state. Pete and Hannah had both spoken to him and there is a positive team dynamic within that group. From my experience over the years, with this latest being a very stark example, [Plaintiff] [*17]  is NOT a team player in action or communication, focusing instead almost exclusively on plays that he sees as self-aggrandizing, at times (like below) he acts in a manner that is, by design, destructive to the team dynamic.
Id. According to Plaintiff, in March 2010, Forsberg had told Plaintiff, "Indian dude, we got you, go back to your own county," regarding Forsberg's decision to promote and transfer other employees. Forsberg denies making this statement.
In April of 2010, Plaintiff failed to timely complete a spreadsheet showing the availability of certain materials. Additionally, the spreadsheet did not provide the information that Forsberg had requested according to both Forsberg and Kevin Dore, a Senior Manager. Dore noted that the spreadsheet was "incomplete and nowhere near what I would expect after 4 days of work." Forsberg Decl., Ex. X. Plaintiff explained that he needed additional assistance from procurement engineers to complete the project but Forsberg declined the request on the ground that Forsberg's request did "not require the Procurement Engineering support [Plaintiff was] requesting." When Forsberg forwarded Plaintiff's request to Kevin Dore, Dore replied to Forsberg [*18]  as follows:
Tom, Pm beyond words... He has been in the same meetings, has heard all the same conversations, knows as much about all the material lots that are on the horizon as all of the people working on this problem. If he hasn't understood that the priority [sic], he's beyond all help. I'll say the same thing that has been repeated at every meeting/call for days. The priority is to get lots of material that pass the spec. The lots made with 2 count raw material look to be the most likely to do this. The 1st lot of material that meets the spec will be the 1st to be used, the 2nd will be next etc... IF he's asking which will likely be the first — all he has to do is look at the spreadsheet it took forever for us to get from him (which he pushed off on DOW to do) that lists at what date each lot will have what test results. If he is unable to understand these simple concepts, or talk to other members of the team on his own and has to keep asking the supplier, you, I or my managers to do everything for him, then he has no value add [sic] to the team working on this issue.
Forsberg Decl., Ex. W. Forsberg had to ask another employee to complete the project. In April 2010, Plaintiff was [*19]  unprepared to present team results on a different project to a client and Forsberg had to postpone the presentation to the client.
On May 12, 2010, Forsberg offered Plaintiff the choice between a 30 day PIP and a performance-based severance package. On June 1, 2010, Plaintiff elected to proceed with the PIP. The PIP had no effect on Plaintiff's level of seniority or pay. On June 3, 2010, Plaintiff went on short term disability leave. In August of 2010, Defendant Granuzzo became the manager of the chemical procurement group at IBM. At no point did Plaintiff work for Granuzzo. In November of 2010, Granuzzo rated Plaintiff a PBC 4 — unsatisfactory — for 2010, based on input from Forsberg and Maltrotti. The PBC evaluation noted that "[t]he impact to our business from mentioned miscalculations, lack of teaming and misses on assignments ultimately affected procurement planning and performance in 2010 with inaccurate baseline assumptions, result outlooks and added resources required to rework calculations, perform added analysis and program support to recover and keep the team moving toward dept. objectives." Pl. Deposition, Ex. 47. In December of 2010, Plaintiff went on long term disability. In [*20]  July of 2011, Plaintiff advised IBM that he was able to return to work. In the interim, however, Plaintiff's position had been filled. IBM provided Plaintiff with a laptop for home use and access to IBM's system in order for Plaintiff to submit applications for available positions at IBM. Plaintiff applied for positions but did not receive any offers.7 According to Plaintiff, IBM failed to accommodate his need to work from home. Plaintiff acknowledges that no one at IBM ever told Plaintiff that he could not work from home. Plaintiff was terminated on October 20, 2011.
On March 6, 2015, and March 8, 2015, Plaintiff was evaluated by Psychiatrist Tracy Grant. In a report issued on March 19, 2015, Dr. Grant noted that Plaintiff [REDACTED].8

II. Standard for Summary Judgment
Under Rule 56, summary judgment should be granted "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 320-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A trial judge may, therefore, grant summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue as [*21]  to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 250. The inquiry performed is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact. Id.
Moreover, a court should "constru[e] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawn all reasonable inferences in its favor." Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Belize N.Y., Inc., 277 F.3d 232, 236 (2d Cir. 2002); Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc., 259 F.3d 91, 97 (2d Cir. 2001); see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 261 n.2. Thus, "[o]nly when no reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the nonmoving party should summary judgment be granted." Cruden v. Bank of New York, 957 F.2d 961, 975 (2d Cir. 1992) (citing H.L. Hayden Co. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 879 F.2d 1005, 1011 (2d Cir. 1989)).

III. Plaintiff's Intentional Discrimination and Failure to Transfer Claims
Plaintiff asserts that his 2009 PBC rating, his 2010 PBC rating, his placement on a PIP, and Defendants' failure to transfer Plaintiff were the result of intentional discrimination based on Plaintiff's race and national origin. For the following reasons, this Court concludes, and respectfully recommends that Your Honor conclude, that Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to these claims should be granted.

A. The Law
In evaluating a claim of intentional discrimination under Title VII, courts in the Second Circuit apply the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-03, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) [*22] . Under this framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. To carry this minimal burden, a plaintiff must show that "1) he [or she] belonged to a protected class; 2) he [or she] was qualified for the position; 3) he [or she] suffered an adverse employment action; and 4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent." Allen v. Murray-Lazarus, 463 Fed. Appx. 14, 16 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 138 (2d Cir. 2003)); Holcomb v. Iona College, 521 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2008). An inference of discriminatory intent "may be derived from a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to: 'the employer's continuing, after discharging the plaintiff, to seek applicants from persons of the plaintiff's qualifications to fill that position; or the employer's criticism of the plaintiff's performance in ethnically degrading terms; or its invidious comments about others in the employee's protected group; or the more favorable treatment of employees not in the protected group; or the sequence of events leading to the plaintiff's discharge.'" Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., 584 F.3d 487, 502 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994)), superseded by statute on other grounds.
In order to raise an inference of discriminatory intent by asserting that an employer treated a plaintiff less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside the plaintiff's protected group, the plaintiff must show he or she was similarly situated in "all material respects" to the comparator employee. Graham v. Long Island R.R., 230 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2000). As the Second Circuit has explained:
What constitutes all material respects... varies somewhat from case to case and ... must be judged based on (1) whether the plaintiff and those [he or she] maintains were similarly situated were subject to the same workplace standards and (2) whether the conduct for which the employer imposed discipline was of comparable seriousness. In other words, there should be an objectively identifiable basis for comparability. Hence, the standard for comparing conduct requires a reasonably close resemblance of the facts and circumstances of plaintiff's and comparator's cases, rather than a showing that both cases are identical.
Id. at 40 (citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Norville v. Staten Island University Hospital, 196 F.3d 89, 96 (2d Cir. 1999) (to be "similarly situated," the comparators "must have been subject [*23]  to the same standards governing performance evaluation and discipline, and must have engaged in conduct similar to the plaintiff's") (citation omitted). "The determination that two acts are of comparable seriousness requires - in addition to an examination of the acts - an examination of the context and surrounding circumstances in which those acts are evaluated." Graham, 230 F.3d at 40. "As a general rule, whether [employees] are similarly situated is a factual issue that should be submitted to the jury. This rule is not absolute, however, and a court can properly grant summary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met." Fahrenkrug v. Verizon Services Corporation, 652 Fed. Appx. 54, 56-57 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Harlen Associates v. Inc. Vill. of Mineola, 273 F.3d 494, 499 n.2 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted)); see also Edwards v. Khalil, No. 12 Civ. 8442 (JCM), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44407, 2016 WL 1312149, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2016).
"If the plaintiff succeeds in presenting a prima facie case, the defendant may rebut that showing by articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action." Allen, 463 Fed. Appx. at 16. "An employer's explanation of its legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons must be 'clear and specific.'" Mandell v. County of Suffolk, 316 F.3d 368, 381 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). However, "[a]ny stated reason is sufficient; the employer need not persuade the court that the proffered reason was the actual reason for its decision." Tarshis v. Riese Org., 211 F.3d 30, 36 (2d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted), abrogated on other grounds [*24]  by Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). A defendant's "burden is satisfied if the proffered evidence taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action." Ricci v. DeStefano, 530 F.3d 88, 110 (2d Cir. 2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).
"Upon the defendant's articulation of such a non-discriminatory reason for the employment action, the presumption of discrimination arising with the establishment of the prima facie case drops from the picture." Weinstock v. Columbia University, 224 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir. 2000). The burden then shifts "back to the plaintiff to demonstrate by competent evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 499 (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must "produce not simply 'some' evidence, but 'sufficient evidence to support a rational finding that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons proffered by the [defendant] were false, and that more likely than not [discrimination] was the real reason for the [employment action]:'" Weinstock, 224 F.3d at 42 (brackets in original) (quoting Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 80 F.3d 708, 714 (2d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted)). "[T]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." Leibowitz, 584 F.3d at 499 (internal quotation [*25]  marks and citation omitted); Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981).

B. Analysis
Plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Preliminarily, Plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence that he suffered an adverse employment action either by virtue of his 2009 and 2010 PBC ratings, his placement on a PIP, or his inability to obtain a transfer. An adverse employment action is a "materially adverse change in terms and conditions of employment." Chung v. City University of New York, 605 Fed. Appx. 20, 22 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Sanders v. N.Y. City Human Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004)). Examples of an adverse employment action include "termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices ... unique to a particular situation." Id. A "negative performance review, without more, does not represent an adverse employment action." Chung, 605 Fed. Appx. at 22 (quoting Fairbrother v. Morrison, 412 F.3d 39, 56-57 (2d Cir. 2005) (surveying cases and finding that a negative evaluation was not materially adverse where the plaintiff did not assert a detrimental effect on her salary, benefits, or title), abrogated on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006); Kpaka v. City Univ. of N.Y., No. 14 Civ. 6021(RA), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101746, 2016 WL 4154891, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2016) ("Negative evaluations can be adverse employment actions only if they give rise to material adverse changes in work conditions") (citation omitted). [*26]  Similarly, placement on a PIP, without more, does not constitute an adverse employment action. See e.g., Brown v. Am. Golf Corp., 99 Fed. Appx. 341, 343 (2d Cir. 2004) (affirming grant of summary judgment on basis that placement on a performance improvement plan was not an adverse employment action); Szarzynski v. Roche Labs., Inc., No. 07 Civ. 6008, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17883, 2010 WL 811445, at *7 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2010) ("[P]lacing plaintiff on a PIP, the goal of which was to improve his performance and avoid his termination, is not an adverse employment action."). Further, "[t]he denial of a transfer may constitute an adverse employment action at the prima facie step of discrimination analysis when... a plaintiff adduces sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the sought for position is materially more advantageous than the employee's current position, whether because of prestige, modernity, training opportunity, job security, or some other objective indicator of desirability." Beyer v. County of Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 2008).9
Here, Plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence that his PBC 3 rating in 2009, PBC 3 rating in 2010, or placement on a PIP had a negative impact on his salary, title, benefits, or assignments. To the contrary, the record establishes that Plaintiff's salary, benefits, and seniority level remained the same up to the point that he voluntarily took a leave of absence from [*27]  IBM in July, 2010. Plaintiff cannot identify a single, objective, concrete harm that he suffered as a result of his PBC 3 rating in 2009, his PBC 3 rating in 2010, or his placement on a PIP.
With respect to Plaintiff's failure to transfer claim, he has failed to adduce any evidence that a transfer would have resulted in a beneficial change in his duties, the opportunity for advancement, or some other objective benefit. Further, he has failed to identify a particular instance in which he applied to a specific position which would have been materially advantageous to him and was denied a transfer. Rather, Plaintiff testified that he made a general request to transfer out of Forsberg's department. The denial of such a general request does not constitute an adverse employment action. As the Second Circuit stated in Wright v. Goldman, 387 F. Supp. 2d 314 (S.D.N.Y. 2004):
...to establish a claim based on a failure to transfer, a plaintiff must show that he [or she] (a) applied for a position for which his [or her] employer was seeking applicants, and (b) was denied that position under circumstances which support an inference of discrimination. See Gomez v. Pellicone, 986 F. Supp. 220, 228 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). [Plaintiff] has not introduced any evidence that he actually applied for a specific position within [*28]  [Defendant], stating at his deposition only that he requested a transfer to "any other department." [] As the Second Circuit recently has noted in the context of a failure to promote claim, a specific application is required to "'ensure[ ] that, at the very least, the plaintiff employee alleges a particular adverse employment action.'" Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 2004 WL 2177044, at *14 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Brown v. Coach Stores, Inc., 163 F.3d 706, 710 (2d Cir. 1998)). This requirement ensures that "the fact finder is not left to speculate as to the qualifications of the competing candidates, the damages to be derived from the salary of unknown jobs, the availability of alternative positions, the plaintiff's willingness to serve in them ..., etc." Id.
Wright 387 F. Supp. 2d at 323; see also Krachenfels v. N. Shore Long Island Jewish Health Sys., No. 13 Civ. 243 (JFB)(WDW), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103474, 2014 WL 3867560, at *18 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2014) ("when evaluating failure to transfer claims on summary judgment, courts have required the plaintiff to present some evidence about a particular position to which [he or] she sought to be transferred"). Plaintiff's subjective belief that he would have been more productive or successful under a different manager than Forsberg is insufficient to carry his burden. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish that he suffered an adverse employment action with respect to [*29]  his performance evaluations, with respect to his placement on a PIP, or based on his inability to obtain a transfer.10
Assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, his claims still fail because he has not established that he was denied a transfer, assessed a PBC 3 in 2009 and/or 2010, or placed on a PIP under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. The evidence Plaintiff relies on in support of his claim of discrimination is as follows: (1) Plaintiff's subjective belief that he suffered these adverse employment actions because of his race and national origin, (2) two allegedly discriminatory comments made by Forsberg, (3) Plaintiff's assertion that thousands of Caucasian employees obtained transfers, and (4) Plaintiff's assertion that certain Caucasian employees were treated more favorably than Plaintiff. These allegations are insufficient to carry Plaintiff's minimal burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.
Plaintiff's subjective belief that he was discriminated against is insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination. See Tung Nhu Nguyen v. Dep't of Corrs. & Cmty. Servs., 169 F. Supp. 3d 375, 390 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) ("as a matter of law [plaintiff's] subjective assessment cannot give rise to an inference [*30]  of discrimination") (citing Crews v. Trs. of Columbia Univ. in City of N.Y., 452 F. Supp. 2d 504, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("Although [the plaintiff] may disagree with [the defendant's] determination that [another candidate] was more qualified than he, courts are not permitted to second-guess the reasonableness of the employer's criteria for employment or the merits of its selection for the position.")). Further, Plaintiff's unsubstantiated, conclusory, and generalized assertion that thousands of Caucasian employees were promoted, and that Caucasian employees were treated more favorably than Plaintiff, is insufficient to carry his burden with respect to his 2009 and 2010 evaluations, his placement on a PIP or his transfer request. See E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., 967 F. Supp. 2d at 873 (plaintiff could not establish that her performance review was discriminatory because she could not "point the Court to any reviews of other employees with similar language [in the review] but different ratings").
Relatedly, Plaintiff's assertion that Forsberg "[k]icked out" Plaintiff and another Indian employee in 2009 and 2010, and hired two Caucasian employees — Steven Blanks and Debra McLiverty — during that same time period, is insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination. Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence that any of these employees [*31]  were similarly situated to Plaintiff in terms of job responsibilities or performance reviews. Further, he has not provided any other basis from which the Court might infer that Defendants' allegedly favorable treatment of these two Caucasian employees was the result of discrimination against Plaintiff and the other Indian employee identified by Plaintiff.11
Plaintiff has also failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on Forsberg's alleged discriminatory comments. The first comment cited by Plaintiff is a comment Forsberg allegedly made in 2006, in which Forsberg compared Plaintiff to an Indian employee who "pisses people off as a leader." Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 97. The second comment Plaintiff cites is a comment Forsberg allegedly made in March of 2010, in which Forsberg stated, "Indian dude, we got you, go back to your own country." Id. at ¶ 169. These stray remarks are insufficient for Plaintiff to carry his burden of raising an inference of discrimination.
"In determining whether a particular remark is probative, [district courts in this circuit] have considered four factors: (1) who made the remark (i.e., a decision-maker, a supervisor, or a low-level co-worker); (2) [*32]  when the remark was made in relation to the employment decision at issue; (3) the content of the remark (i.e., whether a reasonable juror could view the remark as discriminatory); and (4) the context in which the remark was made (i.e., whether it was related to the decision-making process)." Henry v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 616 F.3d 134, 149 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). Although "none of these factors should be regarded as dispositive,... this framework will often provide a useful approach to the admission or exclusion of remarks not directly related to the adverse action against the plaintiff...." Id. at 150.
Here, both comments were allegedly made by Plaintiff's direct supervisor.12 Further, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable juror could conclude that the comments evinced a generally discriminatory state of mind. Nevertheless, the statement from 2006 is too temporally remote from the adverse employment actions alleged in this case to constitute evidence of discrimination. See Tomassi v. Insignia Fin. Grp., Inc., 478 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 2007) ("the more remote and oblique the remarks are in relation to the employer's adverse action, the less they prove that the action was motivated by discrimination...."). Further, Plaintiff has proffered no evidence that either comment was causally related [*33]  to the decision-making process that led to Plaintiff's evaluations, placement on a PIP, and/or his inability to obtain a transfer. On their face, the comments have nothing to do with Plaintiff's job performance or eligibility for a transfer. "Without some causal connection, these off-color comments were no more than stray remarks." White v. Andy Frain Services, 629 Fed. Appx. 131, 134 (2d Cir. 2015). Stray comments, without other indicia of discrimination, "are not enough." Id. Here, Plaintiff has not shown any other indicia of discrimination. Additionally, in 2005, 2006, and 2007, Forsberg assessed Plaintiff a PBC 2+ rating and, in 2008, he assessed Plaintiff a PBC 2 rating. This history of favorable treatment undercuts Plaintiff's claim that Forsberg had a discriminatory motivation in assessing Plaintiff a PBC 3 rating in 2009 and 2010 and in suggesting that he be placed on a PIP. Cf. Grady v. Affiliated Cent., Inc., 130 F.3d 553, 560 (2d Cir. 1997) ("Although each case must involve an examination of all the circumstances, some factors strongly suggest that invidious discrimination was unlikely. For example, when the person who made the decision to fire was the same person who made the decision to hire, it is difficult to impute to her [or him] an invidious motivation that would be inconsistent with the decision [*34]  to hire. This is especially so when the firing has occurred only a short time after the hiring"). Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to establish that these adverse employment actions occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.
Assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiff had established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination based on his performance reviews, placement on a PIP, or failure to obtain a transfer, Defendants have articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for each of these occurrences. Plaintiff's performance challenges throughout his ten-year tenure at IBM, including interpersonal issues with peers and managers, self-aggrandizement, failure to follow directions from managers, failure to be responsive to certain clients, and inability to incorporate feedback, are well documented in numerous contemporaneously generated performance reviews and e-mails. Further, these performance reviews and e-mails were generated by at least five different managers. When Plaintiff challenged certain of these performance reviews, the managers' findings were upheld by IBM investigators after the investigators reviewed documentary material and interviewed [*35]  numerous witnesses. With respect to Plaintiff's 2009 PBC rating, Forsberg noted that numerous clients had complained about Plaintiff's failure to be responsive. Plaintiff's PBC evaluation noted deficiencies in communication, collaboration, teamwork, leadership, following the direction of management, and problem-solving. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 148. That same year, a different manager, Maltrotti, informed Plaintiff that he was in the bottom third of the department. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 130. In response to Plaintiff's request for an Open Door review of his 2009 PBC rating, an investigator interviewed Plaintiff's managers and four peers. According to each peer, Plaintiff was "self-absorbed," did not get along with "various people," and did not feel that team work was necessary. Jones Decl., Ex. I. The feedback from Plaintiff's peers was consistent "and ranged from his inability to follow department procedures, spreadsheet errors, verbal abuse, and attitude." Id. The investigative report also noted that when Plaintiff was counseled by managers on how to improve, he responded "with defensive statements" and the assertion that he "was an expert that has mastered these key skill competencies..., [*36]  [a] statement which his management does not agree with, nor his fellow peers when interviewed." Id. It also noted that Plaintiff refused to be "trained, directed, measured, and assisted." Id.
Contemporaneous e-mails and documents from 2010 reflect that Plaintiff overstated savings on a project, was accused of confronting another employee in a verbally aggressive manner, was accused by yet another manager of being self-aggrandizing and not being a team player, failed to timely complete a spreadsheet, was accused by a senior manager of adding "no value" to the team working on a particular issue, and was unprepared to present team results on a particular project to a client. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶¶ 157-68, 172, 174-78. This thorough, consistent, and contemporaneously generated record of Plaintiff's performance deficiencies constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for Plaintiff's 2009 PBC, Plaintiff's 2010 PBC, IBM's failure to transfer Plaintiff to a different department, and Plaintiff's placement on a PIP. See Dasrath v. Stony Brook Univ. Med. Ctr., No. 12 Civ. 1484 (SJF)(SIL), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32805, 2015 WL 1223797, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. March 17, 2015) (Poor job performance, documented instances of poor professional relationships, and insubordination are [*37]  legitimate, non-discriminatory bases for a poor performance evaluation).
Plaintiff cannot point to any evidence that would reasonably support a finding that these explanations were false and a pretext for discrimination. Plaintiff's subjective belief that these explanations were pre-textual, his subjective belief that he was an optimal employee, and the two stray comments allegedly made by Forsberg relating to Plaintiff's ethnicity are insufficient to satisfy Plaintiff's burden. This is particularly true in light of the overwhelming, contemporaneously recorded, multi-sourced evidence of Plaintiff's performance challenges. Moreover, Forsberg, one of the managers who was involved in Plaintiff's 2009 and 2010 PBC evaluations, assessed Plaintiff either a PBC 2 rating or PBC 2+ rating in three previous years, which severely undercuts any assertion that Forsberg's 2009 assessment of Plaintiff was motivated by racial animus. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claims of intentional discrimination, including his failure to transfer claim, fail at every analytical step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis. Therefore, this Court concludes, and respectfully recommends that Your Honor conclude, that Defendant& [*38]  motion for summary judgment regarding Plaintiff's intentional discrimination claims should be granted.13

IV. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim
Plaintiff claims that his 2009 PBC rating and ultimate termination were in retaliation for a protected activity. For the following reasons, this Court concludes, and respectfully recommends that Your Honor conclude, that Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim should be granted.14

A. The Law
"To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show that (1) [he or] she was engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer was aware of that activity; (3) the employee suffered a materially adverse action; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and that adverse action." Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 F.3d 127, 157 (2d Cir. 2012). "Ordinarily, causation may be inferred from close temporal proximity." Chung, 605 Fed. Appx. at 23. Nevertheless, "[w]here timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began well before the plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation does not arise." Id. (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reins. Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001)).
"Once a prima facie case of retaliation is established, the burden of production shifts to the employer to demonstrate [*39]  that a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason existed for its action." Raniola v. Bratton, 243 F.3d 610, 625 (2d Cir. 2001). If the employer demonstrates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, then "[t]he burden shifts ... back to the plaintiff to establish, through either direct or circumstantial evidence, that the employer's action was, in fact, motivated by discriminatory retaliation." Parra v. City of White Plains, No. 13 Civ. 5544(VB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122819, 2016 WL 4734666, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2016) (quoting Raniola, 243 F.3d at 625)). "Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action." Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2528, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013).

B. Analysis
Plaintiff has satisfied the first three prongs of a prima facie case of retaliation. The record establishes that Plaintiff filed numerous complaints of discrimination — a protected activity — and that IBM was aware of the complaints. Indeed, these complaints prompted various Open Door reviews. Further, the record shows that Plaintiff received low ratings on his 2009 performance review and that he was unable to secure a position at IBM after the conclusion of his medical leave, which are materially adverse employment actions.15 Plaintiff, however, has failed to raise an inference of any causal connection between a protected activity and either his 2009 PBC rating or his inability to secure employment [*40]  at IBM at the conclusion of his leave of absence.
Plaintiff's conclusory assertion that his 2009 PBC rating and/or termination were in retaliation for various complaints he had filed is insufficient to raise an inference of a causal connection between a protected activity and an adverse employment action. Similarly, Plaintiff's Open Door complaints from 2000-2003 are too temporally remote to raise an inference of causation with respect to his 2009 PBC rating. Further, the notion that Plaintiff's 2009 PBC rating was in retaliation for his complaint to Palmisano is undermined by the fact that Plaintiff informed an investigator that he believed his 2009 PBC was unfair, in part, because he believed the PBC rating had been prematurely determined in September 2009, when he was told he was in the bottom third of his department — which was prior to Plaintiff's complaint to Palmisano. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 146. Similarly, Forsberg confirmed that the 2009 PBC rating was determined prior to Plaintiff's complaint to Palmisano. Id. To the extent that Plaintiff's PBC rating was determined prior to Plaintiff's complaint to Palmisano, the PBC rating could not [*41]  have been in retaliation for that complaint.
In any event, even assuming that Plaintiff's complaint preceded his 2009 PBC rating, Plaintiff had received "gradual" criticism of his job performance for the years preceding his 2009 PBC rating. Therefore, the temporal proximity of the 2009 PBC rating to Plaintiff's complaint to Palmisano is insufficient, on its own, to raise an inference of retaliation at the summary judgment stage. See Iguanzo v. Housing & Services, Inc., 621 Fed. Appx. 91, 92 (2d Cir. 2015) ("Although 'temporal proximity can demonstrate a causal nexus,' causality is lacking when 'adverse employment actions were both part, and the ultimate product, of an extensive period of progressive discipline [beginning prior to the complaint]....'") (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance America Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, prior to the 2009 PBC evaluation, Forsberg informed Plaintiff that there were issues with his performance including poor interpersonal skills, poor judgment, refusal to take direction from management, and negative feedback from certain clients. In September of 2009, Forsberg met with Plaintiff and advised him that he was in the bottom third of the department. In October of 2009, Maltrotti also advised Plaintiff that he was in the bottom third of the department. [*42]  These interactions establish that Plaintiff's PBC 3 rating was the result of a history of poor performance, which predated Plaintiff's complaint to Palmisano. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to establish a causal nexus between his 2009 PBC rating and any of his complaints. Furthermore, as stated supra, Defendants have proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for Plaintiff's 2009 PBC rating and neither Plaintiff's subjective belief that the evaluation was discriminatory, nor the alleged discriminatory statements made by Forsberg, are sufficient to establish pretext.

V. Plaintiff's Failure to Accommodate Claim
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants failed to accommodate his disability by failing to permit him to work from home or "in a stress-free environment." Pl. Deposition, p. 225. "To establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he [or she] is a person with a disability; (2) defendant had notice of his [or her] disability; (3) plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue with reasonable accommodation; and (4) defendant refused to make such accommodations." Howard v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 343, 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., Inc., 457 F.3d 181, 184 (2d Cir. 2006)). "A claim based on a failure [*43]  to make reasonable accommodations does not require the plaintiff to show a discriminatory animus." Craddock v. Little Flower Children & Family Servs. of N.Y., No. 12 Civ. 5062 (JS)(GRB), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22958, 2016 WL 755631, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2016). "Rather, it is sufficient to establish that a covered entity failed to fulfill its affirmative duty to make a reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental limitations of a disabled employee." Id.
"The employer need not find or create a position for the employee." Thompson v. N.Y. City Dep't of Prob., 348 F. Appx. 643, 645 (2d Cir. 2009). Rather, "the plaintiff bears the burdens of both production and persuasion as to the existence of some accommodation that would allow [him or] her to perform the essential functions of [his or] her employment, including the existence of a vacant position for which [he or] she is qualified." McBride v. BIC Consumer Products Mfg. Co., Inc., 583 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 2009). Relatedly, "[a]n ADA plaintiff does not satisfy [the plaintiff's] burden to identify a potential accommodation merely by reciting the formula that [the plaintiff's] employer could have reassigned [the plaintiff]. Instead, [the plaintiff] must demonstrate the existence, at or around the time when accommodation was sought, of an existing vacant position to which [the plaintiff] could have been reassigned." McBride, 583 F.3d at 97-98; See also Thompson, 348 Fed. Appx. at 645 ("An ADA plaintiff seeking [*44]  accommodation in the form of a transfer bears the burden of proving that a vacancy existed into which he or she might have been transferred"). Although the ADA "envisions an 'interactive process' by which employers and employees work together to assess whether an employee's disability can be reasonably accommodated" (McBride, 583 F.3d at 99) (citations omitted), an "employer's failure to engage in a sufficient interactive process does not form the basis of a claim under the ADA and evidence thereof does not allow a plaintiff to avoid summary judgment unless [he or] she also establishes that, at least with the aid of some identified accommodation, [he or] she was qualified for the position at issue" (Id. at 101). Nevertheless, "an employer's failure to engage in a good faith interactive process can be introduced as evidence tending to show disability discrimination, and that 'the employer has refused to make [a reasonable] accommodation.'" Sheng v. M&TBank Corp., 848 F.3d 78, 2017 WL 443641, at *6 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting McBride, 583 F.3d at 96-97)) (internal citations omitted).
Here, Defendants were aware of Plaintiff's disability by virtue of the fact that Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence and provided a letter to IBM in the summer of 2011, in which Plaintiff's doctor noted that he was treating Plaintiff [*45]  for anxiety and panic attacks "which had started at his work." ECF 206, Ex. 3. In that same letter, the doctor noted that Plaintiff was "capable to return to work on a regular basis" and recommended that Plaintiff "be allowed to do this work mostly from home with only minimal traveling to avoid relapse of his anxiety and panic attacks." Id. Accordingly, Defendants were also on notice of Plaintiff's need for an accommodation to address his medical condition. Lastly, there is scant evidence that Defendants engaged in an interactive process with Plaintiff in an attempt to accommodate his disability.16
Nevertheless, the failure to engage in an interactive process does not form the basis of a failure to accommodate claim. Although Plaintiff testified that he applied for numerous positions at IBM, that "IBM has more than 40, 50 percent work from home," and that he was "qualified for more than a thousand jobs," he has failed to provide any evidence that he applied for a specific, vacant position at IBM, for which he was qualified. Pl. Deposition, pp. 73, 79, 227, 617-18. Additionally, Plaintiff testified that he was informed by an employee of IBM's human resources department that there were [*46]  no procurement positions available for internal candidates at IBM. Pl. Deposition, pp. 617, 621. Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to allege a prima facie case that IBM discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability. Therefore, this Court concludes, and respectfully recommends that Your Honor conclude that Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to this claim should be granted.17

VI. Plaintiff's Claims Against Murphy
Defendants' motion for summary judgment regarding Plaintiff's claims against Murphy should also be granted because Plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence that Murphy was involved in Plaintiff's employment with IBM or separation from IBM. Plaintiff conceded at his deposition that Murphy did not manage Plaintiff, that Plaintiff's only interaction with Murphy was that he "said hello to him once," and that Plaintiff had no evidence that Murphy had any involvement in any decision relating to Plaintiff's employment. Def. Rule 56 Statement, ¶ 220.
