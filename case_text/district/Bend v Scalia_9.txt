FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON A MOTION TO DISMISS
Plaintiff Hubert Bend, Jr., proceeding pro se, brings this action asserting claims of discrimination and harassment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 791. Defendant moves for a second time to dismiss Plaintiff's claims. For the reasons stated below, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's second Motion to Dismiss [46] be GRANTED and that Plaintiff's claims be DISMISSED.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff's original Complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on June 20, 2018, pleaded claims of discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. and the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq. Upon Defendant's first motion to dismiss, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims of discrimination under the FMLA and ordered Plaintiff to re-plead his claims of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act rather than the ADA. See R&R [32]; Order [44]. Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint on February 20, 2020. Defendant now moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint. [*2] 
The following facts, taken from the Amended Complaint and its attachments, are accepted as true for purposes of evaluating Defendant's second motion to dismiss. Plaintiff worked as an Investigator in the Labor, Wage, and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor at its District Office from September 2001 through April 2016, spending most of his employment in the Department's Atlanta, Georgia office. Am. Compl. [35] at B1a—B1c. On July 22, 2015, while he was on FMLA leave for a back injury, Plaintiff was contacted by District Director Eric Williams and told to report back to work. Id. at A-1. The next day, Plaintiff met with Director Williams; the two had a what Plaintiff described as a "verbal confrontation" in which Director Williams allegedly told Plaintiff that he was "crazy" and that he had "issues." Id. at A-1, A-1c. On July 24, Plaintiff informed the Assistant District Director, Kim Chu, that he had "reinjured" a pre-existing back injury and that he had questions about taking medical leave. Id. at 2, C-1. Later that day, Director Williams instructed Assistant Director Chu on how to respond to Plaintiff's communication, informing Chu "do not engage in answering any [*3]  lengthy questions, do not share information and do not talk about his status while away from work or anything else. Simply . . . send him the [FMLA and other related] paperwork." Id. at 2, C-2a. On July 27, Assistant Director Chu forwarded to Plaintiff a fact sheet related to FMLA leave and a form on which he was to complete a medical certification of the alleged condition for which he needed leave. Id. at 2, C-3.
On August 25, 2015, Plaintiff contacted Assistant Director Chu to request to use "advanced leave in the amount of 80 hours." Id. at C-4. The same day, Plaintiff filed a grievance with the Department, alleging that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD") and that the behavior of Director Williams toward him aggravated his condition. Id. at C-7. Three days later, Chu advised Plaintiff that his request for advanced leave had been denied, stating that the length of Plaintiff's period of incapacity and the frequency of his anticipated medical treatment rendered his "future accrual of sick leave . . . doubtful." Id. at C-6. Director Williams denied Plaintiff's grievance on September 22. Id. at C-8—C-8c. On October 13, Plaintiff filed an Informal Complaint of Discrimination [*4]  with the Department's Civil Rights Center, alleging that he had been the victim of "disability harassment" because of Director Williams' July 22 demand that he return from leave and because of their verbal confrontation the next day. Id. at A-1. On March 15, 2016, Plaintiff medically retired from his position. Id. at B-1c. Three months later, on June 15, 2016, Plaintiff participated in a workers' compensation hearing at which he sought benefits for his alleged July 23, 2015 injury. Id. at 3, C-10—C-10a. Plaintiff states that Director Williams participated in this hearing. Id. at 3, C-10a.
In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff claims that because of the denial of his requested leave and his interactions with Director Williams, he has been the victim of disability-based "discrimination and harassment"; Plaintiff brings his claims solely under the Rehabilitation Act. Id. at 1, 4.

II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard on a Motion to Dismiss
Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a complaint need only contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," in order to "give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). A plaintiff, however, may [*5]  not merely plead facts in a complaint sufficient to find a claim to relief is conceivable; instead, the complaint must set forth "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Id. at 570.
When evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court cannot consider matters outside of the pleadings, and must accept the allegations of the non-movant's pleadings as true, but "[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Moreover, "a plaintiff's obligation to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted).
Iqbal went on to instruct that, while a court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true, it need not accept as true legal conclusions recited in a complaint. Repeating that "only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss" the Supreme Court advised that "[d]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific [*6]  task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not 'shown'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)) (other citations omitted).
Although the Supreme Court requires a plaintiff to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief, because Plaintiff is proceeding pro se in this case, the Complaint must be "liberally construed." Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)). "[A] pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Id.; see also Miller v. Donald, 541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir. 2008); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e) ("Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice"). At the same time, however, nothing in the leniency which courts afford pro se filings excuses a plaintiff from complying with threshold requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Trawinski v. United Tech., 313 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir. 2002). A court may not rewrite inadequate pleadings—including those filed by pro se plaintiffs—to plead essential allegations. See Pontier v. City of Clearwater, 881 F. Supp. 1565, 1568 (M.D. Fla. 1995). Moreover, although a pro se complaint is held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by attorneys, [*7]  "the Court need not accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences." Montgomery v. Huntington Bank, 346 F.3d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 2006).
As noted, a court ordinarily cannot consider matters outside the pleadings when evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), but when a plaintiff has referred to documents in the complaint and such documents are central to the plaintiff's claims, a court may consider those documents as part of the pleadings in the case and may consider them in resolving a motion to dismiss. See Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997) ("where the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff's claim, then the court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for the purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal"). In this case, Plaintiff attached copies of various documents to his Amended Complaint, including an EEOC Decision related to his claims dated September 8, 2017. Because Plaintiff attached those documents to the Amended Complaint, they are considered part of pleadings for all purposes. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c).
Furthermore, it is well-settled law in the Eleventh Circuit that when a plaintiff attaches exhibits to a complaint and the exhibits contradict the allegations of the complaint, the exhibits control. See Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Irvin, 496 F.3d 1189, 1205-06 (11th Cir. 2007).
Our duty to accept the [*8]  facts in the complaint as true does not require us to ignore specific factual details of the pleading in favor of general or conclusory allegations. Indeed, when the exhibits contradict the general and conclusory allegations of the pleading, the exhibits govern.
Id.; see also Associated Builders, Inc. v. Ala. Power Co., 505 F.2d 97, 100 (5th Cir. 1974) ("Conclusory allegations and unwarranted deductions of fact are not admitted as true, especially when such conclusions are contradicted by facts disclosed by a document appended to the complaint. If the appended document, to be treated as part of the complaint for all purposes under Rule 10(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., reveals facts which foreclose recovery as a matter of law, dismissal is appropriate." (citation omitted));1 Simmons v. Peavy-Welsh Lumber Co., 113 F.2d 812, 813 (5th Cir. 1940) ("Where there is a conflict between allegations in a pleading and exhibits thereto, it is well settled that the exhibits control.").
B. Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claims
Plaintiff's claims of "discrimination and harassment" under the Rehabilitation Act appear to allege two distinct theories of disability-based discrimination: failure-to-accommodate and hostile work environment. Defendant argues that both claims are foreclosed by a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. To the extent that they are not, argues Defendant, Plaintiff [*9]  has failed to plead essential elements of the claims in the Amended Complaint.
1. Administrative Exhaustion
Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claims in the Amended Complaint exceed the scope of his prior administrative complaint.
As the Court explained in its previous R&R, federal employees alleging claims under the Rehabilitation Act are required to exhaust administrative remedies in the same manner as plaintiffs bringing claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. See Litman v. Sec. of the Navy, 703 F. App'x 766, 772 (11th Cir. 2017) (citing Doe v. Garrett, 903 F.2d 1455, 1461 (11th Cir. 1990)); Gaillard v. Shinseki, 349 F. App'x 391, 392 (11th Cir. 2009). That is, before filing a lawsuit, they must complain of the underlying conduct to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. See Booth v. City of Roswell, 754 F. App'x 834, 836 (11th Cir. 2018) (citing Wu v. Thomas, 963 F.2d 1543, 1547 (11th Cir. 1989)).
A plaintiff who then files a lawsuit asserting claims of employment discrimination cannot bring any claim that was not included in their EEOC complaint. See Zellars v. Liberty Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 907 F. Supp. 355, 358 (M.D. Ala. 1995) (citing Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974)). In determining the permissible scope of an employment discrimination complaint, the Court must first look to the EEOC complaint and investigation. Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry Co., 696 F.2d 925, 929 (11th Cir. 1983). A plaintiff is precluded from pursuing any claims in a federal court action that are not "like or related" to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in their EEOC complaint or that could not reasonably be expected to arise during the course of the EEOC investigation. See Coon v. Ga. Pac. Corp., 829 F.2d 1563, 1569 (11th Cir. 1987); Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985); Evans, 696 F.2d at 928; Buffington v. Gen. Time Corp., 677 F. Supp. 1186, 1192 (M.D. Ga. 1988). Therefore, [*10]  additional charges in the civil complaint which do not arise naturally and logically from the facts presented to the EEOC are not related to the original complaint and cannot be pursued in a civil action.
Plaintiff has attached to his Amended Complaint the first page of the administrative complaint he filed on October 13, 2015. In his administrative complaint, Plaintiff alleged that he had been the victim of, inter alia, "disability harassment" and a "hostile work" environment. Am. Compl. [35] at A-1. Plaintiff noted the factual basis of his complaint solely as Director Williams' July 22 instruction for him to return to work from leave and the verbal confrontation between them that followed the next day. Id. The limited factual basis of Plaintiff's administrative complaint is echoed by an EEO Counselor's Summary Report of it, which describes issue raised by his complaint as "[w]hether the complainant was subjected to harassment based on his disability . . . when [Director Williams] contacted [him] while he was on FMLA and informed the complainant to report to his office." Id. at A-1b. Both an investigative summary of Plaintiff's complaint and the EEOC's decision in favor the Department [*11]  recounted the sole factual basis of Plaintiff's claims as Director Williams' July 22 instruction to Plaintiff and their July 23 confrontation, in which Plaintiff alleged that Director Williams told him he was "crazy" and that he "had issues." Id. at A-1c, B-1.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim and his claim of harassment, to the extent it is based on Plaintiff's 2016 interactions with Director Williams, exceed the scope of Plaintiff's administrative complaint. As for Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim, the Court acknowledged in its previous R&R that Plaintiff's administrative complaint fails to "expressly make mention of Plaintiff requesting or being denied any kind of accommodation for a disability," as Plaintiff alleges in this action. R&R [32] at 10. Nevertheless, given the Court's obligation to broadly construe administrative complaints filed by uncounseled individuals, the Court found that an informal grievance filed by Plaintiff in which he requested, inter alia, temporary leave and reassignment due to workplace "aggravation" of his PTSD could plausibly have been part of the EEOC's broader investigation of Plaintiff's claims. Id. at 10-12. Plaintiff [*12]  attaches the same document to his Amended Complaint and Defendant provides no argument as to how Plaintiff's grievance does not now suffice to administratively exhaust his failure-to-accommodate claim. In keeping with its reluctance "to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims brought under [discrimination statutes]," Batson v. Salvation Army, 897 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Gregory v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2017)), the Court again declines to recommend dismissal of Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
Plaintiff's claim of harassment, however, appears to be based in part on conduct squarely outside the scope of his administrative complaint. Plaintiff bases his claim of harassment solely on two interactions with Director Williams: In addition to his July 23, 2015 altercation with Director Williams, Plaintiff bases his claim of harassment on a June 15, 2016 workers' compensation hearing at which Plaintiff claims Director Williams "continued alleged harassment." Am. Compl. [35] at 3. As Defendant notes, however, the June 15, 2016 hearing occurred about eight months after Plaintiff filed his administrative complaint, and in fact several months after Plaintiff's retirement. Any post-employment and post-complaint [*13]  conduct during the hearing was therefore not within the scope of the EEOC's investigation. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim of disability harassment, to the extent that it is based on events occurring at the June 2016 workers' compensation hearing, is due for dismissal for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.
2. Failure to State a Claim
Defendant next argues that the Amended Complaint fails to state any claim of disability discrimination. The Court agreed with Defendant's similar argument regarding Plaintiff's original Complaint, ordering Plaintiff to replead his claims of disability discrimination and to
state specific facts in support of his failure-to-accommodate claim, and to plausibly establish each of the elements, that is, that Plaintiff had a disability, how that disability substantially limited his major life activities, that Plaintiff requested and was denied a reasonable accommodation relating to that disability, and, critically, facts to explain that Plaintiff was able to perform the essential tasks of his job at least with a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff is reminded that conclusory recitations of these legal elements will not suffice. Rather, he must allege [*14]  specific facts that meet these elements.
R&R [32] at 16. Defendant contends that the Amended Complaint fails to properly plead any of the above elements and further fails to plead a plausible disability-based harassment claim.
a. Qualified Individual with a Disability
Defendant argues that both of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims fail because he has not adequately pleaded that he is disabled or a qualified individual within the meaning of the statute.
Both are essential elements of Plaintiff's claims: To establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must ultimately present sufficient evidence to prove that he: (1) has a disability as defined under the Act, (2) is an otherwise "qualified individual" meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, he can perform the essential functions of the job, and (3) was discriminated against because of his disability or perceived disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007); Ellis v. England, 432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2005).
The Rehabilitation Act, which incorporates the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act, see Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000), defines "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual," 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A); see also Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268. A person may also have a "disability" under [*15]  the Rehabilitation Act if the person has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment by an employer. See Mazzeo, 746 F.3d at 1268 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)). Under the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), for the purpose of establishing the existence of a "disability," "a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(B). Thus, to be considered disabled—and thus protected—under the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff must show that he (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) has a record of such impairment, or (3) has been regarded as having such an impairment. See Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., 507 F.3d 1306, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2007).
Plaintiff pleads that he is disabled because of his PTSD. See Am. Compl. [35] at 3. Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiff has properly pleaded that he suffers from a mental impairment but contends that the Court should not consider Plaintiff's PTSD as disabling under the Rehabilitation Act because Plaintiff has not expressly pleaded how his PTSD substantially limits any of his major life activities. According to Defendant, "PTSD . [*16]  . . standing alone, is not necessarily a disability contemplated by" the statute. Mot. to Dismiss [46] at 16 (citing Johnston v. Henderson, 144 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2001), aff'd sub nom. Johnston v. U.S. Postmaster Gen., 277 F.3d 1380 (11th Cir. 2001)). However, Defendant's argument fails for two reasons. First, the Amended Complaint does, in fact, contain express references to the limiting effects of Plaintiff's PTSD. In an Investigative Summary attached to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff is recounted as testifying that "he is limited in his personal life as a result of his medical condition in the following ways: he is confined to his home; he has anger problems; insomnia; depression; no friends; and relationship issues." Am. Compl. [35] at A-1c. As such, liberally construing the attachments to the Complaint, Plaintiff has pleaded that he has problems "[i]nteracting with others," which is a major life activity. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i).2 Second, and relatedly, the pre-ADAAA cases to which Defendant cites regarding whether general allegations of PTSD suffice to establish a disability do not account for the fact that the limiting effects of PTSD on an individual's "brain function" are now expressly recognized as being substantial limitations, as part of the ADAAA's broader liberalization of the definition of "disability." [*17]  See Bell v. Westrock Servs., Inc., No. 15-0148-CG-C, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79113, 2016 WL 3406117, at *8 (S.D. Ala. June 17, 2016); see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(iii) ("[I]t should easily be concluded that . . . post-traumatic stress disorder . . . substantially limit[s] brain function."). The Court therefore cannot accept Defendant's argument that Plaintiff has failed to properly plead that he is disabled.
However, Defendant is correct that Plaintiff has failed to plead that, at the time of the alleged discrimination, he was nonetheless qualified for his job. The ADA defines the term "qualified individual" as follows:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8); see also Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287 n.17, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 278 (11th Cir. 1994).
Thus, an employee must show that he is able to meet all job requirements, despite any disability, in order to establish a valid disability discrimination claim. See Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406 (1979). "Accordingly, [*18]  an ADA plaintiff must show either that he can perform the essential functions of his job without accommodation, or, failing that, show that he can perform the essential functions of his job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Despite express instruction from the Court to plead facts explaining that he could, with or without an accommodation, perform the essential tasks of his job, and despite being warned that such a pleading was critical to sustaining his claims, Plaintiff has failed to offer any facts supporting such a conclusion. Plaintiff merely conclusorily states that he "would have been able to perform the essential task[s] of [his] job" had he received a requested accommodation. Am. Compl. [35] at 3. Plaintiff cites to the EEOC's recounting of a former supervisor's testimony as supporting this conclusion. Id. But the cited testimony, in which Plaintiff's former supervisor states that he "did not have any work limitations to her knowledge," is at best an indication of Plaintiff's status no later than July 2014, a full year before the events underlying this action. Id. at C-9.
Conversely, Plaintiff's own later statements, which are [*19]  attached to the Amended Complaint, belie the notion that he was qualified for his job at the time of the alleged discrimination. Although the Court previously noted that a May 2016 statement by Plaintiff that he could not work as a result of his medical conditions is not necessarily an indication that he could not work during the relevant timeframe, R&R [32] at 15, it is now accompanied by attachments to the Amended Complaint which indicate that Plaintiff never worked after July 2015 and elected medical retirement in March 2016 because of conditions he suffered in July 2015. See Am. Compl. [35] at B-1c (Plaintiff "formally received disability retirement because his back injuries made it impossible to resume his work duties."). As stated in an Investigative Summary of his claims regarding his interactions with Director Williams, Plaintiff testified in May 2016 that "he is not able to perform any duties of his former position. When asked to identify his work restrictions resulting from his medical condition, he responded that he is unable to work." Id. at 4, A-1C. Because of this ambiguity, the Court instructed Plaintiff to amend the complaint to include "facts to explain that Plaintiff [*20]  was able to perform the essential tasks of his job at least with a reasonable accommodation" and that a conclusory recitation of this element will not suffice. R&R [32] at 16. However, the Amended Complaint offers nothing more in this regard. Indeed, the only available indication in the Amended Complaint of Plaintiff's job duties and his ability perform them are Plaintiff's statements that his duties included "visiting employers" but that his medical conditions confine him to his home. Am. Compl. [35] at A-1c. The Amended Complaint is thus devoid of non-conclusory allegations from which to conclude that Plaintiff was able to perform his job in July 2015.
Accordingly, Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims are due for dismissal because he has failed to plead that he is otherwise qualified for his position.
b. Failure-to-Accommodate
Defendant argues that the Amended Complaint is due for dismissal for the additional reason that Plaintiff fails to properly plead that it failed to accommodate Plaintiff's disability.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating against "otherwise qualified" disabled employees. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); see Boone v. Rumsfeld, 172 F. App'x 268, 270 (11th Cir. 2006). The definition of "discriminate" includes a failure to make [*21]  reasonable accommodations to the limitations of that individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A) ("the term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes . . . not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity"). EEOC regulations state that "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for the covered entity to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Unless the appropriate accommodation is obvious to both parties,3 EEOC interpretive guidance recommends a "flexible, interactive process" between the employer and employee in which the employer considers factors such as the limitations faced by the employee and how an accommodation might overcome those limitations. See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 App. § 1630.9.
To prevail on a claim of disability discrimination based on an alleged failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that [*22]  he: (1) is disabled; (2) was a "qualified individual" when he suffered the adverse employment action; and (3) he was discriminated against because of his disability by being denied a reasonable accommodation to allow him to keep working. See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001); Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir. 1999); Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co., 102 F.3d 516, 519 (11th Cir. 1996); Morisky v. Broward Cty., 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). The third and final element of a plaintiff's prima facie case requires him to present sufficient evidence to establish that he was discriminated against because of his disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007).
As noted above, an employer unlawfully discriminates against a qualified individual with a disability when the employer does not make "reasonable accommodations" for the employee, unless "the accommodation would impose an undue hardship" on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 F. App'x 924, 927 (11th Cir. 2010). A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b). The reasonability of a requested accommodation, however, is determined based on the specific facts [*23]  and circumstances of the case. Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997). "The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286.
Defendant's contends that "the 80 hours of advance leave Plaintiff requested did not constitute a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's permanent inability to perform the essential duties of his position." Mot. to Dismiss [46] at 22. But that Plaintiff requested less than what might have been necessary to fully accommodate his disability does not render his request unreasonable. Rather, the reasonability of a requested accommodation is determined by its burden on an employer. Viewed from an employer's perspective, "an extended leave of absence of a definite duration . . . may be a reasonable accommodation in certain circumstances." Spears v. Creel, 607 F. App'x 943, 950 (11th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (citing Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir. 2013)). The Court thus cannot categorically state at this juncture that Plaintiff's requested remedy of what amounts to a definite period of as little as two weeks of leave is unreasonable.
Defendant further argues that the Amended Complaint [*24]  makes clear that, contrary to Plaintiff's allegations that they intentionally refused to interact with him regarding his requested leave, his supervisors did, in fact, engage in an interactive process with Plaintiff. The exhibits attached to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint do indeed appear to contradict the notion that his supervisors refused to engage in an interactive process with him. Plaintiff appears to selectively quote an email from Director Williams to make it appear that he instructed Assistant Director Chu to "not engage" with his accommodation request, when the rest of the email makes clear that Williams was instructing Chu to reach out and begin an interactive process regarding his request, but to limit the engagement to pre-prepared forms. See Am. Compl. [35] at 2, C-2a. However, Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim does not rest simply on an allegation that Defendant failed to interact with him. Rather, because "[t]here is no independent cause of action for bad faith interactive process," Murphy v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of the Army, 769 F. App'x 779, 782 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (citing Willis v. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir. 1997), the adverse employment action at the heart of Plaintiff's claim is the denial of his requested leave itself. Despite containing contradictions to his allegations [*25]  about how he was denied leave, the attachments to the Amended Complaint do not contradict Plaintiff's allegation that he was, in fact, denied leave.
Nevertheless, as Defendant argues, Plaintiff pleads nothing from which to conclude that the denial of his requested leave was discriminatory on the basis of his disability. When asserting a claim of disability discrimination by way of failure-to-accommodate, a plaintiff must show both that their "employer failed to reasonably accommodate [their] disability" and "that this discrimination occurred 'because of [their] disability'—that is, that the adverse employment action was caused by [their] disability." Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1247, 1263 n.17 (11th Cir. 2007). Although this does not require an allegation of disparate treatment from non-disabled workers, it does require an allegation that a plaintiff's requested and rejected accommodation is related to their disability. See id. In this case, Plaintiff adequately pleads that he was denied the leave he requested after a back injury in July 2015. But Plaintiff does not even conclusorily allege that the requested leave was related to his disability. Instead, despite repeatedly stating in his Amended Complaint and emphasizing in his response to Defendant's [*26]  motion that he is alleging disability discrimination based on his PTSD, see Am. Compl. [35] at 3, 6, A-1b, A-1c, C-7; Resp. [52] at 2, B-1a, Plaintiff pleads that the he sought leave to address back injuries he suffered days prior to his request, see Am. Compl. [35] at 2, C-1. Plaintiff simply does not allege that the denial of his requested leave was related to his PTSD and does not plead any information from which the Court could conclude that his back injuries constituted disabilities.
As such, because it is apparent that the leave he requested was not related to a pleaded disability, its denial could not constitute disability discrimination. Plaintiff's failure-to-accommodate claim should be dismissed.
c. Harassment Claim
Defendant finally argues that Plaintiff has failed to properly plead a claim of disability-based harassment.
The Amended Complaint appears to pursue a harassment claim under a hostile work environment theory. Although the Eleventh Circuit has not expressly held that a plaintiff may pursue hostile work environment claims under the Rehabilitation Act, it has assumed so in unpublished cases. See Wolfe v. Postmaster Gen., 488 F. App'x 465, 469 (11th Cir. 2012); Burgos v. Chertoff, 274 F. App'x 839, 842 (11th Cir. 2008). It has further assumed that such claims would proceed in the same manner as hostile work [*27]  environment claims pressed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq. See Booth v. Houston, 58 F. Supp. 3d 1277, 1302 (M.D. Ala. 2014) (citing Burgos, 274 F. App'x at 842). In order to establish a prima facie case for a Title VII hostile work environment claim against an employer, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he belongs to a protected group; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on a protected characteristic; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment; and (5) there is a basis for holding the employer liable for the harassment either directly or indirectly. See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., 594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc); Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002); Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., 195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Cross v. Alabama, 49 F.3d 1490, 1504 (11th Cir. 1995); Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 903-05 (11th Cir. 1982); see also Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1998); Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 762-63, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998).
To demonstrate the fourth element of a prima facie case of a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must be able to show that his work environment was "permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment." Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993). A court must consider the "totality of the circumstances" in determining whether a hostile environment is severe or pervasive enough to be actionable under Title VII; it must consider not only the frequency of the incidents alleged but also the gravity of those incidents. [*28]  Harris, 510 U.S. at 23; Vance v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 863 F.2d 1503, 1511 (11th Cir. 1989). Other factors that are relevant are whether the offensive conduct is physically intimidating or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with plaintiff's work performance. Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.
As the Supreme Court has stated, "simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment." Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788 (citation omitted). In evaluating whether a reasonable person would find conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive, "the objective severity of harassment should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position, considering 'all the circumstances.'" Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998); see also Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1246 ("[C]ourts should examine the conduct in context, not as isolated acts, and determine under the totality of the circumstances whether the harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of the plaintiff's employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment.").
In this case, because Director Williams' participation in Plaintiff's June 2016 workers' compensation hearing is not properly a subject of this action, see supra, Part II-B-1, Plaintiff's claim of harassment, [*29]  at most, proceeds solely on his allegation that Director Williams instructed him to return to work while he was on FMLA leave and that the two had a "verbal confrontation" the next day, see Am. Compl. [35] at A-1. During their altercation, Plaintiff alleges that Director Williams called him "crazy" and said that he "had issues." Id. at A-1c. Defendant argues that, even assuming Plaintiff has alleged harassing conduct, the single alleged instance of such harassment is not severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff does not appear to defend the viability of his harassment claim in his response to Defendant's motion.
Plaintiff's harassment claim plainly falls short of the standard at which offensive or harassing conduct can support a hostile work environment claim. Under any objective standard, a single "verbal confrontation" in which a supervisor used derogatory language toward Plaintiff, without any indication that the comments were unusually severe or threatening, is not enough to alter the terms and conditions of his employment. See Mahone v. CSX Transp., Inc., 652 F. App'x 820, 823-24 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (finding no objectively hostile work environment where plaintiff alleged only a "single incident [*30]  [over a multiyear employment tenure] in which a coworker used a racially-charged word during a staff meeting"); McCann v. Tillman, 526 F.3d 1370, 1379 (11th Cir. 2008); Mendoza, 195 F.3d at 1249; Matthews v. Faurecia Automotive Seating, Inc., No. 7:16-cv-01937-LSC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101831, 2018 WL 3041831, at *7 (N.D. Ala. June 19, 2018) ("[T]he single comment . . . though based on [the plaintiff's] gender, falls far short of the severe and pervasive threshold."); Suevsky v. Walt Disney World Parks & Resorts Online, Inc., No. 6:15-cv-342-Orl-31KRS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79829, 2016 WL 3387620, at *6 (M.D. Fla. June 20, 2016) (finding that "a single comment" regarding a plaintiff's ancestry and faith "falls far short of satisfying the objective test"). Plaintiff's claims, as pleaded, thus do not satisfy the requirement that allegedly harassing behavior be objectively severe in order to comprise a hostile work environment. Accordingly, Plaintiff's harassment claim is due for dismissal.

III. RECOMMENDATION
For the reasons discussed above, the Court RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [46] be GRANTED and that Plaintiff's claims be DISMISSED.
As this is a Final Report and Recommendation, there is nothing further in this action pending before the undersigned. Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate the reference of this matter to the undersigned.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED this 21st day of September, 2020.
