Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
The plaintiff, Barbara Kehr, claims that her former employer, the defendant, Principal Life Insurance Company, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act when it terminated her employment as an account representative and failed to place her in an alternative position as an administrative specialist. On motion for summary judgment, Principal denies that Kehr is disabled, but also contends that Kehr is unable to perform the essential functions of either position with or without reasonable accommodation. I find on the evidence presented that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Kehr's inability to work either as an account representative or administrative specialist, the only two positions that were available to her, and conclude that Principal is entitled to the entry of summary judgment.

I. Background
In accordance with the requirements of [*2]  our local rules, see NECivR 56.1(a), Principal has included in its supporting brief a statement of material facts, which consists of 99 numbered paragraphs with appropriate references to the pleadings, affidavits, and other filed evidentiary materials. (Filing 37.) Because Kehr has not controverted Principal's statement of material facts, it is deemed admitted. See NECivR 56.1(b)(1) ("Properly referenced material facts in the movant's statement will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the opposing party's response.") (emphasis in original). Thus, the following facts are undisputed:
1. Kehr was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis ("MS") in 1996. (Deposition of Barbara Kehr, hereinafter "Kehr Dep.," [filing 38-3] at 15:8-10).
2. In connection with her MS, Kehr has been diagnosed with depression, fatigue, restless leg syndrome, and urinary urgency. (Kehr Dep. at 15:14-16:12).
3. Kehr takes an antidepressant daily, which works well to suppress or mitigate her symptoms of depression. (Kehr Dep. at 22:20-23:24, 27:23-28:9).
4. Kehr's fatigue medication has helped to eliminate fatigue as a symptom of MS. (Kehr Dep. at 23:25-24:16, 27:23-28:9).
5. Kehr also takes medication for restless leg syndrome and urinary urgency. [*3]  (Kehr Dep. at 26:1-15).
6. Sometimes when her legs are restless, Kehr will stand and "it's not a problem. It's just something I experience. I'm used to it. And I'll just stand and work my legs a little bit." (Kehr Dep. at 33:23-34:3).
7. Kehr describes her urinary problems as a "sudden urge," and her urinary habits as occurring "little bits at a time." (Declaration of Marcia A. Washkuhn, hereinafter "Washkuhn Dec.," [filing 38-1] ¶ 4, Ex. A [filing 38-2] at KEHR 000587). Kehr sometimes becomes incontinent. (Id.). Kehr takes medication "to counter any urinary problems that may arise." (Kehr Dep. at 26:1-15).
8. Kehr has "memory problems" that are "infrequent" and "brief." (Washkuhn Dec., ¶ 4, Ex. A at KEHR 000587). Kehr has difficulty remembering dates and appointments, so she tries to write things down. (Kehr Dep. at 28:10-29:23). Kehr believes she "compensate[s] for [her memory] pretty well." (Id. at 28:20-25). Kehr also has "problems sometimes" with concentration. (Id. at 24:24-25:15).
9. Kehr has difficulty in multitasking, specifically in taking notes while talking on the telephone at the same time. (Kehr Dep. at 29:24-31:10).
10. Kehr has a history of infrequent migraine headaches. [*4]  (Kehr Dep. at 19:25-20:2; Washkuhn Dec., ¶ 4, Ex. A at KEHR 000587).
11. Every 15 days or so, Kehr has "abdominal attacks," consisting of sudden nausea with diarrhea and vertigo, and lasting about one or two hours. (Washkuhn Dec., ¶ 4, Ex. A at KEHR 000587). 
12. Kehr tries not to get overheated because if she gets too hot, she gets tired. (Kehr Dep. at 32:23-33:4). To keep herself cool, Kehr avoids being "too active." (Id. at 33:10-22). For example, Kehr does not run. (Id. at 32:23-33:4). To avoid getting overheated, Kehr did not coach her children in softball, and if she took her children swimming, she tried to go indoors. (Id. at 33:10-22). Kehr, however, "can still go walking with [her children] and things like that." (Id.).
13. Kehr has tremors and sometimes has tingling in her arms when she puts her head down. (Kehr Dep. at 25:16-25, 27:7-16).
14. Kehr suffers from eye pain and "[l]ight sensitivity at times." (Kehr Dep. at 19:3-21, 25:22-25). Kehr's vision, however, is not affected. (Id. at 19:20-21).
15. Although Kehr has a good libido and does not have pain during intercourse, she has decreased sensitivity and difficulty achieving orgasm. (Washkuhn Dec., ¶ 4, Ex. A at KEHR 000587). [*5] 
16. "Awhile back [Kehr] think[s] [her] doctor advised [her] not to lift anything too heavy." (Kehr Dep. at 34:4-8).
17. Principal is an insurance company that offers life, medical, dental and vision insurance, and pension plans. (Deposition of Amanda Fox-Rivera, hereinafter "Rivera Dep.," [filing 38-4] at 128:2-9).
18. Kehr worked at Principal as an Account Representative for approximately one year, from October 9, 2006 to November 7, 2007. (Kehr Dep. 108:11-25, 147:3-9).
19. As an Account Representative, Kehr worked in a call center in Principal's Insured Health Operations Department and took inbound telephone calls from members and service providers, and she answered questions about benefits, preauthorization and claims. (Rivera Dep. at 14:9-18, 127:16-129:22).
20. Kehr's supervisor was Amanda Fox-Rivera ("Rivera"), who reported to Manager Pam Swazo. (Rivera Dep. at 15:16-16:9, 30:8-11).
21. During Kehr's employment, the disciplinary guideline structure in place began with coaching, which usually involved a verbal conversation about the employee's results. (Rivera Dep. at 26:5-14, 32:19-24). For example, if an employee was getting multiple errors in a situation, the coaching would involve [*6]  providing feedback to help the employee perform better. (Id. at 33:10-20).
22. If an employee was consistently not meeting his or her daily results, then coaching with consequences would take place. (Rivera Dep. at 35:21-36:18). Coaching with consequences essentially constituted disciplinary action. (Id. at 36:19-23, 46:23-47:4).
23. After coaching with consequences, Principal's disciplinary guideline structure called for a written warning, a final warning, and termination. (Rivera Dep. at 26:5-20).
24. Principal's disciplinary structure was only a guideline. (Rivera Dep. at 26:18-22).
25. Depending on the situation, Principal could skip disciplinary steps within the disciplinary guideline structure and move directly to termination. (Declaration of Amanda Fox-Rivera, hereinafter "Rivera Dec.," [filing 38-6] at ¶ 6).
26. There was no time frame established for the amount of time between disciplinary actions, and every situation and every individual would be evaluated differently. (Rivera Dep. at 27:4-16, 93:17-24, 157:25-158:11).
27. As noted earlier, as an Account Representative, Kehr was responsible for handling inbound telephone calls from members and service providers. (Rivera Dep. at [*7]  127:22-128:1).
28. The written job description for the Account Representative position included the following essential functions: "Meet or exceed established measurements," and "Complete necessary documentation in all utilized systems." (Declaration of Kelly Roberts, hereinafter "Roberts Dec.," [filing 38-10] ¶ 3, Ex. A [filing 38-11]).
29. A major function of the Account Representative position was talking on the telephone and documenting the information from the caller at the same time. (Kehr Dep. at 121:20-122:2).
30. Kehr admits the ability to multitask was a minimum requirement needed to perform the essential functions of the Account Representative position. (Kehr Dep. at 131:23-132:6).
31. Kehr admits she had difficulty performing the essential functions of the Account Representative position. (Kehr Dep. 29:24-30:8, 187:2-5, 194:9-13, 223:8-15).
32. An Account Representative's ability to "meet or exceed established measurements" was evaluated in two main parts: (1) competencies; and (2) the goals established in the IHO Experience Level Rating Guide, which included such areas as Availability, Adherence and Quality. (Rivera Dep. at 105:2-6, 134:6-137:3; Rivera Dec., ¶ 3, Ex. A [filing [*8]  38-7]).
33. Competencies were softer goals and included the ability to multitask, provide accurate information, and maintain attendance. (Rivera Dep. at 102:22-103:5).
34. Competencies were evaluated by quarterly side-by-sides, quality reviews, and daily observance. (Rivera Dep. at 102:22-103:5, 106:22-107:16).
35. During quarterly side-by-sides, Rivera plugged into the Account Representative's headset and monitored calls for 20-minute increments. (Rivera Dep. at 105:7-19, 106:22-108:12). Immediately after monitoring the telephone calls, Rivera discussed the calls and her observations with the Account Representative. (Id. at 108:8-12).
36. During quality reviews, quality reviewers randomly listened to eight recorded calls per month for each Account Representative, and they scored the Account Representative on his or her customer service and technical ability to provide accurate information. (Rivera Dep. at 134:10-135:1).
37. Daily observance involved Rivera observing the Account Representatives when she was up and about the team. (Rivera Dep. at 107:10-16).
38. The IHO Experience Level Rating Guide established measurable hard goals for the Account Representatives. (Rivera Dep. at 110:25-111:23). [*9] 
39. With respect to performance reviews, the hard goals were given more weight than soft goals. (Rivera Dep. at 112:3-8).
40. The hard goals listed on the IHO Experience Level Rating Guide included (1) IHO ACD/Avail ("Availability"), which is the percentage of time the employee is available to take incoming calls, (2) Adherence, which measures the employee adhering to his or her schedule for breaks and lunches, and (3) Quality, which measures customer service and providing accurate information. (Rivera Dep. at 130:9-20, 134:6-15).
41. Availability included ACD (which is the average call duration), ACW (which is after call work), AUX (which is the amount of time the employee is not available to take incoming calls), and hold (which is the amount of time the employee places a caller on hold during a call). (Rivera Dep. at 130:21-133:10; Kehr Dep. at 139:5-140:24).
42. Every month, each Account Representative was to meet or exceed his or her IHO Experience goals, including those pertaining to Quality, Availability and Adherence to ensure the Account Representative was available to take customer calls and to provide good quality care to the customers. (Kehr Dep. at 128:7-11, 130:19-24).
43. [*10]  Principal designed the monthly goals to ensure the Account Representatives provided prompt, courteous and excellent service at an acceptable cost, to ensure persons were available to take customer calls, and to provide good quality customer care to customers. (Kehr Dep. at 130:12-24; Rivera Dec. at ¶ 7).
44. Every month, each Account Representative met with his or her supervisor to review the previous month's results and to discuss whether the monthly goals were achieved. (Kehr Dep. at 143:25-144:3).
45. When an employee starts in the position of Account Representative, the goals are lower, but they gradually increase over time as the Account Representative remains in the position. (Kehr Dep. at 133:11-17).
46. There are four levels of goals for Account Representatives based on the length of time the employee is in the position: (1) up to 6 months; (2) 6 to 12 months; (3) 1 to 2 years; and (4) 2+ years. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 3, Ex. A [filing 38-7]).
47. Due to the learning curve, Principal recognizes that Account Representatives may not be able to meet their goals right off the bat, so the goals are set lower during the first six months on the job. (Rivera Dep. at 124:12-125:20). After six [*11]  months on the job, it was mandatory that the Account Representatives meet their goals. (Id. at 125:14-16).
48. Kehr's monthly goals during the January to April 2007 time frame, i.e., Kehr's first six months, which was the first level, included 97.1% for Quality, 62% for Availability, and 91% for Adherence. (Kehr Dep. at 141:16-142:11, 145:7-13).
49. Beginning May 1, 2007, Kehr's monthly goals, including Quality, Availability, and Adherence, increased to the second level. (Kehr Dep. 144:4-13; Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C [filing 38-9] at KEHR 000081-82). Kehr's monthly goals at the second level included 97.9% for Quality,1 68% for Availability, and 92% for Adherence. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 3, Ex. A).
50. Beginning November 1, 2007, Kehr's monthly goals for Quality, Availability, and Adherence increased to the third level. (Kehr Dep. at 144:14-18). Kehr's monthly goals at the third level included 98% for Quality, 70% for Availability, and 92% for Adherence. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 3, Ex. A).
51. The following chart provides a summary of Kehr's monthly results pertaining to Quality, Availability, and Adherence from January 2007 to October 2007:

(Rivera Dec. at ¶ 4, Ex. B [filing 38-8]).
52. The following chart provides a summary of Kehr's monthly levels and goals from January 2007 to October 2007. Kehr failed to meet the goals that are shaded in gray.

(Kehr Dep. at 145:7-149:3; Rivera Dec. at ¶ 3, Ex. A).
53. On March 6, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with respect to her failure to meet her February 2007 goal for Quality. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C [filing 38-9] at KEHR 000088). Id. at (a)(2)
54. On April 4, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with consequences with respect to her failure to meet her March 2007 goal for Quality. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 000086). Rivera advised Kehr that she needed to meet her [*13]  Quality goal for the month of April 2007 to avoid disciplinary action. (Id.).
55. On June 5, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with respect to her failure to meet her May 2007 goals for Quality and Availability. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 00008182). Rivera advised Kehr that as of May 1, 2007, her goals had changed to the 6-12 month level, and she needed to focus on meeting Quality and Availability goals. (Id.). Rivera told Kehr that she needed to reduce her after call work, and Rivera arranged for Kehr to receive tips on how to lower her after call work. (Id.)
56. On July 11, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with consequences with respect to her failure to meet her June 2007 goals for Quality, Availability, and Adherence. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 000075). Rivera told Kehr that she needed to focus on meeting her Quality goal, and she needed to reduce her after call work (which would help her meet her average call duration goal). (Id.). Rivera told Kehr that she needed to meet her goals in July 2007 to avoid disciplinary action. (Id.).
57. On August 7, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with consequences with respect to her July 2007 results. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C [*14]  at KEHR 000066). While Kehr had met her Quality goal for July, Rivera told Kehr that she needed to focus on meeting her Availability and Adherence goals, and Rivera gave Kehr guidance on how to improve, such as using computer macros and documenting as much information as possible while on the telephone. (Id.). Rivera told Kehr that she needed to meet her goals to avoid disciplinary action. (Id.; Kehr Dep. at 154:6-12).
58. On September 10, 2007, Rivera gave Kehr a coaching with consequences with respect to her August 2007 results. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 000057). While Kehr had met her Quality goal for August, Rivera told Kehr that she needed to meet all her goals. (Id.). Rivera specifically stated, "we really need to focus on lower[ing] her [after call work]." (Id.). Kehr understood in her discussions with Rivera that she needed to document more while she was on the telephone to reduce her after call work. (Kehr Dep. at 150:14-18). Rivera told Kehr that "we could go down disciplinary action if the goals are not met." (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 000057).
59. Kehr admits she was not consistently meeting her monthly goals. (Kehr Dep. at 158:5-9). She admits that between [*15]  January 2007 and October 2007, she only met her Availability goal two months out of ten. (Id. at 146:3-147:15). She also admits that between January 2007 and October 2007, she only met her Quality goal five months out of ten. (Id. at 147:16-148:8).
60. Kehr understood in her monthly coaching sessions with Rivera that she needed to document more while on the phone to reduce her after call work. (Kehr Dep. at 150:14-18).
61. Kehr understood that if her monthly results did not improve, she might be disciplined and the results might lead to disciplinary action. (Kehr Dep. at 154:6-12, 156:5-14, 157:11-16).
62. Because Kehr was consistently failing to meet her goals, sometime before October 4, 2007, Manager Pam Swazo directed Rivera to give Kehr a written warning. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 8; Rivera Dep. at 164:10-16). Rivera, however, did not issue the written warning pending review of whether Kehr was eligible for assistance in her job in light of the statements Kehr had made about her MS and how it may have been affecting her results. (Deposition of Kelly Roberts, hereinafter "Roberts Dep.," [filing 38-5] at 62:1-63:5; Rivera Dep. at 166:11-20; Kehr 152:25-153:16).
63. If Kehr had received a written [*16]  warning, she would not have been eligible to apply to transfer to another position within the company. (Kehr Dec. at 116:6-16).
64. On October 2, 2007, Kehr visited her neurologist and reported she was having memory problems and "a difficult time doing [her] work and meeting [her] quota." (Kehr Dep. at 48:12-15, 49:10-15).
65. On October 4, 2007, Rivera met with Kehr to discuss her monthly results and how she had not met her monthly goals during the last few months. During this conversation, Kehr advised Rivera she was having trouble concentrating and believed that was affecting her results. (Kehr Dep. at 172:15-19). Kehr also told Rivera that she believed her MS may have been affecting her results, and that she did not know if she could meet her goals in her position. (Id. at 169:4-6, 173:2-4).2 Kehr asked to transfer to an Administrative Specialist position because she believed it may have lower goals that she would be more apt to meet, require less time on the phone, and have more relaxed breaks and AUX time. (Id. at 171:4-15, 202:21-203:8).
66. Because Kehr had stated her medical condition was affecting her results, Rivera referred the matter to a human resources specialist, Compliance Consultant [*17]  Kelly Roberts ("Roberts"). (Rivera Dep. at 29:13-25).
67. On October 8, 2007, Roberts sent an e-mail to Kehr, asking whether she felt she needed assistance due to medical issues:
I wanted to contact you briefly about a potential medical condition that may be impacting you in our job. I work in Human Resources and my role is to assist employees who may have work needs due to medical issues. I can assist with providing job accommodations, special equipment, leave of absence, etc.
If you are in need of assistance the Company can review your situation to determine what, if any, assistance we may need to provide in light of any medical issues you may have. In order to [do] this, I would need to spend some time discussing your situation with you. After that, I would need to obtain your authorization so that I could write to your medical provider(s) for specific information pertaining to your medical information. Any information you share with me and/or I obtain regarding your medical situation is confidential, is not being shared with your leader or your HR Generalist, nor being made part of your personnel file. The only information shared with your leader is any restrictions you may have to [*18]  your work activities or any accommodation/assistance that the Company may need to provide you.
If I do not hear from you by Wednesday, 10/10, I will assume that you do not feel you need assistance at this time and I will close my handling of your situation. If you have questions/comments, please feel free to contact me at any time.
(Roberts Dec., ¶ 4, Ex. B [filing 38-12]; Kehr Dep. 178:1-179:7).
68. On October 8, 2007, Kehr responded to Roberts' inquiry, stating she felt her medical condition was impacting her performance, and she would like to visit with Roberts to discuss her options: "I do feel that my medical condition is impacting my performance. I would definitely like to visit with you and find out what my options are that may help me to perform better in my position, or any position that I may be best suited for here." (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C [filing 38-13]; Kehr Dep. 178:13-15, 179:17-181:11).
69. On October 11, 2007, Roberts talked with Kehr to learn how Kehr felt she might need assistance in her job. (Roberts Dec. at ¶¶ 6-7, Exs. D [filing 38-14], E [filing 38-15]). Among other things, Kehr indicated she was having difficulty concentrating and with her memory, so she was [*19]  having problems documenting calls while on the telephone with a customer. (Kehr Dep. at 187:2-13, 194:9-13). Kehr explained that she continued to document calls after the call ended, so she was less available to answer other calls and, therefore, could not meet her Availability goal. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 6, Ex. D; Kehr Dep. at 148:22-149:3, 172:15-19, 185:10-15, 194:9-13).
70. Roberts informed Rivera that she would "conduct a formal review of [Kehr's] situation," and Roberts asked Rivera to "hold on formally addressing any performance-related issues." (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 7, Ex. E).
71. On October 11, 2007, Roberts requested Kehr complete a medical authorization form to continue the review of Kehr's situation. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 8, Ex. F [filing 38-16]).
72. On October 17, 2007, Roberts advised Kehr that she would be faxing questions to Kehr's treating physician, Dr. Anita Venkataramana. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 9, Ex. G [filing 38-17]).
73. Also on October 17, 2007, Roberts faxed a questionnaire to Kehr's treating physician, Dr. Anita Venkataramana, seeking clarification of the nature of Kehr's medical condition as it relates to her job duties. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 10, Ex. H [filing 38-18]). The [*20]  questions and Dr. Venkataramana's answers thereto state, in part, as follows:
[Question:] Does Barb's medical condition substantially limit her ability to perform a "major life activity"? A major life activity is generally defined as: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, sleeping, sitting, standing, lifting, reaching, eating, thinking, concentrating, reading and interacting with others. If yes, please indicate the major life activities that are substantially limited:
[Dr. Venkataramana:] At this time no. The disease changes from time to time.
....
[Question:] Please identify whether the major life activity is permanently or temporarily limited by the medical condition.
[Dr. Venkataramana:] It can be when and if she has a flare.
[Question:] Barb's job is that of an Account Representative. This job is a call-center environment and requires that Barb be on the phone, sitting at her desk the majority of the day. The job also requires the ability to multi-task and pay attention to detail. Barb has indicated that she is having difficulty talking on the phone to clients and taking notes at the same time. . . In your opinion, [*21]  is she medically able to perform these job duties?
[Dr. Venkataramana:] Yes, she should from time to time be able to stand and stretch if needed. If she has urinary dysfunction, then a desk closer to the restroom may be helpful.
....
[Question:] Please indicate any job accommodations we may consider to assist the employee in performing her job duties:
[Dr. Venkataramana:] Desk closer to restroom.
(Id.).
74. On October 24, 2007, Roberts faxed a letter to Dr. Venkataramana, stating Kehr "has indicated that she is having difficulty talking on the phone to clients and taking notes at the same time because of memory and concentration issues." (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 11, Ex. I [filing 38-19]). Roberts asked Dr. Venkataramana to "clarify if the difficulties [Kehr] is reporting experiencing are related to or caused solely by her multiple sclerosis." (Id.). Dr. Venkataramana responded: "Yes. MS can cause cognitive problems of any kind." (Id.).
75. On October 25, 2007, Roberts informed Kehr that she had received responses from Dr. Venkataramana, and that she would like to discuss some follow up questions with Kehr. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 12, Ex. J [filing 38-20]; Kehr Dep. 193:3-13).
76. On October 29, 2007, [*22]  Roberts and Kehr had a conversation about Kehr's request for a job accommodation. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K [filing 38-21]).
77. During this conversation, other than suggesting that she be transferred into a different position, Kehr did not offer any suggestions of what might have been done to accommodate her in the Account Representative position. (Roberts Dec. at ¶¶ 13-14, Exs. K, L [filing 38-22]; Kehr Dep. at 201:18-202:6).
78. The only accommodation that Kehr requested was to transfer to another position, specifically, the Administrative Specialist position. (Kehr Dep. at 171:4-15, 175:7-15, 185:24-186:7; 226:3-228:22). Kehr did not request any accommodations to help her perform the essential functions of the Account Representative position. (Id. at 224:7-12).
79. Kehr admits no reasonable accommodation existed that would allow her to perform the essential functions of the Account Representative position. (Kehr Dep. at 202:2-20).
80. Roberts informed Kehr that, based on Kehr's self-reported inability to document calls at the same time as being on the telephone and the information provided by Kehr's medical provider, Roberts determined Kehr was unable to perform the essential functions [*23]  of the Account Representative position. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K; Roberts Dep. at 89:20-90:12, 91:1-14; Rivera Dec. at ¶ 5, Ex. C at KEHR 000002-3).
81. Roberts also informed Kehr that no reasonable job accommodations would allow her to continue in the Account Representative position, because Principal could not permanently reduce the production requirements or goals for the position. (Kehr Dep. at 201:6-17; Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K).
82. Roberts told Kehr that she would check with the appropriate people to determine whether Kehr could perform the job of Administrative Specialist with or without reasonable job accommodations. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K; Kehr Dep. at 205:18-23).
83. Roberts advised Kehr that if Kehr refused to accept the Administrative Specialist position or could not perform the Administrative Specialist job, then she would be terminated because there were no other viable positions currently available at Principal. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K; Kehr Dep. 208:13-25).
84. Roberts asked Kehr to submit a "mini resume" so Principal could determine whether she met the minimum qualifications to be considered for the Administrative Specialist job, which Kehr submitted [*24]  on October 30, 2007. (Roberts Dec. at ¶¶ 13,15, Exs. K, M [filing 38-23]; Roberts Dep. at 112:21-113:4, 113:13-21).
85. The only available position at Principal's Grand Island location for which Kehr met the minimum qualifications was an Administrative Specialist position. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 13, Ex. K; Kehr Dep. at 117:6-11).
86. As of November 1, 2007, Principal had six Administrative Specialist positions open in Grand Island. (Roberts Dec. at ¶¶ 16-19, Exs. N [filing 38-24], O [filing 38-25], P [filing 38-26], Q [filing 38-27]; Roberts Dep. at 121:3-15, 127:7-9).
87. The Administrative Specialist requires, among other things, "[p]rocess[ing] and respond[ing] to account inquiries about billing information and eligibility requirements." (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 20, Ex. R [filing 38-28]).
88. All the available Administrative Specialist positions at that time were telephone positions; no non-phone positions were available. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 18, Ex. P; Roberts Dep. at 125:7-9).
89. Roberts spoke with the recruiter, HR Representative and manager of the Administrative Specialist position to determine the job requirements and essential functions of the position. (Roberts Dec. ¶ 22).
90. The available [*25]  Administrative Specialist positions required taking calls in a queue, similar to a call center, and required researching, following up with customers, and providing answers to customer questions. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 18, Ex. P; Roberts Dep. at 125:17-19, 129:22-130:7).
91. While the available Administrative Specialist positions did not have specific goals for the amount of time spent on each call, they required being on the phone approximately 70% of the time, or approximately 5.5 to 6 hours per day, and each Administrative Specialist took approximately 45 to 70 calls per day, with each call lasting approximately 3-5 minutes. (Roberts Dep. at 125:7-21, 127:7-22, 128:19-25; Roberts Dec. at ¶¶ 18-19, Exs. P, Q).
92. To be available to take calls for 5.5 to 6 hours per day, Administrative Specialists cannot be in AUX mode, and otherwise unavailable to take calls, more than 2 hours per day. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 19, Ex. Q; Roberts Dep. at 129:11-15).
93. The available Administrative Specialist positions required the ability to multitask and document calls while on the telephone, because if the employee needed to log off the phone to document telephone calls, the employee would not be able to complete [*26]  the documentation duties within the 2 hours of AUX time allowed. (Roberts Dep. at 130:15-131:3).
94. In connection with her investigation of the requirements of the available Administrative Specialist positions, Roberts asked the manager of the Administrative Specialist position about what would cause employees to struggle in the position, to which the manager responded that employees with issues that Kehr had (i.e., the inability to take and document calls or spending too much time in AUX) caused employees to struggle in the Administrative Specialist position:
Q: Anything else you recall from that phone conversation with Marci English on November 1st of 2007?
A: I recall my concerns that I had. Q: Okay. What were your concerns?
A: I was concerned that when I asked her the question about when people struggle in the role what's the cause, and the thing that she answered—the thing that stuck out to me were the exact same issues that Ms. Kehr was experiencing in her current job.
Q: And what was that?
A: The inability to take and document calls within set performance objectives or standards and having to spend an inordinate amount of time in AUX time.
(Roberts Dep. at 132:5-20).
95. Because Kehr [*27]  had difficulty documenting calls while on the telephone in the Account Representative position, and because this essential function also existed with the Administrative Specialist position, based on Kehr's self-reports about her medical condition and the manner in which it affected her, Kehr would not have been able to perform the essential functions of an Administrative Specialist position. (Roberts Dep. at 132:10-20; Roberts Dec. at ¶ 23).
96. Kehr does not dispute the essential functions of the Administrative Specialist position as related by the individuals who talked to Roberts. (Kehr Dep. at 248:1-250:1-8)
97. On November 6, 2007, Roberts informed Kehr that Principal was unable to identify any accommodations that would enable her to perform the Administrative Specialist job. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 21, Ex. S [filing 38-29]; Kehr Dep. 212:7-215:20).
98. Roberts asked Kehr if she felt there was any way Principal could accommodate her in an Administrative Specialist position. (Roberts Dec. at ¶ 21, Ex. S; Roberts Dep. at 140:13-19). Kehr told Roberts she could not think of a way that Principal could accommodate her in an Administrative Specialist position. (Roberts Dep. at 140:20-24).
99. [*28]  Because Kehr could not perform the essential functions of either the Account Representative or Administrative Specialist positions with or without reasonable accommodations, Principal terminated her employment. (Rivera Dec. at ¶ 21, Ex. S).
(Filing 37, at 3-21 (subheadings omitted).)

II. Discussion
Summary judgment "should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, giving that party the benefit of all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence. Dancy v. Hyster Co., 127 F.3d 649, 652-53 (8th Cir. 1997). It is not the court's function to weigh evidence in the summary judgment record to determine the truth of any factual issue; the court merely determines whether there is evidence creating a genuine issue for trial. Bell v. Conopco, Inc., 186 F.3d 1099, 1101 (8th Cir. 1999).
"Because discrimination cases often depend on inferences rather than on direct evidence, summary judgment should not be granted unless the evidence could not support any reasonable inference for the nonmovant." [*29]  Crawford v. Runyon, 37 F.3d 1338, 1341 (8th Cir.1994); Bassett v. City of Minneapolis, 211 F.3d 1097, 1099 (8th Cir.2000). However, summary judgment is proper if the plaintiff fails to establish any element of his or her prima facie case. Wilking v. County of Ramsey, 153 F.3d 869, 873 (8th Cir.1998); Cravens v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, 214 F.3d 1011, 1016 (8th Cir.2000).
Peyton v. Fred's Stores of Arkansas, Inc., 561 F.3d 900, 901 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 876, 130 S. Ct. 243, 175 L. Ed. 2d 130 (2009).
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), employers are barred from discriminating "against a qualified individual because of the disability of such individual." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (2008).3 The Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act ("NFEPA") similarly makes it unlawful for an employer "to discharge . . . or to otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's . . . disability[.]" Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48-1104 (Westlaw 2010).
"The disability discrimination provisions in the NFEPA are patterned after the ADA, and the statutory definitions of 'disability' and 'qualified individual with a disability' contained in the NFEPA are virtually identical to the definitions of the ADA." Orr v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 297 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir. 2002). "In construing the NFEPA, Nebraska courts have looked to federal decisions, because the NFEPA is patterned after Title VII and the ADA." Id. (citing Father Flanagan's Boys' Home v. Agnew, 256 Neb. 394, 590 N.W.2d 688, 693 (Neb. 1999); IBP, Inc. v. Sands, 252 Neb. 573, 563 N.W.2d 353, 357-59 (Neb. 1997). In the discussion which follows, therefore, while I will analyze Kehr's disability discrimination claims solely with reference to the ADA, the analysis applies [*30]  equally to the NFEPA.
In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, claims are evaluated under the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Kratzer v. Rockwell Collins, Inc., 398 F.3d 1040, 1044 (8th Cir. 2005). First, an employee must make out a prima facie case by showing that "(1) the employee is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) the employee is qualified (with or without reasonable accommodation) to perform the essential functions of a job; and (3) the employee suffered an adverse employment action because of the disability." Henderson v. Ford Motor Co., 403 F.3d 1026, 1034 (8th Cir.2005). Once the employee establishes a prima facie case, the employer must proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. If the employer puts forth such a reason, the employee has the burden of demonstrating that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. Id.
The pending motion for summary judgment concerns only the first step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, as Principal argues that Kehr cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination regarding either its decision to terminate her employment as an account representative or its refusal to instead employ her as an administrative specialist. Basically, Principal contends that (1) Kehr is not disabled within the [*31]  meaning of the ADA because (a) her major life activities are not substantially limited, (b) there is no evidence she has a record of disability, and (c) Principal did not regard her as disabled; and (2) Kehr is not qualified to work as an account representative or as an administrative specialist.
While I find there is a genuine issue of material fact whether Kehr is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, there is not sufficient evidence to support a finding that Kehr was a qualified individual with a disability. That is, the evidence is uncontroverted that Kehr was unable to perform the essential functions of the jobs that were available to her at Principal. Accordingly, Principal's motion for summary judgment will be granted and Kehr's action will be dismissed with prejudice.

A. Kehr's Alleged Disability
As a threshold matter, Kehr must produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that she has a disability within the meaning of the ADA. Helfter v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 115 F.3d 613, 616 (8th Cir. 1997) ("The presence or absence of a disability is a threshold question."). Establishing a disability is "a significant hurdle that can prevent a person who was denied a job because of an impairment from being covered by the ADA." Nuzum v. Ozark Auto. Distribs., Inc., 432 F.3d 839, 842-43 (8th Cir. 2005).
The ADA defines "disability" [*32]  as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) (2008).4 Despite Kehr's MS diagnosis, I find no admissible evidence of an actual disability or a history of disability (definitions (A) and (b) above). There is sufficient admissible evidence, however, for a jury to find that Principal perceived Kehr to be disabled (definition (C) above) after she reported to the company that her MS-related impairments were causing job performance issues.

1. Kehr's Impairments Do Not Substantially Limit a Major Life Activity
Major life activities include key life "functions, such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i). The Supreme Court has held that a life activity is "major" when it is "of central importance to daily life." Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed. 2d 615 (2002). Thus, a plaintiff's "inability to perform an activity of little importance does not establish disability." Nuzum, 432 F.3d at 844. "[A] finding of disability depends . . . on whether the net effect of the impairment is to prevent or severely restrict [*33]  the plaintiff from doing the set of activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives, or from working." Id. at 846 (internal quotation and citations omitted). "When the major life activity under consideration is that of working, . . . 'substantially limits' requires, at a minimum, [(the plaintiff) shows she is] unable to work in a broad class of jobs." Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S. Ct. 2139, 144 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1999). "The inability to perform a single particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(i).
"An individual's major life activities are substantially limited if she is unable to perform a basic function the average person in the general population can perform, or is significantly restricted in the condition, manner, or duration under which she can perform a major life activity as compared to an average person in the general population." Samuels v. Kansas City Missouri School Dist., 437 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i)-(ii)). "This standard requires [Kehr] to show more than a 'mere difference' between [her] performance and that of the average individual." Kirkeberg v. Canadian Pacific Ry., 619 F.3d 898, 903 (8th Cir. 2010) (quoting Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555, 565, 119 S. Ct. 2162, 144 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1999)).
"The impairment must be substantial, that is, considerable or to a large degree." Samuels, 437 F.3d at 801 (citing Toyota, 534 U.S. at 196). "Health conditions that cause moderate limitations on major life activities do not constitute disabilities [*34]  under the ADA." Orr, 297 F.3d at 724. "Several factors are considered in determining whether a person is substantially limited in a major life activity: (1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) its duration or anticipated duration; and (3) its long-term impact." Taylor v. Nimock's Oil Co., 214 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir. 2000).
At the time of her termination, Kehr suffered from numerous conditions relating to her MS, including depression, fatigue, urinary problems, restless leg syndrome, tremors and tingling, memory and concentration problems, difficulty in multitasking, migraine headaches, abdominal attacks with nausea, diarrhea and vertigo, eye pain and light sensitivity, difficulty with physical exertion, decrease in sensitivity and difficulty in achieving orgasm, and a general lifting restriction. As a matter of law, none of these impairments substantially limit any major life activities.
Kehr is able to control many of these symptoms with regular medication, including her depression, fatigue, urinary problems, and restless leg syndrome. "A person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by medication or other measures does not have an impairment that presently 'substantially limits' a major life activity." Sutton, 527 U.S. at 482-83. There is no evidence these symptoms [*35]  substantially limit any major life activities. See generally Cooper v. Olin Corp. Winchester Div., 246 F.3d 1083, 1087 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer where no evidence existed to show plaintiff's depression substantially limited her major life functions because she had suffered from depression for over 30 years, during which time she worked, raised a family, took care of her own finances, took care of her pets and had no problem living independently); Croy v. Cobe Lab, Inc., 345 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir. 2003) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's MS-related fatigue did not prohibit her from completing her job or prevent her from performing any life activities completely); Nyrop, 616 F.3d at 735 (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's general fatigue from MS did not substantially limit plaintiff in her major life activities); Dingwerth v. Astrue, No. 4:05-CV-2003-MLM, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50586, 2007 WL 2507739, at *11 (E.D. Mo. June 8, 2007) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's fatigue did not preclude her from working full days and even overtime when asked and, therefore, was not substantially limiting her activity of working); Swain v. Hillsbourough County Sch. Bd., 146 F.3d 855, 858 (11th Cir. 1998) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding that plaintiff, who suffered from incontinence, "presented no evidence to show that she [*36]  cannot perform a broad range or class of jobs; instead, she simply ma[de] the vague assertion that she [was] unable to perform any job that precludes her from having regular access to a restroom"); Wood v. Crown Redi-Mix, Inc., 339 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 2003) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff, who was able to walk only one-quarter mile before he had to stop to take a rest, who had numbness in parts of his toes on his left foot and leg, whose left knee sometimes collapsed, and who walked with a cane, was not substantially limited in his ability to walk).
Kehr's other symptoms are infrequent and of limited duration, including her tremors and trembling, memory and concentration problems, migraine headaches, vertigo, diarrhea, nausea, eye pain and light sensitivity. None of these symptoms are shown to prevent Kehr from performing a broad class of jobs or to substantially limit her ability to perform any other major life activity. See generally Hooven-Lewis v. Caldera, 249 F.3d 259, 269 (4th Cir. 2001) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's hand tremors did not qualify her as disabled because her tremors did not prevent her from performing a broad class of jobs); Crock v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 261 F. Supp. 2d 1101, 1117 (S.D. Iowa 2003) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer and holding "even severe [*37]  symptoms which are episodic do not constitute a substantial limitation on a major life activity"); Moore v. Cingular Wireless, No. 4:05CV01851WRW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72358, 2007 WL 2828768, at *6 (E.D. Ark. Sept. 27, 2007) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer and holding that in suffering from occasional migraines, plaintiff was not restricted in her ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs and was therefore not substantially limited in a major life activity); Orr, 297 F.3d at 724 (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's sporadic insulin attacks that lasted a relatively short duration did not render him a disabled person); Howard v. N. Miss. Med. Ctr., 939 F. Supp. 505, 509 (N.D. Miss. 1996) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff did not establish her vertigo and migraines substantially limited her major life activity of working); Kirkeberg, 619 F.3d at 905 (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding that while plaintiff with monocular vision "has not completely compensated for his monocularity, he has adjusted such that he is not substantially limited in any major life activity relative to the average individual.").
Kehr also complains that she becomes overheated with physical exertion, has decreased sensitivity during sexual relations, and has been advised by [*38]  her doctor not to lift anything too heavy. These symptoms are not severe and have not been shown to substantially limit any major life activity. See generally Croy, 345 F.3d at 1204 (declining to recognize multiple sclerosis as a substantial impairment of a life activity where the plaintiff, among other things, could not bear "sustained exertion"); Nyrop, 616 F.3d at 735 (plaintiff with MS failed to explain how her sensitivity to heat over seventy degrees substantially limits a major life activity); E.E.O.C. v. Argo Dist., LLC, 555 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir. 2009) (affirming summary judgment to employer and holding plaintiff who suffered from a condition where he was unable to sweat and adopted a variety of strategies to regulate his body temperature, including drinking cold liquids, resting when laboring in the heat, and using air conditioning, was not substantially limited from a major life activity); Contreras v. Suncast Corp., 237 F.3d 756, 763-64 (7th Cir. 2001) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff's claim that he was disabled in the major life activity of sexual reproduction and engaging in sexual relations because his injury limited the frequency he had sexual intercourse to twice a month did not significantly limit a major life activity); Brunko v. Mercy Hosp., 260 F.3d 939, 941 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer and stating, "[a]lthough [*39]  lifting itself is identified as a major life activity, this court has held that a general lifting restriction without more is insufficient to constitute a disability within the meaning of the ADA").
Finally, Kehr has difficulty in multitasking, specifically in taking notes while talking on the telephone at the same time. This difficulty led to her termination, but Kehr has not demonstrated that it prevented her from performing a broad range of jobs. "An individual does not prove that he or she has a disability simply by showing an impairment that makes it impossible to do his or her particular job without accommodation." Nuzum, 432 F.3d at 842. "There is no support in the case law for the proposition that 'multitasking' itself constitutes a major life activity." Hays v. Clark Prod., Inc., No. 1:07-CV-328SEN-DML, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102626, 2008 WL 5384300, at *7 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 18, 2008) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer and holding that plaintiff's inability to add and subtract numbers while simultaneously completing her receptionist duties did not qualify as substantially limiting a major life activity); see also Prentice v. County of Lancaster, No. 4:03CV3118, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1293, 2004 WL 210641, at *4 (D.Neb. Feb. 3, 2004) (granting summary judgment in favor of employer and holding plaintiff who was "not very good at multi-tasking" [*40]  was not disabled).
Kehr's response to Principal's evidence regarding her physical and mental impairments (as summarized in paragraphs 1 through 16 of Principal's statement of material facts) consists of a single, 47-page exhibit ("Exhibit 12" (filing 47-6)) which her attorney identifies as containing "true and correct copies of plaintiff[']s medical records and reports retrieved via subpoena or other formal discovery from the Social Security Administration or the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission." (Affidavit of Eric Brown (filing 41-1) ¶ 9.) Principal objects that the exhibit is not authenticated and is hearsay. Both objections are well-taken.
"To be considered on summary judgment, documents must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit made on personal knowledge setting forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence or a deposition that meets the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Documents which do not meet those requirements cannot be considered." Stuart v. General Motors Corp., 217 F.3d 621, 636 n. 20 (8th Cir. 2000). See also NECivR 56.1 ("[T]he procedures of Nebraska Civil Rule 7.0.1 apply to summary judgment motions."); NECivR 7.0.1(b)(2)(C) ("An affidavit must identify and authenticate documents filed with the [evidence] index. The affidavit must be made on personal knowledge, set forth [*41]  facts that would be admissible in evidence, show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated, and identify the related motion.").
Although Kehr's attorney provided an affidavit which identifies the exhibits filed in opposition to Principal's motion for summary judgment, the affidavit does not properly authenticate the "medical records and reports" filed as Exhibit 12. There is no affirmative showing that Kehr's attorney has any personal knowledge regarding the source of such documents. In paragraph 3 of his affidavit, counsel "declare[s] that the foregoing statements are true and correct to my personal knowledge," (filing 41-1 ¶ 3 (emphasis supplied)), but in the preceding paragraphs of the affidavit counsel merely indicates that he "represent[s] Barbara Kehr in [this action]" and is "making this Affidavit in opposition of [sic] to defendant's motion for summary judgment." (Id., ¶¶ 1, 2.) There are no facts stated in the affidavit to show Kehr's attorney has personal knowledge that the documents copied in Exhibit 12 were "retrieved via subpoena or other formal discovery from the Social Security Administration or the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission." [*42]  (Id., ¶ 9.) Foundation is lacking. See Fed. R. Evid. 901(a) ("The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims."). Additionally, even if Kehr's attorney personally obtained the Exhibit 12 documents "via subpoena or other formal discovery from the Social Security Administration or the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission," he is not shown to have any personal knowledge that the documents are, in fact, Kehr's "medical records and reports." Information contained in the documents is also hearsay. Even supposing the documents might be admitted in evidence under the "business records" exception to the hearsay rule, see Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), the affidavit does not lay the necessary foundation for this exception.
Kehr's Exhibit 12 is not admissible in evidence and therefore cannot create a genuine issue of material fact to defeat Principal's motion for summary judgment. See Golter v. Square D Co., No. 4:06CV3287, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87073, 2007 WL 4225273, *2 (D.Neb. Nov. 27, 2007) (plaintiff's affidavit identifying exhibits as "true and correct copies" of documents that were provided to her by defendant were not properly authenticated and [*43]  were inadmissible); Hillard v. Clarke, 245 F.R.D. 419, 420-21 (D.Neb. 2007) (denying defendant's motion for summary judgment and stating, "this is not some goofy authentication rule that I dreamed up."); Davis v. Hartland Homes, Inc., No. 4:06CV3012, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70599, 2006 WL 2805255, *9 (D.Neb. Sep. 28, 2006) (plaintiff's "true and correct copy" of defendant's memo not properly authenticated); Barger v. Johanns, No. 4:04CV3268, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14331, 2006 WL 680889, *8 (D.Neb. Mar. 13, 2006) ("Plaintiff's affidavit merely recites that the attached documents 'are true and correct copies.' There is no indication that Plaintiff has any personal knowledge concerning the documents that would permit him to describe what they are."); PW Eagle, Inc. v. Schnase, 376 F.Supp.2d 945, 947 (D.Neb. 2005) ("I refuse to consider the copy of the settlement agreement because defendants' counsel did not comply with the rules regarding the authentication of the settlement agreement. Counsel should know that we are serious about these rules.") (footnote omitted); Cordray v. 135-80 Travel Plaza, Inc., 356 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1015 n. 5 (D.Neb. 2005) ("Authentication means more than 'my opponent gave me a document.'").

2. There Is No Record of Disability
Although not specifically alleged in her complaint, Kehr suggests in her brief that "she has a has a record reflecting 'a history of . . . [a] physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.' 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(k)." (Filing 48 at 14.) In this regard, [*44]  Kehr simply refers the court "to Exhibit 12 offered by the plaintiff in its [sic] index of evidence and exhibits offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment." (Id.) For reasons discussed above, however, Exhibit 12 is inadmissible and will not be considered.

3. There Is Evidence Principal Regarded Kehr as Disabled
There are two ways in which an individual may be "regarded as" disabled by his or her employer: "(1) the employer mistakenly believes the individual has an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) the employer mistakenly believes an actual non-limiting impairment substantially limits one or more of the individual's major life activities." Pittari v. Am. Eagle Airlines, Inc., 468 F.3d 1056, 1061 (8th Cir. 2006). "In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual—it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting." Sutton, 527 U.S. at 489. "The mere fact that the employer is aware of an employee's condition . . . is not sufficient to survive summary judgment on the question of whether an employer regards an employee as disabled." [*45]  Anderson v. N.D. State Hosp., 232 F.3d 634, 637 (8th Cir. 2000). The provision "is intended to combat the effects of 'archaic attitudes,' erroneous perceptions, and myths that work to the disadvantage of persons with or regarded as having disabilities." Brunko, 260 F.3d at 942 (quoting Wooten v. Farmland Foods, 58 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir. 1995)).
In determining Kehr could not document calls while on the telephone (and, therefore, could not perform an essential function of her account representative position), Principal relied on Kehr's own statements that she was not meeting her monthly production goals because her MS made it difficult for her to multitask and document calls while still on the telephone. Principal also relied on statements of Kehr's treating physician in determining Kehr could not perform all the essential functions of her job. Dr. Venkataramana confirmed Kehr's self-reported difficulty in talking on the telephone and taking notes at the same time was caused by her MS.5
Just because an employer relies upon the employee's own complaint that a medical condition prevents or hinders the performance of job duties does not mean that the employer regards the employee as disabled for purposes of the ADA. See Knutson v. Ag Processing, Inc., 394 F.3d 1047, 1054 (8th Cir. 2005) (reversing denial of summary judgment to employer and stating, "Ag Processing removed Knutson from [*46]  his boiler operator position after he complained that it was painful for him to perform one responsibility associated with that particular job. Under the governing precedents, we find that there was insufficient evidence that the company regarded Knutson as unable to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs."). The same is true when an employer relies on statements of an employee's treating physician. See Pittari, 468 F.3d at 1063 (reversing district court's denial of employer's motion for judgment as a matter of law and holding "[r]estrictions based upon the recommendations of physicians are not based upon myths or stereotypes about the disabled and thus do not demonstrate a perception of disability"); see also Breitkreutz v. Cambrex Charles City, Inc., 450 F.3d 780, 784 (8th Cir. 2006) (affirming summary judgment to employer and holding that "[i]f a restriction is based upon the recommendations of physicians, then it is not based upon myths or stereotypes about the disabled and does not establish a perception of disability"); Wooten, 58 F.3d at 386 (Farmland Foods' decision to terminate Wooten based upon the physical restrictions imposed by his doctor, when no jobs accommodating those restrictions were currently available, does not indicate that Farmland Foods regarded Wooten as having a substantially [*47]  limiting impairment.").
"If an employer believes that an employee is unable to perform 'one specific job,' then the employee is not regarded as disabled." Chalfant v. Titan Distrib., Inc., 475 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir. 2007); see also Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 527 U.S. 516, 523, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 144 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1999) ("[T]o be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job."). "There is a distinction between being regarded as an individual unqualified for a particular job because of a limiting physical impairment and being regarded as 'disabled' within the meaning of the ADA." Conant v. City of Hibbing, 271 F.3d 782, 785 (8th Cir. 2001). "Accordingly, an employer is free to decide that . . . some limiting, but not substantially limiting, impairments make individuals less than ideally suited for a job." Id. (quoting Sutton, 527 U.S. at 490-91 (emphasis in original)).
Kehr argues that "[t]o the extent there is any question regarding whether Principal regarded Kehr as disabled under the act, even Principal's HR Director, Kelly Roberts — not a lay person, but instead the person charged within Principal as evaluating ADA claims and making sure Principal was following the law, indicated that she had made a determination that Ms. Kehr was a qualified individual with a disability. (Roberts Depo [filing 41-2]: 34:13-35:1)" (Filing 48, [*48]  at 7.)6 "Principal Vice President Amy Mills confirmed this in the company's formal submission response to the NEOC, articulating its position when she stated that '[a]fter reviewing the medical information, Ms. Roberts determined that Ms. Kehr had a medical condition that substantially limited major life activities under the ADA.['] (Aff. Albers7 [filing 47-5], Att. A, p. 2)" (Id.) Included in Principal's exhibits is a copy of an email from Roberts to Kehr, dated October 29, 2007, in which Roberts expressly states, "I have determined that you are a qualified individual with a disability." [Filing 38-21, at 1.]8
Principal objects that Roberts' statement is inadmissible because it is a legal conclusion. This objection is without merit. The issue to be decided under the third prong of the ADA's definition of "disability" is whether Principal regarded Kehr as disabled. Roberts' statement that she, in fact, made a determination about Kehr's disability is sufficient evidence to require submission of the issue to a jury. See, e.g., Richardson v. Honda Mfg. of Alabama, LLC, 635 F.Supp.2d 1261, 1277 (N.D.Ala. 2009) ("The court rejects HMA's regarded-as argument on summary judgment, particularly in light of its express admission made during the course of the parties' paper discovery [*49]  conducted in this case that '[its authorized representative] considered plaintiff to be ADA-qualified for the purposes of conducting a restriction placement search.' . . . At a minimum, this admission creates a material factual dispute as to whether HMA regarded Richardson as disabled due to his neurofibromatosis and related doctor-ordered work restrictions.").

B. Kehr Is Not a "Qualified Individual"
To establish prima facie case of disability discrimination, Kehr must also show she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the account representative position, with or without a reasonable accommodation. See Didier v. Schwan Food Co., 465 F.3d 838, 841 (8th Cir. 2006). She must prove herself to be a "qualified individual" as defined in the ADA, that is, as "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8) 2008). "To be a qualified individual within the meaning of the ADA, [Kehr] must (1) possess the requisite skill, education, experience, and training for her position; and (2) be able to perform the essential job functions, with or without reasonable accommodation." Moritz v. Frontier Airlines, Inc., 147 F.3d 784, 786-87 (8th Cir.1998).
Although an ADA plaintiff retains the ultimate burden [*50]  of proving that she is a qualified individual, an employer who disputes the plaintiff's claim that she can perform the essential functions of a job must put forth evidence establishing those functions. Benson v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 62 F.3d 1108, 1113 (8th Cir.1995). An essential function may be established by evidence that includes:
(1) the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; (2) written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (3) the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (4) the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; and (5) the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.
Moritz, 147 F.3d at 787 (internal quotation marks omitted). A plaintiff need only make a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation that would enable her to perform her essential job functions is possible. Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 950 (8th Cir.1999). The burden then shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the plaintiff. Id.
Heaser v. Toro Co., 247 F.3d 826, 831 (8th Cir. 2001).
Importantly, however, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also held that "regarded as" disabled plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable accommodations. Weber v. Strippit, Inc., 186 F.3d 907, 917 (8th Cir. 1999) ("The ADA cannot reasonably have been intended to create a disparity in treatment among impaired but non-disabled [*51]  employees, denying most the right to reasonable accommodations but granting to others, because of their employers' misperceptions, a right to reasonable accommodations no more limited than those afforded actually disabled employees."). See also Finan v. Good Earth Tools, Inc., 565 F.3d 1076, 1080 (8th Cir.2009) ("Good Earth is correct that an employee who is 'regarded as disabled' is not entitled to a reasonable accommodation."). Because the evidence in this case will only support a finding that Principal regarded Kehr as disabled—rather than her suffering from an actual disability—under Eighth Circuit law, Kehr can only satisfy the ADA's "qualified individual" requirement by showing that she could perform the essential functions of the account representative job without an accommodation. See Duello v. Buchanan County Bd. of Sup'rs, 707 F.Supp.2d 828, 841 (N.D.Iowa 2010) (explaining import of Weber decision).
The undisputed evidence establishes that essential functions of the account representative position held by Kehr included meeting established measurements, completing necessary documentation, and multitasking (i.e., talking on the telephone and documenting the information from the caller at the same time). The undisputed evidence also establishes that Kehr had difficulty performing these essential functions because of her [*52]  memory and concentration problems, which she was experiencing as a result of her MS, and that because of these difficulties she was not meeting her production goals on a regular basis. She therefore was not qualified for the position as a matter of law. See Wisbey v. City of Lincoln, 612 F.3d 667, 673 (8th Cir. 2010) (affirming summary judgment to employer and holding the fact that plaintiff admitted she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job due to her depression provided support that her employer did not mistakenly regard her as having an impairment that substantially limited her ability to work, but that plaintiff was, in fact, unable to work due to her condition); Lloyd v. Hardin County, 207 F.3d 1080, 1083 (8th Cir. 2000) (affirming summary judgment in favor of employer where plaintiff could not perform the essential functions of the job because plaintiff was unable to perform several of the duties listed in the written job description).
Even if there were sufficient evidence to support a finding of actual disability in this case, Kehr has not made "a facial showing that reasonable accommodation is possible and that the accommodation will allow her to perform the essential functions of the job." Burchett v. Target Corp., 340 F.3d 510, 517 (8th Cir. 2003). Indeed, Kehr admits no reasonable accommodation existed that would allow her to [*53]  perform the essential functions of the account representative position. If a function is essential, the employer need not accommodate the employee's disability by eliminating that function for the employee. See Fjellestad, 188 F.3d at 950 ("While job restructuring is a possible accommodation . . . an employer need not reallocate or eliminate the essential functions of a job to accommodate a disabled employee."); Scheer v. City of Cedar Rapids, 956 F. Supp. 1496, 1502 (N.D. Iowa 1997) ("[T]he request to perform only some of the essential functions of a job is not a request for reasonable accommodation.").
The only accommodation Kehr requested was to transfer to another job within the company, specifically, the administrative specialist position. This was the only position available at the time for which Kehr met the minimum qualifications. Once again, however, the undisputed evidence establishes that Kehr was unable to perform the essential functions of the administrative specialist position, either with or without a reasonable accommodation. Her claim therefore fails as a matter of law. See Cravens, 214 F.3d at 1019 ("Importantly, the employee must be otherwise 'qualified' for the reassignment position. . . . [T]he individual must 'satisfy the legitimate prerequisites for that alternative position, and . [*54]  . . be able to perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodations[.]") (quoting Dalton v. Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc., 141 F.3d 667, 678 (7th Cir.1998)).

III. CONCLUSION
Even though Principal might have regarded Kehr as disabled because of her MS-related symptoms, Kehr cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination because there is insufficient evidence that she could perform the essential functions of the account representative position for which she was hired. Because there is no admissible evidence of an actual disability (or a record of disability), Kehr cannot claim that Principal was required to continue her employment by transferring her to the administrative specialist position. In any event, such an accommodation is not reasonable because the undisputed evidence shows that Kehr also was unable to perform the essential functions of the administrative specialist position, with or without accommodation.
