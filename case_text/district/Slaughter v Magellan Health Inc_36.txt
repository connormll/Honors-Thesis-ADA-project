Opinion


Report and Recommendation
Leslie Slaughter filed this employment dispute against Magellan Health, Inc., (Magellan) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA). ECF No. 1. In his complaint, Slaughter alleged several disability discrimination claims under both the ADA and the TCHRA: (1) wrongful termination; (2) failure to accommodate; (3) retaliation; and (4) harassment. Id.
Magellan filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims for wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation but not on the disability-based harassment claim. ECF No. 24. Although Magellan did not label its motion as one for partial summary judgment, the motion does not seek to dispose of all of Slaughter's claims. The court recommends that the motion be granted and that Slaughter's claims for wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation [*2]  be dismissed. The disability-based harassment claim is the only remaining claim in this case.

1. Background
"Magellan is a specialty health care management company that provides," among other managed care services, "clinical and financial management of pharmaceuticals under various health care plans." Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 24-1. Slaughter worked as a clinical pharmacist for Magellan from about 2010 when Magellan acquired Slaughter's former employer until May 2019 when Magellan terminated his employment. Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 25-1; Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 13. Slaughter "suffer[ed] from restless leg syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder [(PTSD)], attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [(ADHD)], schizoid personality disorder, major depression disorder, and severe anxiety." Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 5. Slaughter was in treatment for these conditions in 2017 and 2018. Id.
In July 2016, Julie Bueno became the manager of the clinical prior authorization pharmacists, which included Slaughter and twenty-two others. Bueno's Dep. at 13:9-19, ECF No. 25-2. Slaughter worked from home, as did many other clinical pharmacists on Bueno's team. Id. at 14:12-24.
On January 12, 2017, Bueno emailed [*3]  Slaughter his 2016 productivity scorecard. Slaughter's 2016 Scorecard, ECF No. 25-7 at 5. For the year 2016, Slaughter averaged 4.5 reviews per hour while the team averaged 8.0 reviews per hour. Id. Bueno wrote, "Staying focused to work faxes in between calls will help with your productivity. If you would like to schedule some[ ]time next week to talk about some strategies to increase your numbers[,] let me know. I am here to help you improve." Id.
Four days later, on January 16, 2017, Slaughter sent an email to Magellan's human resources department.1 ECF No. 25-8 at 3. The email asked, "Could you and I have a discussion about some difficulties I am encountering?" Id. On January 27, 2017, Slaughter sent another email to the same individual that stated, "I would like to discuss accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act with you." Id. at 2. He did not receive a response. Slaughter's Decl. at ¶ 8. According to Slaughter, he also told Bueno in January 2017, prior to sending these emails, that his health conditions and medications were affecting his productivity. Id.
Two months later, on March 27, 2017, Bueno instituted an individual goal for every clinical pharmacist on her team to complete a minimum of [*4]  six prior authorization reviews per hour (Productivity Goal). ECF No. 24-14 at 2. In that email, which she sent her team to inform them of the Productivity Goal, Bueno explained that she set the goal in response to growth in Magellan's business and the increase in the number of prior authorizations submitted. Id.; see also Bueno's Decl. ¶ 5, ECF No. 24-12. In the email, Bueno stated that she expected everyone on her team to meet the Productivity Goal by the end of May. ECF No. 24-14 at 2.
Bueno also stated in the March 27, 2017 email that she would "constantly be monitoring queues and reports for both faxes and calls in order to provide . . . the feedback and attention that [her team] deserve[d]." ECF No. 24-14 at 2. Bueno reminded her team that the goal was based on an hourly average over a month's time and took into account the hours worked and the auxiliary time not spent reviewing prior authorizations. Id.; see also Bueno's Decl. ¶ 8; AUX Code Definitions, ECF No. 24-16. Bueno explained the importance of using the correct auxiliary code (AUX code) as it affected production averages and was important to determine if additional staff was needed. ECF No. 24-14 at 2. Bueno warned that [*5]  she would be closely watching nonproduction AUX code usage and would note excessive use on each team member's scorecard. Id.
On August 21, 2017, five months after Bueno instituted the Productivity Goal, Bueno sent her team another email about productivity, stating that, due to a drop in volume over the summer, she had set aside the Productivity Goal but was reinstating it. ECF No. 24-15 at 2. Bueno set October 31, 2017, as the new deadline to meet the Productivity Goal. Id. Bueno explained that anyone who did not meet the Productivity Goal by the end of October 2017 would be placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP) and that, in the meantime, she would meet "with those . . . at the low end of productivity to discuss how [to] meet this goal[.]" Id.
On September 8, 2017, Bueno counseled Slaughter about his failure to meet the Productivity Goal, and she allowed him to shadow a senior clinical pharmacist, John Dameron, in early October 2017. Bueno's Decl. ¶ 11. Slaughter averred that, at the October 2017 shadow session, "Dameron emphasized that [Slaughter] should use the nonproduction codes, especially [AUX code] 5" that accounted for scheduled time on special projects. Slaughter's [*6]  Decl. ¶ 11; see also AUX Code Definitions, ECF No. 24-16. Thereafter, Slaughter followed Dameron's advice, but, in early 2018, Bueno instructed Slaughter not to use AUX code 5. Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 12. Slaughter testified that, beginning in December 2017, Bueno "harassed and bullied" him into not using AUX code 5 for an extended period. Slaughter's Dep. at 63:5-7, ECF No. 24-23.
By the October 31, 2017 deadline, every clinical pharmacist except Slaughter "routinely met" the Productivity Goal. Bueno's Decl. ¶ 6. On January 8, 2018, Bueno placed Slaughter on a PIP. Bueno's Decl. ¶ 12; ECF No. 24-17. The PIP stated, "A productivity rating of 6 per hour is required and has not been met." ECF No. 24-17 at 3. Bueno set a new deadline at the end of February 2018 for Slaughter to comply. Id. The PIP stated that failure to improve would result in "further disciplinary action, up to and including termination[.]" Id. Slaughter did not meet the February 2018 deadline. Bueno's Decl. ¶ 12.
On April 5, 2018, Bueno issued a final written warning to Slaughter for failure to meet the Productivity Goal and gave him until the end of April to comply or face "further corrective action up to and including termination[.]" [*7]  ECF 24-18 at 2-3; see also Bueno's Decl. ¶ 13.
Less than two weeks after the date of the final written warning, on April 16, 2018, Slaughter initiated an "EAP & Work/Life Benefits" inquiry with human resources. ECF No. 25-9 at 4. Human resources responded, asking what his questions were. Id. at 3. Slaughter said he had "questions regarding disability[] and health issues." Id. In an electronic communication dated April 23, 2018, he said that he wanted to discuss "Special Accom[m]odation under the Americans with Disabilities Act." Id. According to Philip Zampogna, senior director of employee engagement, Slaughter made no request for accommodation at that time and instead requested "short-term disability leave under the Family Medical Leave Act." Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 5.
On May 21, 2018, Slaughter messaged Bueno during work hours to say that he was "in a very difficult place" and that he was trying to schedule an appointment with a counselor. ECF No. 25-11 at 2. Slaughter's sixty-day disability leave began within a matter of days after that conversation. Slaughter's Dep. at 93:17-94:12 (agreeing that his short-term disability leave ran for the sixty days prior to July 31, 2018). While Slaughter was on leave in May and June 2018, Bueno did not [*8]  pursue terminating Slaughter under the April 2018 final written warning. See Bueno's Dep. at 72:1-10; ECF No. 25-10 at 2.
When Slaughter returned to work at the end of July 2018, Bueno notified him that he was still subject to the April 2018 PIP and gave him the months of August and September to meet the Productivity Goal. ECF No. 24-19. Slaughter averaged 3.6 reviews per hour in August 2018 and 3.1 reviews per hour in September 2018. ECF No. 24-20 at 3. Because Slaughter had not met the Productivity Goal by the end of September 2018 and "ha[d] demonstrated an inability to meet outlined expectations[,]" Bueno recommended on October 4, 2018, that Slaughter's employment "be terminated immediately." Id. at 3; see also Bueno's Decl. ¶ 14.
Just prior to Bueno's making her recommendation to terminate Slaughter, Slaughter's psychologist, Glenn Bricken, Psy.D, completed a workplace accommodation evaluation form on September 27, 2018. ECF No. 24-5. Dr. Bricken diagnosed Slaughter with persistent depression disorder with psychotic features and anxious distress, PTSD, and ADHD. Id. at 2. As accommodations for Slaughter's mental conditions, Dr. Bricken recommended that Magellan reduce Slaughter's [*9]  goal to four reviews per hour and allow him additional time to complete prior authorization reviews. Id. at 3. Slaughter submitted the form to Magellan on or about September 28, 2018. See Zampogna's Decl. at ¶ 6.
At that time, in late September 2018, "Magellan suspended Slaughter's pending termination while the parties engaged in the interactive process." Zampogna's Decl. at ¶ 6. In October 2018, Slaughter engaged the assistance of the Texas Workforce Commission to identify a reasonable accommodation. On October 18, 2018, Dr. Bricken amended the workplace accommodation evaluation form, recommending that Slaughter be allowed a third-party representative in the interactive process and a job coach. See Slaughter's Decl. ¶¶ 22-23; ECF No. 24-8 at 3.
On October 30, 2018, Magellan sent Slaughter a letter confirming that Slaughter had rejected Magellan's offered accommodations of "ramp up time" to meet the Productivity Goal and longer work hours with a daily, in place of an hourly, quota. ECF No. 24-6. The letter informed Slaughter that Magellan did not allow permanent caseload reductions as an accommodation "because doing so would cause an undue burden on the business." Id.
On November 6, 2018, [*10]  Slaughter emailed Zampogna, complaining that starting the accommodation process "was extremely difficult" and, among other complaints, that he felt he had "been ignored, embarrassed, and retaliated against for attempting to help [himself] as a disabled individual." ECF No. 24-7 at 3. Slaughter suggested guidelines for the continuing interactive process and reasserted requests for accommodation previously rejected. Id. at 4. Slaughter did not propose any new accommodation. See id. at 3-4.
On November 19, 2018, Slaughter filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). ECF No. 25-19. Slaughter claimed continuing discrimination based on disability and retaliation since January 1, 2017. Id. at 2. The EEOC charge stated:
I believe I was retaliated and discriminated against when [Magellan] denied my request for a reasonable accommodation for my disability. . . . I have made numerous requests for reasonable accommodations and have been ignored and my requests were denied. I believe since my requests for an accommodation my work performance has been sabotaged and setup for performance failure based on performance numbers required.
Id. Slaughter attached [*11]  the letter he had sent Zampogna by email on November 6, 2018. See id.
Zampogna responded to Slaughter's November 6, 2018 email on December 20, 2018. ECF No. 24-7 at 2. Zampogna addressed Slaughter's complaints, disagreeing in part with Slaughter's characterization of the interactive process. Id. Zampogna stated that Magellan would "continue to move through the interactive process and respond to [Slaughter's] request for an accommodation per [Magellan's] process." Id.
On January 11, 2019, Slaughter sent another email to Zampogna expressing concerns about the process but stating that he "would like to proceed in negotiations with Magellan with the aid of a mediator" from the EEOC and his disability representative. ECF No. 24-9 at 3. Slaughter did not request additional accommodations. See id. Zampogna responded on January 25, 2019, stating that the Magellan's internal process for addressing Slaughter's request for accommodation was separate from the EEOC proceeding. Id. at 2. Zampogna promised a response to Slaughter's requests within twenty-four hours and allowed that Slaughter could have any external source review the response. Id.
On January 25, 2019, the same day that Zampogna responded [*12]  to Slaughter's email, Meribeth Ehlers, Magellan's senior employee engagement consultant, sent Slaughter a letter response about his accommodation requests. Magellan's Resp. to Accomm. Reqs., ECF No. 24-10 at 2. Ehlers noted that Slaughter had declined to speak with her when she had recently attempted to meet with him. Id. Ehlers listed Slaughter's requested accommodations: "1) a permanent or indefinite reduction in [his] workload from the standard of six (6) preauthorization[s] per hour to four (4) per hour; 2) extended time to complete preauthorizations; 3) the ability to use a job coach provided by the Texas Workforce Commission; and 4) a representative/interpreter to assist in the development of workplace accommodations." Id. Ehlers explained that, due to the highly sensitive and confidential nature of the information" he accessed in his job, Magellan could not allow a third-party job coach to observe or assist him while working but could allow Slaughter to consult one on his own time. Id.
The January 25, 2019 letter discussed prior negotiations between Magellan and Slaughter about Magellan's offer of "ramp up" time to meet the Productivity Goal. ECF No. 24-10 at 3. Also, in response [*13]  to Slaughter's request for refresher training on his accounts, Ehlers offered to provide any account training he thought necessary. Id. Ehlers instructed Slaughter to let her know if he would accept either or both offers. Id. She informed him that, if neither was acceptable, Magellan would offer him additional time to complete authorizations through February, after which he would "be expected to perform the essential functions of [his] job and perform to the required standards, including meeting the minimum standard of six (6) preauthorizations per hour[.]" Id. Slaughter did not respond to this letter. Zampogna's Decl. ¶10.
In March 2019, Zampogna spoke with Elaine Akin, a TWC representative, who informed him that "Slaughter intended to submit additional requests for accommodation based upon a workspace review that [TWC] was going to conduct." Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 11. Magellan did not receive additional requests for accommodation or a copy of the workspace review. Id. On April 9, 2019, after the TWC review was complete, Zampogna sent Slaughter an email requesting that he notify Zampogna of TWC's additional recommendations. Id. at ¶ 12.; ECF No. 24-11. Zampogna stated that, if he received [*14]  no additional requests by April 19, 2019, he would assume Slaughter was not seeking any additional accommodations. ECF No. 24-11 at 2. Slaughter did not respond to this email. Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 12.
On April 30, 2019, Bueno sought approval to terminate Slaughter's employment, which Zampogna granted. Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 13. Magellan notified Slaughter on May 2, 2019, that he was being terminated. Id. Zampogna closed the interactive process on May 3, 2019. Id. ¶ 12.

2. Summary Judgment Standard of Review
"Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, 'the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'" Davenport v. Edward D. Jones & Co., 891 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). No genuine issue of material fact exists if a rational jury could not find for the nonmoving party based on the complete record. McMichael v. Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc., 934 F.3d 447, 455 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)).
"The movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, 401 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-25, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). If this burden is met, the nonmovant must then "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The nonmovant [*15]  must "go beyond the pleadings," using competent summary judgment evidence to cite to "specific facts" showing a genuine issue for trial. Bustos v. Martini Club, Inc., 599 F.3d 458, 468 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324).
The court reviews all evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co., 401 F.3d at 350. "[C]onclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or 'only a scintilla of evidence[]'" are not enough to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994)). The nonmovant must "articulate the precise manner in which the submitted or identified evidence supports his or her claim." CQ, Inc. v. TXU Mining Co., 565 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Smith ex rel. Estate of Smith v. United States, 391 F.3d 621, 625 (5th Cir. 2004)). The court is not required to search the entire record to ensure that the record is "bereft of genuine issue of material fact." Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125,1137 n.30 (5th Cir. 1992).

3. Disability Discrimination under the ADA and the TCHRA
The ADA and the TCHRA make it illegal to discriminate against an individual because of his disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Tex. Labor Code § 21.051. The ADA's prohibition covers, among other acts, treating an employee in a way that adversely affects his opportunities or status, discharging an employee, and failing to make "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified [employee] with a disability." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The TCHRA makes [*16]  it unlawful for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate "against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Tex. Labor Code § 21.051(1). Both statutes prohibit retaliating against employees who exercise their statutory rights. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a); Tex. Labor Code § 21.055.
Claims under the TCHRA are analyzed under the analogous federal precedents interpreting the ADA. Rodriguez v. ConAgra Grocery Prods. Co., 436 F.3d 468, 473-74 (5th 2006). Under federal precedents, ADA claims based on circumstantial evidence are analyzed under the burden-shifting approach outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) (McDonnell Douglas approach). Delaval v. PTech Drilling Tubulars, L.L.C., 824 F.3d 476, 479 (5th Cir. 2016). The burden-shifting approach requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case. Id. The defendant must respond by "'articulat[ing] a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for' the adverse employment action," and, if the defendant does so, the plaintiff bears the final burden of "present[ing] evidence that the articulated reason is pretextual." Id. (quoting EEOC v. LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d 688, 694 (5th Cir. 2014)).

4. Analysis
Magellan moves for summary judgment on wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation.
A. Wrongful Termination
To state a prima facie case for wrongful termination, the plaintiff must show that he (1) has a disability; (2) was qualified for the job; and (3) was subject to an adverse employment [*17]  action based on his disability. Delaval, 824 F.3d at 479. Because Slaughter's claim is based on indirect evidence, the McDonnell Douglas approach applies.
If Magellan carries its summary judgment burden of pointing to record evidence that demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on one or more elements of the prima facie case, Slaughter must point to competent summary judgment evidence of specific facts that raise a genuine issue for trial. The burden then shifts to Magellan to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Slaughter's employment and Slaughter must respond with evidence of pretext.
1. Prima Facie Case
The first and third elements of the prima facie case for wrongful termination are not in dispute. Magellan assumes, for purposes of the motion for summary judgment, that Slaughter has a disability. ECF No. 24 at 12. Magellan also does not dispute that Slaughter was terminated. ECF No. 24 at 13. The dispute on the prima facie case centers on the second element—whether Slaughter was qualified.
Magellan argues that Slaughter has not presented any evidence showing that he was qualified for the position of clinical pharmacist. Id. at 12-13.
"A qualified individual is one[] 'who[,] [*18]  with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.'" Weber v. BNSF Railway Co., 989 F.3d 320, 323 (5th Cir. 2021). (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8)). "[T]he question is whether he was qualified at the time of his termination." Clark v. Champion Nat'l Sec, Inc., 952 F.3d 570, 582 (5th Cir. 2020) (alteration in the original) (quoting Moss v. Harris Cnty. Constable Precinct One, 851 F.3d 413, 418 (5th Cir. 2017)).
The definition of "essential functions" is "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Weber, 989 F.3d at 323 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). "A function is 'essential' if it bears 'more than a marginal relationship' to the employee's job." LHC Grp., Inc., 773 F.3d at 697 (quoting Chandler v. City of Dall, 2 F.3d 1385, 1393 (5th Cir. 1993)). Several factors inform the court's determination whether a function is essential, including the "employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;" the employer's written job description; "the amount of time spent on the job performing the function;" and "the consequences of not requiring the [individual] to perform the function." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3); see also Weber, 989 F.3d at 325 (quoting 29 C.F.R. §1630.2(n)(3)). The court "must give greatest weight to the 'employer's judgment.'" Credeur v. Louisiana, 860 F.3d 785, 792 (5th Cir. 2017).
The evidence shows that all these factors favor finding that meeting productivity goals for reviewing prior authorizations was an essential function of Magellan's clinical pharmacist position. Bueno affirmed that compliance [*19]  with the Productivity Goal was an essential job function, explaining that the clinical pharmacists' reviewing and completing prior authorizations "generate[d] value for the company." Bueno's Decl. ¶¶ 5, 15.
The written job description lists first among the clinical pharmacist's duties to "[p]rovide prior-authorization services for formulary drugs." See 24-13 at 2. The evidence shows that reviewing prior authorizations was a primary job function that Magellan closely tracked to the point of requiring the clinical pharmacists to "log out from 'production' hours" under an applicable AUX code when they were performing other tasks or taking breaks. Bueno's Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 7; see also AUX Code Definitions, ECF No. 24-16. Finally, Magellan explained that it could not reduce Slaughter's productivity requirement because that "would cause an undue burden on the business." See ECF No. 24-6.
The evidence thus demonstrates that Magellan viewed meeting productivity goals to be an essential function of the clinical pharmacist position. Slaughter presents no contradictory evidence.
Slaughter admitted at his deposition that he knew the clinical pharmacists' productivity was measured by the number of prior [*20]  authorization reviews completed per hour. Slaughter's Dep. at 40:18-22. He argues, though, that the "job description did not require pharmacists to achieve any particular metric or productivity level" and that the Productivity Goal "was not a Magellan standard, it was a goal for Bueno's team." ECF No. 25 at 23. Those observations are not material to whether meeting Magellan's expected level of productivity was an essential function of the job. See Credeur, 860 F.3d at 792 ("[T]he inquiry into essential functions is not intended to second guess an employer's business judgment with regard to production standards[, whether qualitative or quantitative,] []or to require employers to lower such standards.") (quoting 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App.)). Meeting the Productivity Goal is an essential function of Magellan's clinical pharmacist position.
The question whether Slaughter was qualified then depends on whether Slaughter was able to meet the Productivity Goal. The evidence shows that, not only was Slaughter unable to meet the Productivity Goal, but he also rarely came close. See Bueno's Decl. ¶10; ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28. More importantly, the evidence shows that Slaughter consistently was one of the least productive members of [*21]  Bueno's team during the period from January 2016 through his last day of employment. See Slaughter's 2016 Scorecard, ECF No. 25-7 at 5; ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28. In 2016, before Bueno instituted the Productivity Goal and before Slaughter informed Magellan that he was disabled and needed accommodations, Slaughter averaged fewer than five reviews per hour every month. Slaughter's 2016 Scorecard, ECF No. 25-7 at 5. The team average per month in 2016 ranged from 7.5 to 8.6 reviews per hour. Id. After 2016, Slaughter's average number of prior authorization reviews per hour "actually decreased over time, averaging between 4 and 5 per hour in 2017, between 3 and 4 per hour in 2018, and less than 3 per hour in 2019." Bueno's Dec. 110; see also ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28. There is no evidence that Slaughter could meet the Productivity Goal.
Focusing on the "with or without reasonable accommodation" portion of the statutory definition of "qualified individual," Slaughter argues that he could have performed the essential functions of the clinical pharmacist position with reasonable accommodations. ECF No. 25 at 23-24. The evidence contradicts that assertion. Dr. Bricken's opinion was that [*22]  Slaughter could review no more than four prior authorization reviews per hour and recommended that Magellan reduce the required number of reviews per hour as an accommodation. ECF No. 24-5 at 3. In other words, Dr. Bricken did not assert that Slaughter could perform to Magellan's expectations with accommodations. He proposed that Magellan change its productivity expectations. That is not a reasonable accommodation. See Toronka v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 411 F. App'x 719, 724 (5th Cir. 2011) (stating that "[i]t would not be a reasonable accommodation to require the employer to eliminate essential job functions, modify job duties, reassign existing employees, or hire new employees").
Moreover, Slaughter averaged below his own proposed goal of four reviews per hour during the years 2017 and 2018. See ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28. Slaughter points to no evidence to support his assertion that he could have performed the essential functions of the clinical pharmacist position with any reasonable accommodation. Based on the evidence before the court, no reasonable jury could find that Slaughter, with or without reasonable accommodation, could perform the essential production function of the clinical pharmacist position.
Because Slaughter has not raised a genuine [*23]  issue of material fact on the second element of a wrongful termination claim, he cannot meet his prima facie burden.

ii. Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason
Even if Slaughter had presented evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements of the prima facie case, Magellan has carried its responsive burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Slaughter's employment—failure to comply with the Productivity Goal. See Moore v. Centralized Mgmt. Servs., L.L.C., 843 F. App'x 575, 578 (5th Cir. 2021) (stating that terminating the employment of an individual "whose performance is unsatisfactory according to management's business judgment is legitimate and nondiscriminatory as a matter of law"). In response, Slaughter must present evidence showing that Magellan's articulated reason was pretextual.

iii. Pretext
Magellan argues that Slaughter has produced no evidence that its articulated reason was pretextual. See ECF No. 24 at 17-20. "A plaintiff may show pretext either through evidence of disparate treatment or by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is false or unworthy of credence." Caldwell v. KHOU-TV, 850 F.3d 237, 242 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Jackson v. Cal-W. Packaging Corp, 602 F.3d 374, 378-79 (5th Cir. 2010)). The plaintiff must present "substantial evidence" of pretext. Delaval, 824 F.3d at 480.
Addressing falsity first, Slaughter points to no evidence that Magellan's [*24]  reason for terminating his employment was false. As discussed above, the evidence shows Slaughter consistently did not meet Magellan's productivity expectations. On January 8, 2018, Bueno initiated disciplinary proceedings against Slaughter prior to any inquiry on his part into disability benefits. Bueno's Decl. 1 12; ECF No. 24-17. At every step of the disciplinary process, Magellan steadfastly cited that same reason—failure to meet the Productivity Goal—for disciplining Slaughter. Nothing in the evidence suggests that Magellan's disciplinary actions were merely part of a scheme to establish a false, pretextual reason for the actions it took against Slaughter. Slaughter cites no evidence that Magellan gave inconsistent explanations for the disciplinary process or that any decisionmaker made discriminatory remarks about Slaughter that would suggest the real reason for Slaughter's termination was anything other than Slaughter's failure to meet Magellan's productivity standards. See Slaughter's Dep. at 190:23-191:5 (admitting that Bueno never made a negative remark about his disability or requests for accommodations and that he did not recall anyone else doing so). Slaughter admitted [*25]  at his deposition that he understood that Magellan terminated his employment due to his lack of productivity. Slaughter's Dep. at 169:15-24.
Slaughter argues instead that Magellan's reasons are unworthy of credence because the evidence shows he was treated less favorably than other, nondisabled clinical pharmacists on Bueno's team. ECF No. 25 at 24-28. To establish disparate treatment, Slaughter must produce evidence showing that Magellan treated him "more harshly than 'similarly situated' employees for 'nearly identical' actions." Vincent v. Coll. of the Mainland, 703 F. App'x 233, 238 (5th Cir. 2017). Slaughter argues that Bueno treated him less favorably than other team members because she allowed the others to use nonproduction AUX codes frequently while not allowing Slaughter to do so. ECF No. 25 at 25. Slaughter argues that, if he had been allowed to use nonproduction AUX codes as much as the other team members, he would have been able to meet the Productivity Goal. The record lacks evidence to support this claim.
The evidence shows that Bueno's Productivity Goal applied to all team members. See ECF No. 24-14 at 2. At the time she instituted the Productivity Goal, Bueno set the same compliance deadline for all team members, explained the importance [*26]  of correctly using AUX codes, warned all team members that she would be closely monitoring usage of nonproduction AUX codes, and said that she would document excessive usage on the individual team member's monthly scorecard. Id.
Slaughter next argues that he was treated differently than others on his team with respect to the use of AUX codes. Slaughter testified that, while he was logged into the prior authorization review system, he could see what the other team members were working on and what AUX codes they were using. Slaughter's Dep. at 74:1-15; 124:11-15. Slaughter testified that he was thus contemporaneously aware that other team members were using nonproduction AUX codes in situations Bueno had instructed him not to use them. Id. at 124:16-125:3; Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 13. Slaughter testified that "everyone" else on the team was allowed more nonproduction AUX code usage but could recall only one instance that he had noticed another clinical pharmacist using a nonproduction AUX code inappropriately. Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 13; Slaughter's Dep. at 123:3-13, 124:11-125:7. Even for that example, though, Slaughter could not recall any details and admitted he did not have knowledge of the [*27]  circumstances surrounding the choice to use the nonproduction AUX code in that situation. Slaughter's Dep. at 125:4-126:6. Slaughter also was unable to identify any situation in which any of his team members was misusing AUX codes. Id. at 74:18-23.
Slaughter also testified that "the way the clock was set up" was unfair because he could not switch to a nonproduction AUX code in the middle of a call, even if the nature of the call warranted the change in AUX codes. Slaughter's Dep. at 83:13-21. Slaughter admitted, however, that all clinical pharmacists faced the same issue. Id. at 83:22-84:1. Even so, Slaughter testified that he found it unfair because his assignment involved more phone time than other team members who were assigned to a mix of calls and faxes or entirely to faxes, which allowed them to work the faxes in between calls. Id. at 84:9-14. Slaughter points to no evidence showing that Bueno gave Slaughter his work assignments after knowing of his disability or for any reason related to his disability. Slaughter points to no evidence to show how work was assigned to other team members. Slaughter also presents no evidence to show that others with assignments similar to his had [*28]  similar production numbers.
Slaughter thus fails to present evidence that his conduct was nearly identical to that of any other clinical pharmacist's conduct on the use of nonproduction AUX codes. Absent evidence of identity between Slaughter's actions and those of the other clinical pharmacists, he cannot show pretext. See Vincent, 703 F. App'x at 239 (quoting Wallace v. Methodist Hosp. Sys., 271 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. 2001)) ("[T]he conduct at issue is not nearly identical when the difference between the plaintiffs conduct and that of those alleged to be similarly situated account[s] for the difference in treatment received from the employer.")
Slaughter also argues that the monthly production reports show that other team members did not meet the Productivity Goal every month, but that he was the only one Bueno disciplined for it and the only one with a disability. ECF No. 25 at 19-20, 25-26. Although Slaughter may not have been the only one not to meet the Productivity Goal in every single month in 2017 and 2018, he was the only one to have not met it during any month since Bueno instituted the Productivity Goal. See Bueno's Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10; ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28.
Slaughter argues that the reports show that he consistently logged less time in nonproduction AUX codes [*29]  than most of the other clinical pharmacists and that his productivity numbers suffered as a result. Id. at 19-20. Slaughter argues that the higher the AUX code usage, the higher the productivity average. Id. at 20. Slaughter's argument assumes that the clinical pharmacists to which he is comparing himself were performing production work while in the AUX code instead of otherwise authorized nonproduction work permitted by that AUX code. Slaughter has presented no evidence that others were permitted to use AUX codes in ways he was not.
Moreover, when examined closely, the reports show that Slaughter did not compare favorably to other clinical pharmacists with similar staffed hours and AUX code usage. See ECF No. 24-22; ECF No. 25-28. For example, in March 2017, Slaughter logged 190 staffed hours and 33.5 hours of AUX usage, and another clinical pharmacist similarly logged 192 staffed hours and 40 hours of AUX time. Id. at 4. Slaughter had 145.5 net production hours, and the other clinical pharmacist similarly had 141.4. Id. Despite similar numbers in those categories, Slaughter completed only 633 prior authorizations compared to 1201 prior authorizations completed by the other clinical [*30]  pharmacist. Id. That is not the only such example in evidence. See, e.g., id. at 20-22. The raw numbers do not support Slaughter's arguments.
Moreover, as discussed above, Slaughter has pointed to no evidence that other team members were using AUX codes improperly or were using AUX codes for purposes that Slaughter had been disallowed. His speculation aside, Slaughter presents no evidence that his actions and those of his more productive team members were identical. See Vincent, 703 F. App'x at 238 (stating that evidence of nearly identical actions is required to show disparate treatment between similarly situated employees).
Because Slaughter fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact on at least one element of the prima facie case and on pretext, his discrimination claims cannot survive summary judgment.

B. Reasonable Accommodation
To state a claim for failure to accommodate, "the plaintiff must show (1) [he] is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) the disability and its consequential limitations were known by the covered employer; and (3) the employer failed to make reasonable accommodations for such known limitations." Drake v. Spring Indep. Sch. Dist, No. 20-20376, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 22187, 2021 WL 3176081, at *5 (5th Cir. July 27, 2021) (quoting Moss, 851 F.301 at 417).
Magellan argues that Slaughter's failure to present evidence showing [*31]  that he was qualified for his position is fatal to his failure to accommodate claim. As discussed above, Slaughter presents no evidence showing that he was qualified for his position, and thus he cannot satisfy the first element of the failure to accommodate claim. Although Magellan does not contest that it knew of Slaughter's disability and request of accommodation while Slaughter was employed, the parties disagree when Magellan first became aware of Slaughter's need for accommodations.

i. Magellan's Knowledge of Slaughter's Need for Accommodation
The knowledge element of a failure to accommodate claim must be met to trigger the employer's duty to provide reasonable accommodation. Drake, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 22187, 2021 WL 3176081, at *5 (quoting Delaval, 824 F.3d at 481) ("[T]he employee must alert the employer to the need for accommodation, not by using special words, but by explaining "that the proposed adjustment in working conditions is for a medical condition-related reason."); see also Patton v. Jacobs Eng'g Grp. Inc., 874 F.3d 437, 444 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (1996) (stating that it is the employee's responsibility to inform his employer that he needs an accommodation).
Magellan argues that Slaughter first alerted Magellan of his need for accommodation due to his medical condition in late September 2018, when Slaughter submitted [*32]  Dr. Bricken's workplace accommodation evaluation form. Slaughter argues that he initially requested accommodation in January 2017.
Slaughter testified that, in January 2017, he told Bueno that his health conditions and medications affected his productivity and that he separately asked human resources about ADA accommodations. Slaughter's Decl. ¶ 8. Taken together in a light most favorable to Slaughter, notifying Bueno of health conditions and separately asking human resources about accommodations did not alert Magellan to Slaughter's need for accommodation because he neither proposed an accommodation nor explained the medical reason for its need.
Slaughter's statements are too vague to notify Magellan that he had a work limitation due to a medical condition. Cf. Patton, 874 F.3d at 444 (finding an employee's statements that his stuttering and anxiety problems "go together" and that he was sensitive to noise at a prior job to be too vague to alert his employer that sensitivity to noise was a limitation resulting from a disability). Without knowing the nature of the disability and the reason for a need for accommodation, Magellan could not provide a reasonable accommodation. See id.; see also Taylor, 93 F.3d at 165 (stating that, [*33]  when the person suffers a disability that is "not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer, as is often the case when mental disabilities are involved," the employee bears the burden to "specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations and suggest the reasonable accommodations").
The same is true of Slaughter's April 2018 inquiry to human resources about "disability[] and health issues" and his May 2018 conversation with Bueno about his efforts to schedule an appointment with a "counselor." ECF 25-9 at 3; ECF 25-11 at 2. Again, the evidence shows that Slaughter provided no information about the nature of his disability or the reason he needed accommodation. See Patton, 874 F.3d at 444.
Based on the summary judgment evidence, the first time that Slaughter explained to Magellan that he needed accommodation due to a medical condition and proposed accommodations was in late September 2018, when he submitted Dr. Bricken's workplace accommodation evaluation form. See ECF No. 24-5. Dr. Bricken identified Slaughter's diagnoses and proposed as accommodations additional time to complete reviews and a reduction in the Productivity Goal to four reviews per hour. Id.
Slaughter's later communications with [*34]  Zampogna bolster the court's determination. In an email to Zampogna dated November 6, 2018, Slaughter stated, "This letter is regarding my current ADA formal request for reasonable accommodations. As the Human Services Division is aware, I submitted an initial request on September 28, 2018." ECF No. 25-18 at 4. (emphasis added). The email characterizes Dr. Bricken's amended work accommodation evaluation form as a "secondary request." Id.
Slaughter's deposition testimony also supports the conclusion that he had not made a request for accommodation as early as January 2017, as he argues on summary judgment. Slaughter testified that he thought the topic of accommodation had been brought up with human resources but that he had not made "a specific request" by July 31, 2018. Slaughter's Dep. at 105:13-21. Slaughter testified:
The person that I went to get evaluated with, he was working on those at this time [July 31, 2018]. By this time, he had done the evaluation; and he was working on getting people who worked for Magellan and compiling what I needed. . . . [W]e were in the process of getting to the specific accommodations that were going to be requested. As of 07-31, I don't think that [*35]  had been done at this time."
Slaughter's Dep. at 105:22-106:4.
Slaughter's submission of Dr. Bricken's workplace accommodation evaluation form at the end of September 2018 was the first time Slaughter alerted Magellan to his need for a work accommodation for a medical condition.

ii. Reasonable Accommodations
Magellan also argues that Slaughter has not shown that Magellan failed to make reasonable accommodations. ECF No. 24 at 21-22. The definition of "reasonable accommodations" includes "[j]ob restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; . . . acquisition or modifications of equipment or devices; appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies; . . . and other similar accommodations[.]" 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(2)(ii); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B); Weber, 989 F.3d at 323-24. An employee is not entitled to his "preferred accommodation but only to a reasonable accommodation." Kitchen v. BASF, 952 F.3d 247, 254 (5th Cir. 2020) When an employee "presents a request for an accommodation, the employer is required to engage in [an] interactive process so that together they can determine what reasonable accommodations might be available." Gonzalez v. United Parcel Serv., 777 F. App'x 735, 739 (5th Cir. 2019) (emphasis in original) (quoting EEOC v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 622 (5th Cir. 2009), abrogated in part on other grounds by LHC Grp., 773 F.3d 688).
Magellan engaged Slaughter in the interactive process soon [*36]  after receiving Dr. Bricken's first workplace accommodation evaluation form in late September 2018. Cf. ECF No. 24-6 (stating in late October 2018 that Magellan had previously proposed accommodations that Slaughter had rejected). Slaughter has pointed to no evidence that Magellan did not act in good faith during the interactive process. Magellan, among other things, suspended Slaughter's termination, explained the interactive process, reviewed Dr. Bricken's workplace accommodation evaluation forms, considered the accommodations he recommended, responded to Slaughter's correspondence, offered to meet with Slaughter, spoke with Slaughter's TWC representative, and solicited additional accommodation requests from Slaughter. Cf. Gonzalez, 777 F. App'x at 739 (finding that informing the employee of his rights, soliciting input from the employee and his doctor, gathering information about the employee's limitations and proposed accommodations, holding a meeting with the employee, and looking for other positions demonstrated good faith).
Magellan acknowledged all four of Dr. Bricken's recommendations but proposed a three-month ramp-up period to help Slaughter meet the Productivity Goal. See ECF No. 24-10 at 2 (recounting [*37]  in a January 2019 letter to Slaughter steps of the interactive process as of the date of the letter). Slaughter counter-proposed a longer ramp-up period with fewer client accounts and a temporary goal of four prior authorizations per hour. See id. Ehlers explained that Dr. Bricken had not recommended fewer client accounts, that Magellan would not agree to a long-term modification to the job responsibilities and expectations, and that Slaughter could not have a third party assist him while working because of the confidentiality of the information he handled. Id. at 2-3. Ehlers again offered the same ramp-up period as it had originally and offered any training that Slaughter thought would be helpful. Id. at 3. Ehlers stated that Magellan lacked sufficient information to evaluate why Slaughter needed a third-party representative. Id. Slaughter did not respond to this letter. Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 10.
In emails with Zampogna in November and December 2018, Slaughter did not request additional accommodations. See Zampogna's Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10; ECF No. 24-7; ECF No. 24-9. Zampogna spoke with a TWC representative in March 2019 who informed him that Slaughter planned to submit additional requests after [*38]  TWC conducted a workspace review. Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 11. Slaughter did not submit the TWC report or make any additional requests for accommodation supported by TWC's review. Id. Slaughter also did not respond to Zampogna's April 9, 2019 letter specifically requesting the TWC report and recommendations for accommodations. Id. at ¶ 12; ECF No. 24-11. This evidence shows that Magellan considered all accommodations that Slaughter requested and explained what accommodations Magellan could not allow, citing business reasons. Slaughter cites no evidence to show Magellan failed to offer reasonable accommodations.
Magellan also argues that Slaughter stopped participating in the interactive process. ECF No. 24 at 22. In his declaration, Slaughter averred, "At no point did I cease participating in the interactive process. At no point did I indicate to Magellan that I wished to terminate the interactive process." ECF No. 25-1 at 6. Other than his own self-serving, conclusory declaration, Slaughter points to no evidence showing that he continued to work with Magellan after December 2018 to reach an agreement on available reasonable accommodations. Slaughter's declaration is not enough to defeat [*39]  summary judgment because a self-serving, conclusory declaration on its own cannot create a genuine issue of material fact. See Vinewood Cap., LLC v. Dar Al-Maal Al-Islami Tr., 541 F. App'x 443, 447 (5th Cir. 2013). This is particularly true when all other facts are to the contrary. See id.
Slaughter argues that he requested additional breaks, which Magellan denied, offering instead that he divide his two fifteen-minute breaks into more shorter breaks. ECF No. 25-1 at ¶ 19. Slaughter's assertion that he requested additional breaks as an accommodation is not supported by any evidence other than his conclusory declaration, which is not enough. See Vinewood Cap., LLC, 541 F. App'x at 447. The evidence includes only a May 2018 conversation between Slaughter and Bueno about the use of breaks. ECF 25-11 at 35. Bueno messaged Slaughter during work hours, "You were just on a 15 min break around 5:30 and now in Aux 4. Aux 4 time will adversely [a]ffect your productivity and you have had quite a bit lately. If you need more frequent breaks, you will need to split up your 15 min breaks throughout the day." Id.
Because Slaughter fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was a qualified individual with a disability and whether Magellan failed to reasonably accommodate his disability, the failure to [*40]  accommodate claim cannot survive summary judgment.

C. Retaliation
The ADA makes it illegal for an employer to retaliate against an employee for engaging in a protected activity. 42 U.S.C. § 12203. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in an activity protected under the ADA; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action existed. Lyons v. Katy Indep. Sch. Dist., 964 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir. 2020). A prima facie case for retaliation under the ADA also requires the plaintiff to show that he was a qualified individual at the time the employer took the adverse action. Moss, 851 F.3d at 420. Because Slaughter's claim is based on indirect evidence, the McDonnell Douglas approach applies.

i. Prima Facie Case
Addressing the last requirement first, as discussed above, Slaughter has not shown that he was qualified at the time he was terminated. The first element—engaging in protected activity—is met by evidence showing that Slaughter requested accommodation in September 2018 and filed an EEOC complaint in November 2018. Because Magellan terminated Slaughter's employment, the second element of adverse employment action is also met.
Magellan argues that Slaughter [*41]  cannot meet the causation element because no evidence connects Magellan's decision to terminate Slaughter's employment to any protected activity. ECF No. 24 at 23. "A 'causal link' is established when the evidence demonstrates that 'the employer's decision to terminate was based in part on knowledge of the employee's protected activity.'" Nall v. BNSF Ry. Co., 917 F.3d 335, 349 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., 238 F.3d 674, 684 (5th Cir. 2001)).
The evidence shows that Magellan initiated the disciplinary process prior to Slaughter's engaging in a protected activity. Bueno placed Slaughter on a PIP for failing to meet the Productivity Goal on January 8, 2018, three months before Slaughter contacted human resources for the first time about disability benefits, eight months before he requested an accommodation, and ten months before Slaughter filed an EEOC charge of discrimination. See Bueno's Decl. ¶ 12; ECF No. 24-17, ECF No. 25-9 at 3-4. Magellan had suspended the pending termination during the interactive process. Zampogna's Decl. at ¶ 6. When Slaughter failed to request any additional accommodations by the deadline imposed by Zampogna's April 9, 2019 letter, Bueno sought approval to terminate Slaughter's employment. Zampogna's Decl. ¶ 13. Slaughter fails to show any causal connection [*42]  between his request for accommodation and his termination because the disciplinary process began before his request for accommodation.
When Slaughter filed the EEOC charge on November 19, 2018, the parties were engaged in the interactive process. Slaughter was terminated on May 2, 2019, slightly more than five months after he filed the EEOC charge. Id. The Fifth Circuit has held that a "five month lapse is not close enough, without other evidence of retaliation, to establish the 'causal connection' element of a prima facie case of retaliation." Lyons, 964 F.3d at 305. The termination, however, occurred less than two weeks after Magellan determined Slaughter had ended the interactive process and lifted the suspension on terminating Slaughter. Because that period is "very close," the court finds that, for purposes of summary judgment, Slaughter has raised a prima facie fact issue on causal connection between the filing of the EEOC charge and his termination. See id. (quoting Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001)) (stating that evidence of "very close" temporal proximity may suffice to establish a prima facie case of retaliation).

ii. Pretext
Slaughter fails to present evidence of pretext to overcome Magellan's legitimate nondiscriminatory reason [*43]  for termination. Slaughter cannot satisfy pretext by temporal proximity alone. See Lyons, 964 F.3d at 306-07 ("This 'very close' temporal proximity is sufficient to establish the 'causal connection' element of [the] prima facie case, but it is insufficient to demonstrate pretext."). "Ultimately, the employee must show that 'but for' the protected activity, the adverse employment action would not have occurred." Lyons, 964 F.3d at 304 (quoting Nall, 917 F.3d at 349).
As discussed above, the evidence shows a reason other than disability for Slaughter's termination. The evidence shows that Slaughter failed to meet the Productivity Goal at any point after Bueno instituted it and showed no improvement during the suspension of his termination. When Slaughter failed to meet Zampogna's response deadline with requests of additional accommodations, Magellan lifted the suspension and finalized the termination. Because the evidence shows that Magellan had a reason other than disability for Slaughter's termination, Slaughter cannot show that but for his disability his employment would not have been terminated.
Absent evidence that his termination would not have occurred if he were not disabled, no reasonable jury could infer that Magellan retaliated against him. [*44]  Because Slaughter fails to raise genuine issues of material fact that he was a qualified individual and that Magellan's stated reason for terminating him was pretextual, the claim cannot survive summary judgment.

5. Conclusion
Because Slaughter fails to produce evidence demonstrating a genuine dispute of material fact on any of the claims on which Magellan filed summary judgment, the court recommends that Magellan's motion for summary judgment be granted.
The parties have fourteen days from service of this memorandum and recommendation to file written objections. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72. Failure to timely file objections will preclude appellate review of factual findings or legal conclusions, except for plain error. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 147-49, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985); Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276-77 (5th Cir. 1988).
