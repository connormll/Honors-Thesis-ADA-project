REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

I. Introduction
This workplace discrimination case, which comes before us for consideration of the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, aptly illustrates the limitations of such motions. The factual record in this case presently seems marked by some stubborn ambiguities and stark factual disputes. Thus, it is not entirely clear what disabilities affected the plaintiff, what accommodations she sought, and how those accommodations were met. Further, the circumstances surrounding Scopelliti's employment, and the end of her employment, are hotly disputed. Indeed, it seems that the parties cannot fully agree regarding whether Scopelliti was fired or resigned. These factual disputes and ambiguities, in our view, combine to largely defeat any summary judgment adjudication of this case at this time.
Pending before the court is the [*2]  plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment in an employment dispute case rife with contention between the former employee and current plaintiff, Dina Scopelliti, and her former employer and supervisors. (Doc. 29). Scopelliti brought the instant suit against her former employer, Traditional Home Health and Hospice ("Traditional"), alleging violations of her rights under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2611, et seq., the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12111, et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. In her motion for partial summary judgment, Scopelliti seeks "partial judgment in her favor on a claim of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate and retaliation under the ADAAA." (Doc.29 at 2).
The defendant disputes these claims, arguing that Scopelliti was not disabled within the meaning of the ADA and the ADAAA, and that even if she was, Scopelliti never requested that Traditional engage in the interactive process regarding her requested accommodations for her disability. The defendant also asserts that it terminated Scopelliti's employment because of her repeated absenteeism and because she had exhausted her FMLA leave, rather than the "health issues" referenced in Traditional's termination [*3]  letter.
After review of the record, we find that there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude the entry of summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's ADA and ADAAA claims since a series of factual ambiguities prevent us from reaching any final conclusions regarding the merits of these claims. Therefore, we recommend that the plaintiff's partial summary judgment motion be denied.

II. Statement of Facts and of the Case
Dina Scopelliti worked for the defendant as an Insurance Verification Specialist from 2014 until 2017. (Doc. 6, ¶ 1). Beginning in July of 2015, Scopelliti was forced to request and take various forms of FMLA leave for medical issues. (Doc. 42-1, 40-41). One of her treating physicians then authored a report on August 4, 2015 recommending intermittent FMLA leave for a period of one year, during which time Scopelliti could take leave if her conditions flared up or worsened. (Id., at 42). From this time until June 5, 2017, it appears that Scopelliti was covered under either intermittent or extended FMLA leave recommended by at least one of her medical providers. (Id., at 61-63, 68-69, 94-95, 98, 121).
While covered under FMLA leave, Scopelliti attended physical therapy in January of 2017, (Id., at 87), had multiple [*4]  surgical procedures, including one which was scheduled in November of 2016, but was delayed until February 8, 2017 due to insurance concerns and the busy holiday season at work, (Id., at 62-68, 74-75, 79), and two procedures in March of 2017. (Id., at 92). For the surgeries in March of 2017, Scopelliti had originally planned to take minimal time off of work, but after a difficult recovery that was longer than expected, this return date was ultimately amended numerous times by her providers to an eventual return date of June 5, 2017. (Id., at 94-95, 98). On June 5, 2017, however, Scopelliti did not return to work, instead calling off ill and claiming that she needed more time to recover. (Id., at 97). She subsequently called off on June 6, 2017, at which time she told her supervisors that she would not be in to work for the remainder of the week. (Doc. 42-4, 6). Scopelliti did not have a medical provider's recommendation for FMLA leave and was not covered under the FMLA when she requested this additional week to continue her recovery. (Doc. 42-1, 98-99).
On June 6, 2017, after Scopelliti's FMLA leave had expired and she had not yet obtained an extension for her FMLA leave or returned to work, the defendant's Human Resources Manager, Tammy Morano, [*5]  mailed Scopelliti a letter terminating her employment, effective immediately. (Doc. 42-2, 30). This letter informed Scopelliti that her "FMLA entitlement exhausted on June 2, 2017, at which time [she] was expected to return to work on June 5[.]" (Id.) The only real explanation given to Scopelliti for her termination was that the defendant could not hold the position open any longer, and that her extended period of leave could "put the Connections Program at risk as the management of the patients in this program require their oversight on a full time basis." (Id.) The defendant further apologized that Scopelliti's health status was preventing her return to work, but that the position simply needed a full-time employee. (Id.)
While Scopelliti had been away from work on approved FMLA leave, Morano had contacted Scopelliti regarding her reassignment to a new position as the Connections Coordinator, which Morano believed might provide a less physically taxing work environment and would allow Scopelliti to work from home on occasion. (Doc. 42-4, ¶ 23). Due to a difference of opinion on the nature of this position, Scopelliti was unhappy about this potential employment move, and believed that [*6]  she was being relocated as part of a plan to phase out the Connections program, and eventually herself with it. (Doc. 42-1, 142-43). In an effort to avoid what she believed was inevitable, Scopelliti voluntarily resigned from her position on June 8, 2017—the day before she received her termination letter in the mail from the defendant. (Id.)
Thereafter, Scopelliti filed a written complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), which was cross-filed with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ("PHRC") to exhaust her administrative remedies. (Doc. 6, ¶ 7). Within ninety days after receiving her right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Scopelliti filed this action on January 5, 2018. (Doc. 1). Fact discovery in this case concluded on July 30, 2018. (Doc. 18). The plaintiff then filed the instant motion for partial summary judgment on August 19, 2019. (Doc. 29). The motion has been fully briefed (Docs. 30, 31, 36, 51, 53, 54, 61, 62) and is ripe for resolution.

III. Discussion

A. Summary Judgment — Standard of Review
The plaintiff has moved for partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that the court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there [*7]  is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Through summary adjudication, a court is empowered to dispose of those claims that do not present a "genuine dispute as to any material fact," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and for which a trial would be "an empty and unnecessary formality." Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-0493, 702 F. Supp. 2d 465, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31615, at *4 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2010). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and "[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Id., at 248-49.
The moving party has the initial burden of identifying evidence that it believes shows an absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Conoshenti v. Pub. Serv. Elec. & Gas Co., 364 F.3d 135, 145-46 (3d Cir. 2004). Once the moving party has shown that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's claims, "the non-moving party must rebut the motion with facts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal memoranda, or oral argument." Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v. Colkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006); accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the non-moving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to [*8]  establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden at trial," summary judgment is appropriate. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. Summary judgment is also appropriate if the non-moving party provides merely colorable, conclusory, or speculative evidence. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. There must be more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the non-moving party and more than some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. Id., at 252; see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). In making this determination, the Court must "consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion." A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Sch., 486 F.3d 791, 794 (3d Cir. 2007).
Moreover, a party who seeks to resist a summary judgment motion by citing to disputed material issues of fact must show by competent evidence that such factual disputes exist. Further, "only evidence which is admissible at trial may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment." Countryside Oil Co., Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., 928 F. Supp. 474, 482 (D.N.J. 1995). Similarly, it is well-settled that: "[o]ne cannot create an issue of fact merely by . . . denying averments . . . without producing any supporting evidence of the denials." Thimons v. PNC Bank, NA, 254 F. App'x 896, 899 (3d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Thus, "[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denial." [*9]  Fireman's Ins. Co. of Newark NJ v. DuFresne, 676 F.2d 965, 968 (3d Cir. 1982); see Sunshine Books, Ltd. v. Temple University, 697 F.2d 90, 96 (3d Cir. 1982). "[A] mere denial is insufficient to raise a disputed issue of fact, and an unsubstantiated doubt as to the veracity of the opposing affidavit is also not sufficient." Lockhart v. Hoenstine, 411 F.2d 455, 458 (3d Cir. 1969). Furthermore, "a party resisting a [Rule 56] motion cannot expect to rely merely upon bare assertions, conclusory allegations or suspicions." Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Ness v. Marshall, 660 F.2d 517, 519 (3d Cir. 1981)).
Finally, it is emphatically not the province of the court to weigh evidence, or assess credibility, when passing upon a motion for summary judgment. Rather, in adjudicating the motion, the court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the opposing party, Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir. 1992). Where the non-moving party's evidence contradicts the movant's, then the non-movant's must be taken as true. Id. Additionally, the court is not to decide whether the evidence unquestionably favors one side or the other, or to make credibility determinations, but instead must decide whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; see also Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1363. In reaching this determination, the Third Circuit has instructed that:
To raise a genuine issue of material fact . . . [*10]  the opponent need not match, item for item, each piece of evidence proffered by the movant. In practical terms, if the opponent has exceeded the "mere scintilla" threshold and has offered a genuine issue of material fact, then the court cannot credit the movant's version of events against the opponent, even if the quantity of the movant's evidence far outweighs that of its opponent. It thus remains the province of the fact finder to ascertain the believability and weight of the evidence.
Id. In contrast, "[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted); NAACP v. North Hudson Reg'l Fire & Rescue, 665 F.3d 464, 476 (3d Cir. 2011).

B. Scopelliti's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Should be Denied as to her ADA and ADAAA Claims.
There is a certain measure of ambiguity to Scopelliti's ADA claims. As we understand it, Scopelliti alleges three claims under the ADA and ADAAA: disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation. We address these arguments in turn.1
Mindful of the effect that the ADAAA amendments had on liberally classifying individuals with disabilities, the purpose of the ADA remains to "prevent employment discrimination of qualified individuals on account of their disability." Koller v. Riley Riper Hollin & Colagreco, 850 F. Supp. 2d 502, 512 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "To state a claim [for disability discrimination] under the ADA, an individual must (1) be disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) be otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) have suffered an adverse employment decision." Miller v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 350 Fed. App'x 727, 728-29 (3d Cir. 2009). The ADA's protections extend to all qualified individuals with disabilities, 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Qualified individuals with disabilities are defined as "an individual with a [*12]  disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that [the] individual holds or desires." Id., § 12111(8); Turner v. Hershey Chocolate USA, 440 F.3d 604, 608 (3d Cir. 2006). Thus, we begin our analysis with whether Scopelliti has presented sufficient evidence that she is a disabled person under the ADA. "The ADA defines 'disability' as: (A) 'a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such [an] individual'; (B) 'a record of such an impairment'; or (C) 'being regarded as having such an impairment.' 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)." Kessler v. AT&T, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, *16 (M.D. Pa. 2015). "Although the statute does not define the term 'major life activities,' the EEOC has issued regulations explaining that major life activities are 'functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.'" Tice v. Ctr. Area Transp. Auth., 247 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)). After the ADAAA amendments, this non-exhaustive list is to be construed liberally in favor of plaintiffs. See Miller v. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48473, *29 (W.D. Pa. 2018).
Scopelliti's pleadings indicate that she is pursuing her case under all definitions of a "disability" under the ADA. (See Doc. 6, ¶¶ 28-30). Likewise, in her amended complaint and partial motion to dismiss, Scopelliti paints with a [*13]  broad brush, generally stating that she has lupus and chronic migraines. (Doc. 6, ¶ 28). She then claims that her "disabilities affect her ability to bend, walk, lift and concentrate." (Id., ¶ 29). Scopelliti thus invites us to make a series of assumptions: first, that her disabilities include lupus, chronic migraines, and perhaps other medical conditions; second, that these conditions "affect her ability to bend, walk, lift and concentrate[;]" and third, that these conditions meet the definition of a disabled individual under the ADA and the EEOC's regulations. (Id.) Scopelliti's briefs and subsequent filings do not clarify this ambiguity, noting merely that her "medical conditions" and "health issues" caused her termination. (See Docs. 29-31, 53, 62).
The defendant takes issue with these ambiguities, noting that "[t]he record is totally insufficient about what precise impairment is the source of Ms. Scopelliti's purported disability[,]" and claiming that Scopelliti has failed "to adduce sufficient evidence that [her] alleged limitations were substantial." (Doc. 61, 5-6). We agree with the defendant that Scopelliti's allegations of disability are vague and imprecise at best, but note [*14]  that the implementing regulations of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 direct our treatment of this issue:
The primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether covered entities have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.
29 C.F.R. § 1630.1; see also 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2 ("Accordingly, the threshold issue of whether an impairment 'substantially limits' a major life activity should not demand extensive analysis."); see also Kessler, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126888, *17. Presented with this statement of congressional intent in the ADA Amendments Act and its implementing regulations, we find that a jury could conclude that Scopelliti is disabled within the meaning of the ADA by virtue of her migraines, lupus, and other alleged medical conditions. We come to this conclusion based on Scopelliti's deposition testimony, which also indicates, contrary to the defendant's assertions, that the effects of her disability were substantial under the ADAAA amendments.2 (See Doc. 42-1, 13, 68-69, 134-35). However, we note that this threshold element of Scopelliti's DAAA and ADA claims is [*15]  itself factually disputed by the defendant, making summary judgment in favor of Scopeletti inappropriate
As to the second element of a prima facie discrimination case under the ADA and ADAAA, the EEOC regulations divide the question of whether an individual is qualified for his or her position into two parts: "(1) whether the individual has the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the position sought, and (2) whether the individual, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position." Turner, 440 F.3d at 611 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)); see also Bisker v. GGS Info. Servs., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *5 (M.D. Pa. 2010). In this case, there does not appear to be a dispute over whether Scopelliti had the "requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements" to perform her job with the defendant. Rather, the parties seem to dispute whether consistent, full-time attendance was an essential function of her job, and thus whether Scopelliti could perform this essential function of her job with a reasonable accommodation—i.e., reducing her work hours or modifying her schedule to attend medical appointments and taking an extra week off in June of 2017 to recover from her surgical procedure earlier in [*16]  the year.
"Whether a job duty is an 'essential function' turns on whether it is 'fundamental' to the employment position," Turner, 440 F.3d at 612 (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)), and is a factual determination made on a case by case basis. Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *5 (citing Turner, 440 F.3d at 612). While many cases have held that regular attendance is an essential function of a job, see, e.g., Veltri v. Thompson Consumer Elecs., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31710 (M.D. Pa. 2004); Jovanovic v. In-Sink-Erator Div. of Emerson Elec. Co., 201 F.3d 894, 899-900 (7th Cir. 2000) ("Common sense dictates that regular attendance is usually an essential in most every employment setting; if one is not present, he is usually unable to perform his job."); Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir. 1994); Carr v. Reno, 23 F.3d 525, 530, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 217 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Jackson v. Veterans Admin., 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994); Santiago v. Temple Univ., 739 F. Supp. 974, 979 (E.D. Pa. 1990), aff'd, 928 F.2d 396 (3d Cir. 1991), our precedent in this Circuit indicates that this is a fact-bound inquiry which is inappropriate for summary judgment, except in clear cases. See Miller v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 350 Fed. App'x 727, 729 (3d Cir. 2009) (holding that "[a]ttendance can constitute an essential function under the ADA" where it is "evident that attendance is an essential element of [the] position"). In this case we are not presented with enough evidence on the record to determine as a matter of law that Scopelliti's position with the defendant was such that her regular attendance was not an essential job function.3 Therefore, Scopeletti has not demonstrated this element of her claim as a matter of law.
Likewise we cannot determine as a matter of law that the defendant refused to [*17]  provide Scopelliti with reasonable accommodations, as required by the ADA. As the Third Circuit has summarized,
An employer discriminates against a qualified individual when it does "not make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of the individual unless the [employer] can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of the [employer]." Id. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "Reasonable accommodation" means measures such as "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." Id. § 12111(9).
Turner, 440 F.3d at 608. Undue hardships involve "significant difficulty or expense in, or resulting from, the provision of the accommodation." Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *6 (quoting Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n of Southeastern Pennsylvania, 168 F.3d 661, 670 (3d Cir. 1999)) (quotation marks omitted); 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. § 1630.2(p). The plaintiff bears the initial burden of "identifying an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its benefits." Walton, 168 F.3d at 670. The burden then shifts to the defendant to either prove that "the accommodation is unreasonable or that it creates an undue hardship for the defendant." Id. Summary judgment is thus only [*18]  appropriate where the plaintiff's proposal "is either clearly ineffective or outlandishly costly." Bisker, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53879, *6-7 (quoting Walton, 168 F.3d at 670) (quotation marks omitted).
Here, there is both a factual ambiguity and a dispute of material fact regarding whether the defendant honored Scopelliti's requests for accommodations during her employment and whether those requested accommodations were unreasonable.4 This is evidenced by conflicting accounts of the events regarding Scopelliti's planned surgery on the Friday following Thanksgiving in 2016, her routine medical appointments throughout her tenure with Traditional, and her request for an additional week off after her scheduled return from an extended period of FMLA leave in June of 2017.5 (Doc. 42-1, 44-45, 54, 58-59, 64, 68-69, 79, 91, 98, 100-02, 107-08, 119-20, 124-25; Doc. 42-4, 2-6, 13-16, 22-23). Scopelliti has also put forth evidence that she offered to work extended hours for the defendant to make up for her time off from work. (Doc. 42-1, 122-23). On the present, incomplete, record, the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to summary judgment on her claim for disability discrimination under the ADA and the ADAAA. We note that it may well be that a more precisely [*19]  focused summary judgment motion could address these ambiguities. Therefore, we recommend that the district court deny this motion without prejudice to the plaintiff raising more pointed and directed issues for our future review, noting the imprecision with which Scopelliti's alleged disabilities were presented and briefed from both parties.
Having found that factual disputes preclude summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on Scopelliti's discrimination case under the ADA and ADAAA, we turn to Scopelliti's remaining claims for failure to accommodate and retaliation. Under the ADA, an employer must provide reasonable accommodations to a disabled worker.
An employee can demonstrate that an employer breached its duty to provide reasonable accommodations because it failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process by showing that: "1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; 2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; 3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and 4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith."
Moore v. CVS Rx Servs., Inc., 142 F. Supp. 3d 321, 335 (M.D. Pa. 2015), aff'd, 660 F. App'x 149 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting [*20]  Williams v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 772 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)). "The burden is on the employee . . . to inform the employer of both the disability and desire for an accommodation." Schillaci v. Cargill Meat Solutions, No. 3:CV-12-561, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178548, 2012 WL 6589941, at *4 (M.D. Pa. December 18, 2012) (quoting Drozdowski v. Northland Lincoln Mercury, 321 F. App'x 181, 185 (3d Cir. 2009)) (quotation marks omitted).
The ADA also prohibits retaliation against the disabled for exercising any of their rights under federal law. "To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee's protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse action." Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., 126 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir. 1997).
These retaliation and failure to accommodate claims suffer from the same shortcomings as Scopelliti's claim for disability discrimination in this case in that the record before us is imprecise and unclear regarding Scopelliti's disabilities and the connection between these disabilities and the defendant's actions in this case. In other words, it is unclear whether Scopelliti's requests for accommodations were attributable to her chronic migraines or lupus diagnosis, recovery from surgery to resolve these conditions, [*21]  or some other outstanding cause unrelated to her identified disabilities in her amended complaint. Moreover, we find that there is an ambiguity regarding the nature of the accommodations that Scopelliti sought. Specifically, it is unclear to us whether Scopelliti was seeking a "blank check" in terms of time off from work when her alleged disabilities flared up or whether she sought a more tailored solution from the defendant. Furthermore, Scopelliti's retaliation and failure-to-accommodate claims rest upon a contested factual premise regarding the motive and intent of the defendant. Scopelliti insists that the defendant acted in bad faith and with the intent to retaliate. The defendant, in turn, contends that its actions were a reasonable response to the unreasonable demands and conduct of the plaintiff. These disputes issues of motive and intent also prevent entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the plaintiff. In short, while the plaintiff alleges that she faced retaliation, and ultimately termination due to her disabilities, the record is unclear on these issues, and when we consider a party's motion for summary judgment, this lack of factual clarity often precludes entry [*22]  of judgment as a matter of law. Thus, considering all the evidence before us, we cannot say, given the ambiguities in this case, that summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff is appropriate with respect to any of Scopelliti's claims under the ADA and the ADAAA.

IV. Recommendation
For the foregoing reasons it is RECOMMENDED that the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 29) be DENIED without prejudice as to the plaintiff's claims under the ADA and ADAAA, subject to later renewal on a clearer and more precise record.
The parties are hereby placed on notice that pursuant to Local Rule 72.3:
Any party may object to a magistrate judge's proposed findings, recommendations, or report addressing a motion or matter described in 28 U.S.C. § 636 (b)(1)(B) or making a recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy thereof. Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and serve on the magistrate judge and all parties, written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings, recommendations or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2 shall [*23]  apply. A judge shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made and may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing only in his or her discretion or where required by law, and may consider the record developed before the magistrate judge, making his or her own determination on the basis of that record. The judge may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses, or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
Submitted this 17th day of December 2019.
