MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
This matter is before the Court on the Motion to Clarify (Dkt. No. 50) of Defendant, D.C. Chartered Health Plan ("Chartered").
In Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S. Ct. 1597, 143 L. Ed. 2d 966 (1999), the Supreme Court held that "an ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation." Accordingly, the Court explained that
When faced with a plaintiff's previous sworn statement asserting "total disability" or the like, the court should require an explanation of any apparent inconsistency with the necessary elements of an ADA claim. To defeat summary judgment, that explanation must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror's concluding that, assuming the truth of, or the plaintiff's good-faith belief  [*2] in, the earlier statement, the plaintiff could nonetheless "perform the essential functions" of her job, with or without "reasonable accommodation."
Id. at 807. Accord, Solomon v. Vilsack, 628 F.3d 555, 562-63, 393 U.S. App. D.C. 327 (D.C. Cir. 2010).
In this case, the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff applied for Social Security disability benefits and was established as totally disabled as of February 1, 2006. Dkt. No. 35 at 20-21; Dkt. No. 36-1 at 15-16. In support of her disability application, the undisputed evidence is that Plaintiff's physician submitted a report in June 2006 stating that Plaintiff was not able to work in any capacity and that an independent physician submitted a report in August 2006 stating that it was not realistic to believe that Plaintiff could perform any work-related activities. Dkt. No. 35 at 20-21; Dkt. No. 36-1 at 15-16. In response to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, based upon this total disability finding and these undisputed facts, Plaintiff did not present any evidence that she could perform the essential functions of her job after February 1, 2006. Instead, the Plaintiff argues that Defendant "[has] not presented evidence that her medical condition could not  [*3] be accommodated" after February 1, 2006 (Dkt. No. 51 at 4), but that assertion, even if accurate, is largely irrelevant. The crucial point is whether Plaintiff has met her evidentiary burden as required by the holding of Cleveland. She has not done so. The evidence that Plaintiff may have earned wages for a few months performing unspecified duties at some other job with some other employer after her termination from Chartered is not sufficient to show that she could still perform the essential duties of her job at Chartered after February 1, 2006. In addition, the medical evidence cited by Plaintiff from October 2005 is not sufficient to raise an issue of material fact, because that evidence does nothing to explain the "apparent inconsistency" with the total disability finding as of February 1, 2006 and the medical evidence that was submitted to support that finding.
Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to partial summary judgment limiting Plaintiff's damages to no more than four months after her October 2005 termination, due to her failure to establish that after February 1, 2006, she could continue to perform the essential elements of her prior position with Chartered, with or without  [*4] reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the Defendant's Motion to Clarify (Dkt. No. 50) is GRANTED as to these grounds. In all other respects, the motion is DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
