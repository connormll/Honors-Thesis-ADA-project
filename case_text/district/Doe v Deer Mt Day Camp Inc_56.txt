Opinion



 [*330]  OPINION & ORDER
 [*331]  POGUE, Judge: 1 In this action, Plaintiff Adam Doe ("Plaintiff" or "Adam") claims that Defendants Deer Mountain Day Camp, Inc. ("DMDC") and Deer Mountain Basketball Academy ("DMBA") discriminated against him -- in denying him admission to a basketball camp -- on the basis of his disability, namely, his infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ("HIV"), in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213 (2000) ("ADA") 2 and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290-301 (2004) ("NYHRL").
The court has jurisdiction over the ADA claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331; it has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
Presently before the court are both parties' motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. As will be explained further below, because Plaintiff's disability was a substantial factor in Defendants' denial of Adam's admission, and because Defendants failed to present any evidence of the objective reasonableness of their determination that Plaintiff's condition posed a threat to other campers, the court GRANTS, as to DMDC, Plaintiff's motion for declaratory relief. However, because the parties have not clarified the relationship between DMDC and DMBA, the court DENIES Plaintiff's motion as to DMBA at this time. In addition, because Plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief, the court DISMISSES Plaintiff's claim in that regard. The court also DENIES Defendants' motion in its entirety, and DISMISSES Defendants' affirmative defense of unclean hands.

I. Background
The parties  [**3] disagree as to some of the facts at issue here; therefore, the court will endeavor to fairly set forth the disputed and undisputed evidence, addressing in turn DMDC's and DMBA's admission process, Adam's background and application for admission to DMBA, and the relevant history of this litigation.

A. Deer Mountain Day Camp
DMDC, a camp regulated by the American Camp Association as well as the Rockland County Department of Health, (Pl's Confidential Ex. C in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. ("Pl.'s Ex. C"), Roberta Katz 3 Dep. 9, 11-12) accepts applications for admission from potential campers. This process requires that a potential camper pay an admission fee and submit a signed application, which includes both a "medical report" and a "camper medication form." 4 (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 13; Pl.'s Ex. E, [DMBA] 2004 Application 1-4.) 5 
The forms are subsequently reviewed by camp nurses, 6 who are responsible for  [*332]  health assessments of the prospective campers. (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 13-14.) Often DMDC nurses require some time, prior to the start of camp, to look into prospective campers' medical conditions, as well as medications listed on a camper's form, in order to determine how to keep the camper safe and to allow the camp staff to anticipate medical problems the child might have. (Id. 13-14, 15-16, 23-25.) If one of the nurses has a question, he or she will usually speak with a parent and, with the parent's permission, with the doctor or a specialist. (Id. 41, 83-85; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin 31, 37, 46.) 7 DMDC will also inquire into medications in order to determine potential side effects as they relate to sun, exercise, and dehydration. (Id. 117-18.)
Accordingly, DMDC needs to receive applications before camp begins so as to have sufficient time to prepare camp facilities for all campers' health needs. (Id. 37, 43-44.) It is unclear whether DMDC has a deadline for application submission, but DMDC does require that a camper provide a signed application and medical forms prior to the start of camp. (Id. 28-30, 37.) Yet it has happened that DMDC has accepted application forms on the first day of camp. (See id. 31-35.)
While DMDC's application provides for the submission of medical information, DMDC has no policy regarding assessment of a child's health and has no medical or admission standards; up until the events giving rise to this action, the camp had never denied admission to a child because of a medical condition. 8 (Id. 14, 15, 41; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin 44-45.)
At the same time, the camp uses "universal precautions," 9 and, at orientation,  [*333]  prior to the summer months, the staff has training thereon. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 107; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 26-27; Pl's Ex. D, Carol Katz Dep. 30.) Further, DMDC keeps its swimming pool properly chlorinated. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 88-89.) But, during the time at issue here, the camp had no particular policies in place for HIV-positive children. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 116.)
If "major"  [**9] medical situations occur or when DMDC nurses have further questions or concerns during their review of applications for admission, DMDC consults Dr. William Bernstein, 10 a local pediatrician who voluntarily offers the camp medical advice and information. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep 27-29; Pl's Ex. F, William Bernstein Dep. 9-10.) 11 In this role, and when providing information to DMDC regarding certain of his patients wishing to attend the camp, Bernstein may inform DMDC and the camper's family that he or she should not attend camp for medical reasons, and has recommended restrictions for children with certain disabilities or diseases. (Id. 37-38.) On medical forms submitted for his patients, Bernstein will discuss the child's medical fitness to attend camp and potential side effects of medications that the child takes. (Id. 38-39.) However, Bernstein had never, prior to the events leading up to this lawsuit, called DMDC directly to report information on a child. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 75.)
B. Deer Mountain Basketball Camp
Although DMBA took place at the DMDC facility, DMDC claims that it did not operate DMBA. (Id. 16-17.) Rather, Steve Loscher, DMBA director, worked as an "outside contractor." (Id. 53.) For the most part, Loscher's staff ran the basketball camp, but DMDC oversaw the DMBA applications process and provided health care personnel such as the lifeguard and nurses. (Pl's Ex. D, Carol Katz Dep. 11, 12; Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 19.)
The application process for DMBA was identical to that of DMDC; DMBA used the DMDC medical report and medication form, and the potential attendees of DMBA were required to submit these  [*334]  forms to the DMDC offices. (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 19, 25. See also Pl.'s Ex. E, [DMBA] 2004 Application 1-3.) In addition, Nurse Gloskin reviewed these forms at DMDC prior to the start of DMBA. (Pl.'s Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin  [**11] Dep. 56-57.)
C. Jane Doe 12 and Adam Doe
Adam contracted HIV at birth due to perinatal infection. (See id.) Adam takes antiretroviral medications to treat his condition, and his syndrome has been undetectable for years. (Id. 54.) On the advice of Dr. Neu, Adam's HIV specialist, Adam and his mother had kept and continue to keep Adam's HIV-seropositivity 13 confidential and have not informed his school of his HIV medications. (Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 34; Neu Aff. PP 19-24.)
Adam likes to play basketball, (Defs.' Ex. 2 in Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Adam Doe Dep. 7; Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 50-51) and, in 2004, his HIV clinic recommended that he attend a basketball camp. (Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 50. See also Pl.'s Ex. A in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Charlotte Revesz Dep. 25.)
Bernstein is Adam's primary pediatrician, although, from time to time, Adam has also seen Dr. David Levy. 14 (Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 41; Pl.'s Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 56-57.) However, Bernstein is not involved in Adam's HIV treatment,  [**12] does not prescribe Adam's medications, and is not familiar with the drugs Adam uses or their potential side effects. (Pl.'s Ex. F, William Bernstein Dep. 69-70.) Whenever Adam visits the HIV clinic, Bernstein gets reports from Neu. (Id. 18.) Bernstein has spoken to Neu about, among other things, Adam's pneumonia, ear infections, and hospitalizations. (Id. 18-20.) 15 

D. Adam's Application to DMBA
In June or July 2004, when Adam was approximately ten-years-old, Mrs. Doe met with Loscher to discuss signing Adam up to attend a summer basketball camp. (Pl's Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 21-22; Compl. P 15.) After Mrs. Doe informed Loscher that Adam was HIV-positive, Loscher recommended that Adam attend DMBA as it  [*335]  would be medically supervised. (Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 21-23.) DMBA was to begin on August 23 of that year. (See Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 62, 94; Defs.' Answers and Objections to Pl's First Set of Interrogs.  [**14] ("Defs.' Answers"), Interrog. 11.)
Mrs. Doe testified that she "felt funny" when Loscher reacted to Adam's condition, (Pl's Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 29) but she paid the $ 345 admission fee, and Loscher mailed her the DMBA/DMDC application. (Id. 24, 26.)
In filling out the 2004 DMBA application, Mrs. Doe left the "Other Health Comments" line blank. (Id. 29.) She did so because of Loscher's reaction to Adam's illness and because Adam's HIV doctor [Dr. Neu] told her she need not disclose Adam's HIV infection. (Id. 29, 32.) Mrs. Doe then asked Bernstein to fill out the medical report and the camper medication form. 16 
Bernstein agonized over whether he should disclose Adam's HIV to DMDC. Although he did not contact Neu, he testified that he did consult with other physicians in his practice on this issue. (Pl's Ex. F, William Bernstein Dep. 45, 46.) Thereafter, he decided to record Adam's HIV on the medical report and to inform DMDC about Adam. 17 (Id. 46. See also Pl's Ex. E, Adam Doe Application 1-4.)
On August 17 or 18, according to the Katz sisters, Bernstein informed them over the telephone that Adam was HIV-positive. He stated that he would not sign Adam's medical report unless Mrs. Doe disclosed the illness. 18 (Defs.' Answers, Interrog. 17; Pl.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 64-67, 69-70, 110; Pl's Ex. D, Carol Katz Dep. 16-17; Pl's Ex. F, William Bernstein Dep. 70-71.) Bernstein refused to provide information as to Adam in particular, but he was concerned  [**16] whether DMBA had appropriate universal precautions protocols in place and suggested establishing such precautions for DMBA. (Pl's Ex. F, William Bernstein Dep. 30-31, 54, 56.) Bernstein did not recall mentioning that Adam's activities should be restricted in any way, recommending that Adam not attend DMBA, or discussing pools or toilets. (Id. 55, 56.) The Katz sisters told him they "ha[d] to get some further advice." (Id. 53.)
After calling Mrs. Doe several times to inform her that DMDC had not yet received Adam's medical forms, Gloskin finally talked with Mrs. Doe on Friday, August 20. 19 (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin  [*336]  Dep. 62; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1.) Mrs. Doe told Gloskin that she would have NCPG fax the forms. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1; Pl's Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 35-36.) That morning, DMDC received the forms without the camper  [**17] medication form, and so Gloskin once again called Mrs. Doe, who, that afternoon, went personally to NCPG to fax the medication sheet. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1.) As a consequence, DMDC did not receive all of Adam's forms until the afternoon on the Friday before camp. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 69-70.)
Mrs. Doe granted Gloskin permission to speak with Bernstein. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 64; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1.) Thereafter, Gloskin called NCPG. 20  [**18] However, Bernstein was not available, and, instead, Gloskin spoke with Levy. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 72-73; Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1; Pl's Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 34; Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 79.) The substance of this conversation is in dispute.
According to Gloskin and Roberta Katz, Levy reported that, although he did not know exactly why Adam supposedly missed an earlier camp that summer, he "thought [Adam] had a virus." (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 79, 88. See also Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 2.) Levy also refused to give DMDC specifics on Adam, as Adam was not his patient. (Pl.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 79, 87-93; Pl.'s Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 35.) Thus, DMDC and Levy spoke in hypothetical. (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 87-93; Pl.'s Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 35.) Gloskin and Roberta Katz claim that Levy told them that there could be "some  [**19] sort of transmission issue," as a child like Adam could have blood in his stool or urine, and that Levy therefore recommended that DMDC use a separate pool and bathroom. (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 87-93, 102.) Levy allegedly affirmatively indicated that bleeding was a potential side effect of Adam's medications rather than a general concern about his HIV. 21 (Pl.'s Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 82, 87-88.) 22 The Katz  [*337]  sisters and Gloskin took what they heard to be Levy's statements at face value, and did not do any additional research. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 100.)
According to Levy, Gloskin called him because Adam's form "said [Adam] was HIV [-] positive, and she had some questions." (Pl's Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 33.) Levy states that Gloskin specifically asked him whether someone could transmit HIV to another camper if he were to urinate or defecate in the pool, urinate or defecate in a toilet bowl, or participate in contact sports. (Id. 35-36, 38.) In response, Levy told Gloskin that risk of HIV transmission was "[e]xtremely unlikely"  [**21] and could only happen if the person had "gross" 23 amounts of blood in his urine or stool - in which case he would be too sick to participate in camp. (Id. 36, 37, 39.) According to Levy, Gloskin did not ask if Adam had this particular medical problem. (Id. 37.) Moreover, Levy denies recommending either a separate pool or a separate toilet for Adam, (id. 41) and does not remember discussing Adam's fitness to attend camp, any earlier illnesses he might have had, or medications that Adam took. (Id. 41, 43, 60.) Further, he told Gloskin that, as to potential collisions resulting from contact sports, there would be small risks but transmission was nonetheless unlikely and, in any event, the camp should be taking universal precautions. (Id. 41-43.)
At this point on Friday afternoon, Gloskin and the Katz sisters worried that they had insufficient time to do research on Adam's health. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 94.) Roberta felt suspicious toward Mrs. Doe as Mrs. Doe did not disclose Adam's medical history earlier, thereby denying the camp sufficient time to prepare themselves to keep Adam and other  [**22] children safe. 24 (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 71-72, 77-78, 102-03.) The Katz sisters were unable, after receiving Adam's medical forms, to discuss the matter with Bernstein. (Id. 92-93.) In addition, they had not yet researched Adam's medications enough to know potential side effects and/or susceptibility to gastrointestinal upsets, the latter of which would be, according to Gloskin, potentially transmissible in a swimming pool. (Pl's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 83-84, 100.) They were concerned about their inability, as they saw it, to account for risks associated with Adam's participation in DMBA, such as providing him a separate pool or toilet as allegedly recommended by Levy. (Pl's Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 92-93.) But, regardless of these concerns, neither Gloskin nor the Katz sisters telephoned Mrs. Doe or Adam's HIV specialist. 25 (Pl.'s Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 95-96.)
On Saturday, Roberta called Mrs. Doe to let her know that they were unable to make reasonable accommodations for Adam and, as a consequence, they could not allow him to attend DMBA. 26 (Pl.'s Ex. C., Roberta Katz Dep. 96, 112.) According to Mrs. Doe, Roberta mentioned that Levy  [*338]  "really wouldn't recommend [Adam] going" to DMBA as well as Levy's advice that Adam could potentially transmit HIV through blood in his urine or in his stool. 27 (Pl.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 40-42.) Mrs. Doe denied that Adam had problems with bloody stool or urine. (Id. 40-41) Nonetheless, Roberta explained that DMBA could not accept Adam. 28 Thereafter, Mrs. Doe received a complete refund of all admission fees. (Id. 24.)

E. The Instant Action
As noted above, Plaintiff 29 brings this action for violations of Title III of the ADA 30 and the NYHRL. He argues that Defendants unlawfully discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, i.e., his HIV-seroposivity, by excluding him from participation in the August 2004 basketball camp. To redress his injuries, including emotional and psychological harm, Adam requests declaratory, compensatory, and injunctive relief, as well as attorney's fees and costs. Defendants have raised affirmative defenses of failure to state a claim; existence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for denial of admission; direct threat; and unclean hands. 31 
Now, in their cross motions for summary judgment, the parties place before  [*339]  the court the issues of whether HIV-seropositivity  [**28] qualifies as a "disability" and whether Defendants' denial of admission constitutes discrimination "on the basis of" that disability. Plaintiff's motion additionally argues that Defendants conclusively qualify as "public accommodations" prohibited from engaging in such discrimination.

II. Standard of Review
Under the familiar standard, summary judgment should be granted where "the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,  [*340]  and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986) (citation and quotation marks omitted). See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). A genuine issue of material fact exists where "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Apex Oil Co. v. DiMauro, 822 F.2d 246, 252 (2d Cir. 1987).
In analyzing a party's motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the  [**29] facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and all reasonable inferences and ambiguities must be resolved against the moving party. Flanigan v. GE, 242 F.3d 78, 83 (2d Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). But "[t]he party opposing summary judgment may not rely simply on conclusory statements or on contentions that the affidavits supporting the motion are not credible," and may not rest on "mere allegations or denials." Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., 51 F.3d 14, 18 (2d Cir. 1995] (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Rather, where the moving party has appropriately supported its motion, the nonmoving party must produce specific, particularized evidence to establish the existence of a genuine factual issue. Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998).

III. Adam's ADA Claim for Declaratory Relief
 32 
In order to establish a prima facie case for declaratory relief pursuant to the ADA Title III, Adam must establish that: (a) he has a "disability"; (b) Defendants are owners or operators of a place of "public accommodation"; and (c) Defendants discriminated against him, on the basis of  [**31] his disability, by denying him a "full and equal opportunity" to participate in DMBA on DMDC premises. See Roberts v. Royal Atl. Corp., 542 F.3d 363, 368 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 1581, 173 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2009) (citing Camarillo, 518 F.3d at 156); 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).
The court will therefore address below each of these elements necessary for summary judgment as to the ADA, concluding that Adam qualifies as having a disability, that the DMDC and DMBA are public accommodations for purposes of the ADA, and that Adam's HIV played a substantial part  [*341]  in the DMDC's denial of his admission. Finally, the court will address Defendants' defense that they reasonably determined that Adam posed a direct threat to other campers' safety.
A. Adam's "Disability"
Although they claim that Adam is not disabled, Defendants do not dispute that Adam is HIV-positive, and the Court of Appeals has concluded that HIV infection qualifies as a disability under the ADA. Rivera v. Heyman, 157 F.3d 101, 103 (2d Cir. 1998) ("HIV infection is a disability under the [ADA]" (citing Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 639-45, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998))). See also Brown v. 820 River St., Inc., No. 1:08-CV-0130 (LEK/DRH), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70370, at *3 n.2 (N.D.N.Y Aug. 10, 2009).  [**32] This conclusion is buttressed by Department of Justice ("DOJ") regulations 33 as well as the legislative history of the ADA. 34 As a consequence, Adam's Motion for Summary Judgment as to disability is GRANTED. For the same reasons, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on disability is DENIED.
 [*342]  B. DMBA and DMDC as "Placet[s] of Public Accommodation"
Next, Plaintiff argues that DMBA and DMDC, as camps for children, qualify as "owners and operators" of "a place of public accommodation" pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Defendants do not contest this issue, and, indeed, refer to themselves  [**35] as "public accommodations." (See Defs. [DMDC] and [DMBA] ' s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to PL.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 22 n.32.) Moreover, Plaintiff has clearly established that DMDC and DMBA "own" and "operate" camps. A "camp" is " [a] place in the country that offers simple group accommodations and organized recreation or instruction, as for vacationing children," and "[a] place where' athletes engage in intensive training . . . ." American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 276 (3d ed. 1996]. The ADA provides several categories of "public accommodations" into which camps fit, including "place[s] of recreation," 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7) (I), "placets] of education," id. § 12181(7) (J), and "placets] of exercise and recreation." Id. § 12181(7) (L). Accord 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. Therefore, Adam's Motion for Summary Judgment as to "public accommodation" is GRANTED.

C. Defendants' Adverse Action "on the Basis of" Adam's Disability
Under the ADA, a disabled individual may not "be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a).  [**36] Accord 28 C.F.R. § 36.201. 35 Thus, Adam has the burden to prove that Defendants discriminated against him within the meaning of the ADA. Camarillo, 518 F.3d at 156. "[D]iscrimination," as used in section 12182(a), is defined by the ADA as, among other things:
(I) the imposition or application of eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any class of individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary for the provision of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered; 36
(ii) a failure to make reasonable 37 modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations;
 [*343]  (iii) a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that  [**37] no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the entity can demonstrate that taking such steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the good,' service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation being offered or would result in an undue burden 38 ….
42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A). Accord 28 C.F.R. §§ 36.301(a), 36.302(a), 36.303(a). See also 28 C.F.R. § 36.204 ("A public accommodation shall not . . . utilize standards or criteria . . . that have the effect of discriminating on the basis of disability"). 39 
It follows that "[t]o establish discrimination under . . . the ADA, [a] plaintiff[] ha[s] three available theories: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation." Tsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dep't, 352 F.3d 565, 573 (2d Cir. 2003).  [**39] Plaintiff raises only the first of these theories of liability.
DMDC's Intentional Discrimination:
To state a claim for intentional discrimination, or disparate treatment, under the ADA, Adam "must present evidence that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken" by Defendants. Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, Inc. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2002) (citations, emphasis, and quotation marks omitted). This "significant factor" standard creates a "mixed-motive" theory of liability in which a plaintiff's disability need not be a but-for cause of a defendant's actions. See Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 336-37 (2d Cir. 2000). "[T]he existence of additional factors causing an injury does not necessarily negate the fact that the defendant's wrong is also the legal cause of the injury," Henrietta P., 331 F.3d at 278 (citation omitted], so long as "the plaintiff can show that the disability was a substantial cause of the exclusion or denial . . . ." Id. at 291. In other words, in order for Plaintiff to prevail, Adam's HIV infection must have constituted a "motivating factor" for Defendants' denial of his admission  [**40] to the basketball camp. Parker, 204 F.3d at 337 (citation omitted). 40 
However, Adam does not have to present direct evidence that his HIV was a significant factor in Defendants' denial of his admission to basketball camp. Rather, Defendants' discriminatory intent or animus "may be inferred from the totality of  [*344]  the circumstances, including the historical background of the decision; the specific sequence of events  [**41] leading up to the challenged decision; and contemporary statements by [Defendants]." Reg'l Econ. Cmty. Action Program, 294 F.3d at 49 (citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted).
Plaintiff argues that, "[e]ven crediting each of [D]efendants' various reasons for denying Adam admission [including the need to provide a separate pool and toilet as well as his secrecy surrounding HIV-seropositivity], none is independent of Adam's HIV status; rather, they are all based on stereotypes and irrational fear about people with HIV." (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 17-23.) Although Adam assumes, arguendo, that Defendants were motivated by side effects of his medications and the claim that Adam missed another summer camp, he states that these concerns do not absolve Defendants of liability so long as HIV was also a motivating factor. (Id. 23-25.) Defendants dismiss Plaintiff's allegations as merely conclusory and therefore an inadequate basis for opposing Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on this issue.
But Defendants' objection is not well founded. Rather, taking Plaintiff's facts to be true and resolving inferences in favor of Plaintiff, record evidence establishes  [**42] that Adam's HIV-seropositivy played a motivating part in DMDC's decision to deny him admission. Testimony from Roberta Katz, as presented in her deposition, demonstrates that part of her concerns about admitting Adam related to the need for a separate pool and bathroom for HIV-positive campers. (See PL.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 89-93, 103-04.) Moreover, Roberta's concerns, also discussed in her deposition, that Mrs. Doe did not provide a full medical history, related specifically to Adam's HIV-seropositivy as well as his HIV medications. (See PL.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 71-72, 76-77, 102-03.) Questions posed to and specific answers received from Levy during the August 20 telephone conversation also focused on Adam's HIV transmission and the alleged heightened risks posed by side effects of his medications. (PL's Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 80-93; PL's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 81-84; PL's Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Notes 1; Pl.'s Ex. G, David Levy Dep. 35-45.) Moreover, Mrs. Doe testified that Roberta expressed concerns about Adam transmitting HIV to others. (See  [**43] PL.'s Ex. H, Jane Doe Dep. 39-41.) This evidence supports the inference that DMDC denied Adam admission because of his disability.
On the other hand, in response to Plaintiff's motion, Defendants have presented no evidence to raise an issue of fact for trial with regard to DMDC's denial of admission. Defendants insist that other considerations led to their decision to deny Adam admission, such as their concern about the side effects of Adam's medications and his alleged absence at an earlier camp. (Pl.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 75-79; Pl.'s Ex. E, Ellen Gloskin Dep. 82-84, 98-100.] But Defendants' asserted alternate justifications for denying Adam admission confirm, rather than counteract, Plaintiff's allegations. Defendants particularly focus on the existence of side effects of antiretroviral medications, and present evidence to this effect. Even assuming the truth of Defendants' allegations, however, the fact that Adam may take medications with certain side effects is inseparable from the fact that Adam is HIV-positive. Discriminating against Adam because of medicinal side effects, therefore, still constitutes discrimination on the basis of Adam's disability. Moreover, undisputed  [**44] facts from the record demonstrate that  [*345]  DMDC's concerns with regard to Plaintiff's medicine relate to risks of his transmission of HIV to other campers, as a result of bleeding that might be caused by his medication. Therefore, this concern is also inseparable from Adam's condition.
As to Adam's alleged illness in June, this illness only influenced DMDC's decision to deny Adam admission in August insofar as it roused suspicion that Adam's HIV infection made him vulnerable to contagious opportunistic infections. Hence, both of these "alternate" justifications are clearly related to Adam's HIV, and thus confirm that the denial of admission was based on Adam's disability. Thus, no reasonable jury could find that HIV was not a substantial factor -- or, indeed, a but-for cause -- in Defendants' decision to deny Adam admittance to DMDC.
DMBA's Intentional Discrimination:
It is not clear from the record, however, that DMDC's intentional discrimination may also be imputed to the DMBA, 41 as it is unclear to the court whether a sufficient relationship existed between DMDC and DMBA so as to hold the latter liable for acts of the former. Therefore, due to the complexities of and necessity for fact-specific  [**45] inquiries concerning business entity relationships, and because the parties have not yet briefed this issue, the court will not grant summary judgment as to DMBA at this time, because a genuinely disputed issue of fact may remain for trial.
* * * *
As a result, on the issue of DMDC's disparate treatment of Adam on the basis of his disability, the court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. The court, however, DENIES Plaintiff's motion as to DMBA. The court also DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on this issue.
Direct Threat Defense:
Finally, the court turns to Defendants' claim that Adam's HIV poses a direct threat to other campers' safety so as to preclude ADA liability. 42 Defendants, however, have not presented the court with evidence of the objective reasonableness of their direct threat determination sufficient to survive summary judgment.
As a threshold legal matter, the ADA allows Defendants to assert an affirmative "direct threat" defense. Specifically, a public accommodation is not "require[d] to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations . . . where such individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(3). The ADA defines "direct threat" as "a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services." Id. Accord 28 C.F.R. § 36.208(b). "To constitute a 'direct threat,' the probability of significant harm must be substantial, constituting more than a remote or slightly increased risk." Hatzakos v. Acme Am. Refrigeration, Inc., No. 03-CV-5428 [*346]  (DLI)(VVP), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49034, at 826-27 (E.D.N.Y. July 6, 2007). [**47]  See also New Directions Treatment Servs. v. City of Reading, 490 F.3d 293, 306 (3d Cir. 2007) ("The purported risk must be substantial, not speculative or remote.")
In making its direct threat determination, a public accommodation must:
make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.
28 C.F.R. § 36.208(c) (emphasis added). Accord Sch. Bd. of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 287-88, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 94 L. Ed. 2d 307 (1987); Lovejoy-Wilson v. Noco Motor Fuel, Inc., 263 F.3d 208, 220 (2d Cir. 2001). These factors provide for the evaluation of objective medical evidence while "protecting others from significant health and safety risks, resulting, for instance, from a contagious disease." Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. See also Arline, 480 U.S. at 287 & n.16 (balancing the rights of disabled individuals while "giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns of [public accommodations] as  [**48] avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks" of the disabled individual "communicating an infectious disease to others"). But the ADA does not sanction "deprivations based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear." Arline, 480 U.S. at 287. The focus is on the objective reasonableness of Defendants' assessment of the significance of the risk of transmission.
In making a determination of objective reasonableness, the fact-finder's responsibility does not involve "independently assess[ing] whether it believes that [Plaintiff himself] posed a direct threat." Jarvis v. Potter, 500 F.3d 1113, 1122 (9th Cir. 2007). Rather, the fact-finder determines the reasonableness of Defendants' actions based upon "reasonable medical judgments of public health authorities." Arline, 480 U.S. at 288. "[0]f special weight and authority" are "views of public health authorities [ ] such as the U.S. Public Health Service ["PHS"], CDC, and the National Institutes of Health ["NIH"]." Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 650 (citations omitted). In other words, in the absence of objective medical evidence to the contrary, the fact-finder views the reasonableness of Defendants' actions in light of the views  [**49] of the CDC/PHS/NIH and similar medical authorities. The factual inquiry looks to available medical evidence, and, in light of this evidence, makes an "individualized determination on the significance of the risk . . . ." Doe v. County of Centre, Pa., 242 F.3d 437, 448 (3d Cir. 2001). See also id. ("Decisions are not permitted to be based on generalizations about the disability but rather must be based on the facts of an individual case . . . The purpose of creating the 'direct threat' standard is to eliminate exclusions which are not based on objective evidence about the individual involved." (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 45) (emphasis omitted)); 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel at 146-47.
Thus the issue presented is whether Defendants have submitted sufficient evidence to permit a jury to conclude that their threat evaluation -- that there was a danger that Adam could transmit his condition to other campers -- was objectively  [*347]  reasonable. A plaintiff like Adam is "not required to prove that he [] poses no risk." Lovejoy-Wilson, 263 F.3d at 220 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 46). In contrast, a defendant "asserting a 'direct threat' as a basis for excluding an individual  [**50] bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the individual poses a significant risk to the health and safety of others." Lockett v. Catalina Channel Express, Inc., 496 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649-50). To survive summary judgment, Defendants have the responsibility to present the court with objective, medical evidence -- such as reliable medical guidelines, literature, or expert testimony -- to establish that their direct threat assessment was reasonable. See, e.g., Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 650-54; Lovejoy-Wilson, 263 F.3d at 220-21.
Plaintiff argues that the direct threat determination cannot rely on stereotypes or unfounded fears, and thus Defendants failed to demonstrate that Adam posed a significant risk. In addition, Plaintiff asserts that there is no "insufficient time" exception to the statutory direct threat analysis, and, even should such an exception exist, that Defendants have: provided no evidence to support their assertions. All medical information was readily available to Defendants, and yet Defendants did not attempt to educate themselves beyond asking one doctor.
Defendants argue that they were not afforded a reasonable time to conduct an  [**51] individualized assessment to make a direct threat determination or to provide reasonable accommodation for that threat. Defendants claim that a small but theoretically-sound risk of transmission can be significant given the heightened danger posed by HIV infection. Moreover, Defendants deny that it was feasible for them to know all information about all diseases, and, claim, thus, it was reasonable for them to rely on Levy's advice.
Defendants, however, have provided the court with no objective, medical evidence to support their threat determination. The only evidence Defendants present relates to the potential side effects of Adam's medications. (See Defs.' Exs. 2-9 in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J.) These exhibits, however, fail to mention "bleeding" in stool or urine as side effects of Adam's medication. In any case, whether Adam had this risk of bleeding is of limited relevance. According to public health authorities' publications available to Defendants in 2004, HIV cannot survive outside the body, and, hence, cannot survive in a swimming pool 43 or on a toilet seat. 44 Moreover, it is  [*348]  highly unlikely that HIV will be transmitted through contact sports. 45 In light of this widespread,  [**52] established medical opinion, 46 unless Defendants can present objective medical evidence to the contrary, no reasonable jury could find that Defendants acted reasonably. Defendants, however, do not provide such evidence.
Nurse Gloskin 47 did provide deposition testimony that HIV in stool can survive in swimming pool water and that HIV can be transmitted by blood on a toilet seat. However, while a health care professional, such as a registered nurse like Gloskin, may disagree with "the prevailing medical consensus," she must provide "a credible scientific basis for deviating from the accepted norm." Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 650. Opinions from health care workers do not constitute objective medical evidence absent such a basis. Id. Defendants, however, have not supported Gloskin's position with any medical evidence. The mere existence of "possible" avenues of transmission, presented "without a documented showing," "does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to direct threat." Abbott v. Bragdon, 163 F.3d 87, 90 (1st, Cir. 1998). Accord Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Court, 840 F.2d 701, 707-09 (9th Cir. 1988);  [**55] N.Y. State Ass'n of Retarded Children v. Carey, 612 F.2d 644, 650 (2d Cir. 1979).
Moreover, Gloskin, as a registered nurse had her own duty to evaluate the risk. 48 A health professional has a "duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective, scientific information available 49 to [her]" and, accordingly, her  [*349]  "belief that a significant risk existed, even if maintained in good faith, w[ill] not relieve [DMDC] of liability." Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. Thus, Gloskin's own "state of mind  [**56] [does not] excuse discrimination without regard to the objective reasonableness of [her] actions." Id. at 650.
Defendants also argue that Levy's advice constituted "objective" evidence on which they could rely. But Defendants are only partly correct. It is correct that a public accommodation can "consult with individual physicians as objective third-party experts." Bragdon, 524 U.S. at 649. But even assuming that Levy provided the advice ascribed to him by Defendants, Defendants have still failed to support the reasonableness of that advice  [**57] with objective medical evidence sufficient to raise an issue of material fact. While "obtaining a physician's detailed assessment and then acting in accordance with it can be persuasive evidence that a [public accommodation] has based its decision on an individualized inquiry," such a public accommodation "cannot slavishly defer to a physician's opinion without first pausing to assess the objective reasonableness of the physician's conclusions." Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 31 (1st Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). See also Verzeni v. Potter, 109 F. App'x 485, 491-92 (3d Cir. 2004); Holiday v. City of Chattanooga, 206 F.3d 637, 645 (6th Cir. 2000). Nor should the court, in assessing the objective reasonableness of Defendants' actions, "defer to an individual doctor's opinion that is neither based on the individualized inquiry mandated by the ADA nor supported by objective scientific and medical evidence." Holiday, 206 F.3d at 645. Thus, Defendants' interpretation of their conversation with Levy, even if credited, does not provide a basis for contradicting the widespread, established medical opinion applicable here.
That Defendants had less than a week to make their  [**58] decision does not alter the court's conclusion. It is correct that, in certain circumstances, courts may apply a lower standard of reasonableness to a non-medically trained person with a very short time period in which to make a decision. See, e.g., Lockett, 496 F.3d at 1067 (determining a direct threat assessment made by a boat trip ticket seller to be reasonable and in good faith, given the ticket seller's limited time (i.e., close to the time of the boat's departure) to make the decision and his lack of health care training). But this is not such a case. Here, Defendants had several days to make their determination; Roberta Katz and Nurse Gloskin learned of Adam's HIV infection five or six days before the beginning of camp. (Pl.'s Ex. C, Roberta Katz Dep. 64-67, 69-70, 110; Defs.' Answers, Interrog. 17.) More important, however, as mentioned above, Gloskin had substantial medical training and experience with HIV. 50 In short, regardless of the fact that Gloskin had less than a week to assess Adam's  [*350]  condition, based on the record presented here, she should have known that Adam did not pose "significant" risks to other children.
The court agrees that Defendants were obligated to protect other campers from a very serious, life-threatening viral infection. But this obligation does not excuse Defendants' actions when based on unsubstantiated fears, Arline, 480 U.S. at 287, especially in the case of a decision partly made by a health care professional with both extensive experience with HIV and several days in which to confirm her medical opinions and educate other decision makers.
The court recognizes the inherent difficulties in this situation. Mrs. Doe, understandably concerned to protect her son from discrimination, was not forthcoming about his  [**60] condition. It is more than unfortunate that Defendants -- faced with what they may have perceived as Mrs. Does' reticence -- may have felt that they lacked the specific information necessary to make a direct threat assessment. But, as a legal matter, Defendants' feelings cannot relieve them of their duty to base a threat determination on objective medical evidence. For these reasons, as to direct threat, the court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, and DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.

IV. Adam's NYHRL Claim for Declaratory Relief
The elements of a prima facie case for ADA claims are also applicable in claims under the NYHRL. 51 Adams v. Master Carvers of Jamestown, Ltd., 91 F. App'x 718, 725 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Reeves v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., 140 F.3d 144, 154-57 (2d Cir. 1998)). Therefore, insofar as Plaintiff has established his entitlement to summary judgment as to his ADA claim, he is also entitled to summary judgment under the NYHRL.

VI. Conclusion
In light of the foregoing, the court hereby
1. DISMISSES Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief; and
2. DISMISSES Defendants' defense of unclean hands; and
3. GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment of ADA and NYHRL declaratory relief, as to "disability" and "public accommodation"; and
4. GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment of ADA and NYHRL declaratory relief, as to DMDC's discrimination "on the basis of" Adam's disability; and
5. Otherwise DENIES Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment; and
6. DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety.
The parties are directed to submit, by February 15, 2010, briefs regarding the liability of DMBA. The parties may each respond to the other's respective filings by March 1, 2010.
It is SO ORDERED.
