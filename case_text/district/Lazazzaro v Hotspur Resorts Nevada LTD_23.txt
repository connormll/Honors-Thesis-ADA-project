Opinion


ORDER
Presently before the court is Hotspur Resorts Nevada, Ltd. d/b/a JW Marriott Las Vegas Resort & Spa's ("defendant") motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 44). Irasari Lazazzaro ("plaintiff") filed a response (ECF No. 45), to which defendant replied (ECF No. 46).

I. Background
The instant action arises from defendant's alleged disability discrimination failure to accommodate in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA").
In April 2012, defendant hired plaintiff as a pantry cook. (ECF No. 10 at 2). On February 27, 2015, plaintiff had bone fusion surgery on her right foot. (ECF No. 10 at 2). The doctor placed a walking boot on plaintiff's foot and instructed plaintiff to stay off her feet for three months. (ECF No. 10 at 2-3). Plaintiff requested a Family Medical Leave of Absence ("FMLA"), which defendant approved on February 24, 2015. [*2]  (ECF No. 10 at 3).
Plaintiff alleges that her doctor completed family medical leave paperwork estimating that plaintiff would be unable to work until May 27, 2015. (ECF No. 10 at 3). Plaintiff further alleges that she called human resources every three weeks to report her recovery progress as required to continue receiving disability income. (ECF No. 10 at 3). Plaintiff alleges that defendant never inquired about her return date during these calls. (ECF No. 10 at 3). As such, plaintiff "assumed that [defendant] expected [plaintiff] back to work on May 27, 2015." (ECF No. 10 at 3).
About a week before May 27, 2015, plaintiff called defendant asking for her schedule upon her return from medical leave. (ECF No. 10 at 3). Defendant informed plaintiff that her employment had been terminated effective May 18, 2015, because her family medical leave exhausted and plaintiff failed to contact defendant as to when she would return. (ECF No. 10 at 3). On May 21, 2015, defendant sent plaintiff a letter memorializing the conversation. (ECF No. 10 at 3).
On March 3, 2017, plaintiff filed the original complaint (ECF No. 1), which she subsequently amended on April 12, 2017 (ECF No. 6), and then again [*3]  on May 31, 2017 (ECF No. 10). The second amended complaint alleges one cause of action against defendant for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate in violation of the ADA. (ECF No. 10).
In the instant motion, defendant moves for summary judgment, arguing that it did not terminate plaintiff because of her disability and that plaintiff never requested an accommodation. (ECF No. 44).

II. Legal Standard
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow summary judgment when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A principal purpose of summary judgment is "to isolate and dispose of factually unsupported claims." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986).
For purposes of summary judgment, disputed factual issues should be construed in favor of the nonmoving party. Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed., 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990). However, to withstand summary judgment, the nonmoving party must "set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Id.
In determining summary judgment, a court applies a burden-shifting analysis. "When the party moving for summary judgment [*4]  would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. In such a case, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case." C.A.R. Transp. Brokerage Co. v. Darden Rests., Inc., 213 F.3d 474, 480 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).
By contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party can meet its burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence to negate an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323-24. If the moving party fails to meet its initial burden, summary judgment must be denied and the court need not consider the nonmoving party's evidence. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).
If the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the burden then shifts to the opposing party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). The opposing party need not establish a dispute of material fact conclusively in its favor. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir. 1987). It is sufficient that [*5]  "the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." Id.
In other words, the nonmoving party cannot avoid summary judgment by relying solely on conclusory allegations that are unsupported by factual data. See Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989). Instead, the opposition must go beyond the assertions and allegations of the pleadings and set forth specific facts by producing competent evidence that shows a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.
At summary judgment, a court's function is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth, but to determine whether a genuine dispute exists for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). The evidence of the nonmovant is "to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Id. at 255. But if the evidence of the nonmoving party is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. See id. at 249-50.
The Ninth Circuit has held that information contained in an inadmissible form may still be considered for summary judgment if the information itself would be admissible at trial. Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Block v. City of Los Angeles, 253 F.3d 410, 418-19 (9th Cir. 2001) ("To survive summary judgment, a party does not necessarily have to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible [*6]  at trial, as long as the party satisfies the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56.")).

III. Discussion
The ADA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . job training[ ] and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The statutory definition of "discrimination" includes an employer's failure to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified employee. U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 396 (2002) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)).
"Once an employee requests an accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process with the employee to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation." U.S. E.E.O.C. v. UPS Supply Chain Sols., 620 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002)) (alteration, ellipses, and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Although the general rule is that an employee must request an accommodation, if "an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation under the ADA to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations." Humphrey v. Mem'l Hosps. Ass'n, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has clarified as follows:
The exception to the general rule that an employee must make an initial request applies, however, only when the employer [*7]  (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2) knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation.
Brown v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 246 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation and quotation marks omitted).
"Reasonable accommodations are mechanisms to remove barriers or provide assistance to disabled individuals so that they can perform the 'essential functions' of employment positions." Cripe v. City of San Jose, 261 F.3d 877, 889 (9th Cir. 2001); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9). "A leave of absence for medical treatment may be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1135-36 (citing 29 C.F.R. 1630 app. § 1630.2(o)). The Ninth Circuit has held that "where a leave of absence would reasonably accommodate an employee's disability and permit him, upon his return, to perform the essential functions of the job, that employee is otherwise qualified under the ADA." Id. (citing Nunes, 164 F.3d at 1247).
Thus, to establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination and failure to accommodate under the ADA, plaintiff must establish: (1) that she is a disabled person within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that she is qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation; and (3) that [*8]  she suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability. Allen v. Pacific Bell, 348 F.3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003); Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir. 1999).
As defendants properly note, the Ninth Circuit addressed failure-to-accommodate and unlawful-discharge claims in Humphrey and held as follows:
Unlike a simple failure to accommodate claim, an unlawful discharge claim requires a showing that the employer terminated the employee because of his disability. Often the two claims, are, from a practical standpoint, the same. For the consequence of the failure to accommodate is, as here, frequently an unlawful termination.
Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139. Therefore, the court's analysis regarding the failure to accommodate claim is dispositive of the unlawful discharge claim as well.
For the purposes of this motion, the court assumes—without deciding—that plaintiff was disabled within the meaning of the ADA. Here, the parties agree that plaintiff never requested an accommodation. (See ECF Nos. 44; 45; 46). Although plaintiff contends that she "assumed that [defendant] expected her back to work on May 28, 2015," (ECF No. 45 at 7), she does not dispute that plaintiff approved her FMLA request only for February 27, 2015, to May 15, 2015, (ECF No. 44 at 5). Instead, plaintiff argues that defendant was obligated to [*9]  reasonably accommodate her disability because "[d]efendant knew that [p]laintiff needed her leave of absence extended through May 27, 2015, to fully recover from her right foot surgery on February 27, 2015." (ECF No. 45 at 15). Plaintiff notes that defendant "had a policy to grant an employee 30 days of personal leave if needed." Id. at 3.
But plaintiff does not argue that defendant knew or should have known that her disability prevented her from requesting a reasonable accommodation. See Brown, 246 F.3d at 1188. To the contrary, plaintiff notes that she "called into the human resources department at JW Marriott about every three weeks to tell them about the progress of her recovery . . . ." (ECF No. 45 at 7). At no time during any of those calls to human resources did she request additional leave or a reasonable accommodation.
Even assuming plaintiff meets the requirements of Brown such that she did not need to request an accommodation, defendant could not have placed plaintiff on unpaid personal leave without her request.
The Ninth Circuit's decision in Mois v. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, although not binding on this court, is instructive on this point. See Mois v. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, 715 Fed. App'x. 600 (9th Cir. 2017). In Mois, the employer—who was specifically notified of the employee's need for an accommodation—failed [*10]  to engage in the interactive process and placed the employee on unpaid leave. Id. at 601. Id. The Ninth Circuit held that placing the employee on unpaid leave was not a reasonable accommodation. Id. (citing Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that unpaid medical leave may be a reasonable accommodation where requested by an employee); Arizanovska v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 682 F.3d 698, 704 (7th Cir. 2012) (holding, in the context of a retaliation claim, that "[b]eing forced to take an unpaid leave of absence" is an adverse employment action)).
Accordingly, plaintiff must have requested that her personal leave be used to cover the 12 days between her FMLA time running out and her purported May 27, 2015, return date. At the very least, plaintiff must have generally requested an accommodation. Plaintiff made no such request.
As a result, plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law, and summary judgment is appropriate. Defendant's motion is granted.

IV. Conclusion
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that defendant's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 44) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED.
The clerk is instructed to enter judgment and close the case accordingly.
DATED February 26, 2020.
