Opinion



MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
SHERIDAN, U.S.D.J.
This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 19). The primary issues before the Court are whether Plaintiff requested and was provided with sign language interpreting services at his job; and, if so, under what circumstances was he provided with such interpreting services. On October 2, 2019, the Court heard oral argument.
For the reasons stated below, Defendant's Motion is denied.

I. Factual and Procedural Background
Plaintiff Stephen Hwaga ("Plaintiff" or "Hwaga") is deaf. (Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (SOMF), ¶ 1, ECF No. 19-1). Plaintiff was born in Kenya and is fluent in both American Sign Language ("ASL") and Kenyan Sign Language. (See Declaration of Andrew Rozynski, Ex. H, Hwaga Resume, ECF No. 21-11). Plaintiff understands a little bit of written English and can communicate [*2]  basic words through email communication and text messaging. (Def.'s Br. in Support of Summary Judgment, Ex. 19, Deposition of Stephen Hwaga ("Hwaga Dep."), Sept. 27, 2018, 11:4-20, ECF No. 19-2).
Plaintiff was hired by Defendant Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (the "Hospital") in January 2011, started work at the Hospital on February 14, 2011, and became a full-time employee in June 2011. (Def.'s SOMF ¶ 2). At the Hospital, Plaintiff is an Environmental Services Aide, where he provides janitorial and cleaning services, and works the night shifts. (Id. at TR 3, 5). Plaintiff understands that his job responsibilities include various tasks related to cleaning the hospital. (Id. at ¶ 15).
Shortly after Plaintiff was hired, he attended an orientation at the Hospital and was provided a sign language interpreter at the orientation to help explain what his work responsibilities would be. (Id. at ¶¶ 6-7). The orientation covered a series of topics listed on a checklist, for which Plaintiff signed off on acknowledging his receipt and understanding of the items on the checklist, including an Employee Handbook, which listed, inter alia, his job description. (Id. at ¶ 8).
At all relevant times, [*3]  Plaintiff was represented by a Union at the Hospital. (Id. at ¶ 11).
Lisa Freeman ("Ms. Freeman") is an Employment Specialist and worked for Lexington Vocational Services Center ("Lexington Vocational"). (Id. at ¶ 17). In her official role, Ms. Freeman served as Plaintiff's job coach, where she helped Plaintiff learn to perform his work duties effectively and according to the Hospital's specifications. (See Def.'s SOMF ¶ 18; Freeman Dep. 104:8-22; 120:3-7). On occasion, however, she interpreted for Plaintiff at meetings with the Hospital. (Id.). Ms. Freeman is reasonably fluent in ASL and has completed college-level coursework in ASL, but does not hold any formal certifications or licenses in sign language. (Rozynski Decl., Ex. A, Deposition of Lisa Freeman ("Freeman Dep."), Dec. 11, 2018, 39:13-19, ECF No. 21-4). Although it appears that Lexington Vocational did not formally authorize Ms. Freeman to provide Plaintiff with sign language interpreting services, she nonetheless provided these services to him more than ten times. (See Freeman Dep. 90:5-6).
From the time of his hire in 2011 through the fall of 2016, Plaintiff's job performance met the Hospital's expectations and he regularly [*4]  received strong performance evaluations. (Def.'s SOMF 191 20-26). Further, at the time the Hospital filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff had never been fired, demoted, or suspended by the Hospital and, to date, remains its employee. (Id. at ¶¶ 27, 28).
To the contrary, sometime in November or early December of 2016, Plaintiff's direct supervisor, Joseph Owusu, became concerned with Plaintiff's work performance. (Id. at ¶ 43). Specifically, Owusu wrote Plaintiff several notes expressing concern that he could not find Plaintiff during his shift, did not know what work Plaintiff had completed during his shift, and that Plaintiff appeared to be leaving the hospital before the end of his shift. (Id. at ¶ 45). Owusu elevated his concerns to Michael Hossary, Director of Environmental Services ("Director Hossary"). (Id. at ¶ 47).
Over the next few months (and accompanied by some bickering between Director Hossary and Ms. Freeman), the Hospital attempted to schedule several meetings with the appropriate personnel to discuss Plaintiff's job performance and work expectations. (Id. at ¶¶ 47-64). Plaintiff allegedly requested a sign language interpreter for these meetings. (Id. at ¶ 46). [*5]  At one point in late 2016, Director Hossary suggested to Ms. Freeman that the Hospital could use Video Remote Interpreting (VRI), which is an electronic, on-demand interpreting service for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, to conduct the meeting regarding Plaintiff's job performance. (Id. at ¶ 48). Ms. Freeman responded that Plaintiff would need a live (human) interpreter for this meeting, and that she (Ms. Freeman) would not interpret for Plaintiff since she was only Plaintiff's job coach. (Id. at ¶ 49).
Since a meeting had still not yet been convened with all of the interested parties, Mr. Hossary sent the following letter dated February 16, 2017, to Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff's job performance:
It has come to my attention that your performance has been declining over the past few months. In addition your supervisors continue to express frustration over your continued refusal to follow instructions which you have done well in the past, they also state that they cannot reach you during your shift or locate you in your assigned work area. It is the expectation as an environmental services aide that you perform any task given to you on your assigned day to work. I have authorized [*6]  your job coach and our training manager to do personal re-training of your duties. This will be a classroom training conducted over the course of the next 30 days. Once this is complete, you will be expected to comply with all hospital rules and regulations as well as department policies. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
(Certification of Mark Blunda ("Blunda Cert.") in Support of Def.'s Mot. for Summary Judgment, Ex. 13, Hossary Letter to Hwaga, ECF No. 19-2).
On February 16, 2017, a meeting was held with Plaintiff, Director Hossary, Plaintiff's union representative, and Ms. Freeman to discuss Plaintiff's job performance, but the meeting was postponed because Ms. Freeman stated, once again, that she would not serve as Plaintiff's interpreter1. (Def.'s SOMF ¶ 66). On February 23, 2017, a meeting with Plaintiff, Director Hossary, and a Hospital Human Resources representative was convened and a third-party interpreter was used. (Id. at ¶ 69). Further email communications were exchanged between Director Hossary and Lexington Vocational Services, specifically Jennifer Quigley, the Program Director at Lexington Vocational, regarding Lexington Vocational's and Ms. Freeman's [*7]  roles in providing interpreting services for Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 71, 72).
On March 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that his direct supervisor, Joseph Owusu, accused him of neglecting his work duties and cheating on his timesheets. (Id. at ¶ 73). A few weeks later, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter indicating that it was "unable to conclude that the information obtained established a violation of the statutes." (Id. at ¶ 76; Blunda Cert., Ex. 11, EEOC Documents, ECF No. 19-2).
On June 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in U.S. District Court. (Def.'s SOMF ¶ 77).
The claims in Plaintiff's Complaint are muddled. In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleged numerous disability discrimination claims under state and federal laws, (see Compl. at Claims I, II, and III), and the Hospital responded to those claims. (See Def.'s Br. in Support of Mot. for Summary Judgment, at 19-27, ECF No. 19-3). Yet, in Plaintiff's Opposition Brief (and at oral argument), Plaintiff does not address all of the claims asserted in his Complaint, but instead focuses solely on his failure-to-accommodate claim under state and federal [*8]  law. Within that response, Plaintiff notes "the sole issue is whether the Hospital discriminated against Mr. Hwaga by failing to accommodate his deafness under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and NJLAD." (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. Summary Judgment, 9, ECF No. 21). Plaintiff concedes that his other claims, retaliation and aiding and abetting, are not at issue in this case. (Id. at 9). Accordingly, the retaliation and aiding and abetting claims are moot and withdrawn, and this Court will solely focus on the failure-to-accommodate claim.
Plaintiff's chief allegation appears to be that, before and after 2016, he repeatedly requested, but was denied, live interpreter services for various meetings in which Plaintiff was required to participate. (Pl.'s Counterstatement of Material Facts, ¶¶ 1, 2, ECF No. 21-1). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that the Hospital failed to accommodate his deafness and engage in the interactive process with him by failing to provide live interpreters for staff meetings, training sessions, yearly evaluations, supervisor meetings, and discussions about scheduling and his workload. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 11, 16). Plaintiff acknowledges that the Hospital [*9]  occasionally provided him with VRI interpretation services, but he has questioned the quality and efficacy of the video interpretation. (Def.'s SOMF 83).
Without interpreters present at these various meetings, Plaintiff alleges that he was isolated, ignored, and faced protracted humiliation from being unable to fully understand his workplace. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 7).

II. Legal Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) when the moving party demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the evidence establishes the moving party's entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). A factual dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant, and it is material if, under the substantive law, it would affect the outcome of the suit. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Ullrich v. United States Secy. of Veterans Affairs, 457 F. App'x 132, 136 (3d Cir. 2012). In considering a motion for summary judgment, a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in any weighing of the evidence; instead, the nonmoving party's evidence "is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor." Marino v. Indus. Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255).
Once the moving party has satisfied its initial burden, the party opposing the motion must establish that a genuine issue as to a material [*10]  fact exists. Jersey Cent. Power & Light Co. v. Lacey Twp., 772 F.2d 1103, 1109 (3d Cir. 1985). The party opposing the motion for summary judgment cannot rest on mere allegations and instead must present actual evidence that creates a genuine issue as to a material fact for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Express, Inc., 54 F.3d 1125, 1130-31 (3d Cir. 1995); see also Ullrich, 457 F. App'x at 136 ("[T]he party opposing summary judgment must support each essential element of the opposition with concrete evidence in the record."). "[U]nsupported allegations . . . and pleadings are insufficient to repel summary judgment." Schoch v. First Fidelity Bancorp., 912 F.2d 654, 657 (3d Cir. 1990); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (requiring nonmoving party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial).
Moreover, only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law will preclude the entry of summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48. If a court determines, "after drawing all inferences in favor of [the non-moving party], and making all credibility determinations in his favor — that no reasonable jury could find for him, summary judgment is appropriate." Alevras v. Tacopina, 226 F. App'x 222, 227 (3d Cir. 2007).

III. Discussion

A. Disability Discrimination Under the ADA2 and the LAD
Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits employers from "discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee [*11]  compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). The New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD) similarly prohibits "any unlawful discrimination against any person because such person is or has been at any time disabled or any unlawful employment practice against such person, unless the nature and extent of the disability reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment." N.J. Stat. Ann. 10:5-4.1.
In the absence of direct evidence, a plaintiff may prove discrimination under the ADA and LAD through the burden-shifting framework set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). See Tourtellotte v. Eli Lilly & Co., 636 F. App'x 831, 841 (3d Cir. 2016); Maher v. Abbott Labs., Civil Action No. 11-5161 (PGS) (TJB), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *28 (D.N.J. Dec. 4, 2013). Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 842; Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *28.
Thus, to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA and the LAD, a plaintiff must first demonstrate that: (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA and the LAD; (2) he is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that he has suffered an otherwise adverse employment action because of his disability. McGlone v. Phila. Gas Works, 733 F. App'x 606, 610-11 (3d Cir. 2018); Gaul v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 134 F.3d 576, 580 (3d Cir. 1998); Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *29.
The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff's deafness constitutes a disability under the ADA or LAD, nor do they dispute [*12]  whether he was qualified to perform the cleaning and other janitorial duties of his job at the Hospital, especially since Plaintiff has performed his job satisfactorily for many years. There is an open question, however, about whether Plaintiff experienced an "adverse employment action."3

B. Failure to Accommodate Under the ADA and the LAD
Both the ADA and the LAD require an employer that is a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees, unless to do so would cause undue hardship.4 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a); N.J. Admin. Code § 13:13-2.5(b); see also Solomon v. Sch. Dist., 532 F. App'x 154, 157 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting the ADA). The elements of a prima facie discrimination case vary depending on the cause of action.
Therefore, to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under a failure-to-accommodate cause of action under the ADA and LAD5, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the employer knew about the employee's disability; (2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith." See Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 849 (quoting [*13]  Taylor, 184 F.3d at 317); see Armstrong v. Burdette Tomlin Mem'l Hosp., 438 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir. 2006) (applying the same four ADA factors to an LAD failure-to-accommodate claim); Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *29 (same); Royster v. NJ State Police, 227 N.J. 482, 499 (2017).
Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, if the plaintiff successfully meets the requirements of a prima facie case of an accommodation claim, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory or nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 831; Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *29. If the employer produces such a reason, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's nonretaliatory or nondiscriminatory explanation is merely a pretext for the discrimination or retaliation. Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 831; Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *30-31.

C. Adverse Employment Actions Under the ADA and LAD
The Court notes that this fact pattern is unusual because Plaintiff has not suffered an "adverse employment action" in the strict sense that he has not been terminated, suspended, or demoted from his environmental services position at the Hospital. Instead, he alleges that he could not understand fully the content of various business meetings because the Hospital failed to provide him with a sign language interpreter. Based on the discussion below, an employer's failure to accommodate an employee's disability is, in itself, an "adverse action" or, in the alternative, [*14]  no "adverse action" is required to establish a prima facie case of a failure-to-accommodate claim.
i. "Adverse Employment Action" Under the LAD
The New Jersey Supreme Court in Victor v. State directly addressed the "adverse employment action" issue, and noted that a scenario such as the one before this Court would be unconventional: "[I]t is difficult for us to envision factual circumstances in which the failure to accommodate will not yield an adverse consequence." 203 N.J. 383, 421 (2010). Although the Victor Court did not directly resolve the question of whether a plaintiff can assert a "freestanding" failure-to-accommodate claim without any adverse employment action, it nonetheless indicated, in dicta, that in some cases, "there may be individuals with disabilities who request reasonable accommodations, whose requests are denied, and who continue to toil on," and thus "we therefore cannot entirely foreclose the possibility of circumstances that would give rise to a claim for failure to accommodate even without an identifiable adverse employment consequence." Id. at 421-22.
In addition, a few months ago, on June 11, 2019, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, held that a plaintiff is not required to allege [*15]  an adverse employment action to establish a prima facie claim under the LAD for failure to accommodate. Richter v. Oakland Bd. of Educ., 459 N.J. Super. 400, 416-17 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2019). In Richter, the Appellate Division concluded that the plaintiff's LAD claim against her employer for failure to accommodate her diabetes disability should not have been dismissed on summary judgment based on a lack of adverse employment action. Richter, 459 N.J. Super. At 416. The New Jersey Supreme Court has not had occasion to re-address this precise issue since Richter.
ii. "Adverse Employment Action" in the Third Circuit
Meanwhile, the Third Circuit has not directly addressed the "adverse employment action" issue, but has stated that an "adverse employment action" must be "serious and tangible enough to alter an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 842 (emphasis added).
There is case law to support the proposition, that an employee's "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" can reasonably include, as Plaintiff alleges here, the ability to understand fully the content and affairs of business meetings. See, e.g., Vardon v. FCA US LLC, Civil Case No. 16-11807, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37109, at *22 (E.D. Mich. March 7, 2018); Campbell v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1291 (N.D. Okla. 2003), adopted by, 272 F. Supp. 2d 1276 (N.D. Okla. 2003); Majtan v. Week, CIVIL ACTION NO. 99-718, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13817, at *19 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 21, 2000).
The Third Circuit has also suggested that a reasonable accommodation claim can serve as a stand-alone claim. See, e.g., Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 761 (3d Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 961, 125 S. Ct. 1725, 161 L. Ed. 2d 602 (2005); Ruggiero v. Mount Nittany Med. Ctr., 736 F. App'x 35, 39 (3d Cir. 2018) (citation omitted); [*16]  Yovtcheva v. City of Phila. Water Dep't, 518 F. App'x 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).
Moreover, in enacting the ADA, Congress found that "physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(1). Indeed, EEOC regulations state that "it is unlawful for a covered entity not to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee with a disability . . ." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a).
Therefore, under the ADA, a failure-to-accommodate claim can be considered an "adverse action" or, in the alternative, no "adverse action" is required to establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate.

D. Analysis
In this case, because Plaintiff raises genuine disputes of material facts as to whether he requested and Defendant provided him with sign language interpreting services, summary judgment must be denied.
Again, for a plaintiff to succeed on a failure-to-accommodate claim, he must prove (1) that his employer knew about his disability; (2) that he requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good [*17]  faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) he could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith. Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 849.
Here, the parties do not dispute whether the Hospital knew that Hwaga was deaf. (See generally Def.'s Summary Judgment Br.; Pl.'s Opp'n Br.). Therefore, this Court will focus on the remaining elements, chiefly whether Hwaga requested a sign language interpreter for his deafness, and whether the Hospital put forth a good-faith effort to provide him with a sign language interpreter.
1. Plaintiff Raises Genuine Issues as to Whether He Requested a Reasonable Accommodation
Summary judgment must be denied in this case because a reasonable jury could conclude that Hwaga requested that a sign language interpreter be provided to him at certain work meetings.
The second prong of a failure-to-accommodate claim requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that he requested accommodations or assistance for his disability. Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 849. Under the ADA, an employer has a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities. Lewis v. Univ. of Pa., No. 18-2706, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 23818, at *3 (3d Cir. Aug. 9, 2019). The employer can breach this duty by failing to provide an accommodation that is reasonable or by failing to engage in a good [*18]  faith interactive process6 to identify accommodations. Lewis, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 23818, at *3; Taylor, 184 F.3d at 296. An employee has no obligation to unilaterally identify and propose a reasonable accommodation. Lewis, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 23818, at *3; Taylor, 184 F.3d at 315-17.
The term "reasonable accommodation" under the ADA means, inter alia, "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable an individual with a disability who is qualified to perform the essential functions of that position," and "[m]odifications or adjustments that enable a covered entity's employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by its other similarly situated employees without disabilities." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(ii) and (iii). Similarly, under the LAD, examples of reasonable accommodations include "[m]aking facilities used by employees readily accessible and usable by people with disabilities" and the "acquisition or modification of equipment or devices." N.J. Admin. Code § 13:13-2.5(b)(1)(i) and (iii). A "reasonable accommodation" "may include the provision of . . . interpreters." See 42 U.S.C. §12111(9)(B); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(iii)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).
In this case, the Hospital argues that Hwaga cannot identify "a single instance" in which he requested, but was denied, [*19]  an interpreter for a specific meeting or training that he was required to attend. (Def.'s Summary Judgment Br. 22; see also Def.'s Reply Br., 5, ECF No. 22). The Hospital further asserts that Hwaga testified that he was entitled to a live interpreter only for "special occasions" or when there was "a problem," but cannot identify the "special occasions" or "problems" for which he requested and was denied an interpreter. (Id. at 23). At oral argument, Defendant's counsel stressed, once again, that although it may be true that Hwaga requested an interpreter for certain meetings, he nonetheless cannot identify the specifics circumstances (the "who, what, and when") of such requests.
In response, Hwaga alleges that he and Ms. Freeman repeatedly requested ASL interpreters to understand company policies, to participate in workplace functions, and to interact with supervisors at weekly staff meetings, but that the Hospital ignored many of these requests. (See Pl.'s Opp'n Br. at 11, 13, 15). Hwaga points out that one of the "special occasions" for which he requested, but was denied, an interpreter was to discuss with Human Resources "different work responsibilities" or "something new on the [*20]  job." (Hwaga Dep. 15:7-12).
For example, Hwaga testified that he had a lot of work and was being moved around to different locations to perform his work, and therefore wanted to discuss with his supervisor his work schedule. (Hwaga Dep. 83:23-25; 84:8-10). Hwaga stated that he "repeatedly" requested from his supervisor an interpreter so that he and his supervisor could discuss his work schedule and responsibilities, but that his supervisor refused to provide an interpreter. (Id. at 12-14). In addition, during his deposition, when asked what "important" situations Hwaga believed he had a right to an interpreter Hwaga stated: "Anytime there was a problem with the supervisor or communication was needed with my supervisors, I have a right to have an interpreter to discuss those." (Id. at 87:15-18).
Also, Ms. Freeman testified during her deposition that she made repeated requests to Mr. Hossary that Hwaga be provided an interpreter. (Freeman Dep. 111:25 — 112:1-3). For instance, she stated that she requested that the Hospital provide Hwaga an interpreter for his "weekly meetings" and that she was unable to interpret for Hwaga because, according to her job description, she is a job coach and [*21]  not "technically" an interpreter. (Id. at 104:3-9). Ms. Freeman stated that she made these requests to Director Hossary as well as to other supervisors Hwaga had over the years. (Id. at 107:12-13). Ms. Freeman also testified that, at one point, she asked William Paladeau, a former HR Manager at the Hospital, to provide interpreting services for Hwaga, but an interpreter was never provided. (Id. at 110:2-11).
Furthermore, Ms. Freeman stated that in a "disciplinary" meeting with Hwaga, Director Hossary, and herself (in which Ms. Freeman was interpreting for Hwaga) to discuss Hwaga's declining work performance, it came to her attention that some of the "rules" or "directions" that he apparently was not following were "directly related to his training that he never had an interpreter for." (Id. at 100:23-24 — 101:1-3).
Moreover, Hwaga testified that sometime around 2015, one of his supervisors accused him of "lying down" while on the job7 and he was given extra work responsibilities; in response, he informed his senior manager that he needed an interpreter and also asked someone at the Hospital to call Ms. Freeman to assist him with these issues. (Hwaga Dep. 55:14 — 56:19). Hwaga stated that [*22]  he sent a text message to his supervisor to make this request, but could not produce a copy of the text message. (Id. at 58:13-20). Hwaga further indicated that he has text messages from around December 2016 in which he requested to Mr. Hossary his need for an interpreter (it is unclear precisely for which purpose), but that the Hospital never responded. (Id. at 92-11-12). Yet, Hwaga apparently lost those text messages. (See id. at 92:16 ("They're lost. They're gone.")). Plaintiff also stated that he wrote (on paper) to his direct supervisor, Joseph Owusu, about his need for an interpreter; yet, Plaintiff does not have copies of those notes. (Id. at 95:12-15).
In their briefs and during oral argument, the parties discussed two cases, Vardon v. FCA US LLC, Civil Case No. 16-11807, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37109 (E.D. Mich. March 7, 2018), and Majtan v. Weck, CIVIL ACTION NO. 99-718, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13817 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 22, 2000), where both courts in those cases denied summary judgment to the employer-defendants in failure-to-accommodate causes of actions similar to the one before this Court. In both cases, the plaintiffs, who were deaf or hard-of-hearing, identified specific instances where they requested from their respective employers sign language interpreters for various meetings. See Majtan, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13817, at *5, *16; Vardon, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37109, at *5-8.
In this case, unlike the specific requests the plaintiffs made in Vardon and Majtan [*23] , it is true that the Hwaga lacks much specificity concerning exactly when and for what meetings he requested that the Hospital provide him with an interpreter. Nevertheless, he and Ms. Freeman identified a few instances where he purportedly requested, but was not provided, an interpreter for certain meetings and interactions with his supervisor(s). Therefore, drawing all inferences in favor of Hwaga, a reasonable jury could find that Hwaga made, and the Hospital denied, his requests for a sign language interpreter. See Majtan, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13817, at *16 ("There is evidence that plaintiff gave defendant sufficient notice of his disability and requested accommodation in the form of a sign language interpreter[.]"). Accordingly, Hwaga has raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether he requested an interpreter, and thus summary judgment must be denied.
2. Plaintiff Raises Genuine Issues of Fact About Whether the Hospital Engaged in the Interactive Process to Provide Him with an Interpreter
As Plaintiff has demonstrated that a genuine dispute exists concerning whether he requested an accommodation, there is also a genuine issue of material fact about the remaining two elements of his claim: whether the Hospital [*24]  made a good faith effort to assist the Hwaga in seeking an interpreter, and whether Hwaga could have been reasonably accommodated but for the Hospital's lack of good faith. See Tourtellotte, 636 F. App'x at 849.
To prevail on a failure-to-accommodate claim, Hwaga must also prove that the Hospital did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations, and that he could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith. Id.
As stated, an employer has a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities, unless to do so would cause the employer undue hardship. Lewis, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 23818, at *3; 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.9(a); N.J. Admin. Code § 13:13-2.5(b). EEOC regulations state that "[t]o determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation it may be necessary for [an employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (emphasis added); see also Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *49 (quoting the EEOC regulations). Through this process, the employer should "identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). Although there is no affirmative requirement that an employer participate in an interactive process, the [*25]  EEOC recommends that an employer do so. See Elizabeth O'Connor Tomlinson, Cause of Action for Failure to Make Reasonable Accommodation in Workplace Under Americans with Disabilities Act, § 18 Practice and Procedure (2019).
The Third Circuit has stated that "[t]he interactive process, as its name implies, requires the employer to take some initiative." Taylor, 184 F.3d at 315; Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *49. "An employer who has received proper notice cannot escape its duty to engage in the interactive process simply because the employee did not come forward with a reasonable accommodation that would prevail in litigation." Taylor, 184 F.3d at 317; Maher, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171530, at *49-50.
Employers can demonstrate that they have engaged in the interactive process in myriad ways, such as meeting with the employee who requests an accommodation, request information about the condition and what limitations the employee has, ask the employee what he or she specifically wants, show some sign of having considered the employee's request, and offer and discuss available alternatives when the request is too burdensome. See Parker v. Verizon Pa., Inc., 309 F. App'x 551, 560 (3d Cir. 2009); Taylor, 184 F.3d at 317. The Third Circuit has held that "an employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation he requests or prefers, the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation." Yovtcheva, 518 F. App'x at 122 (citations omitted). "Generally, the question of whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable is a question of fact." Turner v. Hershey Chocolate USA, 440 F.3d 604, 611 n.4 (quoting Buskirk v. Apollo Metals, 307 F.3d 160, 170 (3d Cir. 2002)).
Regarding, [*26]  specifically, the provision of sign language interpreters for deaf individuals, the ADA Technical Assistance Manual provides some guidance: "A person who is deaf or hearing-impaired should be able to communicate effectively with others as required by the duties of the job . . . Interpretation may be necessary for training situations, staff meetings or an employee party, so that this person can fully participate in these functions." Technical Assistance Manual on the Employment Provisions of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, § III - 3.10(9), (Jan. 1992). Also, in informal guidance, the EEOC has stated the following:
An employer's decision regarding what accommodation to provide for an employee who is deaf or has a hearing impairment, like any accommodation decision, is an individualized one. The appropriate accommodation may depend on the setting in which communication occurs, the ability of the employee to use certain means of communication, technological advancements that make once-effective accommodations obsolete or ineffective, and other factors . . . An interactive process with an employee will help ensure initial selection of an effective accommodation and will be important for reassessing a situation if the employee requests a change to an accommodation that has been provided.
Peggy [*27]  R. Mastroianni, Legal Counsel, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Informal Discussion Letter, Oct. 28, 2013, https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/foia/letters/2013/ada_sign_language_interpreters.html (last visited Oct. 4, 2019).
In this case, the Hospital maintains that it has reasonably accommodated Hwaga's deafness because it provided Hwaga with a live interpreter during orientation when his job duties were first explained to him; that the Hospital generally provided him with a live interpreter, video interpretation, and electronic and written means of communication so that he could perform the essential functions of his job; and that the Hospital eventually arranged for an outside interpreter to discuss his job performance. (Def.'s Summary Judgement Br. 22, 23). Additionally, the Hospital maintains that the law does not mandate an ASL interpreter in all circumstances. (Def.'s Reply Br. 5).
Plaintiff counters with a brief assertion that Anastasia Jacobs, Director of Human Resources, offered "bare-bones testimony" regarding what steps, if any, the Hospital has taken to provide Hwaga with an interpreter for certain meetings and trainings. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. at 19). Plaintiff's counsel [*28]  also mentioned during oral argument that, after Hwaga's work performance meeting in early 2017, the Hospital began to provide Hwaga with sign language interpreting services for various meetings but has not put forth evidence to prove as such. The Court will briefly highlight a few facts concerning whether the Hospital engaged in the interactive process to provide Hwaga with an interpreter.
It appears that the Hospital, and specifically Director Hossary, is or was unclear as to Lexington Vocational's role, and particularly Ms. Freeman's role, in providing job coach and interpreting services to Hwaga. For instance, in notes dated December 19, 2016, that appear to have been kept by Mr. Hossary, he apparently had a meeting with Ms. Freeman about Ms. Freeman's role as interpreter and/or job coach. (Blunda Cert., Ex. 14, Hossary Notes, ECF No. 19-2). During that meeting, after Ms. Freeman apparently stated that she was not Hwaga's interpreter, Mr. Hossary wrote that he would reach out to HR to "get a better understanding of [Ms. Freeman's] relationship" with Hwaga and the Hospital. (Id.).
During a text message exchange dated December 19, 2016, between Mr. Hossary and Ms. Freeman, after Ms. [*29]  Freeman stated that she would only appear for a meeting as a "silent advocate" for Hwaga and would not interpret for him, Ms. Hossary wrote, "Then clearly I have been confused on your role all these years. I will set up the meeting for this week. Please advise of your role and depending on this will be weather [sic] or not I continue to deal with you as I was always under the impression that you were his interpreter." (Blunda Cert., Ex. 15, Text Messages, ECF No. 19-2). Mr. Hossary further stated, "I don't really know what you are doing on his behalf if you were never his interpreter like you said." (Id.). In response, Ms. Freeman wrote, "I am not a professional interpreter in the role related to Stephen I am his job coach fully able to communicate with him . . . It is my job to make his employment there successful . . . " (Id.).
Moreover, there are a few examples that address whether the Hospital provided Hwaga with an interpreter, either live or through video. During his deposition, for example, when Hwaga was asked if the Hospital ever—from the date of his hire until this lawsuit—provided him with an interpreter, he stated that the Hospital provided him with an interpreter only for [*30]  orientation in 2011 to explain his work duties. (Hwaga Dep. 52:7-11). When asked if the Hospital had ever provided him with video interpretation services, Hwaga answered affirmatively, but noted that the video service is "pixilated and fuzzy," is "a waste of time," and that he needs "a live interpreter, not video." (Id. at 64:9-15).
Hwaga also testified that occasionally Ms. Freeman would interpret for him at meetings with the Hospital. (Hwaga Dep. 59:23-24). Indeed, Ms. Freeman stated in her deposition that she interpreted for Hwaga on numerous occasions, but never received "formal" approval from Lexington Vocational to do so. (See Freeman Dep. 75:14-15; 89:24). Specifically, Ms. Freeman testified that she provided Hwaga with interpretation services at the hospital for "short meetings with his supervisor, long meetings with his . . . director. And then occasional staff meeting[s]." (Id. at 91:8-10). Ms. Freeman stated she interpreted for Hwaga at least ten times for meetings with "a slew of supervisors" including Mr. Hossary. (Id. at 91:23; 92:3-4).
Ms. Freeman also testified that she interpreted for Hwaga for "disciplinary" meetings. For one of these "disciplinary" meetings, in which [*31]  Hwaga, Ms. Freeman, and Mr. Hossary were present, Ms. Freeman stated that the nature of the meeting concerned whether Hwaga was following the rules and procedures regarding his work responsibilities. (Id. at 100:23-25; 101:25).
Several other examples address the Hospital's efforts to provide interpreting services for Hwaga. For instance, in a text message sent from Mr. Hossary to Ms. Freeman on December 19, 2016, Mr. Hossary indicated that the Hospital has "interpreting services 24/7." (Blunda Cert., Text Messages). Hwaga also testified that Director Hossary provided plaintiff with two of his (Director Hossary's) phone numbers "so if there was a problem, I [Hwaga] could communicate with him [Director Hossary]." (Hwaga Dep. 91:14-15).
Anastasia Jacobs, Director of Human Resources at the Hospital, also testified about the interactive process that the Hospital allegedly conducted. (Rozynski Decl., Ex. B, Deposition of Anastasia Jacobs ("Jacobs Dep."), Dec. 13, 2018, ECF No. 21-6). Ms. Jacobs testified that Hwaga was provided with an interpreter during the Hospital's Orientation, but was not aware of the interactive process after Orientation, and alleges that Hwaga did not make a request [*32]  for a "consistent" interpreter. (Jacobs Dep. 36:22-25 — 37:2-6; 44:21-24; 93:18-20).
Ms. Quigley, NJ Program Director at Lexington Vocational and Ms. Freeman's supervisor, also testified about the interactive process. (Rozynski Decl., Ex. D, Deposition of Jennifer Quigley ("Quigley Dep."), Dec. 13, 2018, ECF No. 21-7). Ms. Quigley stated that in or around November 2017, Hwaga received re-training for his job, and that the Hospital provided an interpreter. (Quigley Dep. 47:5-14). Ms. Quigley stated that in or around November 2017, a meeting took place in which she advised Mr. Hossary that Hwaga does not understand VRI, and thus the Hospital should provide Hwaga with a live interpreter. (Quigley Dep. 51:1-6).
Here, there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the Hospital engaged in the interactive process to provide Hwaga with an interpreter. The ADA Technical Assistance Manual states that "[p]eople with hearing impairments have different communication needs and use different modes of communication . . . The individual should be consulted to determine the most effective means of communication." § III - 3.10(9). In this case, there is little evidence that the Hospital consulted with [*33]  Hwaga to determine the precise circumstances in which he would need to be provided with an interpreter. Still, it appears that, in some instances, the Hospital took steps to provide Hwaga with an interpreter in certain circumstances, although the Hospital's provision of an interpreter was somewhat inconsistent. In other instances, Ms. Freeman (who is not Hwaga's official interpreter) interpreted for Hwaga at meetings.
In sum, whether this evidence amounts to a good-faith effort by the Hospital to engage in the interactive process to provide sign language interpretation services for Hwaga presents a genuine issue of material fact.

IV. Conclusion
For the reasons stated above, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.
