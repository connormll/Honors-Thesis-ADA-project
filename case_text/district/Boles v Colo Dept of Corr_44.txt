RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
Entered By Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak
This matter is before the Court on: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [#295] (the "Injunction Motion") and (2) CDOC Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) [#310] (the "Motion to Dismiss")1 (collectively, the "Motions"). The Motions have been referred to this Court. [#296, 343] The Court has carefully considered the Motions and related [*2]  briefing, the entire case file, argument presented at the November 9, 2021 motion hearing [#336], and the applicable case law. For the following reasons, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Motion to Dismiss and the Injunction Motion be DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND
The instant lawsuit arises out of the conditions of confinement during Plaintiff's incarceration by Defendant Colorado Department of Corrections ("CDOC") at the Sterling Correctional Facility ("SCF"). [#116] Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed the instant action on April 19, 2019. [#1] On May 29, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint, asserting the following claims: (1) denial of adequate food [#116 at 8-13]; (2) denial of adequate medical care [id. at 13-20]; (3) discrimination on the basis of a disability [id. at 20-22]; (4) discrimination on the basis of religion [id. at 22-25]; (5) the illegal taking of money from Plaintiff's inmate account and property from Plaintiff's cell [id. at 25-27]; and (6) "[u]ntenable "[i]nterference [w]ith [t]his [l]itigation" by restricting Plaintiff's access to the law library and legal research resources [id. at 27-28]. The Second Amended Complaint [*3]  originally named twenty defendants and sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. [Id. at 1, 29]
On March 19, 2021, United States District Judge William J. Martinez entered an Order adopting this Court's Recommendation that certain claims and Defendants be dismissed. [#247] Specifically, Judge Martinez dismissed all claims and Defendants except: (1) Claim Three to the extent it asserts claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and the Rehabilitation Act ("RA") against Defendant CDOC for failing to accommodate Plaintiff's need for a wheelchair-accessible cell; (2) Claim Four to the extent it asserts a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act ("RLUIPA") against Defendant CDOC and Defendant Charleen Crockett in her official capacity based upon alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet at SCF; (3) Claim Four to the extent it asserts a First Amendment claim against Defendants CDOC, Ms. Crockett and Rabbi Yisroel Rosskamm based upon alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff's kosher diet at SCF; and (4) Claim Four to the extent it asserts a First Amendment Claim against Defendants Ms. Crockett and Cyrus Clarkson based upon the alleged denial of a kosher diet from June 2019 through December 2019, including kosher meals for Sukkot. [Id. at [*4]  4-5] After Judge Martinez issued his Order, the case was reassigned to United States District Judge Regina M. Rodriguez upon her appointment to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. [#293]
On July 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed the instant Injunction Motion. [#295] Through the Injunction Motion, Plaintiff seeks an "injunction ordering . . . [a] wheelchair accessible cell and [a] nutritionally adequate authentic kosher diet." [#307 at 2; see generally #295] Defendants responded to the Injunction Motion [## 304, 305] and Plaintiff filed a reply [#307]. On November 9, 2021, this Court heard oral argument on the Injunction Motion.2 [#336] On December 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief in support of the Injunction Motion. [#342; see also #346]
On September 7, 2021, CDOC Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss which seeks to dismiss Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief under the ADA and RA as moot. [#310] On September 20, 2021, Plaintiff responded to the Motion to Dismiss [#314], and CDOC Defendants then filed a reply [#321].

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A. Pro Se Litigant
"A pro se litigant's pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent [*5]  standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972)). "The Haines rule applies to all proceedings involving a pro se litigant." Id. at 1110 n.3. The Court, however, cannot be a pro se litigant's advocate. See Yang v. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008). Moreover, pro se parties must "follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants." Nielsen v. Price, 17 F.3d 1276, 1277 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting Green v. Dorrell, 969 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir.1992)).

B. Dismissal Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) empowers a court to dismiss a complaint for "lack of subject-matter jurisdiction." Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) is not a judgment on the merits of a plaintiff's case, but only a determination that the court lacks authority to adjudicate the matter. See Castaneda v. INS, 23 F.3d 1576, 1580 (10th Cir. 1994) (recognizing federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and may only exercise jurisdiction when specifically authorized to do so). A court lacking jurisdiction "must dismiss the cause at any stage of the proceeding in which it becomes apparent that jurisdiction is lacking." Basso v. Utah Power & Light Co., 495 F.2d 906, 909 (10th Cir. 1973).
Rule 12(b)(1) challenges are generally presented in one of two forms: "[t]he moving party may (1) facially attack the complaint's allegations as to the existence of subject matter jurisdiction, or (2) go beyond allegations contained in the complaint by presenting evidence to challenge the factual basis upon which subject matter jurisdiction rests." Merrill Lynch Bus. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Nudell, 363 F.3d 1072, 1074 (10th Cir.2004) (quoting [*6]  Maestas v. Lujan, 351 F.3d 1001, 1013 (10th Cir.2003)). When the moving party challenges the facts providing the basis for a court's subject matter jurisdiction, a reviewing court "may not presume the truthfulness of the complaint's allegations." Holt v. United States, 46 F.3d 1000, 1003 (10th Cir. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by Cent. Green Co. v. United States, 531 U.S. 425, 437 (2001). As a result, the court must make its own findings of jurisdictional facts. Holt, 46 F.3d at 1003. In doing so, the court "has wide discretion to allow affidavits, other documents, and a limited evidentiary hearing." Id. "[A] court's reference to evidence outside the pleadings does not convert" a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) into a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Id.

C. Preliminary Injunction3
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 governs preliminary injunctions. In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must prove: "(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm to the movant if the preliminary injunction is denied; (3) the threatened injury outweighs the harms that the preliminary injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction, if issued, will not adversely affect the public interest." Gen. Motors Corp. v. Urban Gorilla, LLC, 500 F.3d 1222, 1226 (10th Cir. 2007). "As a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal." Schrier v. Univ. Of Colo., 427 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted).
"[C]ourts 'disfavor' [*7]  some preliminary injunctions and so require more of the parties who request them." Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019). "Disfavored preliminary injunctions don't merely preserve the parties' relative positions pending trial." Id. "Instead, a disfavored injunction may exhibit any of three characteristics: (1) it mandates action (rather than prohibiting it), (2) it changes the status quo, or (3) it grants all the relief that the moving party could expect from a trial win." Id. "To get a disfavored injunction, the moving party faces a heavier burden on the likelihood-of-success-on-the-merits and the balance-of-harms factors: She must make a 'strong showing' that these tilt in her favor." Id. (quoting Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 724 (10th Cir. 2016)).

II. ANALYSIS
Because the Motion to Dismiss challenges the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief under the ADA and RA—part of the relief requested in the Injunction Motion—the Court first addresses the Motion to Dismiss and then turns to the Injunction Motion. See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 1126 (10th Cir. 2013) ("Before turning to the preliminary injunction standard, [the court] must resolve . . . issues that bear on [its] subject-matter jurisdiction").

A. Motion to Dismiss
In the Motion to Dismiss, CDOC Defendants argue that the [*8]  Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief for a wheelchair-accessible cell under the ADA and RA because those claims are moot in light of Plaintiff's placement in a wheelchair-accessible cell. [#310] The United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to actual cases or controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. Mootness thus "is a threshold issue because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal court jurisdiction." McClendon v. City of Albuquerque, 100 F.3d 863, 867 (10th Cir. 1996).
"A 'suit becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer "live" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.'" Brown v. Buhman, 822 F.3d 1151, 1165 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013)). "[T]he case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs' particular legal rights." Id. (quoting Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013)). "The crucial question is whether granting a present determination of the issues offered will have some effect in the real world." Id. at 1165-66 (quoting Wyoming v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 414 F.3d 1207, 1212 (10th Cir. 2005)). "Put another way, a case becomes moot when a plaintiff no longer suffers actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision." Id. at 1166 (quoting Ind v. Colo. Dep't of Corr., 801 F.3d 1209, 1213 (10th Cir. 2015)).
"When prospective equitable relief is requested, the requesting party must show an ongoing, personal [*9]  stake in the outcome of the controversy, a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at law." Rezaq v. Nalley, 677 F.3d 1001, 1008 (10th Cir. 2012). "Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief." Id. (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974)). Here, it is undisputed that, since the filing of the lawsuit, Plaintiff has been moved into a wheelchair-accessible cell and thus that his RA and ADA claims could be moot to the extent these claims seek injunctive relief requiring CDOC Defendant to place him in a wheelchair-accessible cell. [#310 at 2-3; #314 at 2]
This does not end the inquiry, however, because courts recognize the following two "exceptions" to the mootness doctrine: (1) disputes that are "capable of repetition, yet evading review" and (2) disputes involving the "voluntary cessation" of the defendant's conduct. N. M. Health Connections v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., 946 F.3d 1138, 1159 (10th Cir. 2019) (quoting Brown, 822 F.3d at 1166). Here, Plaintiff argues that the "voluntary cessation" exception applies.4 [See #314 at 2 (arguing that Plaintiff was "temporarily" transferred to the wheelchair-accessible cell "under pressure of litigation"), 5 (arguing that "no accommodation will be honored beyond court enforcement")]
Pursuant to the "voluntary cessation" [*10]  exception, "[t]he voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as soon as the case is dismissed." Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 (2012)). Courts "view voluntary cessation 'with a critical eye,' lest defendants manipulate jurisdiction to 'insulate' their conduct from judicial review." Brown, 822 F.3d at 1166 (quoting Knox, 567 U.S. at 307). Accordingly, "a defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." Already, LLC, 568 U.S. at 91. More specifically, the party asserting mootness must demonstrate: "(1) it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation." Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of Reclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1115 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)). This heavy burden, however, "is not insurmountable, especially in the context of government enforcement." Brown, 822 F.3d at 1167.
CDOC Defendants contend that "[t]he voluntary cessation exception to mootness does not apply to [Plaintiff's] ADA/RA claim for three reasons." [#321 at 5] First, CDOC Defendants argue [*11]  that "courts generally deny mootness following governmental officials' voluntary cessation only when there are 'clear showings of reluctant submissions' by governmental actors 'and a desire to return to the old ways'" and, here, "the record is devoid of evidence that [Plaintiff] was moved to an ADA cell as a ploy to deprive the Court of jurisdiction." [#321 at 5 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Brown, 822 F.3d at 1167)] As a preliminary matter, although CDOC Defendants fault Plaintiff for "offer[ing] no evidence," it is the CDOC Defendants and not Plaintiff who bear the "formidable burden" of proof. Brown, 822 F.3d at 1166 (quotation omitted). Plaintiff has alleged that he was provided a wheelchair-accessible cell as a result of pressure created by the instant litigation [#314 at 2], and CDOC Defendants have not submitted any evidence that directly refutes that contention.
Instead, CDOC Defendants contend that Plaintiff "submitted a request for accommodation, which was evaluated and granted on the normal process for handling such requests" and cite to a declaration from Janet Smith, a CDOC ADA Inmate Coordinator. [#321 at 3-4 (citing #321-1)] Although Ms. Smith's declaration describes the process pursuant to which Plaintiff's request [*12]  for an accessible cell was evaluated and provides supporting documentation, she does not explain the specific timing of Plaintiff's ultimate accommodation or expressly disavow any involvement by the participants in this litigation. [See #321-1] The record reflects that Plaintiff submitted an Offender Request for Accommodation form requesting a wheelchair-accessible cell on March 28, 2021. [Id. at 18] Ms. Smith responded to that request on April 5, 2021, by stating that the request was forwarded to certain individuals in the medical department and that Plaintiff should "follow up with medical." [Id. at 20] On July 23, 2021, Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Jerome Long, who concluded that Plaintiff "needs a cell with handrails and . . . a higher toilet" and thus recommended that Plaintiff be housed in an ADA cell "[i]f the only cell that meets these qualifications is an ADA cell." [Id. at 21] Plaintiff's request for an accommodation was not actually granted until September 30, 2021. [Id. at 23] Although Ms. Smith testifies that Plaintiff "was moved to an available ADA cell fitting [the] criteria" set out in Dr. Long's recommendation and subsequently approved [id. at 3-4], the record instead [*13]  reflects that Plaintiff was transferred to the ADA cell on July 11, 2021—before Plaintiff met with Dr. Long and before his accommodation request was approved [id. at 24].5 Moreover, the record appears to indicate that Plaintiff was "moved" into an ADA cell on that date for "routine" reasons. [Id.] The current record thus does not support CDOC Defendants' contention that Plaintiff was provided an ADA cell pursuant to the approval of his request for accommodation.6
Second, CDOC Defendants contend that Plaintiff was placed in an ADA cell as a result of the recommendation by Dr. Long and pursuant to the procedure for obtaining an accommodation and, thus, that the voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply because Defendants'"actions [were] essentially ministerial and dictated by the actions of a non-party." [#321 at 6 (quoting Eagle Air Med Corp. v. Martin, 377 F. App'x 823, 829 (10th Cir. 2010))] As explained above, however, the record reflects that Plaintiff was moved into an ADA cell before his request for an accommodation was approved and prior to even meeting with Dr. Long. [#321-1 at 21-24] CDOC Defendants have offered no explanation for the specific timing of Plaintiff's transfer into the ADA cell on July 11, 2021. Nor have CDOC Defendants submitted [*14]  any evidence establishing that an inmate who is approved for an ADA cell accommodation is guaranteed placement in an ADA cell such that the decision to place Plaintiff in an ADA cell was merely "ministerial." To the contrary, Plaintiff contends that "the prison is overcrowded with 3 times more prisoners in wheelchairs than there are wheelchair accessible cells" and, as a result, there is "a long list" of inmates awaiting placement in a wheelchair-accessible cell. [#314 at 2]
Third, CDOC Defendants contend that "because [Plaintiff] has received an accommodation for an accessible toilet with grab bars, the allegedly wrongful behavior of placing him in a cell not fitting that criteria could not reasonably be expected to occur." [#321 at 6] The Court disagrees. As a preliminary matter, Defendants have not offered any evidence that the approved accommodation—a cell "with accessible toilet equipped with grab bars"—is the same as a wheelchair-accessible cell. In his recommendation, Dr. Long merely stated: "If the only cell that meets these qualifications is an ADA cell," then he would recommend one. [#321-1 at 21 (emphasis added)] CDOC Defendants have offered no evidence to support a finding [*15]  that all cells with accessible toilets and grab bars also are wheelchair accessible.7 Nor, as noted above, have CDOC Defendants offered any evidence to support a finding that an inmate who receives an accommodation for an accessible cell is guaranteed to be placed in an accessible cell. Instead, CDOC Defendants merely point to a CDOC Administrative Regulation that directs prison staff to "review housing restrictions and accommodations" prior to internal movement of inmates "to ensure continuity of accessible housing and accommodation." [#321-1 at 9] The Administrative Regulation concedes, however, that continuity will not always be possible as it directs staff to contact ADA coordinators "[i]n the event continuity is not possible" and to only utilize "[i]naccessible housing . . . temporarily and as a last resort in the event of an emergency or imminent safety or security problem." [Id.] Defendants have offered no evidence to refute Plaintiff's contention that there are three times more prisoners in wheelchairs than there are wheelchair-accessible cells. [See #314 at 2]
Accordingly, the Court concludes that CDOC Defendants have not carried their heavy burden of demonstrating that: "(1) [*16]  it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation." Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, 601 F.3d at 1115. Although the Tenth Circuit has acknowledged that this "heavy burden frequently has not prevented governmental officials from discontinuing challenged practices and mooting a case," id. at 1116, such cases generally involve the governmental officials undertaking some significant action with indicia of permanence.8 See, e.g., id. at 1118 (discussing "concrete step" of issuing a new policy, that "superseded and rendered obsolete" challenged policies); Camfield v. City of Oklahoma City, 248 F.3d 1214, 1223-24 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding "state legislature's repeal or revision of a challenged statute" sufficient where there was "no evidence in the record to indicate that the legislature intend[ed] to reenact the prior version of the disputed statute"); Haulmark v. Kansas, No. 520CV04084EFMTJJ, 2021 WL 4124645, at *4 (D. Kan. Sept. 9, 2021) (noting that there was "simply no evidence . . . that [d]efendants intend[ed] to pull the rug out from their multimillion-dollar project upon dismissal of th[e] suit"). Here, CDOC Defendants have not introduced evidence of any permanent steps they have undertaken to change or correct the policy that previously deprived [*17]  Plaintiff of a wheelchair-accessible cell; nor have they submitted sworn testimony guaranteeing that Plaintiff will not be removed from an ADA cell. Cf. Brown, 822 F.3d at 1170 (relying on declaration from defendant "under penalty of perjury that [the plaintiffs] w[ould] not be prosecuted" under the challenged law and noting that, to find this insufficient, the court "would have to conclude the highest-ranking law enforcement official in Utah County had engaged in deliberate misrepresentation to the court"). Instead, CDOC Defendants rely only on the decision to move Plaintiff into an ADA cell and point to an Administrative Regulation that expressly contemplates that an inmate may be moved into "[i]naccessible housing."
For these reasons, the Court concludes that CDOC Defendants have not established that the voluntary cessation exception to mootness is inapplicable and the Court thus respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Motion to Dismiss be DENIED.

B. Injunction Motion

1. Wheelchair-Accessible Cell
Through the Injunction Motion, Plaintiff first seeks an Order requiring the CDOC Defendants to provide Plaintiff with a wheelchair-accessible cell. [#295 at 15] As discussed above, Plaintiff concedes that he was provided [*18]  a wheelchair-accessible cell on July 11, 2021; Plaintiff contends, however, that such placement is "not guaranteed." [#295-1 at 7] The Court thus understands Plaintiff to seek an order forbidding CDOC from moving Plaintiff out of a wheelchair-accessible cell.9 With respect to this request, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.
To establish irreparable harm, "the movant 'must demonstrate a significant risk that he or she will experience harm that cannot be compensated after the fact by money damages.'" First W. Cap. Mgmt. Co. v. Malamed, 874 F.3d 1136, 1141 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Fish, 840 F.3d at 751). In addition, "[t]o constitute irreparable harm, an injury must be certain, great, actual and not theoretical." Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1267 (quoting Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003)). "[P]urely speculative harm does not amount to irreparable injury," but "a plaintiff who can show a significant risk of irreparable harm has demonstrated that the harm is not speculative." Greater Yellowstone Coal. v. Flowers, 321 F.3d 1250, 1258 (10th Cir. 2003). Demonstrating irreparable harm is "not an easy burden to fulfill." Id.
Here, Plaintiff admits to having been moved to a wheelchair accessible cell and, while he claims that continued placement in such a cell "is not guaranteed" [#295-1 at 7], Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that he is in imminent [*19]  danger of being moved from the wheelchair accessible cell. [Id.] For example, he has not provided any evidence that CDOC officials have threatened to move Plaintiff. Instead, Plaintiff merely contends that his current wheelchair-accessible cell "is in a transition unit where he cannot expect to keep a cell for very long," that the pod in which it is located "is slated for conversion to a kitchen worker pod," and that there is "a long list" of inmates seeking a wheelchair-accessible cell because there are three times more prisoners in wheelchairs than there are wheelchair-accessible cells. [#307 at 5; #314 at 2] Although the Court gives credence to Plaintiff's undisputed statements about the location of his current cell and the shortage of wheelchair-accessible cells, they are insufficient—standing alone—to demonstrate that the risk of Plaintiff being moved out of a wheelchair-accessible cell is "certain, great, actual and not theoretical." Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1267 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable injury if the preliminary injunction is denied.10 See, e.g., Norfleet v. Ill. Dep't of Corr., No. 15-cv-1279-SMY-DGW, 2016 WL 5724931, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Aug. 4, 2016) (recommending denial of preliminary injunction for failure to satisfy irreparable harm requirement [*20]  where wheelchair-bound inmate had since been moved to a "transitional" cell and had made no showing that he was suffering harm in the new cell), report and recommendation adopted 2016 WL 5691615 (Oct. 3, 2016); Henderson v. Castillo, No. 1:20-cv-01199-SKO (PC), 2020 WL 6886382, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 24, 2020) (finding "the 'extraordinary remedy' of a preliminary injunction [was] not necessary to preserve the relative positions of the parties, since [the plaintiff's] request for single-cell status ha[d] already been granted for a minimum of six months"), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 WL 53244 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 6, 2021); Rhoades v. Jeffrys, No. 3:20-cv-00836-GCS, 2021 WL 365785, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Feb. 3, 2021) (finding plaintiff's request for preliminary injunction seeking an accessible cell moot where, by the time of the order, the plaintiff had already been moved to such a cell). Accordingly, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Injunction Motion be DENIED to the extent it seeks an Order requiring the CDOC Defendants to provide—and/or prohibiting the CDOC Defendants from removing Plaintiff from—a wheelchair accessible cell.

2. Kosher Meals
Plaintiff next seeks an Order requiring CDOC either to improve the kosher meals prepared at SCF or to outsource the kosher meals served to Plaintiff to an outside kosher food caterer. [#295 at 13-14] Because such relief would change the status quo concerning CDOC's food-handling [*21]  procedures for kosher meals, Plaintiff seeks a disfavored injunction. Vega v. Wiley, 259 F. App'x 104, 107 (10th Cir. 2007) (finding inmate's request for injunctive relief regarding prison's food-handling procedures to be a disfavored injunction). To obtain the requested injunction, Plaintiff thus bears the heavier burden of making a "strong showing" of success on the merits of his RLUIPA and/or First Amendment claims based upon the alleged deficiencies in the kosher diet at SCF. See Free the Nipple-Fort Collins, 916 F.3d at 797.
To succeed on his RLUIPA claim, Plaintiff "must demonstrate he wishes to engage in (1) a religious exercise (2) motivated by a sincerely held belief, which exercise (3) is subject to a substantial burden imposed by the government." Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, 600 F.3d 1301, 1312 (10th Cir. 2010). The Tenth Circuit "has explained that a burden on a religious exercise rises to the level of being 'substantial' when (at the very least) the government (1) requires the plaintiff to participate in an activity prohibited by a sincerely held religious belief, (2) prevents the plaintiff from participating in an activity motivated by a sincerely held religious belief, or (3) places considerable pressure on the plaintiff to violate a sincerely held religious belief—for example, by presenting an illusory or Hobson's choice where the only realistically [*22]  possible course of action available to the plaintiff trenches on sincere religious exercise." Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F.3d 48, 55 (10th Cir. 2014). With regard to the third category, the Tenth Circuit explained that "a burden can be 'substantial' even if it does not compel or order the claimant to betray a sincerely held religious belief" but instead "[i]t is enough that the claimant is presented with a choice in which he faces considerable pressure to abandon the religious exercise at issue." Id. In other words, "a 'substantial burden' need not be a complete or total one." Id.
Similarly, to succeed on his First Amendment Claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate that "a prison regulation substantially burdened . . . sincerely-held religious beliefs." Kay v. Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). "To determine whether [a] plaintiff has made an initial showing of a substantial burden on religious exercise, courts use the same test under the First Amendment as is used under RLUIPA." Orwig v. Williams, No. 16-CV-00781-PAB-SKC, 2019 WL 4751775, at *8 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2019); see also Strope v. Cummings, 381 F. App'x 878, 881 (10th Cir. 2010) ("While the analysis under [the First Amendment and RLUIPA] differs in some respects, the principle dispositive here is the same: [the plaintiff] must show that defendants' conduct imposed a substantial burden on his religious practice." (emphasis omitted)).
Thus, in order to make a "strong showing" of success on the merits [*23]  of either the RLUIPA claim or the First Amendment claim, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the kosher diet provided at SCF places a "substantial burden" on the exercise of Plaintiff's religious beliefs. The only evidence submitted by Plaintiff in support of his Injunction Motion is Plaintiff's own affidavit. [See #295-1] Most of the allegations in the affidavit related to SCF's food preparation are either conclusory, based upon hearsay,11 and/or relate to food preparation generally and not to SCF's compliance with Plaintiff's firmly held religious beliefs. [Id. at 5 ("Food service at SCF is especially bad because there has not been anyone in the kitchen who has any formal education or training in food service" for over four years); id. ("SCF cannot comply with Colorado Health and Safety laws."); id. ("Some of [the inmate kitchen workers] told [Plaintiff] that they were forced to work (one as a cook) while sick with COVID 19."); id. at 6 ("Kitchen staff and sometimes workers skrew (sic) up as a matter of course."). Although Plaintiff testifies that SCF's kosher diet "does not meet kosher law requirements," the only example Plaintiff provides relates to the freshness of SCF's fruits and vegetables. [Id. [*24]  at 6-7] With respect to that example, Plaintiff declares that he has received rotten and blemished fruits and vegetables but does not detail how frequently this has occurred or what other foods were offered in addition to the fruits and vegetables.12 [Id.] Given the lack of detail in Plaintiff's affidavit, the Court finds that Plaintiff's affidavit is insufficient to make the strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits necessary for issuance of the disfavored injunction.
Plaintiff's briefing on the Injunction Motion itself—which was not submitted under penalty of perjury—contains slightly more information. [#295, 307, 342] Here too, however, most of the assertions are conclusory, not based upon personal knowledge, and/or based upon hearsay for which Plaintiff has provided no information to substantiate its reliability. [See, e.g., #295 at 13 (stating that "every single meal is . . . fraudulent, wholly unacceptable by Jewish law"); #342 at 5 (stating that "[t]he current CDOC pretend kosher diet is virtually indistinguishable from a non-kosher Gentile diet")] For example, the Injunction Motion indicates that "[h]ighly processed foods served as part of the CDOC['s] . [*25]  . . kosher diet" can cause digestive difficulty, which in turn violates Plaintiff's religious obligation to "stay away from things which destroy the body." [#295 at 5; see also #342 at 5] The Injunction Motion, however, does not detail what type of foods are highly-processed, what portion of the meals consist of highly-processed foods, or which specific foods cause Plaintiff digestive difficulty and with what frequency. [Id.] Similarly, the Motion states that "[m]eat and dairy separation is not strictly adhered to at SCF" but fails to identify the particular manner in which SCF violates the separation requirements or how often SCF violates these requirements. [Id. at 6] Other allegations are entirely speculative. [Id. at 7 ("There is no way for us to know what besides chemicals is in the bread in our meals or how it was made."); id. (stating "[w]e have no way to know" whether animals with damaged intestines or worms and worm larvae affect the food)]
Plaintiff provides the greatest detail when discussing the potential burden on his religious beliefs posed by the preparation of food by Gentiles. [Id. at 6, 8] Plaintiff explains that, pursuant to his religious beliefs, "[i]n general, food [*26]  prepared by Gentiles is not permitted unless a Jew participates at least minimally in the preparation." [Id. at 8] According to Plaintiff, "[t]he Rabbi's supervision is random for a few minutes once a month or less, so no Jewish presence." [Id. at 6] It is not clear, however, that Plaintiff has personal knowledge regarding this allegation or that other Jews are not involved in food preparation at SCF.13 Plaintiff merely states that "[t]hese facts are a combination of personal observation, talks with kitchen personnel about grievances, and the association with prisoners that have worked as kosher food prep[aration] workers." [Id.] Plaintiff fails to describe with particularity what he has observed, who he has talked to, or what those individuals have personally observed.
Moreover, although Plaintiff contends generally that the food served as part of the kosher diet is made by Gentiles and thus in violation of his religious beliefs, Plaintiff acknowledges that certain foods (e.g., raw foods and bread) may be eaten. [#295 at 8] Plaintiff also admits that the "Meal Mart products" served as part of the kosher diet "may originally have been kosher" subject to the generalized concerns discussed [*27]  above regarding highly-processed foods. [#342 at 5] Plaintiff's allegations are insufficient for the Court to determine what portion of the kosher diet Plaintiff receives consists of: (1) food in which the Rabbi or another Jewish person participates in the preparation, (2) raw foods, (3) bread, and/or (4) "Meal Mart products" that may be suitable for Plaintiff to eat without violating his religious beliefs. Without more specific allegations and evidence, Plaintiff has failed to make a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits.
Plaintiff also fails to make a strong showing with respect to the precise religious beliefs that Plaintiff contends are being violated and need to be remedied by the proposed injunction. For example, as noted above, Plaintiff contends that his religious beliefs require him to "stay away from things which destroy the body" and thus there is an "[e]mphasis . . . on eating easily digested foods," but Plaintiff does not allege that his religious beliefs prohibit him from eating all types of processed foods and Plaintiff has not identified which specific types of food are prohibited. [#295 at 5] Similarly, with respect to the food preparation allegations, [*28]  Plaintiff has failed to clearly articulate what injunctive relief he seeks to ensure that the food meets his religious beliefs. [See, e.g., id. at 6 (suggesting that food would be kosher if "prepared in the presence of a Jew"), 8 (stating that "a Jew [must] participate[] at least minimally in the preparation" and suggesting that food is not kosher where "Gentile[s] do all the preparation"); 14 (suggesting that the preparation should "minimize Gentile contact with kosher food")]
Given these inconsistent assertions, the Court cannot determine the precise nature of the alleged violation of Plaintiff's firmly held religious beliefs and, thereby, the precise nature of the relief needed to remedy the violation. Requiring the CDOC to have a Jewish person present during the preparation of kosher foods is a far less intrusive remedy than requiring the CDOC to have all kosher meals prepared by only Jewish people. Moreover, the Court is mindful that a "federal court considering a motion for injunctive relief affecting the conditions of a prisoner's confinement must give substantial weight to the adverse impact on public safety and on prison operation." Folsom v. Knutson, No. CIV-13-632-D, 2016 WL 1171178, at *4 (W.D. Okla. Feb. 26, 2016); see also Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179, 1186 (10th Cir. 2002) (finding, in the context of a [*29]  prisoner's claims regarding access to a kosher diet, that "[w]ithout doubt, prison administrators have a legitimate interest in working within a fixed budget" and "a legitimate concern that other inmates[ ] might react negatively to providing some prisoners with a kosher diet"). Without knowing the precise nature of the alleged violation or the relief needed to remedy the alleged violation, the Court cannot analyze the impact the remedy would have on prison operations, and therefore cannot "balance the guarantees of the Constitution with the legitimate concerns of prison administrators." Beerheide, 286 F.3d at 1185 (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-91(1987)). For this additional reason, Plaintiff has failed to make the strong showing necessary for issuance of a disfavored injunction.
Accordingly, given that Plaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden with respect to his request for a preliminary injunction, the Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that the Injunction Motion be DENIED to the extent it seeks an injunction requiring Defendants to change the kosher diet offered at SCF. The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff's RLUIPA and First Amendment claims regarding the alleged deficiencies in the kosher diet at SCF have survived Defendants' motions to dismiss and [*30]  may ultimately prove to have merit. Although the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to make the required showing to obtain injunctive relief on the current record, the Court acknowledges that it is possible that Plaintiff—with the assistance of discovery and potentially counsel14 —may be able to better articulate and prove the precise deficiencies in SCF's kosher diet and posit a narrowly-tailored request for injunctive relief.15 As a result, the Court further RECOMMENDS that the Injunction Motion be DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to the extent it seeks injunctive relief with respect to the alleged deficiencies in SCF's kosher diet.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court respectfully RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's Motion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief [#295] and CDOC Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) [#310] be DENIED.16
