Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
The plaintiff, Beverly Gagne, filed this action pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq.; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621, et seq.; and the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.; against her former employer, SAFE Federal Credit Union ("SAFE"). This matter is before the court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Civil Rule 73.02(B)(2) (D.S.C.) for a Report and Recommendation on the defendants' motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 34.) Gagne filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 42) and the defendant replied (ECF No. 57.) Having reviewed the parties' submissions and the applicable law, the court concludes that the defendant's motion should be granted.

BACKGROUND
The following facts are either undisputed or are taken in the light most favorable [*2]  to Gagne, to the extent they find support in the record. Gagne is the former Chief Executive Officer for SAFE. As CEO, she reported directly to the credit union's Board of Directors. In 2014-2015, Gagne began suffering from gastrointestinal problems and was ultimately diagnosed with microcolitis in 2015. She informed SAFE's Executive Vice President, but did not share the diagnosis with the Board until early 2016 after she received negative performance feedback. Also in 2016, Gagne began experiencing problems with her knees and shared that information with a Board member, and in August of 2016 she was diagnosed with bilateral knee osteoarthritis. Gagne turned sixty-five in 2016.
Although the credit union experienced marketing and financial successes under Gagne's leadership in 2015, SAFE's auditors from the National Credit Union Administration, a federal regulatory agency, identified various problems. Many of the issues identified were repeated from the year before. Gagne missed the pre-examination meeting without notice because of her gastrointestinal problems. The audit gave a score of three on a scale of one (best) to five (worst) for the Management category, which measured the performance [*3]  of the executive officers and the Board. This was a worse score than the 2014 score for that category. The audit also cited SAFE for various compliance issues. In the exit interview, the main auditor, Donald Thomas, specifically criticized Gagne, referring to her as an "absentee CEO" and expressing his opinion that Gagne's unexplained absence at the pre-examination meeting did not reflect well on her engagement in the process or on SAFE's management as a whole. When a Board member questioned the Executive Vice President about the auditor's comments, she expressed frustration about Gagne's frequent unexpected absences. The Board member investigated further by questioning other members of the credit union's executive team and received negative feedback from other senior executives about Gagne's management style. In addition to the unpredictable absences, they reported that she was not open to the input of others and that she considered her own opinion to be most important because she was the CEO. They criticized certain decisions Gagne had made as short-sighted and self-serving.
In early 2016, two Board members met with Gagne regarding the various performance issues and provided her with [*4]  a proposed Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP"). Gagne informed them of her gastrointestinal problems and asked for "understanding." (Gagne Dep. 108:5-110:1, ECF No. 34-2 at 64-66.) The Board did not issue the PIP to Gagne, but did ask her for a written response to the performance problems identified in the meeting and an action plan to correct them. After some prodding, Gagne responded but provided no action plan. According to SAFE, following the January 2016 meeting, Gagne's job was not in jeopardy. However, the Board evaluated her negatively in her March 2016 performance evaluation for the year 2015. At that evaluation, Board members showed her a recapitulation of her performance scores from prior years which showed a gradual, consistent decline in her performance ratings every year since 2010. In May 2016, the Board denied a merit-based pay increase for Gagne.
The credit union continued to experience financial success in 2016; however, SAFE fared no better in the 2016 audit by its regulators. Gagne missed the pre-examination meeting again. SAFE was again issued a deadline to correct various compliance problems. Nonetheless, in December 2016, the Board awarded its employees approximately [*5]  $ 230,000 in bonuses due to the credit union's financial success.
At a Board meeting on October 20, 2016, Gagne informed the Board that she was going to have double knee replacement surgery in early December; she requested FMLA leave for the surgery. The next day, the Board met with its outside consultant, Mark Arnold, who volunteered strong criticism of Gagne's performance as CEO. A few days later, NCUA auditor Ron Burn conducted an exit interview from the September 2016 exam. Mr. Burn was pointedly critical of Gagne, admonishing her for her absenteeism.
Around October 31, 2016, the Executive Committee of the Board met and decided to terminate Gagne's employment agreement. The Executive Vice President, who had tendered her resignation to accept a position as CEO of another credit union, assumed responsibility for the credit union's operations from November 1 to December 15, 2016. Darrell Merkel, who is four years older than Gagne, then served as Executive Vice President and the Interim CEO, ultimately being selected as permanent CEO in March 2017. Under Merkel's leadership, the credit union received similar scores in its annual audits as it had under Gagne's. Despite this, SAFE paid [*6]  Merkel a higher salary and awarded him bonuses.

DISCUSSION

A. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party "shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A party may support or refute that a material fact is not disputed by "citing to particular parts of materials in the record" or by "showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine [dispute] of material fact." Ballinger v. N.C. Agric. Extension Serv., 815 F.2d 1001, 1005 (4th Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A fact is "material" if proof of its existence or non-existence would affect the disposition of the case under the applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). An issue of material fact is "genuine" if the evidence offered is such that a reasonable jury might return a verdict for the non-movant. Id. at 257.
In discrimination cases, a party is entitled to summary judgment if [*7]  no reasonable jury could rule in the non-moving party's favor. Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d 639, 645 (4th Cir. 2002). The court cannot make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence, but the court should examine uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence offered by the moving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The court must determine whether a party's offered evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of discrimination and look at the strength of a party's case on its own terms. See id. at 148 (stating that "[c]ertainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational fact-finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory").

B. Methods of Proof in Employment Cases
A plaintiff asserting a claim of unlawful employment discrimination may proceed through two avenues of proof. First, she may attempt directly to prove discrimination with direct or circumstantial evidence. Alternatively, when direct proof is lacking, a plaintiff may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Diamond v. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 318 (4th Cir. 2005); see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (assuming that the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to ADEA claims); Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49-52, 124 S. Ct. 513, 157 L. Ed. 2d 357 & n.3 (2003) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework in ADA employment [*8]  discrimination case); Yashenko v. Harrah's NC Casino, Co., LLC, 446 F.3d 541, 550-51 (4th Cir. 2006) (analyzing claims of retaliation under the McDonnell Douglas framework); Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404, 430 (4th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (applying the McDonnell Douglas framework in ADEA employment discrimination cases); but see Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167, 175 n.2, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (noting that the Supreme Court "has not definitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of McDonnell Douglas . . . utilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context"). Pursuant to this framework, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight, 601 F.3d 289, 294 (4th Cir. 2010) (Title VII). The defendant's burden "is a burden of production, not persuasion." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142. Once a defendant meets this burden by producing affidavits or testimony demonstrating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, "the McDonnell Douglas framework—with its presumptions and burdens—disappear[s], and the sole remaining issue [is] discrimination vel non." Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
In other words, if the defendant meets the burden to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason [*9]  was "not its true reason[], but [was] a pretext for discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294 (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Accordingly, the plaintiff's burden of demonstrating pretext "merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [the plaintiff] has been the victim of intentional discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256) (alterations in original); see also Diamond v. Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 319 (4th Cir. 2005) (Title VII & 42 U.S.C. § 1981). To meet this "merged" burden, the employee may prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision maker's affidavit is untrue or that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.
"[A] plaintiff's prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated." Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. However, "if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff create[s] only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred," summary judgment is appropriate. Id. Accordingly, the court must evaluate "the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, [*10]  the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law." Id. at 148-49. "Notwithstanding the intricacies of proof schemes, the core of every [discrimination] case remains the same, necessitating resolution of the ultimate question of . . . whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination." Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294-95.

C. Gagne's Claims
As an initial matter, Gagne has expressly abandoned her causes of action based upon an alleged improper medical examination requirement and FMLA interference. (See generally Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Summ. J. at 1, ECF No. 42 at 1.) Additionally, for the reasons articulated by SAFE, any claims based on SAFE's decision to deny her a raise in May of 2016 are time barred. (See Def.'s Reply at 1-2, ECF No. 57 at 1-2.) The following claims warrant a more in-depth discussion: (1) discriminatory discharge based on age; (2) discriminatory discharge based on disability (knees);1 (3) retaliatory discharge based on the exercise of her FMLA rights for knee surgery; and (4) ADA failure to accommodate Gagne's microcolitis.

1. Claims Based on Termination [*11] 
Setting aside the ADA failure-to-accommodate claim which is addressed separately below, the other claims all require Gagne to demonstrate that but for the protected trait or activity, she would not have been terminated. See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (ADEA); Gentry v. E. W. Partners Club Mgmt. Co. Inc., 816 F.3d 228, 235-36 (4th Cir. 2016) (ADA); Foster v. Univ. of Maryland-E. Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 252 (4th Cir. 2015) (retaliation). Moreover, the discriminatory discharge claims require her to show as part of her prima facie case that she was meeting SAFE's legitimate expectations as to job performance. See O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 310-12, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996) (discussing the prima facie case under the ADEA); see also Warch v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510 (4th Cir. 2006) (ADEA); Reynolds v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, 701 F.3d 143, 150 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Rohan v. Networks Presentations LLC, 375 F.3d 266, 273 n.9 (4th Cir. 2004)) (providing prima facie test for disability discrimination); Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 252 F.3d 696 (4th Cir. 2001) (ADA). Finally, because the McDonnell Douglas framework applies to all of her claims based on her discharge, Gagne must show that SAFE's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for her termination was pretextual. Because the defendant's proffered reason for its actions is that the plaintiff was not meeting expectations, the evidence as to the prima facie issue and the pretext prong of the McDonnell Douglas framework overlaps; therefore, the court may address these issues together. See Warch v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510, 516 (4th Cir. 2006) (noting the flexibility of the McDonnell Douglas framework and finding "no impermeable barrier that prevents the employer's use of such evidence [*12]  [of an employee's performance] at different stages of the McDonnell Douglas framework").
Here, even if Gagne could meet the prima facie tests for her various discrimination claims,2 no reasonable jury could find on this record that SAFE's proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason—Gagne's declining performance as CEO—was a pretext for discrimination based on either her age, knee disability, or exercise of her FMLA rights for her knee surgery.3
A plaintiff's performance is evaluated at the time of the alleged adverse action and courts have recognized that "it is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self- assessment of the plaintiff." Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., 203 F.3d 274, 280 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting DeJarnette v. Corning Inc., 133 F.3d 293, 299 (4th Cir. 1998)); see also King v. Rumsfeld, 328 F.3d 145, 149 (4th Cir. 2003). An employer's expectations of its employees are considered "legitimate" when they are honestly held; whether the employee agrees with those expectations is not the test. Thornley v. Penton Pub., Inc., 104 F.3d 26, 30 (2d Cir. 1997) (stating that "a plaintiff must satisfy the employer's honestly-held expectations"). In this context, the term "legitimate" means that expectations cannot be a "sham designed to hide the employer's discriminatory purpose." Warch, 435 F.3d at 518. As long as the requirements imposed are bona fide expectations, it is not the court's province to determine [*13]  whether an employer demands too much of its workers. Coco v. Elmwood Care, Inc., 128 F.3d 1177, 1179 (7th Cir. 1997) (Posner, J.).
Although Gagne contends that she was not blameworthy for the performance problems attributed to her by the Board, as noted above, it is the perception of the decision maker that matters. See King, 328 F.3d at 149; Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 280. Here, multiple sources identified problems with Gagne's execution of her duties as CEO. Not only Board members, but members of her executive team, outside consultants, and the credit union's regulators also faulted Gagne for various problems. (See, e.g., Privette Decl. PP 9, 11-14, 16, 19, ECF No. 34-19 at 3-6; Privette Dep. 120:22-121:17, 122:3-124:7, ECF No. 34-18 at 12-16; Davis Dep. 214:3-21, ECF No. 34-12 at 33; Pratt Decl. PP 9, 12, ECF No. 34-20 at 2-3; CEO Performance Feedback, ECF No. 34-24; 2015 Performance Evaluation, ECF No. 34-9.) These varied sources of criticism preclude any inference that performance was a sham reason given by the Board to discriminate against her because of her age, knee problems, or exercise of her FMLA rights for knee surgery. Cf. Irani v. Palmetto Health, 767 F. App'x 399, 419 (4th Cir. 2019) (finding that it was clear plaintiff was not meeting his employer's legitimate expectations based in part on concerns expressed by numerous staff members). And [*14]  even if Gagne were correct that blame for the problems properly lay elsewhere, she has not disputed that the Board genuinely believed her to be responsible for them. (See, e.g., Gagne Dep. 96:19-97:20, 102:4-22, 119:14-21, 125:14-18, 148:25-149:8, 168:14-170:19, 185:11-16, ECF Nos. 34-2 at 55-56, 60, 69, 71, 88-89, 103-105, 118); see Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., 487 F.3d 208, 217-18 (4th Cir. 2007) (finding that no reasonable juror could conclude the decision maker's reason was pretextual where regardless of whether the threats were in fact made, the plaintiff's evidence "failed to address whether [the decision maker] did not honestly believe that the threats were made"); Hawkins, 203 F.3d at 279 ("[W]hen an employer gives a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for discharging the plaintiff, it is not our province to decide whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct, ultimately, so long as it truly was the reason for the plaintiff's termination.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Coco, 128 F.3d at 1179.
Moreover, specifically with respect to her age claim, eight of the Board members who voted to terminate her were older than Gagne. See McNeal v. Montgomery Cty., Md., 307 F. App'x 766, 775 (4th Cir. 2009) (observing that the fact that the decision maker "is the same age or older than the plaintiff is circumstantial evidence against [*15]  age discrimination"). And she was replaced by someone older than she, Darrell Merkel. Cf. O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 312-13, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996) (observing that an inference of discrimination "cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger"); Warch v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 435 F.3d 510, 513 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring a plaintiff to show "following his discharge, he was replaced by a substantially younger individual with comparable qualifications").4 As to her disability discrimination claim, it is based largely on her assertion that the Board voted to terminate her two weeks after she informed them of her upcoming knee replacement surgery. But although temporal proximity in certain circumstances can raise an inference of discrimination sufficient to make a prima facie case, it is alone usually insufficient to show pretext. See Mercer v. Arc of Prince Georges Cty., Inc., 532 F. App'x 392, 399 (4th Cir. 2013); see also Staley v. Gruenberg, 575 F. App'x 153 (4th Cir. 2014). Moreover, as SAFE points out, Gagne's apparent concession that SAFE actually treated other unidentified but allegedly disabled employees—i.e., employees within her protected class—more favorably than her precludes any reasonable inference that Plaintiff's alleged disability (as opposed to poor performance) was the true reason for her termination. Finally, as SAFE points out, it had previously approved FMLA leave for [*16]  Gagne in 2014 with no repercussions. (Gagne Dep. 38:13-24, ECF No. 34-2 at 17); cf. Sharif v. United Airlines, Inc., 841 F.3d 199, 205 (4th Cir. 2016) (finding that a record demonstrating that a defendant employer had approved all of the plaintiff employee's requests for FMLA leave was not "the record of a company that is historically hostile to FMLA leave in any discernable way").
Gagne seeks to demonstrate pretext by showing that her replacement's performance was comparable to hers, but Merkel was not terminated; rather, he was rewarded with higher pay and bonuses. The Fourth Circuit has recognized that comparator evidence, though not required, is "especially relevant to a showing of pretext." Laing v. Fed. Express Corp., 703 F.3d 713, 719-20 (4th Cir. 2013). Recently the court discussed the importance of comparator evidence, clarifying that a plaintiff need not demonstrate that the comparator is identically situated to her for a valid comparison. Haynes v. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d 219, 223-25 (4th Cir. 2019). The Haynes Court stated:
Turning first to the issue of an appropriate comparator, this Court has emphasized that a comparison between similar employees "will never involve precisely the same set of work-related offenses occurring over the same period of time and under the same sets of circumstances. Cook v. CSX Transp. Corp., 988 F.2d 507, 511 (4th Cir. 1993). Rather, to establish a valid comparator, the plaintiff must produce [*17]  evidence that the plaintiff and comparator "dealt with the same supervisor, [were] subject to the same standards and . . . engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it." Haywood v. Locke, 387 F. App'x 355, 359 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., 964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 1992)).
Id. at 223-24 (alterations and omission in original).
Accepting the importance of Gagne's comparison of her performance to Merkel's, the court nonetheless concludes that it is insufficient to show that SAFE's reason for terminating Gagne was pretextual. As an initial matter, Merkel cannot serve as a comparator for her age discrimination claim because he is older than Gagne, and therefore within her protected class. See Mitchell, 964 F.2d at 583 (Title VII & ADEA) (defining "similarly situated" as requiring the employees outside the protected class to have dealt with the same decision maker, been subject to the same standards, and engaged in the same conduct without mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it). With respect to her ADA disability and FMLA retaliation claims, even assuming Merkel is not disabled and did not engage in protected [*18]  activity, SAFE has presented unrefuted evidence that, although certain audit scores did not improve under Merkel's leadership, Gagne had additional performance problems that Merkel did not share. (See Def.'s Reply Mem. at 10, ECF No. 57 at 10) (explaining that Gagne also had performance ratings steadily declining for six years; that she received negative feedback regarding her leadership from executives, consultants, and NCUA examiners; and that Gagne failed to take responsibility to address these issues); Haynes, 922 F.3d at 223-24 (requiring that the plaintiff and the comparator "engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it") (quoting Haywood, 387 F. App'x at 359). Moreover, for all of the reasons discussed above, the overwhelming evidence of record precludes a reasonable finding that Gagne's knee problems or use of FMLA leave for knee replacement surgery was the true reason for or the but-for cause of her termination. See, e.g., Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148 (holding that "if the record conclusively reveal[s] some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff create[s] only a weak issue of fact as to whether [*19]  the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred," summary judgment is appropriate); Horne v. Reznick Fedder & Silverman, 154 F. App'x 361, 364 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding that any inference arising from temporal proximity was rebutted by the employer's communication that that the plaintiff's performance was sub-par before the alleged protected activity and by intervening events occurring thereafter). As Reeves instructs, the court must evaluate "the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law." Id. at 148-49. No reasonable jury could find on this record that Gagne was the victim of intentional discrimination based on her age, knee problems, or exercise of her FMLA rights. Merritt, 601 F.3d at 294-95.

2. ADA Failure to Accommodate
Gagne's claim that SAFE failed to accommodate her microcolitis fails because she cannot establish a prima facie case. To establish a prima facie case against her employer for failure to accommodate, a plaintiff must show: "(1) that [s]he was an individual who had a disability within [*20]  the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of [her] disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation [s]he could perform the essential functions of the position . . . ; and (4) that the [employer] refused to make such accommodations." Rhoads v. F.D.I.C., 257 F.3d 373, 387 n.11 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Mitchell v. Washingtonville Ctr. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 1, 6 (2d Cir. 1999)); see also Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp., 717 F.3d 337, 345 (4th Cir. 2013). Here, even assuming she could meet the first prong based on her microcolitis, she cannot show that she could perform the essential functions of her job or that SAFE refused her a reasonable accommodation.5 She cannot dispute that she was unexpectedly absent two years in a row during important meetings with SAFE's auditors. See Tyndall v. National Educ. Centers, Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) (stating that "[e]xcept in the unusual case where an employee can effectively perform all work-related duties at home, an employee who does not come to work cannot perform any of his job functions, essential or otherwise" and holding that "a regular and reliable level of attendance is a necessary element of most jobs") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). And her purported request for accommodation was simply that SAFE show "understanding." (Gagne Dep. 108:5-110:1, ECF No. 34-2 at 64-66.) Such a vague plea is insufficient to invoke the statutory process required by the ADA [*21]  to accommodate a disability. Cf. Freadman v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 484 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2007) (observing "[t]hat because an employee's disability and concomitant need for accommodation are often not known to the employer," "the plaintiff has the burden of showing that she sufficiently requested the accommodation in question" and such request "must be sufficiently direct and specific" and "must explain how the accommodation requested is linked to some disability") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 104 ("The employer has no duty to divine the need for a special accommodation where the employee fails to make an adequate request."). And even if it were sufficient to trigger the interactive process, to the extent this statement counts as a request for an accommodation of allowing unlimited absences without notice, such accommodation would not be a reasonable one. Compare 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (stating that a reasonable accommodation "may include . . . job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar [*22]  accommodations for individuals with disabilities.") with Tyndall, 31 F.3d at 215; Dark v. Curry Cty., 451 F.3d 1078, 1089 (9th Cir. 2006) ("The ADA does not require an employer to exempt an employee from performing essential functions or to reallocate essential functions to other employees."); Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., Md., 754 F. App'x 186, 189-90 (4th Cir. 2018) (providing that "[r]easonable accommodations can include reallocating marginal functions to another employee" but an employer never has to reallocate essential functions).

RECOMMENDATION
For all of the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 33) should be granted.
