Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
The above-styled case is presently before the Court on a motion [Doc. 9] to dismiss filed by Defendant Wellstar. Plaintiff Turjemia Robinson ("Robinson"), proceeding pro se, filed her complaint [Doc. 2] in this case on May 21, 2019. In her complaint, Plaintiff asserts claims against Defendant alleging disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments of 2008 ("ADAAA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq.2 [Doc. 2 - Plaintiff's Complaint ("Compl.")]. The matter has been fully briefed by the parties and is submitted to the undersigned for Report and Recommendation ("R&R") to the District Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B).3

I. Preliminary Matters
As a preliminary [*2]  matter, the Court addresses the record to be considered in resolving the instant motion. Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, entitled "Result of Presenting Matters Outside the Pleadings," reads:
If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) . . ., matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).
On February 12, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). [Compl. at 5, Exhibit A - EEOC Charge]. On February 27, 2019, Plaintiff received her Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter. [Compl. at 5, Exhibit B - Right-to-Sue Letter]. "A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes." F.T.C. v. AbbVie Prod. LLC, 713 F.3d 54, 63 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c)). Plaintiff's EEOC documents are properly considered in evaluating the instant motion without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See id.; see also Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, Inc., 116 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted); and see Dixon v. Philadelphia Housing Auth., 43 F. Supp. 2d 543, 545 (E.D. Pa. 1999) (the court considered plaintiff's EEOC complaint "without converting the motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion"); Greene v. Term City, Inc., 828 F. Supp. 584, 587 n.1 (N.D. Ill. 1993) ("the [*3]  court deems the EEOC charge to be part of the pleadings").
In addition to her EEOC documents, Plaintiff attaches to her complaint correspondence from the Social Security Administration to Plaintiff concerning a supplemental security income benefit. [Compl. at 9-11]. Presumably, Plaintiff relies on this document to show disability. "At the motion-to-dismiss stage, we consider the facts derived from a complaint's exhibits as part of the plaintiff's basic factual averments. . . . [The Court] even treat[s] specific facts demonstrated by exhibits as overriding more generalized or conclusory statements in the complaint itself." F.T.C., 713 F.3d at 63(internal citations omitted). The Court may also take judicial notice of matters of public record. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; and see Halmos v. Bomardier Aerospace Corp., 404 Fed. Appx. 376, 377 (11th Cir. 2010) (approving of district court's consideration at Rule 12(b)(6) of the complaint, attachments to the complaint, and matters of public record); and see Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S. Ct. 2499, 2509 (2007) (on a motion to dismiss, court must consider the complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which the court may take judicial notice) (citation omitted).
However, unless the District Court elects to convert the Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment [*4]  under Rule 56, many of Defendant's exhibits must be excluded. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). In support of its motion, Defendant attaches a "Declaration of Detra Bickerstaff" and multiple exhibits, several of which reflect email and text message exchanges that Plaintiff references within her complaint. [Doc. 9-1 - Declaration of Detra Bickerstaff ("Bickerstaff Decl."), Exhibits 1 through 12]. With the exception of any exhibit expressly discussed within the R&R (i.e., Plaintiff's 7/21/18 email to Detra Bickerstaff complaining about 7/21/18 telephone conversations with Manager Audrey Berry), the Bickerstaff Declaration and Defendant's documentary exhibits are not considered in evaluating the sufficiency of Plaintiff's complaint.

II. Factual Background
On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the complaint's factual allegations are assumed true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Hardy v. Regions Mortg., Inc., 449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir. 2006); M.T.V. v. DeKalb Cty. School Dist., 446 F.3d 1153, 1156 (11th Cir. 2006). "However, conclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of facts or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the following factual allegations are drawn from the complaint as well as those documents attached to or referenced within Plaintiff's complaint and deemed [*5]  central to her claims.
On or about November 5, 2017, Plaintiff began her employment with Defendant Wellstar when hired as a Weekend Unit Secretary. [Compl. at 4]. Plaintiff alleges that, on July 21, 2018, her supervisor, Audrey Berry ("Berry"), yelled and screamed at Plaintiff for not answering the unit phone in a timely manner. [Id.]. Plaintiff was not able to answer the phone because she was assisting a nurse with a patient. [Id.]. The same day, Plaintiff filed a complaint with Defendant's Human Resources ("HR") Office reporting what Plaintiff described as verbal abuse by her supervisor. [Id.].4
On or about July 24, 2018, Teresa Minefee ("Minefee") with HR held a meeting to discuss Plaintiff's complaint about the July 21, 2018, events. [Id.]. Lenore Rodgers ("Rodgers"), Director of Telemetry, was also present at the meeting. [Id.]. Plaintiff advised Minefee and Rodgers that she was a survivor of trauma and suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disease ("PTSD"). [Id.]. Plaintiff also shared that she was very uncomfortable with the way Berry was treating her while performing her duties and that Berry's verbal abuse and treatment "would trigger symptoms of . . . PTSD within Plaintiff." [ [*6] Id.].
On or about July 26, 2018, a second meeting was held to discuss Plaintiff's July 21, 2018, complaint with Minefee, Berry, and Plaintiff. [Id.]. During the meeting, Plaintiff again explained that she suffered from PTSD and that Berry's conduct was a trigger for Plaintiff's PTSD symptoms. [Id.]. Plaintiff requested "[r]easonable [a]ccommodation paperwork" from Berry and Minefee but was refused. [Id.]. Berry "stated that she did not believe that Plaintiff was disabled." [Id.].5
On or about October 12, 2018, a co-worker accused Plaintiff of threatening her in text messages. [Id.]. Plaintiff and the co-worker were friends outside of work. [Id.]. Plaintiff received a text message from Berry stating that Plaintiff was under investigatory leave and was being placed on suspension due to the text messages between Plaintiff and her co-worker. [Id.].6 Plaintiff's co-worker was allowed to continue to come to work, and there was no disciplinary action taken against the co-worker. [Id.]. Plaintiff attempted to reach Berry for an explanation but was unsuccessful. [Id.]. Plaintiff sent Berry an email containing the screenshot and text message conversation between Plaintiff and her co-worker. [Id. [*7] ]. Plaintiff was on investigatory leave for one month and alleges that her stress level went up, that her PTSD symptoms flared up, and that she became suicidal because she did not know if she was going to have a job. [Id.].
On or about November 1, 2018, Plaintiff contacted WHS Corporate Headquarters to find out the results of the investigative leave. [Compl. at 4]. The representative Plaintiff spoke with advised Plaintiff that "there was no history or record of any disciplinary actions or investigation in Plaintiff's employee file" and that "Plaintiff was still listed as an active employee as of November 1, 2018."
On or about November 9, 2018, Supervisor Audrey Berry terminated Plaintiff "in retaliation for Plaintiff's reporting the supervisory harassment." [Id.].7 Plaintiff filed her EEOC Charge on February 12, 2019, alleging disability discrimination and retaliation occurring between July 21, 2018, and November 9, 2018. [EEOC Charge]. On February 27, 2019, Plaintiff received her Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter from the EEOC. [Right-to-Sue Notice]. Plaintiff commenced her lawsuit on May 21, 2019, with the filing of her complaint. [Doc. 2].

III. Plaintiff's Complaint Is Limited By [*8]  The Allegations Within Her EEOC Charge
Defendant initially raises three issues concerning the scope of Plaintiff's judicial complaint. Defendant construes Plaintiff's complaint as alleging violation of Title VII and argues that Plaintiff did not administratively exhaust any Title VII claim. [Doc. 9 at 9-10]. In addition, Defendant contends that Plaintiff may not allege in her complaint that she was terminated given that her EEOC Charge alleges that she was constructively discharged. [Doc. 9 at 11-14]. Defendant finally contends that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e), Plaintiff cannot rely on any allegations of discriminatory or retaliatory conduct that occurred more than 180 days before filing her EEOC Charge, or prior to August 16, 2018. [Doc. 9 at 13 n.10].
Both Title VII and the ADA require Plaintiff to exhaust her administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e) (Title VII); 42 U.S.C. §§ 12117 (ADA); Anderson v. Embarq/Sprint, 379 Fed. Appx. 924, 926 (11th Cir. 2010) ("Before filing suit under Title VII, . . . a plaintiff must exhaust the available administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC.") (citation omitted); and see Maynard v. Pneumatic Products Corp., 256 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2001) (ADA requires exhaustion) (citations omitted); see also Latson v. Holder, 82 F. Supp. 3d 377, 385-86 (D. D.C. March 9, 2015) (citations omitted). It is well established in the Eleventh Circuit that a "'plaintiff's judicial complaint is limited [*9]  by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.'" Gregory v. Georgia Dep't of Human Resources, 355 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted); accord Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 465-66 (5th Cir. 1970) (deciding as a matter of first impression the standard to be utilized in measuring the proper scope of an EEOC complaint).8 "Claims omitted from the EEOC charge may still be litigated when 'reasonably related' to those claims brought in the EEOC charge." Waldemar v. American Cancer Soc., 971 F. Supp. 547, 553 (N.D. Ga. 1996) (citing Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466). "If not reasonably related, the court is precluded from considering claims not raised in the EEOC complaint." Waldemar, 971 F. Supp. at 553 (citation omitted). The reason for this rule is that under the statutory scheme of Title VII, the EEOC is given the first opportunity to investigate the alleged discrimination and attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466. Thus, raising a claim at the administrative level is a condition precedent to filing a Title VII or ADA action asserting a given claim. See Fort Bend Cty., Texas v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 1843, 1846 (2019) (holding that Title VII's charge-filing requirement is not jurisdictional); accord Giles v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 542 Fed. Appx. 756, 758 (11th Cir. 2013) ("as a condition precedent to filing a law suit an individual must exhaust [her] administrative remedies by filing a charge of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC").
"The starting point of ascertaining the permissible [*10]  scope of a judicial complaint is the administrative charge and investigation." Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516, 1522 (11th Cir. 1985). In Wu v. Thomas, 863 F.2d 1543 (11th Cir. 1989), the Eleventh Circuit explained as follows:
As long as allegations in the judicial complaint and proof are reasonably related to charges in the administrative filing and no material differences between them exist, the court will entertain them. . . . Judicial claims which serve to amplify, clarify, or more clearly focus earlier EEO complaints are appropriate. Allegations of new acts of discrimination, offered as the essential basis for the requested judicial review are not appropriate.
Id. at 1547 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, in determining whether a claim has been exhausted, the scope of Plaintiff's EEOC Charge is not to be strictly construed. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 465 (citations omitted); accord Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280 (quoting Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 465). With these principles in mind, the undersigned considers "whether [Plaintiff's] complaint [i]s like or related to, or grew out of, the allegations contained in her EEOC charge[s]." Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280.
Plaintiff's February 12, 2019, EEOC Charge indicates that Plaintiff is complaining of discrimination based on "RETALIATION" and "DISABILITY" that occurred between July 21, 2018, and November 9, 2018. [EEOC Charge]. The [*11]  particulars of her EEOC Charge are described by Plaintiff as follows:
I was hired by [Wellstar] on November 5, 2017, as a Weekend Unit Secretary. On July 12, 2018, Audrey Berry, Supervisor, was verbally abusive toward me. I filed a complaint with HR regarding her verbal abuse and requested an accommodation due to my disability. The verbal abuse stopped. On October 12, 2018, [a] co-worker accused me of threatening her in a text message. I was immediately suspended. On November 9, 2018, I was constructively discharged.
I believe I have been discriminated against because of my disability and retaliated against for opposing unlawful employment practices, in violation of Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended.
[EEOC Charge]. Plaintiff references only the ADA, and the substantive allegations within Plaintiff's EEOC Charge solely involve disability-related issues and retaliation for reporting supervisory harassment. [Doc. 9 at 9-10].
Plaintiff's judicial complaint alleges that she was discriminated against "because of her disability" and retaliated against "for Plaintiff's reporting the supervisory harassment." [Compl. at 4]. She alleges that Defendant engaged in "intentional disability discrimination in the terms and [*12]  conditions of [her] employment, including, but not limited to . . . [her] termination." [Id. (emphasis added)]. Plaintiff does not identify any protected characteristic under Title VII in her complaint and does not allege any other type of discrimination other than disability discrimination.9 [Id.]. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's complaint, as currently pled and construed liberally, does not allege any facts that could plausibly support a Title VII claim and, therefore, that the complaint does not present an administrative exhaustion issue as to Title VII. The Court will RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss be DENIED as MOOT with respect to any Title VII claim.
Defendant next contends that Plaintiff is precluded from asserting in this court that she was terminated from employment since Plaintiff's EEOC Charge alleges that she was constructive discharged.10 [Doc. 9 at 11-14]. In her pro se complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she was placed on investigatory leave for approximately one month and subsequently terminated by Berry on or about November 9, 2018, "in retaliation for Plaintiff's reporting the supervisory harassment." [Compl. at 4 (emphasis [*13]  added)]. Plaintiff's complaint does not allege "constructive discharge." [Compl.].11
Under Gregory, "[t]he proper inquiry . . . is whether [Plaintiff's] complaint [i]s like or related to, or grew out of, the allegations contained in her EEOC charge." 355 F.3d at 1280; and see Wu, 863 F.2d at 1547. However, "allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate." Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1280; accord Wu, 863 F.2d at 1547 (citing, inter alia, Danner v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 445 F.2d 159, 162 (5th Cir. 1971)). As an initial matter, Plaintiff's complaint alleges termination as of November 9, 2018, so Plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim is not premised upon facts occurring after she filed her EEOC Charge. [Compl. at 4]. "Even for retaliation claims, which may grow out of an initial charge, when the alleged retaliatory action occurs before an EEOC charge is filed, a plaintiff must exhaust . . . her administrative remedies as to that claim by including factual information in the charge that discloses the factual basis for the claim." Prewitt v. City of Northport, Alabama, 2017 WL 2719319, at *7 (N.D. Ala. June 23, 2017) (citing Thomas v. Miami Dade Public Health Trust, 369 Fed. Appx. 19, 22 (11th Cir. 2010)) (emphasis in original). And "[t]o prove constructive discharge, the employee[ ] must demonstrate that [her] working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in [her] position would be compelled to resign." Kilgore v. Thompson & Brock Mgmt., Inc., 93 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wardwell v. School Bd., 786 F.2d 1554, 1557 (11th Cir. 1986). As [*14]  such, a constructive discharge claim is more involved than an ordinary discriminatory termination claim. See Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 2354-55 (2004) (discussing in dicta similarities and differences between actual termination and constructive discharge); and see Rodriguez v. U.S. Postal Service, 1989 WL 57158, at *1 (D. P.R. May 16, 1989) (holding that plaintiff failed to exhaust constructive discharge claim, in part, "because the facts necessary to prove a constructive discharge include many matters which are unrelated and in addition to the elements of a normal discriminatory termination case") (citation omitted). Still, "courts do not strictly interpret the scope of [the] EEOC charge itself because charging parties often prepare EEOC charges by workers who lack education or sophistication without the assistance of counsel." Freeman v. Koch Foods of Alabama, 777 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1276-77 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original); accord Gregory, 355 F.3d at 1278 (noting that plaintiff's EEOC charge of discrimination was filed "without the aid of counsel") (emphasis in original).12
Here, Plaintiff's EEOC Charge alleges a form or type of termination, namely, constructive discharge. [EEOC Charge]. And, in terms of Plaintiff's alleged harm, the EEOC was placed on notice that Robinson was no longer employed by Defendant [*15]  Wellstar and could be expected to learn the underlying facts (or the parties' respective versions of the facts) by way of its investigation of Plaintiff's EEOC complaint.13 Despite the differences in the nature of proof, the Court finds that Plaintiff's pro se complaint broadly alleging termination of employment is, therefore, reasonably related to her claim of constructive discharge.14 See Freeman, 777 F. Supp. 2d at 1277 ( "the 'like or related' standard for determining the extent of a reasonable EEOC investigation - and therefore, the scope of an EEOC charge—is a 'liberal' one") (citation omitted). Construed liberally, the Court finds that Plaintiff's general claim of "termination" is exhausted. The Court will RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss be DENIED as to this issue.
Defendant finally argues that all factual allegations concerning events before August 16, 2018, are untimely and barred as such. [Doc. 9 at 13 n.10]. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e), a Title VII litigant must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. See, e.g., Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, 102 S. Ct. 1127 (1982). As stated supra, the ADA has adopted Title VII's administrative filing requirements. See 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a). Thus, Title VII's 180-day limitations [*16]  period also applies to claims brought under the ADA. See Brewer v. Alabama, 111 F. Supp. 2d 1197, 1204 (M.D. Ala. 2000) (citations omitted). Title VII provides, in pertinent part, "A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e). The Eleventh Circuit has held that a failure to file a charge with the EEOC within the 180-day time period bars a plaintiff's Title VII claims. See Pijnenburg v. West Georgia Health Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir. 2001) ("It is settled law that in order to obtain judicial consideration of [an ADA] claim, a plaintiff must first file an administrative charge with the EEOC within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred."); Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 980 F.2d 648, 662 (11th Cir. 1993).
In this case, Plaintiff filed her EEOC charge on February 12, 2019. [EEOC Charge]. This means that any discriminatory employment action that occurred before August 16, 2018, is time barred because it is outside the 180-day period. "[D]iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges." National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2072 (2002); and see Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., 324 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir. 2003); see also Greason v. Georgia Dep't of Revenue, Civil Action No. 1:11-CV-4506-TWT-JFK (N.D. Ga. May 10, 2013) (applying Morgan). "Discrete acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire are easy to identify." Morgan, 122 S. Ct. at 2073. As previously noted, Plaintiff did not [*17]  allege a continuing action in either her EEOC Charge or her complaint.15 [EEOC Charge; Compl.]. Indeed, in both documents, Plaintiff concedes that Berry's conduct (i.e., alleged supervisory harassment) ceased after Plaintiff complained to HR on July 21, 2018.16 [EEOC Charge; Compl. at 3].
To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to allege a disability discrimination claim based upon Defendant's failure to provide reasonable accommodation, discussed infra, her request for reasonable accommodation paperwork in the July 26, 2018, meeting is also outside of the 180-day limitations period. As previously discussed, Plaintiff Robinson alleges that she requested reasonable accommodation paperwork for her PTSD from Berry and Minefee in the July 26, 2018, meeting but was refused. [Compl. at 3-4]. The July 26, 2018, meeting in which Plaintiff allegedly requested reasonable accommodation paperwork is beyond the 180-day limitations period and before August 16, 2018. Plaintiff cannot rely on the July 26, 2018, meeting to establish a failure to accommodate claim.
The Court will RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND that Plaintiff not be allowed to rely upon allegations of discriminatory employment actions that occurred before [*18]  August 16, 2018.17

IV. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard
In general, a pleading must include "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). However, in order to withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint must plead "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1974 (2007); accord Ray v. Spirit Airlines, Inc., 836 F.3d 1340, 1348 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1974). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (citing Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1955). The factual allegations in the complaint must be "enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level[.]" Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965; accord Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). In addition, the allegations must "succeed[ ] in identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render [the necessary elements of a claim] plausible." Watts v. Florida Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965) (internal quotation marks omitted).
In evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, the Court first "identif[ies] pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950 (discussing two-pronged approach prescribed by Twombly). Next, the Court "assume[s] the[ ] veracity" of the complaint's "well-pleaded factual [*19]  allegations" and "determine[s] whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief" - "a context-specific task that requires [the Court] to draw on its judicial experience and common sense." Id. If the pleading "contain[s] enough information regarding the material elements of a cause of action to support recovery under some 'viable legal theory,'" it satisfies the notice pleading standard. American Federation of Labor & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. City of Miami, 637 F.3d 1178, 1186 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Roe v. Aware Woman Ctr. for Choice, Inc., 253 F.3d 678, 683-84 (11th Cir. 2001)). Dismissal of a well-pleaded complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is not proper "simply because 'it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable[.]'" Watts, 495 F.3d at 1295 (quoting Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1965).
"Pro se pleadings are held to a less demanding standard than counseled pleadings and should be liberally construed." Thomason v. OneWest Bank, FSB, 596 Fed. Appx. 736, 739 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Gilmore v. Hodges, 738 F.3d 266, 281 (11th Cir. 2013)); accord Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200 (2007) ("A document filed pro se is 'to be liberally construed' . . . and 'a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers[.]'") (citations omitted). Nevertheless, nothing in that leniency excuses a plaintiff from compliance with threshold requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. "Even though a pro se complaint should be construed liberally, a pro se complaint still must state a claim upon [*20]  which the Court can grant relief." Grigsby v. Thomas, 506 F. Supp. 2d 26, 28 (D. D.C. 2007).
The Court will apply these standards in ruling on Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss.

V. Discussion
Defendant moves for dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint on the following grounds: (1) Robinson resigned her employment and cannot assert any timely factual allegations to support a constructive discharge theory of recovery; and (2) Wellstar possessed legitimate non-pretextual reasons for taking the actions it took against Robinson during her employment. As Defendant readily admits, both legal arguments are summary judgment arguments and this is revealed by Defendant's reliance on its exhibits (evidence) as opposed to deficiencies in Plaintiff's pleading. [Doc. 9 at 11 n.8]. The Court considers whether Plaintiff's complaint alleges any plausible claim under the ADA.

A. The Americans With Disabilities Act of 199018
"In enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Congress intended that the Act 'provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities' and provide broad coverage[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(1)(2008). The ADA was "designed [in part] to . . . enable . . . persons [with disabilities] 'to compete in the workplace and the [*21]  job market based on the same performance standards and requirements expected of persons who are not disabled.'" Paleologos v. Rehab Consultants, Inc., 990 F. Supp. 1460, 1464 (N.D. Ga. 1998) (quoting Harding v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 907 F. Supp. 386, 389 (M.D. Fla. 1995)). The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); see also Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001).
"Subchapter I of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on account of disability in employment, covers the same employers and provides the same remedies contained in Title VII. . . ." Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117). As a result, "[t]he ADA adopts in large part the Title VII case precedent[,]" and "courts have used the Title VII cases as a guide for determining employer liability under the ADA." Huck v. Mega Nursing Services, Inc., 989 F. Supp. 1462, 1463 (S.D. Fla. 1997); and see Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C ., 492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2007); accord Durley v. APAC, Inc., 236 F.3d 651, 657 (11th Cir. 2000) (applying analytical framework prescribed in McDonnell Douglas19 and Title VII cases in the context of ADA disability discrimination case) (citation omitted).

1. Alleged Discrimination Based Upon Plaintiff's Disability
"'[T]here are two distinct categories of disability discrimination claims under the ADA: (1) failure to accommodate and (2) disparate treatment.'" [*22] 20Groover v. Fayette Cty., Georgia, 2018 WL 9490076, at *5 (N.D. Ga. July 27, 2018), report and recommendation adopted by 2018 WL 9490350 (N.D. Ga. September 17, 2018) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Eckerd Corp., 2012 WL 2726766, at *4 (N.D. Ga. July 9, 2012)).
To establish a prima facie case of disability-based discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she has a disability as defined in the ADA; (2) she is a "qualified individual," meaning that, with or without reasonable accommodations, she can perform the essential functions of the job she holds; and (3) she was discriminated against because of her disability. See Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int'l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256); Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2007).
"To state [an ADA disability] discrimination claim, a complaint need only provide enough factual matter to 'plausibly suggest' that the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action due to intentional discrimination." Davis v. Johnson, 2016 WL 3360568, at *3 (N.D. Ga. April 22, 2016) (quoting Surtain v. Hamlin Terrace Foundation, 789 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir. 2015)), report and recommendation adopted by 2016 WL 3349343 (N.D. Ga. June 15, 2016). The Eleventh Circuit clarified in Surtain that the Iqbal-Twombly pleading standard governs the motion to dismiss analysis — not the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting evidentiary framework. See Surtain, 789 F.3d at 1245-46 (holding that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework is not the governing standard in deciding motion for default, which requires the court to find a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered and is akin to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim). [*23]  However, that framework provides a useful tool to analyze the sufficiency of the complaint.

a. Disability
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she has a disability as it is defined under the ADA. The ADA defines the term "disability" as "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment . . . ."21 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A)-(C) (2009).
In this case, Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that she suffers from PTSD. [Compl. at 3]. Presumably, Plaintiff seeks to proceed under Subsections (A) or (B) of § 12102(1) and allege that she is, in fact, disabled or has a record of impairment.22 "While PTSD is a mental impairment, PTSD, in and of itself, does not necessarily meet the statutory definition of an ADA disability." Miller v. FED EX Corp. Office, 2008 WL 3020884, at *11 (N.D. Fla. July 30, 2008) (citing, inter alia, Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 135 F.3d 1047, 1050 (5th Cir. 1998) ("PTSD . . . standing alone, is not necessarily a disability contemplated by the ADA.")). Rather, in order to fall within the protection of the ADA, "[P]laintiff must demonstrate that her PTSD was such that it substantially limited a major life activity." Id., at **11-12 (citing, inter alia, 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(g)(1)) (granting summary judgment in favor of defendant where plaintiff [*24]  did not present "any evidence to show that she was unable to perform tasks central to most people's daily lives").23 The complaint further alleges that Plaintiff's interactions with her supervisor trigger PTSD-related symptoms. [Compl. at 3-4].24 Construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Plaintiff's allegation that she suffers from PTSD is sufficient to plausibly allege disability. See Walker v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours and Co., 199 F. Supp. 3d 883, 896 (D. Del. 2016) (finding first element of prima facie disability discrimination claim satisfied where defendant was aware that plaintiff suffered from PTSD and had received treatment for the condition and was also aware that plaintiff had uncontrollable outbursts related to diagnosed PTSD) (summary judgment); and see Miller, 2008 WL 3020884, at **11-12.

b. Qualified Individual
Plaintiff also has to allege facts that plausibly show she is a "qualified individual." For purposes of the ADA:
The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. . . .
42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). "Accordingly, an ADA plaintiff must show either that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job without accommodation, or, [*25]  failing that, show that [she] can perform the essential functions of [her] job with a reasonable accommodation." D'Angelo v. Conagra Foods, 422 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant time period for evaluating whether an individual is "qualified" is at the time of termination. See Paleologos, 990 F. Supp. at 1466. Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that she "performed her duties in a satisfactory or above manner" throughout the course of her employment. [Compl. at 3]. Defendant does not address all of the prima facie elements of a disability discrimination claim in its memorandum of law and does not expressly challenge the qualified individual element for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6). [Doc. 9]. For purposes of the instant Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, the Court finds that this prima facie element is established.

c. Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff may seek to establish disability discrimination under the ADA by alleging Defendant's failure to provide reasonable accommodations or by alleging disparate treatment. See Groover, 2018 WL 9490076, at *5.

i. Disparate Treatment
"Liability in a disparate-treatment case depends on whether the protected trait . . . actually motivated the employer's decision." Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 124 S. Ct. 513, 519 (2003) (acknowledging that disparate treatment claims are cognizable under the ADA) (citation [*26]  and internal quotation marks omitted). In order to plead a prima facie case of disability discrimination based upon disparate treatment, Plaintiff must allege facts plausibly showing that: 1) Plaintiff was a member of a protected class (i.e., disability); 2) Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action; and 3) Plaintiff's employer treated similarly situated employees outside the protected class differently or more favorably. See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., 376 F.3d 1079, 1087, 1091 (11th Cir. 2004) (Title VII action before the court on motion for summary judgment); accord Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir. 2008) (same); and see Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997). The Court has already found sufficient facts to allege disability. And the Court will presume adverse employment action given Plaintiff's allegation that she was terminated from employment.25
"A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 127 S. Ct. at 1955). As currently pled, Plaintiff's complaint does not allege any facts that employees outside of her protected class (without disability) were treated differently or more favorably. The only factual allegation in Plaintiff's complaint that could even potentially support a claim [*27]  of disparate treatment is her allegation that, following the October 2018 incident with her co-worker, Plaintiff was suspended and her co-worker was not. [Compl. at 4]. However, Plaintiff's complaint does not even allege that the decision to suspend Plaintiff and place her on investigatory leave was made because of her disability, and there are no other facts that plausibly give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus due to disability. [Id.]. Accepting Plaintiff's current factual allegations as true, and construing the complaint liberally, Plaintiff's complaint does not allege sufficient facts in support of a disparate treatment theory under the ADA.
The Court will RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss be GRANTED as to this issue and that any disability discrimination claim based upon disparate treatment be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

ii. Failure To Accommodate
Plaintiff appears to assert a failure to accommodate claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). "[A]n employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is 'otherwise qualified,' and unless the employer can show undue hardship."26 Holly, 492 F.3d at 1262 [*28]  (emphasis in original); and see McKane v. UBS Financial Services, Inc., 363 Fed. Appx. 679, 681 (11th Cir. 2010) (recognizing an employer's failure to provide reasonable accommodation as the third prima facie element in ADA failure to accommodate claim and one way a plaintiff can show disability discrimination) (citing Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)).
"An accommodation is 'reasonable' and necessary under the ADA only if it enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job." Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1259-60; and see Holly, 492 F.3d at 1256 (citation omitted). "The burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow a qualified employee to perform the essential functions of her job rests with that employee, as does the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to showing that such accommodation is reasonable." Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1367 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997); accord Gilliard v. Georgia Dep't of Corrections, 500 Fed. Appx. 860, 868 (11th Cir. 2012) (applying Stewart). "Moreover, an employer's duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made." Frazier-White v. Gee, 818 F.3d 1249, 1255-56 (11th Cir. 2016) (citation and internal quotation omitted); accord Cazeau v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 614 Fed. Appx. 972, 982 (11th Cir. 2015).
A "reasonable accommodation" may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, . . . and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(b); see also Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621, 626 (11th Cir. 1998) (inclusion of a particular type of accommodation in the ADA does not mean that the accommodation is automatically deemed "reasonable"). Whether an accommodation is reasonable depends upon the specific facts and circumstances of the [*29]  case. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285. To be sure, "[a]n employee with a disability is not entitled to the accommodation of his choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation." McKane, 363 Fed. Appx. at 681 (citing Earl, 207 F. 3d at 1367); see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1285 (employer is not required to provide an employee with "'the maximum accommodation or every conceivable accommodation possible'") (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 947 (N.D. Ga. 1997)). Finally, it is the employee's burden to establish that a reasonable accommodation exists before an employer has any duty to engage in an "interactive process" or establish that it could not provide the requested accommodation because of undue hardship. Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.
In this case, Plaintiff alleges that she advised Minefee and Berry that she suffered from PTSD in July 2018. [Compl. at 3-4]. Plaintiff Robinson further alleges that she requested reasonable accommodation paperwork from Berry and Minefee in the July 26, 2018, meeting but was refused. [Id.]. Robinson does not allege or identify any particular accommodation that she intended to request or even indicate if she ever formally made a request. [Id.]. Moreover, as previously discussed, the July 26, 2018, meeting is beyond the 180-day limitations period and cannot be relied upon to support this claim. The complaint contains no other factual [*30]  allegations concerning any actions taken by Plaintiff after her request for reasonable accommodation paperwork was refused. [Id.]. It is true that Rule 8 does not require that Plaintiff's complaint provide detailed factual allegations or "allege with precision each element of [her] claim[s] . . . ." Financial Sec. Assurance, Inc., 500 F.3d at 1282 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); and see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). However, at minimum, Plaintiff must allege that she did more than request "reasonable accommodation paperwork" in a meeting that falls beyond the 180-day statutory limitations period. Construing the factual allegations within the complaint liberally, Plaintiff's complaint fails to plausibly allege a disability discrimination claim based upon failure to provide reasonable accommodations.
The Court will RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] be GRANTED as to this issue and that Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim based upon failure to provide reasonable accommodation be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

2. Retaliation
The ADA provides that "[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, [*31]  testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter." 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a).27 To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, a plaintiff must show the same elements generally required for a claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the expression and the adverse employment action. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287; and see Crawford, 529 F.3d at 970 (explaining that, for purposes of Title VII retaliation claim, "the type of employer conduct considered actionable has been broadened").
With regard to protected activity, Title VII's anti-retaliation provision provides for two distinct types of statutorily protected conduct. See EEOC v. Total Sys. Services, Inc., 221 F.3d 1171, 1174-75 (11th Cir. 2000) (distinguishing between the opposition clause and the participation clause). "An employee is protected from discrimination if (1) 'he has opposed any practice made an unlawful practice by [Title VII]' (the opposition clause) or (2) 'he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under [Title VII]' (the participation clause)." [*32]  Clover v. Total Sys. Services, Inc., 176 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting § 2000e-3(a)).
Regarding adverse action, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim "must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Conde v. Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters Local Union 728, 2017 WL 1395519, at **5-6 (N.D. Ga. March 24, 2017) (applying Burlington).
As for causation, "the plaintiff must [allege facts to support an inference] that 'the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.'" Taylor v. Cardiovascular Specialists, P.C., 4 F. Supp. 3d 1374, 1383 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (quoting Univ. of Texas Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533 (2013)); accord Duncan v. Johnson, 213 F. Supp. 3d 161, 184-85 (D. D.C. 2016) (summary judgment context).

a. Protected Activity
The first prima facie element requires Plaintiff to show that she engaged in protected expression as it is defined under the ADA. This element may be met by a request for a reasonable accommodation or the filing of an EEOC charge. See Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (first prima facie element of ADA retaliation claim that plaintiff engage in statutorily protected expression satisfied by request for accommodation); see also Hanig v. Yorktown Central School Dist., 384 F. Supp. 2d 710, 724 (S.D. N.Y. 2005) (filing of EEOC charge well-established as statutorily protected activity under ADA) (citations omitted). [*33]  Plaintiff is unable to rely on her February 12, 2019, EEOC Charge as statutorily protected expression under the participation clause because it was filed approximately three months after she separated from employment with Wellstar.28
The Court next looks to Plaintiff's allegations of protected activity under the opposition clause, which encompasses any "activity that occurs before the filing of a formal charge with the EEOC, such as submitting an internal complaint of discrimination to an employer, or informally complaining of discrimination to a supervisor." Snell v. Columbus Consol. Government, 2010 WL 2723086, at *6 (M.D. Ga. July 7, 2010) (citing Total Sys. Services, Inc., 221 F.3d at 1174-75). "[A]n employee who seeks protection under the opposition clause must have a 'good faith reasonable belief' that [the] employer has engaged in unlawful discrimination." Clover, 176 F.3d at 1351 (quoting Little v. United Technologies, Carrier Transicold Div., 103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir. 1997)); and see generally Taylor, 4 F. Supp. 3d at 1378-81 (thorough discussion of opposition clause and application). The "good faith reasonable belief" requirement imposes a burden on the plaintiff to "show that [she] subjectively (that is, in good faith) believed that [her] employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices, but also that [her] belief was objectively reasonable in light of the facts and record presented." Little, 103 F.3d at 960 (emphases in original); [*34]  and see Arafat v. School Bd. of Broward Cty., 549 Fed. Appx. 872, 875 (11th Cir. 2013) (upholding dismissal of retaliation claim and stating, "it was not objectively reasonable for [the plaintiff] to believe the single incident of touching alleged here was an unlawful employment practice [and so] her reporting of that incident was not a protected expression")).
As previously noted, Plaintiff alleges that she submitted a complaint to Bickerstaff in HR via email on July 21, 2018, to complain about supervisor harassment. [Compl. at 3; Doc. 9-1 at 14-15]. Construing Plaintiff's allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, her July 21, 2018, email could be deemed an informal (internal) complaint. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a) (protecting opposition of conduct "made unlawful by this chapter"). However, Plaintiff Robinson does not allege that she complained of ADA-protected activity. [Compl. at 4-5; Doc. 9-1 at 14-15]. In order to be ADA protected activity, Plaintiff's complaint to HR must concern disability. See, e.g., Coutu v. Martin Cty. Bd. of Cty. Commissioners, 47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in original) ("Unfair treatment, absent discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, is not an unlawful employment practice under Title VII."); accord Jacobs v. Alorica, 2016 WL 1337315, at *4 (N.D. Ga. March 31, 2016) (plaintiff's complaints to her employer regarding alleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation [*35]  based on false allegations about plaintiff's hygiene, inappropriate workplace behaviors, and her allergies, which are not protected characteristics under Title VII, did not sufficiently allege Title VII protected activity, and did not plausibly allege Title VII retaliation claim). Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Berry's speech and volume when talking to her on the phone was abusive and made her uncomfortable. [Id.]. In short, Plaintiff does not allege that she opposed any conduct protected by the ADA.
The only plausible protected activity related to Plaintiff's alleged disability is the information Plaintiff reportedly provided to HR in the subsequent face-to-face meetings with Rodgers and Berry, respectively. Following her email complaint to Bickerstaff, Plaintiff advised Minefee and Rodgers in the July 24, 2018, meeting that she was a survivor of trauma and suffered from PTSD and that Berry's verbal abuse and treatment "would trigger symptoms of . . . PTSD within Plaintiff." [Compl. at 3]. In the July 26, 2018, meeting, Plaintiff advised Minefee and Berry that she suffered from PTSD and that Berry's conduct was a trigger for Plaintiff's PTSD symptoms. [Id. at 3-4]. In addition, Plaintiff [*36]  requested reasonable accommodation paperwork from Berry and Minefee but was refused. [Id. at 4]. Berry "stated that she did not believe that Plaintiff was disabled." [Id.]. Nonetheless, for purposes of Plaintiff's retaliation claim, Plaintiff's expression of interest to Berry and Minefee in pursuing reasonable accommodation for her PTSD is sufficient at this stage of the proceedings to establish this threshold element.29 Construing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the complaint contains sufficient facts to plausibly support the prima facie element of protected activity.

b. Adverse Employment Action
As for the second prima facie element of her ADA retaliation claim, Plaintiff must identify an adverse employment action. See Mattingly v. Univ. of South Florida Bd. of Trustees, 931 F. Supp. 2d 1176, 1187 (M.D. Fla. 2013). "[T]he 'adverse action' test applied to retaliation claims is distinct from that applied to disparate treatment claims." Sharpe v. Global Security Int'l, 766 F. Supp. 2d 1272, 1291 (S.D. Ala. 2011). In the retaliation context, an adverse employment action includes employer conduct "which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related." Crawford, 529 F.3d at 973. The Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim "must show that a reasonable employee would [*37]  have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination." Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 126 S. Ct. 2405, 2415 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Conde, 2017 WL 1395519, at **5-6 (applying Burlington). This standard for determining adverse actions in retaliation claims is "decidedly more relaxed" than that used in discrimination claims. Crawford, 529 F.3d at 973. "Although '[the ADA's] protection against retaliatory discrimination extends to adverse actions which fall short of ultimate employment decisions,' the plaintiff must still demonstrate 'some threshold level of substantiality.'" Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 434 F.3d 1227, 1233 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir. 1998)).
In this case, Plaintiff complains about being suspended and placed on investigatory leave in October 2018 as well as being terminated from employment, effective November 9, 2018. Accepting Plaintiff's allegation that her employment was terminated as true, the adverse action element is satisfied.30

c. Causal Connection
The third and final element of a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA requires Plaintiff to show that there is a causal connection between the protected expression and the adverse employment action. See Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. Under the ADA, the causal [*38]  link element "requires a showing of but-for causation." Frazier-White, 818 F.3d at 1258 (citing Univ. of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2533-34 (2013)). If an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee shortly after becoming aware of the employee's protected expression, then the close temporal proximity between the two events is sufficient to meet the "but-for" causation requirement. See Adams v. City of Montgomery, 569 Fed. Appx. 769, 773 (11th Cir. 2014) (Title VII case); accord Brungart, 231 F.3d at 799 ("Temporal proximity alone . . . is not sufficient to establish a causal connection when there is unrebutted evidence that the decision maker was not aware of the protected activity."). "But mere temporal proximity, without more, must be very close." Adams, 569 Fed. Appx. at 773 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In the Eleventh Circuit, a "delay of four to nine months is too remote, as a matter of law, to show a causal connection." Cazeau v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 614 Fed. Appx. 972, 980 (11th Cir. 2015) (citing Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 2007)).
The Court has already determined that the only protected activity under the ADA is Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation paperwork. According to the complaint, Plaintiff's request was made on July 26, 2018, and she was placed on investigatory leave on October 12, 2018, resulting in her termination from employment on November 9, 2018. [Compl. at 3-4]. Therefore, the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's [*39]  July 2018 request for accommodation and Defendant's suspension in October 2018 is approximately two and a half months, and the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's July 2018 request for accommodation and her November 2018 termination is approximately three and a half months. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Defendant's decision to suspend Plaintiff and place her on investigatory leave on October 12, 2018, was a precipitating factor and ultimately lead to Plaintiff's separation from employment. The Eleventh Circuit has held that, without other evidence, "[a] three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough" to establish a causal connection. Thomas, 506 F.3d at 1364 (citation omitted). Here, the two and a half month period between Plaintiff's July 2018 request for accommodation and her October 2018 suspension, is right on the cusp of factual scenarios deemed to plausibly allege a causal link for purposes of a retaliation claim. See Adams, 569 Fed. Appx. at 773. For this reason, the Court finds that the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's request for reasonable accommodation paperwork and her October 2018 suspension (and subsequent separation [*40]  from employment) is enough to survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny.
The Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss be DENIED as to this issue and that Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim be allowed to proceed.

VI. Leave To Amend Complaint
For all the reasons discussed herein, the Court finds that Plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination claim as set forth in her complaint does not contain "factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citation omitted). However, the Court finds that Plaintiff may be able to state a claim for relief if allowed to amend her complaint.
In Spear v. Nix, 215 Fed. Appx. 896 (11th Cir. 2007), the Eleventh Circuit concluded that when a plaintiff is proceeding pro se and "'[w]here a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.'" Id. at 902 (citation omitted); accord Case v. Riley, 270 Fed. Appx. 908, 910-11 (11th Cir. 2008); Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir. 2001) ("Generally, [w]here a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a plaintiff must be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.") (citation [*41]  and internal quotation marks omitted); Canty v. Fry's Electronics, Inc., 736 F. Supp. 2d 1352, 1363 (N.D. Ga. 2010).
Plaintiff Robinson has not had the opportunity to amend her complaint. The Court cannot conclude at this stage of the proceedings that Plaintiff would not be able to draft a complaint stating a claim for relief. Therefore, the undersigned RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff be allowed an opportunity to amend her complaint as to any facts that may plausibly state a cause of action for disability discrimination.
Because Plaintiff's amended complaint will supersede and replace the original complaint, see Gardner v. Aloha Insurance Services, 566 Fed. Appx. 903, 906 (11th Cir. 2014) (amended complaint becomes operative pleading and original complaint is abandoned); Pintando v. Miami-Dade Housing Agency, 501 F.3d 1241, 1243 (11th Cir. 2007) (same); Malowney v. Federal Collection Deposit Group, 193 F.3d 1342, 1345 n.1 (11th Cir. 1999) ("An amended complaint supersedes an original complaint."), the court further recommends that Plaintiff be allowed to amend her pending ADA claim for retaliatory discharge if there are additional allegations of fact in support of that claim.31 It is therefore recommended that Plaintiff be allowed to file an amended complaint that (1) is labeled as an amendment to Turjemia Robinson v. Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center, Inc., d/b/a Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center South, 1:19-CV-2244-SDJ-JFK, and (2), in separately enumerated Counts and paragraphs, sets forth [*42]  the facts supporting each delineated cause of action. Multiple causes of action should not be set forth in a single Count, and only those allegations of fact pertaining to a cause of action should be included in each Count. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and 10.

VII. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing reasons and cited authority, the Court RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDS that Defendant's Motion [Doc. 9] to Dismiss the complaint be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Specifically, the Court RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff's ADA disability discrimination claim based upon disparate treatment and / or failure to provide reasonable accommodation be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE and that Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim be allowed to proceed.
If the District Judge adopts the instant R&R, the undersigned also RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff be given leave to file an Amended Complaint that complies with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and this Court's directive within twenty-one (21) days of the District Court's Order. In the event that Plaintiff Robinson elects not to file a substituted amended complaint within the twenty-one (21) days, only Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim will remain.
SO RECOMMENDED THIS 4th day of November, 2019. [*43] 
/s/ Janet F. King
JANET F. KING
UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE
