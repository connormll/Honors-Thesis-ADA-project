CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS (IN CHAMBERS): ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND/OR STRIKE PLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT [21]
Before the Court is Defendant Bank of America, National Association's ("Defendant") Motion to Dismiss and/or Strike Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint ("Motion") (Dkt. 21). The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without oral argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; L.R. 7-15. Having reviewed the moving papers submitted by the parties, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion.

I. Background

A. Facts
The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff Irma Frausto's ("Plaintiff") First Amended Complaint ("FAC") (Dkt. 13). [*2]  Plaintiff worked for Defendant from approximately 1999 until she was terminated on or about August 11, 2017. FAC ¶ 10. Plaintiff was 55 years old at the time of her firing. Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff originally worked for Defendant as a phone leasing agent, and was eventually promoted to the "general core team" and then to the "silver team." Id. ¶¶ 12, 15-16. Defendant recognized Plaintiff with awards for customer service and professionalism, and Plaintiff received several positive performance reviews. Id. ¶ 13.
Around the year 2008, however, both of Plaintiff's parents suffered serious medical declines; her father was diagnosed with dementia and her mother was diagnosed with a debilitating heart condition. Id. ¶ 17. As a result, Plaintiff began to experience "serious depression, stress, and anxiety." Id. These mental difficulties grew more severe after Plaintiff's father passed away in October of 2016 and as her mother's condition continued to worsen. Id. ¶ 26. Soon after learning of these diagnoses, Plaintiff informed her supervisor that she would need to take more time off work to care for her parents. Id. ¶ 18. Plaintiff also informed her supervisors and managers, on a weekly basis up [*3]  until the time of her termination, that she was suffering from disabilities related to her depression, stress, and anxiety. Id. ¶ 27. In March 2017, Plaintiff suggested that she be transferred as a reasonable accommodation to her disability, but this request was denied without any interactive process on Defendant's part. Id. ¶ 28.
After returning to work, Plaintiff was demoted from the "silver team" to the "general core team." Id. ¶ 19. Plaintiff also frequently noticed her managers speaking negatively about her and other older employees, disparagingly referring to them as "tenured associates," often in conjunction with terms like "old" and "inept." Id. ¶ 20. Other older employees agreed with Plaintiff's observations in this regard. Id. ¶ 21. Moreover, both Plaintiff and other older employees expressed concern that managers were markedly more friendly with younger employees. Id. ¶ 21. One example of targeted ageism against Plaintiff came in approximately June 2017, about two months before her firing, when one of Plaintiff's supervisors, who was under 40 years old, mocked Plaintiff by telling her "you've been here for too long." Id. ¶ 23-24.
On approximately August 9, 2017, Plaintiff [*4]  was assisting a client over the phone with a wire transfer. Id. ¶ 29. During this call, Plaintiff received a call from her mother's doctor, who told Plaintiff that she needed to bring her mother to the hospital immediately for a blood transfusion. Id. Plaintiff attempted to quickly finish assisting the client, but was hindered by a computer malfunction, and there were no on-site technical support staff to address the problem. Id. ¶ 30. Despite the malfunction, Plaintiff managed to finish helping the client, and immediately informed her supervisor that she needed to leave work to take her mother to the hospital. Id. ¶¶ 31-32. Plaintiff also told her supervisor that, due to the computer malfunction, the client's funds might not have been wired according to company protocol. Id. ¶ 33. Later that day, Plaintiff followed up with her supervisor, who told Plaintiff that she had done "something wrong" with the wire transfer, but that the problem had been fixed. Id. ¶ 34.
Two days later, i.e., on or about August 11, 2017, one of Plaintiff's managers (along with other managers and supervisors), who is under 40 years old, called Plaintiff into her office. Id. ¶ 35. The manager informed Plaintiff [*5]  that she had been terminated. Id. Plaintiff additionally believes that her termination was decided by an individual under 40 years old, and that she was replaced by an individual under 40 years old. Id. ¶¶ 36, 46.

B. Procedural History
Plaintiff filed her original Complaint (Dkt. 1-1) in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, on July 15, 2019. Defendant removed the action to this Court on August 16, 2019 ("Notice of Removal") (Dkt. 1). On August 23, 2019, Defendant filed its first Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 12), to which Plaintiff responded with her First Amended Complaint. The FAC brings the following nine claims:
(1) discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA);
(2) discrimination on the basis of disability under California Government Code sections 12940-12953;
(3) associational disability discrimination;
(4) failure to accommodate disability;
(5) failing to engage in timely good faith interactive process;
(6) retaliation in violation of FEHA;
(7) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation;
(8) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; and
(9) unfair competition under the California Business and Professional Code.
See generally FAC.
On September 26, 2019 Defendant [*6]  responded with the instant Motion to Dismiss. On October 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed an Opposition brief (Dkt. 24), and Defendant filed a Reply (Dkt. 25) on October 21, 2019.

II. Legal Standard

A. Rule 12(b)(6)
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must be dismissed when a plaintiff's allegations fail to set forth a set of facts that, if true, would entitle the complainant to relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (holding that a claim must be facially plausible in order to survive a motion to dismiss). The pleadings must raise the right to relief beyond the speculative level; a plaintiff must provide "more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)). On a motion to dismiss, a court accepts as true a plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and construes all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008). A court is not required to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.
In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, review is ordinarily limited to the contents of the complaint and material properly submitted with the complaint. Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2002); Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555, n.19 (9th Cir. 1990). Under the incorporation by reference doctrine, the court may also consider documents "whose contents are alleged [*7]  in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading." Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). The court may treat such a document as "part of the complaint, and thus may assume that its contents are true for purposes of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)." United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003).
When a motion to dismiss is granted, the court must decide whether to grant leave to amend. The Ninth Circuit has a liberal policy favoring amendments, and thus leave to amend should be freely granted. See, e.g., DeSoto v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 957 F.2d 655, 658 (9th Cir. 1992). However, a court need not grant leave to amend when permitting a plaintiff to amend would be an exercise in futility. See, e.g., Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 729, 738 (9th Cir. 1987) ("Denial of leave to amend is not an abuse of discretion where the pleadings before the court demonstrate that further amendment would be futile.").

B. Rule 12(f)
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that a court "may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Motions to strike are disfavored and "will usually be denied unless the allegations have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause prejudice to one of the parties." Friedman v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc., 580 F. Supp. 2d 985, 990 (C.D. Cal. 2008); see also RDF Media Ltd. v. Fox Broad. Co., 372 F. Supp. 2d 556, 566 (C.D. Cal. 2005) ("Motions to strike are generally disfavored because of the limited importance [*8]  of pleadings in federal practice and because it is usually used as a delaying tactic.").
The Ninth Circuit has defined "immaterial" matter as "that which has no essential or important relationship to the claim for relief or the defenses being pleaded," and "impertinent" matter as "statements that do not pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question." Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), overruled on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517, 114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994).

III. Discussion

A. Plaintiff Has Adequately Stated a Claim for Age Discrimination
Plaintiff's first cause of action alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of age, in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (California Government Code sections 12900-12996) ("FEHA"). Under California law, such a claim has four elements: namely, that the plaintiff
(1) is over the age of 40; (2) suffered an adverse employment action; (3) was performing satisfactorily at the time of the adverse action; and (4) suffered the adverse action under circumstances that give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination, i.e., evidence that the plaintiff was replaced by someone significantly younger than the plaintiff.
Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 321, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010) (citing Hersant v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 1002-03, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 483 (1997)).1
Plaintiff has [*9]  adequately pleaded each of these elements. Plaintiff's FAC alleges that when she was 55 years old, FAC ¶ 11, she was fired by Defendant, id. ¶ 35. While she worked for Defendant, Plaintiff earned "numerous awards," positive performance reviews, and at least two promotions. Id. ¶¶ 12-13, 15-16. Finally, she alleges that her firing was embedded in circumstances that support an inference of unlawful discrimination. Her managers allegedly disparaged older employees as "tenured associates," frequently in conjunction with labels like "old" and "inept," id. ¶ 20, and Plaintiff's coworkers agreed with her observations and concerns, id. ¶ 21. One of Plaintiff's supervisors, who is under 40 years old,2 told Plaintiff "you've been here for too long," just months before her firing. Id. ¶¶ 10, 24. And Plaintiff was terminated by, informed of her termination by, and replaced by individuals under 40 years old. Id. ¶¶ 35-36, 46.
Defendant wrongly argues that these are merely conclusory allegations and that the Court therefore cannot draw a plausible inference of age discrimination. E.g., Mot. at 10-12. To the contrary, each of the allegations cited above makes a claim about a matter of fact, rather [*10]  than asserting a legal conclusion. Employing "its judicial experience and common sense," see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679, the Court finds these factual allegations adequate to support an inference that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her age.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's claim fails because there is an alternative explanation for the firing—viz., Plaintiff's admitted breach of company protocol. Mot. at 12; see also FAC ¶¶ 29-35. Granted, the Ninth Circuit has held that when an alternative, innocent explanation of the alleged wrongdoing is available, plaintiffs must "offer[] facts that tend[] to exclude the defendant's innocuous alternative explanation." Eclectic Props. E., LLC v. Marcus & Millichap Co., 751 F.3d 990, 996-97 (9th Cir. 2014). This alternative explanation, however, hardly reads as plausible, and the Court finds that the facts alleged in the FAC tend to exclude this explanation. In short, Defendant suggests that Plaintiff's mistake in completing a wire transfer—which Plaintiff alleges was caused by a computer malfunction, about which she immediately informed her supervisor, and which was quickly corrected, FAC ¶¶ 30-34—was sufficient cause to terminate, two days later, a career spanning nearly twenty years, during which Plaintiff received awards, [*11]  positive performance reviews, and promotions.
Far from presenting an obvious alternative explanation, Plaintiff's FAC gives the distinct impression that this irregular wire transfer served as a pretext for her firing, when in reality she worked in an environment that was frequently hostile towards older employees, and when Plaintiff herself, a mere two months prior, had been told "you've been here for too long,"3 and when, as Plaintiff alleges, she was replaced by someone significantly younger. Plaintiff's lengthy employment and record of achievement tend to foreclose Defendant's alternative explanation, as do her allegations that the mistake was immediately disclosed, corrected that same day, and caused by a computer malfunction (i.e., not by some negligence or incompetence on Plaintiff's part). Twombly and Iqbal require a complaint to plead a plausible claim and require courts to consider obvious alternative explanations for the conduct at issue. See Eclectic, 751 F.3d at 995-96 (citations omitted). But they do not require courts to be willfully obtuse when reading complaints. Here, with the aid of "its judicial experience and common sense," see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679, and taking together all of the relevant factual allegations in [*12]  the FAC, the Court finds that Plaintiff has stated a plausible claim for age discrimination.
Because Plaintiff has adequately pleaded each of the elements of a FEHA claim for age discrimination, and because the facts alleged in the FAC tend to exclude Defendant's proffered alternative explanation, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion with respect to the first cause of action.

B. Plaintiff Has Not Adequately Stated a Claim for Disability Discrimination or Associational Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff's second and third causes of action claim that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, or due to her association with her disabled mother, in violation of the FEHA.
California courts have construed a FEHA disability claim as having three elements: (1) that the plaintiff suffers from a disability; (2) that the plaintiff can perform the essential functions of their employment position either with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that the plaintiff "was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability." Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 & n.3 (2000); see also Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 1000 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Green v. California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262-63, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007)). Similarly, to plead a claim for associational discrimination, a plaintiff must allege that they were associated [*13]  with a person who has a disability within the meaning of the statute, were otherwise qualified for their position, and suffered an adverse employment action in "circumstances suggesting that the employer acted with a discriminatory motive." Rope v. Auto-Chlor Sys. of Wash., Inc., 220 Cal. App. 4th 635, 655-656, 163 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392 (2013), superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in Moore v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 245, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016) (discussing amendments to the FEHA's anti-retaliation provisions).
Here, both Plaintiff's disability and associational disability claims fail because the FAC does not allege sufficient facts to show that Defendant acted against her with a discriminatory motive.4 The Supreme Court of California has interpreted this requirement to mean that "the plaintiff [must] show that discrimination was a substantial motivating factor" in the decision; there must be more than "mere thoughts or passing statements," though discrimination need not have been the exclusive impetus for the decision. Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 232, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013). While direct proof of a causal connection is not necessary, a FEHA claimant must still present circumstantial evidence linking the disability and the adverse employment action—for example, that they were replaced by someone without a disability or were "treated less favorably than non-disabled employees." Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 254. The FAC [*14]  does not meet this burden.
Instead, Plaintiff presents only tenuous, speculative allegations, claiming that her accommodation/transfer requests were denied and that she was fired due to her association with her mother, who needed to be taken to the hospital. FAC ¶¶ 28, 55, 57, 70-71. And, to the contrary, it appears that at least some of Plaintiff's requests for time off to care for her parents were granted. See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 18-19, 23 (referring to Plaintiff's request for time off and her return to work). These allegations, taken together, present a merely possible case for disability and associational disability discrimination, falling short of the plausibility demanded by Twombly and Iqbal. As such, the Court finds that these allegations cannot support a reasonable inference that Defendant acted with discriminatory intent and is therefore liable for disability or associational disability discrimination.
Because Plaintiff's second and third causes of action fail to state a claim, the Court GRANTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant's Motion with respect thereto.

C. Plaintiff Has Not Adequately Stated a Claim for Failure to Accommodate and Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
In her fourth [*15]  and fifth causes of action, respectively, Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to accommodate her disability and failed to engage in a timely good faith interactive process. Under California Government Code section 12940(m) and (n), it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee's known physical or mental disability, or "to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation" by an employee with a known disability or mental condition. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(m)-(n) (Deering 2019).
California courts have determined that the "interactive process of fashioning an appropriate accommodation lies primarily with the employee." King v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 443, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007) (quoting Spitzer v. Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1384, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000)). In particular, an employee is required to inform their employer of their disability and the accommodation they desire; it is the "employee's responsibility to understand his or her own physical or mental condition well enough to present the employer at the earliest opportunity with a concise list of restrictions which must be met to accommodate the employee." Id. (quoting Jensen, 85 Cal. App. 4th at 266).
As noted above, it appears that at least some of Plaintiff's [*16]  requests for time off were granted; the only other potential accommodation mentioned in the FAC is her request to be transferred in March 2017. See FAC ¶ 28. While Plaintiff does adequately allege that her supervisors were aware of her stress, depression, and anxiety, see id. ¶ 27, it is not clear, when she asked to be transferred, that she asked any of the individuals who knew about her disabilities, see id. ¶ 28. It is therefore unclear whether the person responsible for the denial knew they were refusing to accommodate a disability or recognized their responsibility to engage in an interactive process. Finally, it is not clear whether Plaintiff made "a specific request for necessary accommodation or a concise list of restrictions" when she asked to be transferred. See King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 443. As such, based on the allegations in the FAC, the Court cannot reasonably infer, within the meaning of the FEHA, that Defendant failed to accommodate Plaintiff's disability or failed to engage in the necessary interactive process.
Because the fourth and fifth causes of action do not meet the plausibility pleading standard under Twombly and Iqbal, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE with respect to these [*17]  claims.

D. Plaintiff's Claims for Retaliation, Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation, and Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy Are Sufficiently Pleaded Only to the Extent They Derive from Her Age Discrimination Claim
Plaintiff and Defendant do not dispute that the sixth through eighth causes of action are dependent on her first through third causes of action. See generally Mot.; Opp'n. Because the Court has found that only Plaintiff's claim for age discrimination should survive dismissal, Plaintiff may only pursue her claims for retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, and wrongful termination on the basis of her claim for age discrimination. Plaintiff may not base these causes of action on her claims for disability and associational disability discrimination, which the Court has already dismissed without prejudice (unless her second and third causes of action are amended so as to meet the plausibility standard of Twombly and Iqbal).

E. Plaintiff's Unfair Competition Claim Fails Because She Has No Available Remedy Under the Unfair Competition Law
Pursuant to her ninth cause of action, Plaintiff seeks restitution, injunctive relief, and an [*18]  equitable accounting as remedies. FAC ¶¶ 137-139. An individual's remedies under California's Unfair Competition Law ("UCL") are limited to restitution and injunctive relief. Asghari v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am., Inc., 42 F. Supp. 3d 1306, 1324 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Korea Supply v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1144, 1152, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 (2003)). Neither appears to be available to Plaintiff.
Restitution under the UCL requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant is in possession of money either taken from the plaintiff or in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest. See id. Plaintiff's claim for "unpaid amounts," FAC ¶ 137, however, seems more like a claim for compensatory damages stemming from her allegedly wrongful termination—a remedy unavailable under the UCL. Plaintiff also alleges only that she "is entitled to restitution of the unpaid amounts," FAC ¶ 137, a wholly conclusory allegation that cannot support a claim for relief.
Furthermore, Plaintiff does not appear to have standing to pursue injunctive relief. As the Supreme Court has made clear, a plaintiff must have suffered a concrete and particularized injury in fact, which must be actual or imminent, rather than speculative. The injury must also be fairly traceable to the defendant's alleged conduct and likely redressable by a favorable decision by the court. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). These requirements [*19]  must be met for each claim the plaintiff brings, and for each remedy sought. Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734, 128 S. Ct. 2759, 171 L. Ed. 2d 737 (2008) (citing DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 164 L. Ed. 2d 589 (2006)). Because Plaintiff has already been fired, however, it is not clear what future injury she faces that would be likely redressable by a (forward-looking) injunction.
Because neither UCL remedy appears available to Plaintiff, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE with respect to Plaintiff's ninth cause of action.

F. Plaintiff Has Not Adequately Stated a Claim for Punitive Damages
Pursuant to California Civil Code section 3294, exemplary damages ("for sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant"), i.e., punitive damages, are available "where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice." Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a) (Deering 2019). The statute defines "malice" as "conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others." Id. § 3294(c)(1).
California courts have explained that, when the defendant is a corporation—which has no mind of its own, and thus cannot be malicious, willful, or conscious—malice must be demonstrated among corporate leaders [*20]  to be imputed to the corporation. Cruz v. Homebase, 83 Cal. App. 4th 160, 167, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435 (2000). "Corporate leaders," in turn, refers to officers, directors, or managing agents of the corporation. Id. The court in Cruz further clarified that managing agents are those employees with "substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy"—that is, an agent with substantial authority to set "the general principles which guide a corporation, or rules intended to be followed consistently over time in corporate operations." Id. at 167-68 (quoting White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 573, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999)).
Here, because Plaintiff's FAC states a claim for age discrimination, she has adequately pleaded that a number of her supervisors acted with malice vis-à-vis the rights afforded to older employees under the FEHA. (That is, it is plausible, given Plaintiff's allegations, that her supervisors willfully and consciously disregarded her rights under the FEHA.) However, Plaintiff does not allege, except in conclusory fashion, that any of her supervisors or anyone who discriminated against her was an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant. Therefore, the Court DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.

IV. Disposition
For the reasons set forth above, [*21]  the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion. Specifically, the Court finds that Plaintiff's first cause of action is sufficiently pleaded, and that Plaintiff may pursue her sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, but only to the extent they derive from her first cause of action. The Court DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff's second, third, fourth, fifth, and ninth causes of action, as well as Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.
Plaintiff may file an amended complaint, if so desired, by December 20, 2019.
The Clerk shall serve this minute order on the parties
