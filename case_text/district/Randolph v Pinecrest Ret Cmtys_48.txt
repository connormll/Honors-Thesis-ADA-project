Opinion



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING MOTION TO DISMISS
This case is assigned to the Honorable Michael Schneider, United States District Judge, and was referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters. The Plaintiff, Arlice J. Randolph ("Randolph"), proceeding pro se, filed an employment discrimination case against the Defendant, Methodist Retirement Communities ("MRC").1 Pending before the undersigned is MRC's motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Doc. No. 8.)

I. Background
A. Randolph's Complaint
In her complaint (Doc. No. 1), Randolph alleges that she was employed as the assistant director of nursing by MRC in 2008 but was terminated in 2012. Randolph states she was seventy years old [*2]  at the time of her termination and had a hearing deficiency. Because of this hearing impairment, Randolph brought a tape recorder to a meeting and placed it on a table in plain sight. During the conversation, the Director of Human Resources for MRC asked her, "Why did you feel it necessary to record this conversation?" Apparently, MRC's corporate compliance officer took umbrage to Randolph's use of the recorder and informed Randolph via a termination letter: "I cannot tolerate these actions. I have to ask for your resignation. If you do not resign then you'll be terminated immediately." Randolph concludes that she was terminated because of her age and disability and claims that MRC failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for using a recording device. As such, Randolph alleges MRC violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA").
B. MRC's Motion to Dismiss
MRC filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Doc. No. 8.) MRC claims Randolph (1) failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as to her disability discrimination and failure-to-accommodate claims; (2) failed to allege a plausible basis for her failure-to-accommodate claim; [*3]  (3) failed to allege a plausible basis for her disability discrimination claim; and (4) failed to establish a plausible basis for her age discrimination claim. Randolph filed a response to the motion (Doc. No. 11), MRC filed their reply (Doc. No. 12), and Randolph in turn filed her sur-reply (Doc. No. 13.) MRC's motion is now ripe for determination.

II. Analysis
A. Failure to exhaust her administrative remedies for her disability discrimination and failure-to-accommodate claims
MRC argues Randolph's disability discrimination and failure-to-accommodate claims should be dismissed because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by the ADA. MRC admits Randolph did in fact file an EEOC charge. However, MRC claims the EEOC charge only mentions a medical condition that might affect her ability to "lift[] patients ranging from 65 to 365 pounds" and does not mention any other claimed disability. (Doc. No. 12, at 2.) MRC argues that Randolph's alleged disability in this lawsuit, a hearing impairment, is beyond the scope of the charge she filed with the EEOC, and as such, she has not properly exhausted her administrative remedies.
An employee must comply with the ADA's administrative [*4]  prerequisites prior to commencing an action in federal court against her employer for a violation of the ADA. Dao v. Auchan Hypermarket, 96 F.3d 787, 789 (5th Cir. 1996). Because the ADA incorporates by reference the procedures applicable to Title VII actions, one of these administrative prerequisites is filing a charge with the EEOC. Id.; 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a); see also Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 379 (5th Cir. 2002) (explaining the administrative prerequisites under Title VII). Nevertheless, merely filing any EEOC charge is insufficient. The scope of the lawsuit "is limited to the 'scope' of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination." Young v. City of Houston, Tex., 906 F.2d 177, 179 (5th Cir. 1990), quoting Sanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970).
While MRC is generally correct on the law relating to exhaustion, the undersigned cannot determine whether or not Randolph properly exhausted her ADA claim because the EEOC charge is not found in the record. In a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court must not go outside the pleadings and must accept all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing those facts most favorably to the plaintiff. Scanlan v. Texas A&M University, 343 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2003). However, there is an important exception to this rule: a court may consider documents attached to the motion to dismiss that are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to the plaintiff's claim. Id. [*5] 
Here, Randolph alleges in her complaint that she filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC and brought this action within ninety days of receiving her right to sue letter. She further claims that all conditions precedent to bringing suit have been fulfilled. The undersigned must accept these facts as true. Even assuming the EEOC charge is "central to the plaintiff's claim," it is not attached to MRC's motion to dismiss or otherwise found in the record. Because the EEOC charge itself is not properly before the court, the undersigned cannot find this suit lies outside the scope of her EEOC charge. For that reason, the motion to dismiss based upon Randolph's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies should be denied. See Scanlan, 343 F.3d at 537 (finding the district court erred in considering a report quoted in the defendant's motion to dismiss but not attached to the motion itself.)
B. Failure to allege a plausible basis for her failure-to-accommodate claim
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss "is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted." Harrington v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009). When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it "accepts 'all well-pleaded facts as true, [*6]  viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.'" In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dall. Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)). A court should grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain "enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A claim is plausible on its face "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice." Id. Likewise, a plaintiff must put forth more than "'unadorned, the defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation[s].'" Varela v. Gonzales, 773 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678).
Because Randolph is proceeding pro se, her pleadings are held to "less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers" and as such, must be liberally construed. Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972); Perez v. United States, 312 F.3d 191, 194-95 (5th Cir. 2002). Furthermore, the court should also consider new issues raised by the pro se litigant in a reply to a responsive pleading. See United States v. Trevino, 554 F. App'x 289, 293 n.9 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that a district court should construe new issues raised in reply to a responsive pleading as a motion to amend the complaint).
The ADA provides that an employer should make a reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations [*7]  of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). To state a claim for failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must allege facts showing (1) that she is qualified for the job; (2) that she has a disability; (3) that she made her limitations and needed accommodations known the employer (or that the limitations and need for accommodations were obvious); and (4) that the employer failed to provide these accommodations. Woodard v. GC Services, Civ. Act. No. H-10-0322, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41337, 2010 WL 1704369, *2 (S.D. Tex. 2010), citing E.E.O.C. v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., 570 F.3d 606, 615-22 (5th Cir. 2009); Taylor v. Principal Fin. Group., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 161-66 (5th Cir. 1996).
MRC argues that Randolph has not pled any facts that she notified MRC of her hearing impairment or its resulting limitations, or that she ever suggested or requested any accommodation. MRC further argues the plaintiff failed to engage in the interactive process with MRC to determine whether the recording device was a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.2
In her complaint, Randolph states MRC was "well aware" of her hearing impairment. Accordingly, she states that she brought a tape recorder with her to an important meeting with the director of human resources and director of nursing because of her hearing impairment and placed it on the table "in plain sight of everyone." (Doc. No. 1, p.2.) In her response to the motion to dismiss, Randolph states that, an hour and a half into the meeting, she was asked by the director of human resources why she felt it necessary to record the meeting. Randolph claims she responded by telling the director she wanted to be able to review the discussion in order to ensure that she had heard everything correctly and to fully understand what was expected of her. Randolph states that the meeting was immediately adjourned. Attached to her response is a letter from the corporate director of compliance asking for her resignation and threatening termination if she did not resign because she used a recording device. (Doc. No. 11, p. 10.) Accepting these facts as true, and construing them liberally in Randolph's favor, she has alleged that she informed MRC of her need for an accommodation and [*9]  that request was denied.
MRC argues that the additional facts included in Randolph's response to the motion to dismiss may not be considered part of her pleadings. However, as previously discussed, because Randolph is proceeding pro se, the undersigned is required to "look beyond her formal complaint and to consider as amendments to the complaint those materials subsequently filed." Howard v. King, 707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983), citing McGruder v. Phelps, 608 F.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir. 1979). Therefore, considering Randolph's pro se status, and taking her allegations in her complaint and response to the motion to dismiss as true, the undersigned finds she has adequately pled that she made her limitations and needed accommodations known to MRC.
C. Failure to allege a plausible basis for her disability discrimination claim
MRC next argues that Randolph failed to sufficiently allege her disability discrimination claim because her complaint did not contain any facts that plausibly show she was replaced by a non-disabled person or was treated less favorably that non-disabled employees. (Doc. No. 8, p.10.) However, in her response to MRC's motion to dismiss, Randolph did claim that she was replaced with a less qualified individual that had no disabilities. (Doc. No. 11.)
Here again, MRC argues [*10]  the court is only permitted to consider the actual contents of the pleadings and the documents either attached or incorporated by reference into the complaint. (Doc. No. 12, p. 7, citing Powell v. Dallas Morning News LP, 610 F. Supp. 2d 569, 571 (N.D. Tex 2009). Consequently, MRC submits that the court cannot consider Randolph's statements contained in her response to the motion to dismiss. However, because of the liberal pleading standards afforded pro se plaintiffs, courts are to consider claims raised for the first time in a reply to a responsive pleading as a motion to amend the complaint. See Howard, 707 F.2d at 220; see also Johnson v. Epps, 479 F. App'x 583, 587-88 (5th Cir. 2012). If Randolph's reply is construed in this manner, she has adequately amended her complaint to allege she was replaced by non-disabled employee. As such, MRC's motion to dismiss on this ground should also be denied.
D. Failure to allege a plausible basis for her age discrimination claim
MRC claims Randolph's complaint fails to state a claim for age discrimination in two ways. First, MRC argues her complaint fails to allege she was replaced by a younger individual. Although MRC recognizes that Randolph alleged she was replaced by a younger employee in her response, MRC again argues that a court is restricted to the complaint itself when determining a motion [*11]  under 12(b)(6). As already set forth above, the undersigned can consider claims raised for the first time in a reply to a responsive pleading as a motion to amend the complaint. If Randolph's reply is construed in this manner, she has adequately amended her complaint to allege she was replaced by a younger employee. Accordingly, MRC's motion to dismiss on this ground should be denied.
Secondly, MRC contends Randolph failed to allege any facts that suggest MRC would not have discharged her "but for" her age and that her allegations on this point are "nothing more than conclusory statements and a 'formulaic recitation' of the elements." MRC cites Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009), for the proposition that Randolph must allege facts that would plausibly suggest that age was the "but-for" cause of their decision to terminate her employment. (Doc. No. 12, p. 8.)
MRC is incorrect that such an allegation is required. To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, the plaintiff must show: (1) she was within the protected class; (2) she was qualified for the position; (3) she suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) she was replaced by someone younger or treated less favorably than similarly situation younger [*12]  employees. Leal v. McHugh, 731 F.3d 405, 410-11 (5th Cir. 2013). Nothing in a plaintiff's prima facie case requires the plaintiff to allege "but for" causation. Instead, a plaintiff must raise a genuine dispute of material fact at the summary judgment phase or prove at trial that that age was the "but-for" cause of the challenged employer decision. Gross 557 U.S. 167, 177-78, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119; see also Leal, 731 F.3d at 414 ("It simply will behoove Appellants—if subject to Gross's heightened evidentiary burden here—to prove at summary judgment or trial that, but-for their age, they would have been selected.") "Gross and its progeny concern a plaintiff's ultimate proof burden in ADEA claims, not the pleading burden (emphasis in original)." Leal at 415. Because Randolph does not need to allege "but-for" causation in her complaint, MRC motion to dismiss on this ground should also be denied.
For the reasons foregoing reason's, MRC's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 8) should be DENIED.

III. Objections
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right to file objections to this report and recommendation. Objections to this report must (1) be in writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, (3) be served and filed within fourteen days after being served with [*13]  a copy of this report, and (4) be no more than eight pages in length. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2); LOCAL RULE CV-72(c). A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).
A party's failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen days of being served with a copy of this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District Judge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276-77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such findings of fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge. See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir. 1996).
SIGNED this 17th day of September, 2015.
