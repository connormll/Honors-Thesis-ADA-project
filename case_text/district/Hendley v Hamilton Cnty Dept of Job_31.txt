Opinion


Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment
This matter is before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 30.) Plaintiff Robin Hendley filed this employment discrimination action against her employer, Hamilton County Department of Jobs and Family Services ("HCJFS"), as well as Defendants Hamilton County, Ohio, Hamilton County Board of County Commissioners, Timothy McCartney, James Ashmore, Christopher Biersack,1 and John and/or Jane Does 1-8. For the reasons that follow, the Court will GRANT Defendants' Motion.

I. BACKGROUND2

A. Hendley's Employment Performance
Plaintiff Robin Hendley was hired by Defendant HCJFS as an Eligibility Technician in 2005. Plaintiff determines eligibility for public assistance programs, and since 2015, has been in the Central Processing Unit, where she makes changes in the computer system of status changes such as death, [*3]  address, or income.
Plaintiff's employment record with HCJFS is rife with personality conflicts and critiques of her work productivity. Without summarizing every personnel record, the Court will highlight a few examples. As early as 2007, Plaintiff was issued a written warning for poor communication skills with her direct supervisor, peers, and external customers, and she was required to attend civil treatment and business etiquette training. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1115.) In 2008, Plaintiff was suspended for three days for gross misconduct, neglect of duty, failure of good behavior, inefficiency, nonfeasance, and discourteous treatment of the public. (Id. at PageID 1214.) In 2009, an employee filed a complaint against Plaintiff for creating a hostile work environment. (Id. at PageID 1249.) In 2011, another employee alleged Plaintiff created a hostile work environment. (Id. at PageID 1261-63, 1282.) In 2012, Plaintiff emailed her then-supervisor informing her that she could no longer work for her. (Id. at PageID 1315-16.) In 2013, Plaintiff was admonished for an inappropriate email she sent to a provider. (Id. at PageID 1347-52.) In 2014, Plaintiff was admonished for using a profanity-laced [*4]  description of another supervisor's intelligence within the supervisor's earshot. (Id. at PageID 1397.)
Plaintiff's employment record also demonstrates difficulty meeting efficiency standards, although her overall work performance has been graded as acceptable.3 "Major Work Objectives" ("MWOs") are developed by the employee's section chief and appear on an employee's evaluations as directives that must be met. One of the MWOs of Plaintiff's position is a requirement to make a specific number of case changes per hour. Plaintiff "achieved" the quality and quantity MWO on her 2014 evaluation and was given a total performance score of "exceeded." However, the evaluation noted that Plaintiff was "thorough to a fault" and the time spent on investigation/research conflicted with equally important important goals. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1405.) Plaintiff "did not achieve" her quantity MWO on her 2015 evaluation but was nonetheless given a total performance score of "achieved." (Id. at 1422-23, 1428.) The evaluation included feedback that Plaintiff had good management skills but must not spend "excessive" time on any one particular case. (Id. at PageID 1418-19.)

B. Conflict with Stephanie Green and [*5]  Weapon Investigation
Most relevant to the underlying action is an escalation of Plaintiff's conflict with her colleague, Stephanie Green, which snowballed into an investigation into whether Plaintiff was bringing a weapon to work. In October 2015, Plaintiff repeatedly complained to Kevin Rabb, who was Plaintiff's supervisor from 2013-2014 until 2018, about Green. (Rabb Dep., Doc. 19 at PageID 432.) Plaintiff complained that Green was talking to her mother on the phone, being "rude," talking extensively with other coworkers, "shooting the bull," that she would "not shut up," and that the behavior was interfering with her ability to work. (Doc. 21-14 at PageID 1917, 1919.) Plaintiff asked to be moved away from Green and complained there was no resolution to her request. (Id. at PageID 1919.) Plaintiff also contacted the Director of Human Resources in December 2015 about a "personnel related issue" regarding Green. (Id. at 1927-34.)
As a matter of policy, HCJFS refrains from moving employees away from one another as a method of solving interpersonal conflicts due to the disruption it causes. Moving an employee's physical work station or transferring the supervision of a rank and file is [*6]  done only when other avenues of addressing the conflict have not succeeded or when a circumstance occurs that causes management to determine that no other resolution will alleviate the problem. (Ashmore Dec., Doc. 29-1 at PageID 3006.)
Rabb attests that he was aware of Plaintiff's "personality conflict" with Green, who was also his direct report, and consulted with his supervisor, Defendant James Ashmore, the Section Chief, who directed him to tell Plaintiff to select an alternative location in which to work. (Rabb Dec., Doc. 29-14 at PageID 3388.) However, Hendley failed to do so. (Id.) In addition, Plaintiff was given an opportunity to transfer in March 2016 but did not accept the opportunity. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1434-36.)
On May 25, 2016, Ashmore, Timothy McCartney, Chief Operating Officer of the Family & Adult Assistance Division, and David Helm of Human Resources, met with Plaintiff. They intended to address Plaintiff's complaints regarding Green and "false statements" Plaintiff made about Ashmore's salary. (Doc. 18-2 at PageID 378; McCartney Dec., Doc. 29-11 at PageID 3306.) Plaintiff expected the meeting to address her concerns about her coworker Green. (Doc. 18-2 at PageID 378.) [*7]  However, she claims that she was asked about the comments she made to another employee regarding Ashmore's salary and that she observed a work slowdown. (Id.) According to Plaintiff, McCartney stated that he was worried about Plaintiff's inability to get along with anyone in the agency, cut her off when she was speaking, and invaded her personal space. (Id.) Plaintiff recalls that only a small portion of the meeting addressed what she thought was the purpose of the meeting, which was the noise level in her unit and concerns about being seated near Green. (Id.) Following the meeting, McCartney emailed Plaintiff some links to articles entitled "Are you the difficult one?" and "Developing a good attitude." (Hendley Dep., Doc. 21 at PageID 887-88.) Plaintiff did not read the articles attached because she says she has no trust in the Employee Assistance Program (through which the links were sent). (Id. at PageID 888.)
Helm recalls the purpose of the May meeting was to address Hendley's complaints about the noise level near her workstation and attempt to intervene with workplace behavior which HCJFS felt was causing or could cause problems in the workplace, specifically, talking about a "work [*8]  slowdown" and the salary of Ashmore. (Helm Dec., Doc. 29-7 at PageID 3263-65.) McCartney and Helm recall that Plaintiff was seated across the conference table from McCartney and Ashmore during the meeting. (McCartney Dep., Doc. 16 at PageID 130-31; Helm Dec., Doc. 29-7 at PageID 3265.) McCartney recalls that he never got up out of his chair to get closer to Plaintiff to speak with her during the meeting. (McCartney Dep., Doc. 16 at PageID 131.) Helm attested that McCartney and Ashmore had a frank discussion with Henley, and he observed that McCartney and Ashmore maintained a professional and appropriate demeanor. (Helm Dec., Doc. 29-7 at PageID 3265.) He does not recall either McCartney or Ashmore invading Plaintiff's personal space. (Id.)
After that meeting, Plaintiff filed a grievance because she believed she was called to the meeting under "false pretenses" and that Ashmore and McCartney were "rude and aggressive" with her during the meeting. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1455.) She also requested a response to her complaints regarding the noise level in her area and concerns being seated near Green. (Id.) The grievance was rejected because it did not seek relief permitted under the collective [*9]  bargaining agreement. (Id. at PageID 1457.)
On July 28, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to her supervisor again complaining about Green. She alleged that Green called her a "nosy roach" and "bitch." (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1470.) She claimed she did not feel safe near Green and "will do what I have to do to keep myself from being place[d] in a position of risk." (Id.)
On August 10, 2016, Plaintiff abruptly barged into the office of a supervisor, Krishawna Scott, while Scott was in a meeting with another employee. (Doc. 29-15 at PageID 3402.) Plaintiff was upset and demanded to leave for the day, complaining that she was sick of the antics of Green and another employee, Jessica Mills. (Id.) That same day, Green and Mills had complained that Plaintiff almost ran into a client who was pushing her son in a stroller. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1478.)
Defendant Christopher Biersack, Labor/Employee Relations Manager, tasked Labor Relations Officer William Lee with conducting an investigation regarding whether Plaintiff "bumped" or "rushed" at a consumer. (Biersack Dec., Doc. 29-3 at PageID 3053-54.) As part of the investigation, Lee interviewed numerous employees, including Plaintiff, Green, and those [*10]  named by Plaintiff as having knowledge of the conflict between Green and Plaintiff. (Lee Dec., Doc. 29-9 at PageID 3271-72; Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1649-59.) Interviewees described Plaintiff as difficult, opinionated, a complainer, disrespectful, and hostile. (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1649-59.)
During the course of the investigation, Lee discovered that Plaintiff told several coworkers, including Green, that she had a concealed carry weapon permit. Plaintiff told Rabb she had a concealed carry weapon permit and parked several blocks away in a high crime area, but she felt safe because she was "protected," implying she carried her gun on her walk to work. (Id.) Both the Union president, Crystal Young, and Union vice president, Linda Hudson, stated that several Union members told them that Plaintiff bragged about her guns and that that they believed Plaintiff should go through the metal detectors because she was creating anxiety among her peers. (Id.) Management also was concerned about statements made by Plaintiff such as "I will do what I have to do to keep myself from being placed in a position of risk." (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1649.)
Biersack determined that a specific inquiry into whether Plaintiff [*11]  was bringing a gun to work was necessary because it involved workplace safety and well-being. (Biersack Dep., Doc. 29-3 at PageID 3053-54.) To that end, on August 12, 2016, Biersack held a meeting with Plaintiff, McCartney, Ashmore, Rabb, Lee, and Deputy Sheriff James York to inquire whether Plaintiff was bringing a gun onto agency premises. (Id. at PageID 3054; York Decl., Doc. 29-21 at PageID 3514.)
At the meeting, York asked Hendley if she had a firearm on her person or if she had brought a firearm into the workplace that day. (York Decl., Doc. 29-21 at PageID 3515.) According to York, Plaintiff denied having a firearm in her possession, and immediately jumped up, threw her hands out and exclaimed that she could "get naked" and that Deputy York could "strip search" her. (Id.) Deputy York told Plaintiff to "relax" and that he had no intentions of strip searching her. (Id.) He explained that bringing a firearm into work was against Hamilton County and HCJFS policy and that some coworkers heard her remark she was not afraid to walk in the dark to work because she walked with a gun and had a concealed carry permit. (Id.)
Plaintiff did not deny making those comments, and she said she had [*12]  booby trapped her desk, file cabinet, and home doors and windows. (Id.) Hendley offered to allow a search of her desk and file cabinets to confirm she did not possess a gun at work. (Id.) Deputy York followed Hendley to her cubicle and she "violently and aggressively" pulled open her desk and cabinet doors, threw items from her desk and cabinet, ripped open her Tupperware container and dumped out its contents, and threw her purse at Deputy York. (Id. at PageID 3516.) Deputy York determined that Hendley did not possess a gun on her person or in her work space, and he reported that, as well as Plaintiff's "extreme" behavior, to management. (Id.)
Plaintiff was required to go through the building's metal detectors until the investigation was complete, spanning August 14, 2016 through August 29, 2016, although for one of those weeks, Plaintiff was out sick. (Biersack Dep., Doc. 17 at PageID 176, 230-32.) Plaintiff's name was not posted in plain view for all to see; rather, security personnel were verbally informed of the requirement that she enter through the metal detector. (York Dec., Doc. 29-21 at PageID 3516-17.) Other employees have been required to temporarily go through metal detectors. [*13]  (Id.)
Lee concluded his investigation and found Hendley's level of performance to be acceptable, but a pervasive air of discontent in regards to her office deportment. (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1658.) He noted Hendley's history of not getting along with others and talking about her guns, taking safety precautions to protect herself at home, and her booby traps on her work desk. (Id. at PageID 1659.) However, Lee found no evidence that she ever brought weapons into the workplace or made direct threats. (Id.) He concluded that Hendley continued to display a pattern of irrational and disruptive behavior that could not be tolerated and needed to stop. (Id.) As a result of the investigation, Hendley was moved to an area away from Green and was no longer required to enter through the metal detector. (Biersack Dep., Doc. 29-3 at PageID 3055.)
Around the same timeframe as the dispute with Green, in June through August of 2016, Plaintiff's productivity declined, and she processed only three changes per hour rather than the required five. (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1505.) As a result, on August 31, 2016, Plaintiff was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan ("PIP"). (Id.) Six weeks later, Plaintiff was [*14]  released from the PIP, because she was averaging the required five changes per hour. (Id. at PageID 1609.)

C. Request for Standing and Flexible Work Station
On November 18, 2013, Dr. Douglas C. Moody, M.D. wrote a prescription for a standing work station to address Plaintiff's diagnosis of cervical disc disease and ulnar neuropathy. On November 21, 2013, Plaintiff requested a standing work station. The request was forwarded to Carolyn Wallis, who processes FMLA and ADA requests. An ADA committee met with Plaintiff on January 15, 2014 to discuss her request. Following the meeting, Defendants made adjustments to Plaintiff's work station, but the adjustments "didn't work" for Plaintiff. (Hendley Dep., Doc. 21 at PageID 820.) As a result, in the summer of 2014, Plaintiff asked for an adjustable work station rather than one that simply allowed her to stand. Wallis instructed Plaintiff to provide an updated doctor's note to clarify the request. In November 2014, Plaintiff emailed Wallis and stated she had an updated doctor clarification but did not provide the requested documentation until December.
Wallis was unfamiliar with a standing/sitting desk combination so she asked for Plaintiff to [*15]  send her examples of what she would like. (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1388.) Plaintiff flippantly responded, "Hmmm...I don't understand that...I simply used Google then typed in standing/sitting desk combo - that results in 638,0000 listings or hits ...then I typed in flexible work stations - that has results in 6,100.000 listings or hits...I only looked at the first dozen or so on each." (Doc. 21-5 at PageID 1388.) Once Plaintiff narrowed down what she wanted, she was provided with a flexible "Varidesk" on January 16, 2015, as requested. Plaintiff did not notify Wallis that she needed any accommodation other than the flexible workstation.

D. Alleged Denied Promotions
Plaintiff alleges that there are 23 positions from 2007 through 2016 for which she was denied promotion. Of these positions, Plaintiff only knows who was promoted instead of her to two of them: Robert Vanderburg was promoted to Call Center Manager in 2010 and Neatra Lockett was promoted to Team Leader-Call Center in 2016. (Hendley Dep., Doc. 21 at PageID 775, 791, 794-95.) For all 23 positions, Plaintiffs admits she does not know the qualifications of those promoted versus her, not seen their personnel records or applications, [*16]  was not present in their interviews, and does not know what any of their written responses were or what the interview panels recommended or why. (Id. at PageID 734-36, 781-82, 784, 787, 794-95.)
For the Team Leader - Call Center position in 2016, Plaintiff admits that Defendants followed the prescribed multi-level process to narrow down candidates and make a selection for the position. Plaintiff met the posting qualifications and "short list criteria" to be granted a first round interview, during which applicants were asked a series of scripted questions. McCartney and Karen Evans were the two interviewers for Hendley's first round interview, and Plaintiff did not advance past that first round process. (McCartney Dec., Doc. 29-1 at PageID 3004-05.) According to McCartney, Hendley responded to scripted questions with answers that were critical of the job posting and did not exhibit big picture thinking the interviewers were looking for. (Id. at PageID 3005.) Plaintiff's answers were focused on issues she was experiencing in her case management work rather than larger issues affecting the agency that a team leader would have to consider in managing a team and a team's function in the [*17]  agency. (Id.) Plaintiff was not considered an ideal fit for the position and was not offered a second interview. (Id.) Neatra Lockett was deemed the most qualified candidate for the position based on her final score, and because she had directly-relevant prior call center supervisory experience. (Id.)

E. 2016 Heart Attack
Plaintiff suffered a heart attack on September 9, 2016. (Doc. 29-5.) Plaintiff conveyed to colleagues that the stress of the workplace caused her heart attack. However, Plaintiff admitted at her deposition that her heart attack occurred because her arteries were blocked. Further, Defendants' expert, Dr. John D. Corl, a board certified interventional cardiologist with the Ohio Heart and Vascular Center at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, reviewed Hendley's medical records and concluded:
Ms. Hendley had multiple powerful risk factors for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction including tobacco abuse, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, age and strong family history of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Review of her cardiac catherization images and cinegraphic runs from both September 9, 2016 and September 20, 2016 revealed extensive diffuse coronary [*18]  artery disease with extensive calcification consistent with chronic underlying altherosclerotic disease. These findings are indicative of decades of progressive coronary artery disease. Her underlying, advanced, diffuse coronary artery disease in conjunction with her co-morbid conditions and cardiac risk factors put her at significant risk for an acute myocardial infarction. These factors directly led to the acute myocardial infarction she suffered on September 9, 2016. It is highly unlikely that the stress related to her occupation contributed significantly to her underlying coronary artery disease and the acute inferior myocardial infarction that occurred on September 9, 2016.
(Id. at PageID 3157.) In addition, Drs. Martin, Mickelson, and Moody, Plaintiff's treating physicians, deny telling Plaintiff that the stress of her workplace, exacerbated her condition or directly led to her heart attack, and all endorse Dr. Corl's opinion in its entirety.

F. FMLA Leave
Plaintiff's request for FMLA leave from September 9, 2016 through September 25, 2016 was approved by HCJFS. (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1535-38.) She took additional FMLA time in 2016 following her return to work on September 26, 2016. [*19]  (Id. at 1817-18.)
There is no reference to FMLA usage in Plaintiff's evaluations from 2009 through 2015, and she did not use FMLA during any of those years. There is no reference to FMLA usage in Plaintiff's 2016 evaluation, but it appears on an attachment which includes all leave requested during the evaluation year.

G. 2018 Supervisor Change
In 2018, Plaintiff sent an email to Human Resources reporting that she had a prior romantic relationship with her supervisor, Rabb. (Hendley Dep., Doc. 21 at PageID 587-88.) Immediately thereafter, HR moved Plaintiff to a new supervisor, Krishawna Scott. (Id. at PageID 588.) Plaintiff claims her relationship with Rabb was sexual and lasted nine years, but Rabb denies the existence of a sexual relationship. (Id. at 589; Rabb Dep., Doc. 19 at PageID 446-48.)

H. Procedural History
Plaintiff initiated this action on June 14, 2017. (Doc. 2.) She asserts the following claims: (1) disability discrimination in violation of "federal law"; (2) disability discrimination in violation of Ohio Rev. Code § 4112; (3) interference and retaliation with Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), 29 U.S.C. § 2601; (4) race and gender discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (5) race and gender discrimination in violation of Ohio Rev. Code § 4112; (6) age discrimination [*20]  in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 623, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (7) age discrimination in violation of Ohio Rev. Code § 4112; (8) breach of Ohio public policy for discrimination based on disability and/or age; (9) disparate treatment in violation of Title VII on the basis of sex, age, and gender;4 (10) retaliation for exercising rights under federal and state law; (11) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (12) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (13) invasion of privacy. Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment on June 3, 2019.5 On July 22, 2019, Plaintiff responded in opposition (Doc. 34), and on July 24, 2019, Defendants replied (Doc. 35).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 governs motions for summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate if "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant has the burden of showing that no genuine issues of material fact are in dispute. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-87 (1986); Provenzano v. LCI Holdings, Inc., 663 F.3d 806, 811 (6th Cir. 2011). The evidence, together with all inferences that can permissibly be drawn therefrom, must be read in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd., 475 U.S. at 585-87; Provenzano, 663 F.3d at 811.
The movant may support a motion for summary judgment with affidavits or other proof or by exposing [*21]  the lack of evidence on an issue for which the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-24 (1986). Pursuant to Rule 56(c)(4), "an affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion [for summary judgment] must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated."
In responding to a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party may not rest upon the pleadings but must go beyond the pleadings and "present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 257 (1986). The Court's task is not "to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Id. at 249. A genuine issue for trial exists when there is sufficient "evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Id. at 252. "The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).

III. ANALYSIS
Defendants move for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's claims. As set out more fully herein, Plaintiff did not respond to substantive arguments on several of her claims. The Court will [*22]  treat these claims as abandoned and award summary judgment to Defendant on them. See Hicks v. Concorde Career Coll., 449 F. App'x 484, 487 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding that a district court properly declines to consider the merits of a claim that a plaintiff fails to address in a response to a motion for summary judgment); Clark v. City of Dublin, 178 F. App'x 522, 524-25 (6th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that the failure to respond properly to motion for summary judgment arguments constitutes abandonment of a claim).
In addition, Plaintiff's brief fails to identify material questions of fact that would preclude summary judgment. Her prosecution of this case has been minimal. Defendants contend that Plaintiff conducted no written discovery. Plaintiff sat for deposition and deposed only one individual. She also provided declarations of her three treating physicians, all of whom endorse the opinion of Defendants' medical expert. Her response brief relies heavily upon her Verified Complaint, deposition testimony, and her own affidavit submitted in response to Defendants' Motion, most of which consists of self-serving speculation and argument not based on fact.6 A plaintiff responding to summary judgment must support her position with record evidence and cannot evade summary judgment by conducting discovery in a manner designed [*23]  to avoid establishing such evidence. See Harvey v. Campbell Cty., Tenn., 453 F. App'x 557, 565 (6th Cir. 2011) (plaintiffs who failed to conduct discovery designed to uncover facts supporting their allegations were unable to rely upon speculative, unsupported allegations to create doubt in opposing summary judgment).
Furthermore, Plaintiff relies extensively upon her affidavit, but it generally falls woefully short of setting out Plaintiff's personal knowledge and admissible facts as required under Rule 56(c)(4). "[U]ltimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law, as well as statements made on belief or 'on information and belief,' cannot be utilized on a summary-judgment motion. Similarly, the mere reargument of a party's case or the denial of an opponent's allegations will be disregarded." 10B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2738 (4th ed.). "Self-serving affidavits, alone, are not enough to create an issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment." Wolfe v. Village of Brice, Ohio, 37 F. Supp. 2d 1021, 1026 (S.D. Ohio 1999). Although the Court will not strike Plaintiff's affidavit, it is unable to consider much of it as fact, and it will be given very little weight.
With these issues in mind, the Court will consider Plaintiff's claims, ultimately concluding that summary judgment for the [*24]  Defendants is merited.7

A. Defendants HCJFS and Hamilton County are Not Sui Juris
Defendants argue that HCJFS and Hamilton County are not sui juris and cannot be sued. The law on this is well-established, and the Court agrees. Furthermore, Plaintiff did not respond to Defendants' argument.
Under Ohio law, if a county has adopted a charter or an alternative form of government, it may sue and be sued. Ohio Rev. Code § 301.22. However, absent that, a county may only be sued through its Board of Commissioners. Ohio Rev. Code § 305.12. Hamilton County has not adopted a charter or alternative form of government; thus, it lacks the ability to sue or be sued. Lowe v. Hamilton Cty. Dept. of Job and Family Serv., No. 1:05-cv-117, 2008 WL 816669, at *2 (S.D. Ohio 2008) (adopting report and recommendation finding neither Hamilton County nor HCJFS to be sui juris). Accordingly, the claims against HCJFS and Hamilton County are properly dismissed.

B. Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff alleges disability discrimination in violation of "federal law"8 and Ohio Rev. Code § 4112. Plaintiff alleges she was discriminated against based on her disability because Defendants failed to provide a reasonable accommodation and denied her a promotion or transfer, but the record evidence is insufficient to support these claims.
The ADA, as amended in the ADAAA, provides that a covered employer [*25]  "shall [not] discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Discrimination is defined to include "denying employment opportunities to a job applicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified individual with a disability, if such denial is based on the need of such covered entity to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of the employee or applicant." 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(B). A plaintiff asserting an ADA discrimination claim has the burden to show that the disability is the but-for cause for the adverse employment decision. Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp., Inc., 681 F.3d 312, 321 (6th Cir. 2012). Likewise, Ohio's anti-discrimination statute also prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of disability. Ohio Rev. Code § 4112.02(A). Because the federal and state statutes contain similar prohibitions, courts rely on interpretations of the ADA as persuasive authority in interpreting Ohio's disability discrimination law. Hostetettler v. College of Wooster, 895 F.3d 844, 848 (6th Cir. 2018).
The following elements comprise a prima facie case for failure to accommodate under the ADA: (1) Plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of [*26]  the ADA; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the position, such that she can perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation; (3) the employer knew or had reason to know of Plaintiff's disability; (4) Plaintiff requested an accommodation; and (5) the employer failed to provide a reasonable accommodation thereafter. Green v. BakeMark USA, LLC, No. 16-3141, 2017 WL 1147168, at *3 (6th Cir. Mar. 27, 2017) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (citing Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Dist., 443 F. App'x 974, 982-83 (6th Cir. 2011)). If Plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that any particular accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer." Id. (citing Johnson, 443 F. App'x at 983.)
Plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to sustain a failure to accommodate claim. The only evidence of Plaintiff's disability are two prescriptions which state a diagnosis of cervical disc disease and ulnar neuropathy.9 Plaintiff was provided both a standing and flexible work station. She claims that Defendants took over a year to accommodate her, but the evidence demonstrates that the delay in getting Plaintiff her flexible work station is contributed to Plaintiff's changing requests from a standing to a standing/sitting flexible desk, her own delay in providing an updated prescription from her [*27]  doctor, and being unhelpful in assisting her employer with selecting the type of product to best fit her needs during the interactive process.10 Under the ADA, to determine a reasonable accommodation, it is necessary for the employer to initiate and participate in an informal, interactive process with the employee. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3). This process "requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations," is "mandatory, and "both parties have a duty to participate in good faith." Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 485 F.3d 862, 871 (6th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Plaintiff's flippant email to Wallis when she was trying to find a flexible work station to accommodate Plaintiff's request is an example of Plaintiff not participating in the interactive process as it was intended. Ultimately, Plaintiff was provided a work desk that accommodated her doctor's request within a reasonable timeframe of Plaintiff providing an updated doctor's note. Thus, the Court finds no evidence to support a failure to accommodate her request for a flexible work station.
Plaintiff also argues that Defendants failed to accommodate her request to not meet the MWOs of processing a required number of changes per hour. Plaintiff has not identified any medical evidence of [*28]  a disability or doctor's note that supports such an accommodation being necessary or reasonable. Further, Plaintiff has not identified any record evidence that Defendants had knowledge that Plaintiff needed an accommodation other than the flexible work station. The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that a proposed accommodation is reasonable. Kleiber, 485 F.3d at 870. Relying solely on her subjective opinion, she has not done so here.
In addition, Plaintiff's argument that she was discriminated against based on denied opportunities is insufficient. To make out a prima facie case of employment discrimination through indirect evidence under the ADA, Plaintiff must show: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) she suffered an adverse employment decision; (4) her employer knew or had reason to know of her disability; and (5) the position remained open while the employer sought other applicants or the disabled individual was replaced. Whitfield v. Tenn., 639 F.3d 253, 259 (6th Cir. 2011). (internal quotation and citation omitted); see also Ferrari v. Ford Motor Co., 826 F.3d 885, 894 (6th Cir. 2016) (same). Once a Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of disability discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate [*29]  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse action. Id. Once the employer discharges its burden of production, the employee must demonstrate that the proffered reason was pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. Id.
Plaintiff contends that she was denied a transfer because of her disability. The record demonstrates that Plaintiff was given opportunities to transfer that she refused, and that when she complained about Green, she ultimately was moved or transferred away from Green. In any event, Plaintiff is unable to prove that a transfer was a reasonable accommodation to a disability.
Plaintiff argues that she was denied a promotion based on disability. In support of this claim, Plaintiff has provided no evidence about the job duties of the positions she claims she was denied or the qualifications or disability status of the individuals who were selected for those positions. In her response brief, Plaintiff identifies two positions she believes she was denied promotion for based on her disability, a Call Center Manager position to which she applied in 2010 and a Team Leader-Call Center position to which she applied in 2016. The 2010 position is barred under the ADA [*30]  (and Title VII) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and Ohio law for being brought outside of the statute of limitations. See Williams v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 53 F. App'x 350, 351-52 (6th Cir. 2002) (to exhaust administrative remedies under the ADA and Title VII, a plaintiff must file an EEOC charge within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice, or if the plaintiff has instituted proceedings with a state or local agency, within 300 days.); Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc., 70 Ohio St. 3d 281, 282, 638 N.E.2d 991 (1994) (an action under Ohio Rev. Code. § 4112 is subject to a six-year statute of limitations). Plaintiff's EEOC charge filed in August 2016 was outside the window of time in which to file a timely charge for discrimination for denial of promotion in 2010. This action, brought in 2017, would be untimely under Ohio law with respect to the 2010 position.
Regarding the 2016 Team Leader-Call Center position, Defendants identified evidence that Lockett was the most qualified candidate based on her final score and prior experience. Plaintiff has offered no evidence about her qualifications for the position. Rather, she relies upon conclusory and opinion statements that do not provide sufficient evidence of pretext. Thus, Plaintiff's claim of disability discrimination based upon denial of a promotion is without merit.
In addition, [*31]  Plaintiff argues that she was denied a pay raise because of her disability. Defendant has submitted evidence that Plaintiff received every pay raise she was due under the collective bargaining agreement, and Plaintiff does not refute this. (Biersack Dec., Doc. 29-3 at PageID 3056.)
Finally, Plaintiff contends that her "medical condition" was referenced in her evaluation and evaluation process. She does not cite any reliable evidence which supports this claim. Furthermore, she fails to link any alleged referencing of her medical condition to an adverse action. Plaintiff received a score of "achieved" on her 2015 evaluation and a score of "exceeded" on her 2016 evaluation. Although she also implies that she did not need a performance improvement plan and was discriminatorily placed on one, the evidence upon which she relies is her own subjective opinion. Plaintiff supports this position by arguing that the metrics upon which she was evaluated were "cooked" and contradict her "chits." Regardless, Plaintiff was released from her performance improvement plan, and there is no evidence that the plan had anything to do with her disability.
For these reasons, Defendants are entitled to summary [*32]  judgment on Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims.

C. FMLA Retaliation
Defendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' FMLA claim. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants interfered and/or retaliated with her use of FMLA.11 To prove a claim of retaliation, she most prove: (1) she was engaged in an activity protected by the FMLA; (2) the employer knew that she was exercising her rights under the FMLA; (3) after learning of the employee's exercise of FMLA rights, the employer took an employment action adverse to her; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected FMLA activity and the adverse employment action. Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Killian v. Yorozu Auto. Tenn., Inc., 454 F.3d 549, 556 (6th Cir. 2006)).
Plaintiff claims she was denied a transfer away from Green based on her use of FMLA and that her use of FMLA was brought out in evaluations. The evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff was offered transfers she denied, and her transfer away from Green predated her use of FMLA leave on September 9, 2016. Plaintiff also contends that her FMLA needs were brought out in the evaluation and evaluation process. There is no reference to FMLA usage in Plaintiff's 2016 evaluation, although it appears on an attachment listing all leave used during the evaluation period. [*33]  (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1811-20.) As previously noted, Plaintiff met expectations in her 2015 and 2016 evaluations and in fact received a higher score on her 2016 evaluation, the year she took FMLA leave. Her 2017 evaluation is not in the record. And again, her opinion that her numbers were "cooked" and she did not need a performance improvement plan is not based on any reliable, identifiable record evidence. Thus, there is no evidence her FMLA leave was mentioned or used against her in her evaluations. Finally, Plaintiff has offered no evidence of a causal connection between use of her FMLA activity and an adverse employment action. As such, summary judgment for Defendants is appropriate.

D. Sex Discrimination
Plaintiff alleges gender discrimination in violation of federal and state law, disparate treatment based on gender, and hostile work environment based on gender. To prove a prima facie case of sex discrimination, Plaintiff must show she: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was subjected to an adverse employment decision; (3) was qualified for the position; and (4) was replaced by a person outside the protected class, or that a similarly situated employee outside of the protected [*34]  class was treated in a more favorable manner. Vincent v. Brewer Co., 514 F.3d 489, 494 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Peltier v. U.S., 388 F.3d 984, 987 (6th Cir. 2004)).12 If Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, an inference of discrimination arises and the burden of proof shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. Laderach v. U-Haul of Nw. Ohio, 207 F.3d 825, 828 (6th Cir. 2000). Once established, the burden shifts back to the Plaintiff to prove the employer's reason was a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Id.
Plaintiff claims that she suffered an adverse action in that she was denied promotions based on her sex. For reasons discussed supra, the Court will not consider the 2010 position. With respect to the 2016 Team Leader-Call Center position, aside from the fact that Defendants have identified unrebutted evidence that Lockett was more qualified for the position than Plaintiff, Lockett is also a female and within the same protected class as Plaintiff. (Doc. 21-6 at PageID 1671.) Thus, Plaintiff is unable to establish her prima facie case based on denial of a promotion.
Plaintiff also argues that she was discriminated against because she was made to go through the metal detector "like a common criminal." (Doc. 34 at PageID 3816.) She claims that the decision to make her enter through a metal detector [*35]  "removing her freedom to come and go as an employee" was made by three men and therefore is discriminatory based on sex. (Id.) The evidence in the record does not demonstrate that the decision to have Plaintiff enter work through a metal detector during the course of an investigation into whether she was bringing a weapon into work was based on her sex. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that requirement was based upon statements Plaintiff made at work and her own conduct and personal conflicts with her coworkers. Furthermore, even if Plaintiff were to establish a prima facie case, which she does not, she has identified no evidence of pretext. She merely states that genuine issues of facts abound, which falls short of her burden to identify record evidence of pretext.
In addition to her disparate treatment claims, Plaintiff also alleges she was the victim of a hostile work environment based on sex. "A violation of Title VII is established if discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment." Hawkins v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 517 F.3d 321, 332 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). To prevail on a hostile work environment claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) she belonged to a protected group; (2) she was subject [*36]  to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on sex; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is liable for the harassment. Williams v. CSX Transp. Co., 643 F.3d 502, 511 (6th Cir. 2011); Thornton v. Fed. Express Corp., 530 F.3d 451, 455 (6th Cir. 2008). Where the harasser is a supervisor, meaning someone "empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions against" the plaintiff, the plaintiff may establish liability based on a supervisor's participation in the harassment that created the hostile work environment. Blackmon v. Eaton Corp., 587 F. App'x 925, 930, n.2 (6th Cir. 2014); Vance v. Ball State Univ., 570 U.S. 421, 424 (2013) (definition of "supervisor"). When liability is not based upon supervisor conduct, it may be established by an employer's negligence in discovering or remedying harassment by the plaintiff's coworkers. Blackmon, 587 F. App'x at 930.
Plaintiff argues that "Biersack, Ashmore and McCartney had made it known to Plaintiff that she was unwelcome. They made a point to make her feel demeaned and uncomfortable." (Doc. 34 at PageID 3818.) Plaintiff relies upon broad, sweeping conclusions and opinions rather than record evidence to attempt to sustain her claim. She has identified no record evidence of severe and pervasive conduct or harassment based on her sex. Instead, the conduct of which she appears [*37]  to complain is based upon apparent long-standing issues with Plaintiff's ability to get along with her colleagues.
Plaintiff also asserts that she had a long term sexual relationship with Rabb, which he denies. Plaintiff claims this relationship caused him to demonstrate "gender hatred" toward her. (Hendley Dep., Doc. 21 at PageID 703.) Crediting Plaintiff's testimony that such a relationship existed, Plaintiff has not identified concrete examples of how this relationship created a hostile work environment. The record establishes that when the relationship was reported in 2018, Defendants immediately moved Plaintiff to a new supervisor. Plaintiff has not identified that anyone was aware of the alleged relationship prior to her 2018 email or that Rabb acted discriminatorily towards her as a result of this relationship. Her broad conclusions about his "gender hatred" do not establish that as fact.
Lacking any record evidence to sustain her sex discrimination claims, summary judgment for the Defendants is appropriate.

E. Race and Age Discrimination
Defendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiff's race and age discrimination claims. Plaintiff did not respond to Defendants' substantive arguments [*38]  or identify any record evidence to support such claims. The Court therefore considers these claims abandoned, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on them.

F. Notice as to § 1983 Claims
Plaintiff cites 42 U.S.C. § 1983 along with Title VII and the ADEA as the basis for her employment discrimination claims based on race, gender, and age in Counts 4 and 6. Although Defendants clearly move for summary judgment as to all claims, they do not cite § 1983 in so moving nor do they provide legal analysis on the application of § 1983. The Court is unclear whether this was an oversight or if Defendants believe that Plaintiff did not properly plead claims under § 1983. In responding to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff proceeds as though she pled a § 1983 claim based upon violation of the First Amendment, which is plainly not asserted in the Complaint. Plaintiff makes no mention of any § 1983 claim based upon race, gender, or age discrimination in responding to summary judgment.
The Court questions whether Plaintiff alleged a viable § 1983 claim on race, gender, and age, because the basis for her claims appear to be identical to her Title VII and ADEA claims. Further, she abandoned her race and age discrimination claims in responding to summary judgment. Courts [*39]  in the Sixth Circuit have found that Title VII and the ADEA provide the exclusive remedy for race and age discrimination when the purported § 1983 claim is based upon violation of Title VII or ADEA. Day v. Wayne Cty Bd. of Auditors, 749 F.2d 1199, 1204 (6th Cir. 1984) (Title VII); Committee v. Jianping Zhu, No. 1:17-cv-1534, 2017 WL 4512479, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 17, 2017) (ADEA).
However, the Sixth Circuit has also recognized that an employee may sue her public employer under both Title VII and § 1983 when the § 1983 violation rests on a claim of infringement of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, e.g., the Fourteenth Amendment. Toth v. City of Toledo, 480 F. App'x 827, 831 (6th Cir. 2012); see Bullington v. Bedford Cty., Tenn., 905 F.3d 467, 473 (6th Cir. 2018) (ADA did not preclude employee's equal protection claims under § 1983). In this case, Plaintiff references the Fourteenth Amendment and equal protection in her Complaint, but concurrently cites either Title VII or the ADEA along with § 1983, and the harm alleged seems to be that of a standard employment discrimination claim. Plaintiff has inartfully pled a § 1983 claim at best and insufficiently pled one at worst.
Regardless, even if the Court were to find that Plaintiff pled viable constitutionally-based equal protection claims under § 1983 independent of her claims for violation of Title VII and the ADEA, summary judgment for Defendants is appropriate for the same basis as the corresponding statutory claims, the analysis for which is located infra. The Court accordingly hereby gives notice [*40]  that it considers summary judgment to be appropriate on Plaintiff's § 1983 claims under Fed. Rule of Civ. P. 56(f)(2), which states that after giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, the Court may grant the motion for summary judgment on "grounds not raised by a party." Plaintiff may respond to this notice by written brief filed with the Court by October 14, 2019 if she wishes to contest to the Court's notice of its intent to grant summary judgment on her § 1983 claims.
In its review of this case, the Court has not found any evidence that would support a § 1983 claim based upon denied equal protection on the basis of race, gender, or age. To succeed on her § 1983 claim, Plaintiff must prove: (1) that she was deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or federal laws; and (2) that the deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Toth, 480 F. App'x at 831. "[T]o establish an equal protection violation against a public employer in a section 1983 action, a plaintiff must show that the employer made an adverse employment decision 'with a discriminatory intent and purpose.'" Foster v. Mich., 573 F. App'x 377, 391 (6th Cir. 2014) (citing Boger v. Wayne Cty., 950 F.2d 316, 324-25 (6th Cir. 1991)). "A plaintiff in a § 1983 equal protection case must demonstrate that the adverse employment decision would not have occurred but for her protected status." Id. [*41]  (citing Boger, 950 F.2d at 325). "A plaintiff 'must do more than just introduce evidence of discriminatory intent and suggest that such intent could have played a role in an adverse employment decision.'" Id. (citing Boger) (internal quotations removed).
For the same reasons Plaintiff's Title VII and ADEA claims fail, there is no evidence of discriminatory intent on the basis of age, sex, or race. Accordingly, summary judgment for the Defendants is appropriate on Plaintiff's § 1983 claims.

G. Breach of Ohio Public Policy
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's breach of Ohio public policy claim is barred under Ohio law. Again, Plaintiff failed to respond to Defendants' argument, and the Court will therefore consider the claim abandoned. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

H. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. To establish such a claim under Ohio law, Plaintiff must show: (1) the actor intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should have known that their actions would result in serious emotional distress; (2) the actor's conduct was so extreme as to go beyond all possible bounds of [*42]  decency and can be considered utterly intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actor's actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiff's psychic injury; and (4) mental anguish suffered by the Plaintiff is serious and of a nature that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it. Torres v. White, 46 F. App'x 738, 754-55 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Garcia v. ANR Freight Sys., 942 F. Supp. 351, 359 (N.D. Ohio 1996)).
Defendants argue Plaintiff lacks evidence to meet the elements of this claim and that there is no evidence that Defendants' conduct is "so extreme as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency." Plaintiff did not cite any record evidence in response to Defendants' arguments. She responded with the broad assertion that she "suffered a great deal of distress" and that the hostility and harassment she suffered caused her heart attack. (Doc. 34 at PageID 3821.) Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden on this claim. Further, as set forth in the facts, Plaintiff's treating physicians agree with their expert that her heart attack was likely not caused by workplace stress. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

I. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
Plaintiff does not respond to Defendants' argument that she failed to prove negligent infliction of emotional distress. As [*43]  such, the Court considers the claim abandoned, and summary judgment is appropriate for Defendants.

J. Invasion of Privacy
To prove an invasion of privacy claim under Ohio state law, Plaintiff must show "a wrongful intrusion into one's private activities in a manner that outrages or causes mental suffering, shame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities." Peitsmeyer v. Jackson Twp. Bd. of Trustees, No. 02AP-1174, 2003 WL 21940713, 2003-Ohio-4302, at *6 (Ohio 2003) (citing Browning v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol, 151 Ohio App. 3d 798, 814, 786 N.E.2d 94, 106 (2003)). "The intrusion must be 'highly offensive' to a reasonable person." Id. (citing Browning). The record evidence demonstrates Plaintiff authorized the search of her cubicle and that she dumped the contents of her purse and desk out during the search. Requiring Plaintiff to enter through the metal detector during a short period of time in which an investigation into whether she was bringing a firearm to work does not rise to the level of wrongful invasion of privacy. Plaintiff does not refute this or respond to Defendants' substantive arguments. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth by the Court, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 30) is GRANTED. However, the case will not be closed from the docket until after the time passes for [*44]  Plaintiff to respond to the Court's findings about her § 1983 claims. Both the Final Pretrial Conference set for October 17, 2019 and Trial set for November 18, 2019 are VACATED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
