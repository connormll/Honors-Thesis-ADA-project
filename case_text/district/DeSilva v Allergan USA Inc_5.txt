CIVIL MINUTES — GENERAL

PROCEEDINGS: (IN CHAMBERS) ORDER (1) GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 36) AND (2) DENYING AS MOOT PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (Doc. 38)
Before the Court are two Motions for Summary Judgment, one filed by Plaintiff Jennifer DeSilva (Pl. MSJ, Doc. 38) and one filed by Defendant Allergan USA, Inc. ("Allergan") (Def. MSJ, Doc. 36). The parties opposed each other's Motions (Def. Opp'n, Doc. 50; Pl. Opp'n, Doc. 51), and filed replies (Pl. Reply, Doc. 61, Def. Reply, Doc. 60). Having considered the parties' briefs and oral argument, for the reasons set forth below, the Court (1) GRANTS Defendant's Motion and (2) DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff's Motion.

I. BACKGROUND
This dispute arises out of DeSilva's termination as a sales representative at Allergan. Allergan argues that DeSilva was terminated for violation of its conflict of interest policy, while DeSilva maintains she was fired due to unlawful retaliation and discrimination based on a medical condition.

A. DeSilva's Employment with Allergan [*2]  and Rodan
Allergan sells products in the beauty and skincare industry. (Def. Reply Statement of Undisputed Facts ("RSUF") ¶ 6, Doc. 60-1). DeSilva began working for Allergan's predecessor, Forest Pharmaceutical, as a sales representative in 2007 and remained employed with Allergan until June 2019. (Id. ¶ 7-8). In 2014, while working for Allergan, DeSilva also began working as a sales representative for Rodan & Fields ("Rodan"). (Id. ¶ 9). Rodan also sells products in the beauty and skincare industry. (Id. ¶ 10).
In October 2017, Allergan issued a conflict of interest policy requiring employees to be free of "any conflict of interest that might compromise objectivity or business judgment." (Id. ¶ 13). In 2018, Carol Sweeney, an Associate Director in Compliance, and Sally Cummings, an Associate Director in Human Resources, terminated the employment of Allergan sales representative Danielle Logan because she was unwilling to stop simultaneously working for Rodan. (Id. ¶ 15). Following Logan's termination, on February 1, 2019, Allergan's Compliance Department issued a written memo reiterating Allergan's conflict of interest policy. (Id. ¶ 16).
Following her review of the February 2019 memo, [*3]  one of DeSilva's supervisors, Cecily Elliston, reported DeSilva to Lance Moore in Compliance because she believed DeSilva was in violation of Allergan's conflict of interest policy. (Id. ¶ 18). Moore told Elliston to forward the February 2019 memo to DeSilva to give her an opportunity to "self-report," and Elliston forwarded the memo to her team—including DeSilva—on February 11, 2019. (Id. ¶ 19-20). Three days later, on February 14, Elliston met with DeSilva and DeSilva confirmed that she had reviewed the memo and was working for Rodan. (Id. ¶ 21). Elliston told Moore that she had instructed DeSilva to contact Compliance, and on February 19, Moore instructed Sweeney to conduct an investigation if DeSilva failed to self-report her working relationship with Rodan. (Id. ¶ 23-24).

B. DeSilva's Medical Absence
Shortly after DeSilva was reported to Compliance for her potential violation of the conflict of interest policy, DeSilva commenced a three-month absence from work. (Id. ¶ 27). In January 2019, DeSilva underwent genetic testing; she received the results of the testing on February 18, 2019. (Plaintiff's Statement of Genuine Disputes ("SGD"), Doc. 51-2 at 33).1 DeSilva was diagnosed with [*4]  a genetic mutation that means she has a 60% risk of developing six types of cancer. (Id. at 35). Based on this diagnosis, DeSilva experienced high levels of stress and anxiety that made it difficult for her to work, and so she informed Elliston of her test results and need for medical leave on February 28, 2019. (Id. at 36).
DeSilva's doctor ordered her to take an eleven-week medical absence from March 1 to May 20, 2019. (Id.) DeSilva notified Defendant and requested an accommodation through Defendant's internal procedures. (Id.) She remained absent from work until her return on May 24, 2019. (Id. at 43). Although Defendant had made preparations to fill her position, Defendant nonetheless returned DeSilva to her previous position. (RSUF ¶ 49).

C. DeSilva's Termination and Filing of this Lawsuit
On June 7, Compliance interviewed DeSilva about her potential conflict of interest and DeSilva confirmed that she was "an independent consultant with Rodan & Fields" (RSUF ¶¶ 29-30). Compliance informed DeSilva that working for Rodan was a violation of Allergan's conflict of interest policy and gave her until June 10, 2019 to decide whether she would continue working for Allegan and stop working for Rodan (Id. ¶ 31). DeSilva [*5]  failed to contact Compliance by the deadline, and on June 12, 2019, Cummings emailed DeSilva to give her a final notice that if DeSilva did not confirm she has stopped working for Rodan by the end of the day, Allergan would terminate her for violation of the company's Conflict of Interest Policy. (Id. ¶ 33). DeSilva did not respond because she "wasn't going to willingly terminate any relationship with Rodan & Fields or with Allergan." (Id. ¶ 34). On the evening of June 12, Cummings notified DeSilva in writing that her employment with Allergan was terminated. (Id. ¶ 36).
On July 19, 2019, DeSilva filed this lawsuit alleging eight causes of action: (1) retaliation under The California Family Rights Act (CFRA); (2) interference under CFRA; (3) medical condition discrimination; (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodation; (5) failure to engage in the interactive process; (6) retaliation under California's Fair Employment Housing Act ("FEHA"); (7) failure to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination; and (8) wrongful termination. (Ex. A to Notice of Removal ("NOR"), Doc. 1-1). Defendant timely removed. (NOR at 1).
Defendant now moves for summary judgment on each of DeSilva's [*6]  claims.

D. Defendant's Counterclaims
In response to DeSilva's complaint, Defendant asserted the following counterclaims: (1) fraud, (2) constructive trust, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) declaratory relief. (Amended Answer, Doc. 26). These counterclaims are based on the $19,122.95 in Short-Term Disability ("STD") payments Allergan made to DeSilva during her 2018 maternity leave while Allergan was unaware DeSilva was also earning income from Rodan.
Defendant argues that, during discovery in the current lawsuit, it learned that "DeSilva, while receiving these payments, was also earning approximately $18,000 a month from selling the products of [Rodan], one of its competitors." (Def. Opp'n at 1). Defendant states that, had DeSilva disclosed this income from Rodan, her STD benefit payments would have been zero because DeSilva's income from Rodan exceeded her base monthly salary under the STD Plan.
DeSilva moves for summary judgment on each of Defendant's counterclaims.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all justifiable inferences in that party's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Summary [*7]  judgment is proper "if the [moving party] shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [moving party] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual dispute is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the non-movant's favor, and a fact is "material" when it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. But "credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge." Acosta v. City of Costa Mesa, 718 F.3d 800, 828 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The role of the Court is not to resolve disputes of fact but to assess whether there are any factual disputes to be tried. The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the adverse party 'may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's pleading,' but must provide affidavits or other sources of evidence that 'set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'" Devereaux v. Abbey, 263 F.3d 1070, 1076 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).

III. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [*8] 
Defendant has moved for summary judgment on each of DeSilva's claims.

A. Retaliation and Interference under CFRA
Defendant argues that DeSilva's first and second causes of action under the CFRA fail as a matter of law because, as of March 1, 2019—the first day of DeSilva's requested medical leave—DeSilva had already exhausted all 12 weeks of job-protected leave to which she was entitled under the CFRA. (Mem. at 10). DeSilva fails to address this argument in her Opposition, or mention anything about her CFRA claims at all. (See Opp'n; Reply at 3). Accordingly, summary judgment for these claims is GRANTED. See Shakur v. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878, 892 (9th Cir. 2008) ("We have previously held that a plaintiff has 'abandoned . . . claims by not raising them in opposition to [the defendant's] motion for summary judgment.'"); Jenkins v. Cty. of Riverside, 398 F.3d 1093, 1095 n.4 (9th Cir. 2005) ("[Plaintiff] abandoned her other two claims by not raising them in opposition to the County's motion for summary judgment.")

B. Medical Condition Discrimination
DeSilva's third claim is for "medical condition discrimination" in violation of FEHA. FEHA prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee in the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" because of a medical condition.2 Cal. Gov't Code § 12940. To prevail on her discrimination [*9]  claim, DeSilva must show that she (1) suffered from a medical condition, (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her medical condition. Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 159-160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011), as modified on denial of reh'g (May 12, 2011).
California courts apply the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis to claims of discrimination under FEHA. Id. at 159. First, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of discrimination or retaliation. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Second, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. Third, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's proffered explanation is merely a pretext for a discriminatory or retaliatory motive. Id. at 804.
"A defendant's summary judgment motion 'slightly modifies the order of these [McDonnell Douglas] showings.'" Wills, 195 Cal. App. 4th at 160. Accordingly, Defendant's burden on its summary judgment motion is to either (1) negate an essential element of Plaintiff's prima facie case or (2) establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff. Id. Then, the burden shifts to Plaintiff [*10]  to offer "substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual." Id. (citing Hersant v. Department of Social Services, 57 Cal. App. 4th 997, 1004-1005, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 483).
Here, Defendant has met its burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating DeSilva, and DeSilva has failed to come forth with "substantial evidence" establishing pretext to defeat summary judgment.

Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason
Allergan's stated reason for terminating DeSilva is that she violated its conflict of interest policy by failing to end her working relationship with Rodan. The following facts establishing this reason for her termination are undisputed:3
(1) Allergan's Conflict of Interest Policy, issued in October 2017, prohibits "participating in outside employment that competes or does business with Allergan" (DeSilva Tr. 112:9-19, Doc. 36-3; Ex. N to DeSilva Tr., Doc. 36-3);
(2) Allergan issued a Memo in February 2019 reiterating its conflict of interest policy (DeSilva Tr. 156:18-25, 157:1-15; Ex. P to DeSilva Tr.);
(3) On February 11, Elliston forwarded the February 2019 Memo to her team, including DeSilva (DeSilva Tr. 157:16-158:14; Ex. P to DeSilva Tr.)
(4) On February 14, 2019, DeSilva confirmed [*11]  with her supervisor that she had received and reviewed the February 2019 Memo and that she was working for Rodan (DeSilva Tr. 162:20-163:9, 167:18-23);
(5) On June 7, 2019, during a phone interview with two members of Compliance, DeSilva again confirmed that she was "an independent consultant with Rodan & Fields" (DeSilva Tr. 212:18-25);
(6) Compliance informed DeSilva that working for Rodan was a violation of Allergan's conflict of interest policy and gave her until June 10, 2019 to notify Compliance whether she would continue working for Allegan and stop working for Rodan (DeSilva Tr. 212:14-216:15);
(7) On June 12, 2019, after DeSilva failed to contact Compliance by the June 10 deadline, Sally Cummings emailed DeSilva to give her a final notice that if DeSilva failed to confirm she has stopped working for Rodan by the end of the day, Allergan would "have no choice but to terminate [her] employment for the violation of the company's Conflict of Interest Policy" (DeSilva Tr. 216:24-217:17; Ex. 133 to DeSilva Tr.);
(8) DeSilva failed to respond to the email (DeSilva Tr. 217:18-22);
(9) DeSilva stated that the reason she did not respond to the email is because she "wasn't going to willingly [*12]  terminate any relationship with Rodan & Fields or with Allergan." (DeSilva Tr. 217:6-14);
(10) On the evening of June 12, 2019, Cummings notified DeSilva in writing that her employment was terminated. (Ex. 133 to DeSilva Tr.)
Additionally, Allergan has provided evidence that in 2018, it similarly terminated the employment of another Allergan employee, Danielle Logan, based on her "unwillingness to end her simultaneous working relationship with Rodan." (O'Hara Decl. ¶2, Doc. 36-7; DeSilva Tr. 263:5-265:7, Doc. 36-3). DeSilva does not genuinely dispute this fact. (Pl. SGD ¶ 15; DeSilva Tr. 263:5-265:7, Doc. 36-3).
Based on the above undisputed facts, the Court finds that Allergan has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for DeSilva's termination. See Paulk v. Sea-Land Servs., Inc., 83 F.3d 428 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that the employer "provided a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for [the employee's] discharge based on [the employer's] conflict-of-interest policy").

Pretext
Because Defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for DeSilva's termination, the burden shifts to DeSilva to provide "specific, substantial evidence of pretext" in order to defeat summary judgment. See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., 150 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. 1998), as amended [*13]  (Aug. 11, 1998) (holding that where direct evidence of discrimination is unavailable, the plaintiff may come forward with "specific" and "substantial" circumstantial evidence to create a triable issue of fact regarding discrimination).
Here, DeSilva argues that Defendant's finding of a Conflict of Interest Policy violation is pretextual because (1) Defendant knew that DeSilva was working for Rodan for years, but the first time Defendant ever reached out to DeSilva to discuss it was on May 24, 2019, after she became disabled and needed an accommodation (Opp'n at 8, 18); and (2) Defendant failed to similarly investigate three other Allergan employees affiliated with Rodan & Fields (Opp'n at 18).
Plaintiff's first argument is essentially one of timing: because she was first told that she had to stop working for a competitor after reporting her disability, Allergan must have taken that action because of her disability. While adverse action taken on the heels of a disability notification can provide evidence of pretext, the timeline here does not permit such an inference. The undisputed evidence establishes that Elliston reported DeSilva's potential violation of Allergan's conflict of interest [*14]  policy in early February and that Carol Sweeney in Compliance was told on February 19, 2020 to investigate the issue by the following week if DeSilva did not self-report. (Sweeney Decl. ¶ 4, Doc. 36-7; Ex. A to Sweeney Decl., Doc. 36-8). All of this happened before DeSilva informed Elliston about her genetic test results and the need for leave on February 28, 2020. (Opp'n at 3). DeSilva points out that Compliance did not contact her for an interview until May 24, her first day back from her leave of absence, but Elliston had reported the violation and discussed it with DeSilva on February 14—again, before she shared her need for medical leave. Further, Defendant explains that Compliance was unable to interview DeSilva because she commenced her leave of absence shortly after Compliance initiated its investigation. (See RSUF ¶ 27). DeSilva does not genuinely dispute any of these facts; as to Defendant's explanation for why Compliance waited to interview her, DeSilva "disputes" this fact only by pointing to testimony where she states, "I do not know what the Compliance department did." (Id.) This is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact. The parties also dispute whether Cummings [*15]  and Sweeney knew about DeSilva's medical condition at the time of her termination (Opp'n at 15, Reply at 7), but even if they did later learn of her condition, it is undisputed that Compliance initiated its investigation into DeSilva's potential conflict before DeSilva had communicated her genetic test results and need for leave. In short, the timeline of the events does not provide "specific" and "substantial" evidence of pretext.
As to her second point, during her deposition, DeSilva identified three other Allergan sales representatives, Ms. Wilke, Ms. Rolla, and Mr. Dible, who allegedly all worked for Rodan but were not terminated by Allergan. (Opp'n at 19; Ex. A to Pearson Decl., DeSilva Tr. 266:13-268:14, Doc. 55-1). To make a showing of pretext based on the differential treatment of similarly situated employees ("comparators"), DeSilva must demonstrate that the employees are outside of DeSilva's protected group and "similarly situated . . . in all material respects." Moran v. Selig, 447 F.3d 748, 755 (9th Cir. 2006). Here, DeSilva has failed to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the comparators are "similarly situated." As described above, Compliance explicitly informed DeSilva that her work for Rodan violated Allergan's [*16]  Conflict of Interest Policy and gave her the option to continue working for Allergan if she stopped working for Rodan, but DeSilva was unwilling to do so. In contrast, when Compliance contacted Ms. Wilke to inform her that working for Rodan violated the company's conflict of interest policy, "[Ms. Wilke] immediately said she wanted to continue to work for Allergan and would promptly terminate her relationship with Rodan & Fields." (Ex. 12 to Curelaru Tr., Doc. 36-3). As to Ms. Rolla, during her interview with Compliance in April 2020 regarding her work for Rodan, she confirmed that she had already stopped working for Rodan years prior. (Ex. 14 to Curelaru Tr., Doc. 36-3). Finally, as to Mr. Dible, he was never a consultant for Rodan—his wife was. (Ex. 13 to Curelaru Tr., Doc. 36-3). Following an interview with Compliance, however, he nonetheless agreed to ask his wife to remove his name and photos from her Facebook page promoting her Rodan business, which Compliance later confirmed had been done.4 (Id.) The Court therefore finds that DeSilva has failed to show that Allergan has treated "similarly situated" employees differently than DeSilva.
Finally, all of DeSilva's arguments [*17]  as to pretext are strongly undercut by a single undisputed fact: DeSilva was given the option to keep her job at Allergan if she stopped working for Rodan, and she chose not to. Because the Court finds that Defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for DeSilva's termination and DeSilva has failed to demonstrate pretext, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED.

C. Failure to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation
DeSilva's fourth claim is for failure to reasonably accommodate a known medical condition. FEHA makes it unlawful for an employer to "fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(k)). The parties do not dispute that DeSilva suffered from a known medical condition, or that DeSilva's request for 11 weeks of leave from March 1, 2019 to May 20, 2019 was a reasonable accommodation. (Mem. at 16; Opp'n at 20). Rather, Defendant argues that Allergan in fact granted DeSilva the exact accommodation she requested, and her claim therefore fails as a matter of law. (Mem. at 16).
DeSilva argues that Defendant failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation for her medical condition because Defendant rejected [*18]  her accommodation request "on multiple occasions." (Opp'n at 16). Specifically, DeSilva explains that she requested an 11-week absence from March 1 to May 20, 2019 for her medical condition based on her doctor's recommendation. (DeSilva Decl. ¶¶ 15-17). Defendant's leave administrator, Matrix Absence Management, Inc. ("Matrix") conducted a review of her request and proposed that Defendant grant the request. (Pearson Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. H). According to Defendant's internal procedure, Matrix's proposal went to a Senior Benefits Manager (Bindia Onik), a Human Resources Partner (Sally Cummings), and a Business Leader (Kent Wheeler) to determine whether the accommodation will cause an "undue hardship." (Wheeler Tr. 32:16-23; Onik Tr. 66-67:17-12; Cummings Depo., 17:8-19). DeSilva contends that Mr. Wheeler and Ms. Cummings improperly conducted the undue hardship analysis based on their alleged knowledge of DeSilva's medical condition, and as a result, Defendant "rejected [her request] on multiple occasions." (Opp'n at 20).
However, the undisputed evidence establishes that (1) DeSilva requested an 11-week leave of absence for her medical condition from March 1 to May 20, 2019 (DeSilva Decl. ¶¶ [*19]  15-17); (2) DeSilva was absent from work from March 1 until she returned on May 24, 2019 (DeSilva Tr. 204:17-19); and (3) upon her return to work, Allergan restored her to the previous position she held prior to her absence (DeSilva Tr. 201:8-12). There is thus no triable issue of fact as to whether Defendant "rejected" her reasonable accommodation request in violation of FEHA; it is undisputed that she received the exact leave of absence she requested.
Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED. See Lattimore v. Euramax Int'l, Inc., No. EDCV 16-2156-PSG-KKX, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216115, 2017 WL 6886081, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2017), aff'd, 771 F. App'x 433 (9th Cir. 2019) (granting summary judgment on failure to accommodate claim "[b]ecause the record indicates that [the employer] granted [the employee's] medical leave, which was the only accommodation she requested, and that it was under no obligation provide any additional accommodations[.]")

D. Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process
When an employee makes a request for a reasonable accommodation, the employer must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "The interactive process requires: (1) direct communication [*20]  between the employer and employee to explore in good faith the possible accommodations; (2) consideration of the employee's request; and (3) offering an accommodation that is reasonable and effective." Zivkovic v. S. California Edison Co., 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002).
As explained above, it is undisputed that DeSilva received the exact accommodation she requested. Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED. Watkins v. Ameripride Servs., 375 F.3d 821, 829 n.5 (9th Cir. 2004) ("The fact that [the employer] reasonably accommodated [the employee's] disability forecloses his allegation that [the employer] failed to engage in the inter-active process."); Wilson v. Cty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1195, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009) (citing Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999) for the proposition that an "employer cannot be held liable for failing to engage in interactive process when the employee was in fact offered a reasonable accommodation[.]")

E. Retaliation under FEHA
"[T]o establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FEHA, a plaintiff must show (1) he or she engaged in a 'protected activity,' (2) the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer's action." Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal. 4th 1028, 1042, 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123, 1130 (2005). The McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis applies to claims of retaliation under FEHA. Id. DeSilva argues that Defendant retaliated [*21]  against her by rejecting her leave request, refusing to engage in the interactive process, and terminating her. (Opp'n at 23). However, for the reasons explained above, the undisputed evidence establishes that Defendant granted her leave request (and thus cannot be held liable for refusing to engage in the interactive process) and articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory/nonretaliatory reason for terminating her, which DeSilva has failed to show is pretextual. Accordingly, Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim is GRANTED.

F. Failure to Prevent Discrimination
DeSilva's seventh cause of action for failure to prevent discrimination also fails because DeSilva has not established her underlying claim of discrimination or retaliation. See Trujillo v. N. Cty. Transit Dist., 63 Cal. App. 4th 280, 289, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 596 (1998), as modified (May 12, 1998) ("'[T]here's no logic that says an employee who has not been discriminated against can sue an employer for not preventing discrimination that didn't happen, for not having a policy to prevent discrimination when no discrimination occurred[.]' Employers should not be held liable to employees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except where the actions took place and were not prevented.") [*22] 
Defendant's motion for summary judgment on this claim is therefore GRANTED.

G. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"A common law claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy requires a showing that there has been a violation of a fundamental public policy embodied in statute." Merrick v. Hilton Worldwide, Inc., 867 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2017). DeSilva acknowledges that this claim is based on her FEHA claims. (Opp'n at 25). Because the Court granted summary judgment on her FEHA claims, her final claim for wrongful termination likewise fails. See Merrick, 867 F.3d at 1150 (holding that the plaintiff's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was "derivative of his FEHA age discrimination claim, and so necessarily fail[s] along with that claim").

H. Conclusion as to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in its entirety.

IV. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
DeSilva has also moved for summary judgment on Defendant's counterclaims. Having granted summary judgment on DeSilva's claims, however, the Court indicated at the hearing on this matter that it would decline to exercise pendant jurisdiction over Defendant's remaining state-law claims, which amount [*23]  to $19,122.95 and are insufficient, standing alone, to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Defendant stated that it had no objection to the Court's dismissal of these counterclaims were the Court to grant Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims. Accordingly, Defendant's counterclaims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to refiling in state court, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DENIED AS MOOT.

V. CONCLUSION
For the above reasons, the Court (1) GRANTS Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and (2) DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant's counterclaims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to refiling in state court. Defendant is further ORDERED to submit to the Court, no later than five (5) days from the date of this Order, a proposed judgment pursuant to the Court's Procedures.

JUDGMENT
The Court, having granted the motion for summary judgment of defendant Allergan USA, Inc. ("Defendant") in its entirety, and having denied as moot the motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiff Jennifer DeSilva ("Plaintiff"), by Order of the Court entered on January 4, 2021 (Doc. 66), the Court hereby [*24]  ORDERS that the Clerk of Court shall (1) enter judgment in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff and shall dismiss Plaintiff's action with prejudice; and (2) dismiss Defendant's counterclaims without prejudice to refiling in state court. Defendant may apply to the Clerk of Court for its costs incurred in this action pursuant to Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rules 54-2 and 54-3.
