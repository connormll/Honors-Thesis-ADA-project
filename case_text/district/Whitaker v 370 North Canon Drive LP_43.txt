ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 27], DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Dkt. 32], AND DISMISSING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PLAINTIFF'S STATE LAW CLAIM

I. INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff Brian Whitaker brings this action under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ("Unruh Act") against Defendants 370 North Canon Drive, LP, Tashman Management LLC, ALO LLC, and unnamed Does. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint, hereinafter "Compl."].) Before the Court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. 27-1 [Memorandum [*2]  in Support of Defendants' Motion, hereinafter "D. Mot."]; Dkt. 32-1 [Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motion, hereinafter "P. Mot."].) For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion is DENIED, and Defendants' motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's ADA claim. Because the Court resolves Plaintiff's sole federal claim in favor of Defendants, it will not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim. Accordingly, this claim is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to allow Plaintiff to assert it in state court.1

II. BACKGROUND
Plaintiff has a spinal cord injury and uses a wheelchair for mobility. (Dkt. 32-2 [Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts] ¶ 1.) Defendants own and operate ALO, a store in Beverly Hills, California ("the Store"). (Id. ¶¶ 2-4.) Plaintiff declares that he visited the Store on March 19, 2019 to go shopping. (Dkt. 32-4 [Declaration of Brian Whitaker] ¶ 3.) When he went to pay for his merchandise, Plaintiff claims that he could not find a wheelchair-accessible sales counter. (Id. ¶¶ 5-7.) He did not see a lowered counter anywhere in the Store (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff explains that this issue caused difficulty, discomfort, and frustration. (Id. ¶ 7.)
On April [*3]  16, 2019, Plaintiff filed this action, asserting one claim for injunctive relief under the ADA and one claim for actual and statutory damages under the Unruh Act. (Compl.) In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the Store does not provide an accessible sales counter in violation of the ADA and Unruh Act. (Id. ¶¶ 12-14.) He asserts that this Court has federal question jurisdiction over his ADA claim, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over his Unruh Act claim, 28 U.S.C. § 1367. (Id. ¶¶ 7-9.) Defendants argue that there has always been a lowered sales counter from when the store first opened. (D. Mot. at 2-3.) Since Plaintiff initiated this action, Defendants modified the lowered transaction counter to permanently set up check out equipment. (Dkt. 36 [Defendants' Opposition to P. Mot.] at 3.)

III. LEGAL STANDARD
The Court may grant summary judgment on "each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). The [*4]  party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. A factual issue is "genuine" when there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant's favor. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" when its resolution might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law and is determined by looking to the substantive law. Id.
Where the nonmovant will have the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the moving party may discharge its burden of production by either (1) negating an essential element of the opposing party's claim or defense, Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-60, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970), or (2) showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 325. Once this burden is met, the party resisting the motion must set forth, by affidavit, or as otherwise provided under Rule 56, "specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. A party opposing summary judgment must support its assertion that a material fact is genuinely disputed by (i) citing to materials in the record, (ii) showing the moving party's materials are inadequate to establish an absence of genuine dispute, or (iii) showing that the [*5]  moving party lacks admissible evidence to support its factual position. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A)—(B).

IV. ANALYSIS
The Court first analyzes whether summary judgment should be granted on Plaintiff's ADA claim. The Court then analyzes supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim.

A. ADA Claim
Congress enacted the ADA to ensure that businesses do not discriminate against the disabled either through "invidious animus" or through "thoughtlessness and indifference" and "benign neglect." Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 944-45 (9th Cir. 2011). Accordingly, the ADA proscribes not only "obviously exclusionary conduct—such as a sign stating that persons with disabilities are unwelcome or an obstacle course leading to a store's entrance"—but also "subtle forms of discrimination—such as difficult-to-navigate restrooms and hard-to-open doors—that interfere with disabled individuals' 'full and equal enjoyment' of places of public accommodation." Id. at 945.
More specifically, the ADA prohibits discrimination "on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities . . . or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns . . . or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). "Discrimination" under the [*6]  ADA includes "a failure to remove architectural barriers . . . where such removal is readily available." Id. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). The ADA Accessibility Guidelines ("ADAAG") adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice set out the minimum requirements for compliance with the ADA's prohibition on architectural barriers. See Fortyune v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 364 F.3d 1075, 1080-81 (9th Cir. 2004); 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design § 101.1 (2010 ed.).
To prevail on an ADA claim alleging discrimination for failure to remove architectural barriers, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is disabled, (2) the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation, and (3) the plaintiff was denied public accommodations because of his disability and by the defendant's failure to remove architectural barriers. Molski v. M.J. Cable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 730 (9th Cir. 2007). In this case, Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff is disabled or that Defendants own, lease, and operate a place of public accommodation. Instead, the issue is whether Plaintiff has identified actionable barriers and, if so, whether he has standing to challenge them.
1. The Sales Counter
Plaintiff contends that the Store's sales counter violates the ADA because it measures forty-two inches high. (See P. Mot. at 8.) The ADAAG require that a store [*7]  provide "[a] portion of the [sales] counter surface that is 36 inches (915 mm) long minimum and 36 inches (915 mm) high maximum above the finish floor." ADAAG § 904.4. However, the Store's IT Operations Manager testified that the sales counter has always had an accessible sales counter since the store opened. (Dkt. 27-6 [Declaration of Nicholas Jaquay, hereinafter "Jaquay Decl."] ¶ 3.) The lowered portion of the sales counter measures thirty-three inches high (Dkt. 27-4 [Declaration of Taryn Pietsch, hereinafter "Pietsch Decl."] ¶ 5.), well within the ADAAG standards. Indeed, the lowered portion of the sales counter is visible in several photographs taken by Plaintiff's investigator. (See Dkt. 32-8.)
Alternatively, Plaintiff argues that the lowered counter was hardly visible and had merchandise on it. (Dkt. 39 [Plaintiff's Reply Brief, hereinafter "P. Rep."] at 2-3.) Defendant concedes that employees occasionally use the ADA-compliant sales counter to fold clothing. (Pietsch Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) However, as this Court, the Ninth Circuit, and other district courts have repeatedly held, placing merchandise on an otherwise ADA-compliant sales counter does not make the counter noncompliant because the [*8]  ADAAG does not require a specific amount of clear counter space. See Whitaker v. Starbucks Corp., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108356, at *9 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 2020); Kong v. Mana Inv. Co., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119755, 2019 WL 3220027 (C.D. Cal. May 1, 2019) ("Nothing in the plain language of § 904.4.1 or its exception suggests that any particular amount of 'clear' space on the surface of a sales or service [counter] is required."), aff'd 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 19078, 2020 WL 3265179 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020); Whitaker v. ELC Beauty LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166184, 2019 WL 4690202, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 25, 2019) (finding that "the lack of clear space or the placement of merchandise on transaction counters violates neither the 2010 Standards nor the ADA"). As this Court explained in Whitaker v. Starbucks Corp., both the plain language of the ADAAG and the Department of Justice's interpretation of the relevant regulations compel this conclusion. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108356, at *5-9.
Nor does 28 C.F.R. § 36.211(a)—which requires businesses to maintain accessible features "in operable working condition"—change the analysis. "It is axiomatic that defendant's obligation to 'maintain' the accessibility of its facilities does not impose greater obligations than those obligations imposed by the ADAAG in the first instance." Johnson v. Starbucks Corp., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54676, 2019 WL 1427435, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2019), aff'd 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 19066, 2020 WL 3265063, at *3 (9th Cir. June 17, 2020). Because the ADAAG does not require a specific amount of clear counter space, Defendants' obligation to maintain their facilities in operable working condition does not create such a requirement. See Whitaker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108356, at *9.
Accordingly, the Court concludes Plaintiff has not established a violation of the [*9]  ADA based on the sales counter's height. To the extent Plaintiff's ADA claim challenges the amount of clear counter space at the accessible sales counter, it fails as a matter of law.
2. Plaintiff Lacks Standing to Pursue His Remaining ADA Theories
Plaintiff argues that even if Defendants' sales counter was not an improper height, the counter violated the ADA for other reasons, including because it did not have check-out equipment on it. (P. Rep. at 3.) Defendants argue that, to the extent the lack of check-out equipment at the accessible counter created a barrier, it has been cured and therefore Plaintiff lacks standing to assert an ADA claim. The Court agrees.
The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing under Article III of the Constitution. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992). To satisfy Article III's standing requirement, "a plaintiff must show (1) that [he] has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision." Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S. Ct. 693, 145 L. Ed. 2d 610 (2000). Standing must be shown to support [*10]  each form of relief requested. See id. at 185. At the summary judgment stage, a party invoking jurisdiction cannot rest on "mere allegations" but must "set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts" that establish standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.
Plaintiff cannot satisfy the third element of standing—a likelihood that his injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Injunctive relief is the only remedy available in private actions for violations of Title III of the ADA. See Wander v. Kaus, 304 F.3d 856, 858 (9th Cir. 2002) ("Damages are not recoverable under Title III of the ADA—only injunctive relief is available for violations of Title III."). To establish redressability in an action for injunctive relief, a plaintiff "must establish a real and immediate threat of repeated injury." Chapman, 631 F.3d at 948 (quotation omitted). Plaintiff fails to establish such a threat.
Even assuming Defendants' lack of check out equipment created a barrier, it has since been cured. Defendants have made permanent modifications to the accessible counter to support check out equipment and have installed an iPad and credit card reader. (See Jaquay Decl. ¶ 5; Pietsch Decl. ¶ 4; Dkt. 27-5 [Declaration of Phuc Nguyen].) Plaintiff therefore cannot show "a real and immediate threat of repeated [*11]  injury" based on the lack of checkout equipment. See Chapman, 631 F.3d at 948. Accordingly, he lacks standing to pursue this claim, and the Court cannot adjudicate it. See id.; Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. Accordingly, Defendants' motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff's motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's ADA claim.

B. Supplemental Jurisdiction Over Plaintiff's Unruh Act Claim
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c), a district court has discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it "has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction." "In order to decide whether to exercise jurisdiction over pendent state law claims, a district court should consider . . . the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity." Nishimoto v. Federman-Bachrach & Assocs., 903 F.2d 709, 715 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation omitted). "[I]n the usual case in which all federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine . . . will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims." Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7, 108 S. Ct. 614, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1988).
This is one such "usual case." See id. The Court has resolved Plaintiff's sole federal claim. His remaining state law claim involves a unique feature of California law. Unlike the ADA, the Unruh Act permits both injunctive relief and monetary [*12]  damages. A plaintiff may recover actual damages for each offense "up to a maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four thousand dollars." Cal. Civ. Code § 52(a). Although the substantive protections of the Unruh Act mirror the ADA, damages must be assessed according to California law. See id. §§ 51(f), 52(a). Considerations of comity suggest that a California court is better situated to assess what damages, if any, should be awarded to Plaintiff. See Nishimoto, 903 F.2d at 715.
The remaining factors—judicial economy, convenience, and fairness—do not change the Court's assessment. See id. California courts impose various procedural requirements on construction-related accessibility actions. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 425.50; Schutza v. Cuddeback, 262 F. Supp. 3d 1025, 1031 (S.D. Cal. 2017). Accordingly, Plaintiff would prefer to litigate in federal court, and Defendants prefer state court. Having dismissed Plaintiff's sole federal claim, it does not seem unfair to require Plaintiff to litigate his state law claim in state court. See Nishimoto, 903 F.2d at 715. Although the parties have apparently engaged in some discovery, this is not a complicated case. Any concerns about judicial economy and convenience are modest. If Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim must go to trial, it may well be faster for the parties to proceed in state court, [*13]  especially since state courts are holding jury trials during the current pandemic.
For the reasons set out above, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim. Accordingly, this claim is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to allow Plaintiff to assert it in state court. Plaintiff and Defendants' motions for summary judgment on this claim are therefore DENIED AS MOOT.

V. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, as to Plaintiff's ADA claim, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is DENIED, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. Both parties' motions for summary judgment are DENIED AS MOOT with respect to Plaintiff's Unruh Act claim. This claim is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to allow Plaintiff to assert it in state court.
