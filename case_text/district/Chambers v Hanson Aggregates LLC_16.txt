ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [23]; DENYING DEFENDANT'S EX PARTE APPLICATION [42]
Pending before the Court is Defendant Hanson Aggregates LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, for Partial Summary Judgment against Plaintiff William Kenneth Chambers. (Dkt. No. 23.) Defendant brings its Motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56 for judgment as a matter of law in the absence of genuine disputes as to the material facts underlying Plaintiff's Complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Plaintiff timely filed an Opposition, and Defendant timely filed its Reply. (Dkt. Nos. 27, 35.) The Court heard oral argument on April 4, 2016 and took the matter under submission. (Dkt. No. 37.) For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion.1

I. BACKGROUND
Neither Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts, (Dkt. No. 23-5), nor Plaintiff's responding Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts, (Dkt. Nos. 28-29), are particularly helpful to the Court in determining the undisputed facts in this case. Both documents are replete with argumentative statements, [*3]  compound conclusions couched in fact, and incomplete or inaccurate evidentiary citations, all of which fail to clearly outline what facts in this case are genuinely in dispute. In examining the parties' papers, however, the Court has determined that—at the very least—the following facts are undisputed.
Plaintiff worked as an electrician at Defendant's Irwindale rock plant from 1977 until May 21, 2014. (Dkt. No. 1-1, Compl. ¶¶ 15, 24, 44; Dkt. No. 23-1, Mot. at 2, 7, 15-16.) In July 2011, Michael Rogers ("Rogers") became Operations Manager for the Irwindale plant, and in spring 2012 Michael Hanna ("Hanna") became the Plant Manager, reporting directly to Rogers. (Mot. at 3; Dkt. No. 27, Opp'n at 2; Dkt. Nos. 28-29, Pl.'s Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Facts Parts I and II ("SGD")2 Nos. 1-2.) In November 2012, Rogers and Hanna instituted a policy requiring Plaintiff and his subordinate, Michael Burton ("Burton"), to submit daily timesheets (also known as worksheets) truthfully describing the work they had performed during each day. (Mot. at 3; Opp'n at 4; see also SGD Nos. 39-40.) Plaintiff and Burton received exemplars showing how to fill out the timesheets, including showing [*4]  how to note when a project was completed. (SGD No. 41.) In September 2013, both Plaintiff and Burton were given verbal warnings for failing to turn in timesheets on time and failing to include sufficient information on the forms. (SGD No. 42.)3 And, between October and November 2013, Rogers notified Plaintiff several times about failing to complete and turn in timesheets and ultimately issued a written warning to Plaintiff for that failure. (SGD No. 43.)4
A few months later, on January 23, 2014, Plaintiff underwent surgery for an umbilical hernia, and between January 23, 2014 and March 24, 2014 Plaintiff was placed on medical leave.5 (See SGD No. 55; see also Mot. at 4; Opp'n at 5-7.) Plaintiff's doctor restricted Plaintiff to lifting no more than ten to fifteen pounds for eight weeks after the surgery and released Plaintiff for unrestricted work on March 24, 2014. (Id.) Plaintiff proposed to Hanna that, rather than taking leave for the full period, he could continue to work with the restrictions ordered by the doctor. (Chambers Depo. at 208:1-212:9; see also Dkt. No. 35-1, Def.'s Reply Statement in Opp'n to Pl.'s Add'l Facts ("Def.'s Reply Statement") Nos. 116-17.) Hanna rejected this [*5]  request, however, and told Plaintiff that company policy did not provide for any limited or restricted duty for Plaintiff and that Plaintiff could return from leave once he had no medical restrictions. (Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 117-18, 121.)6
During Plaintiff's medical leave, the power went out at a plant on the Irwindale property when a backhoe hit a live wire during excavations. (SGD Nos. 10-12; Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 128-34; Mot. at 4; Opp'n at 6-7.) After learning of the outage and subsequent restoration of power, Plaintiff called Burton to ask about the cause of the incident. (Id.) Burton explained the cause of the accident to Plaintiff and reported to Plaintiff that he had de-energized the wires that had been hit, but based on Burton's description of the situation, Plaintiff believed that Burton had made a mistake and that the wires were not de-energized. (Id.) Plaintiff immediately drove to the site to check on the wires and discovered that the wires had not been de-energized properly. (Id.) Plaintiff then corrected the issue and notified Hanna of the results. (Id.) Plaintiff further advised Hanna that Burton's failure to de-energize the wires properly was a fireable [*6]  offense. (Id.) Hanna thanked Plaintiff for his help in correcting the situation. (Id.) Burton was informally counseled concerning his mistake but received no formal discipline in connection with the incident. (See SGD No. 13; Dkt. No. 31, Pl.'s App'x of Evid. Pt. II ISO Opp'n, Ex. 2 ("Burton Depo.") at 92:19-93:4.)
Plaintiff returned to work full-time on March 24, 2014. (See SGD No. 55; see also Mot. at 4; Opp'n at 5-7.) A few months later, on May 12, 2014, Plaintiff reported on a timesheet that he had spent two hours between 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. weeding around the "P-8 transformer" on Defendant's property. (SGD No. 18.) And the next day another employee, Theodore Koerner ("Koerner"), reported to Hanna that around 7:00 a.m. he had observed Plaintiff smoking a cigarette in his truck, parked in front of the P-8 transformer, and that Plaintiff remained there for approximately forty-five minutes. (Def.'s Not. of Lodging ISO Mot., Ex. 5 ("Koerner Depo.") at 69:22-73:17; see also SGD No. 19.)7 Koerner further reported to Hanna that a different worker was usually responsible for weeding at the P-8 transformer. (Koerner Depo. at 84:8-12.) A few days later, on May 15, 2014, Rogers confronted [*7]  Plaintiff about his entry on the time sheet. (SGD No. 25; Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 166-70.) Rogers asked Plaintiff whether the entry was true, and Plaintiff responded that he had made a mistake and that he had actually weeded the area around a different transformer—the "Mays Landing transformer"—which is approximately two-to three-hundred yards away from the P-8 transformer. (Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 166, 170; SGD No. 25.)8 Rogers visited the Mays Landing transformer to investigate Plaintiff's explanation the next day and met with Plaintiff and Hanna at the site a few days later on May 19. (See SGD Nos. 27-29; Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 182-84.) Rogers and Hanna inspected the site with Plaintiff but did not check the dumpster where Plaintiff told him the dead weeds had been thrown.9 (Id.) Two days later, on May 21, 2014, Rogers informed Plaintiff that he was being terminated, and Plaintiff subsequently received a letter dated May 22, 2014 informing him that he was being terminated for falsifying information on the May 12, 2014 timesheet. (Def.'s Reply Statement Nos. 204-05; Opp'n at 8; Mot. at 7; Chambers Depo., Ex. 32.)
Plaintiff was 58 years old at the time he was [*8]  fired. (See Compl. ¶¶ 15, 24, 44; Mot. at 15.) Plaintiff did not seek any treatment for emotional distress from any healthcare provider in connection with his firing. (SGD No. 59.) After a month and a half of unemployment, in July 2014, Plaintiff obtained a new job as an electrician with one of Defendant's competitors. (SGD No. 58.) That same month, on July 31, 2014, Plaintiff filed a complaint of discrimination with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing ("DFEH") alleging that his termination was due to age discrimination. (Def.'s Reply Statement No. 210; Chambers Depo., Ex. 36.) Nine months later, Plaintiff's attorney Charles T. Mathews filed another complaint with DFEH on April 21, 2015. (Id.) This April 2015 complaint lists Mr. Mathews, rather than Plaintiff, as the complainant, but includes reference to the same facts listed in July 2014 complaint. (Def.'s Reply Statement No. 210; Chambers Depo., Ex. 37.) Specifically, this April 2015 complaint alleges that Hanson Aggregates harassed, discriminated, and retaliated against "complainant" because of a disability and attaches the same addendum of facts as the July 2014 complaint submitted under Plaintiff's name. (Id.)
Plaintiff [*9]  filed the present lawsuit in state court on April 23, 2015, and Defendant removed the action to this Court on June 11, 2015. (Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiff brings a total of eight10 claims against Defendant for his termination under three basic headings: retaliation, age discrimination, and disability discrimination. Plaintiff's first claim, retaliation in violation of California Labor Code section 6310 ("Section 6310"), alleges that Defendant unlawfully retaliated against Plaintiff and ultimately discharged him for reporting Burton's failure to de-energize the wires during the backhoe incident.11 (Compl. ¶¶ 21-23.) Plaintiff's third claim, age discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), codified in Government Code section 12940 ("Section 12940"), alleges that Defendant terminated Plaintiff due to his age, as evidenced by Defendant's emphasis on Plaintiff's upcoming retirement and Defendant's pattern of terminating other older employees based on a variety of pretexts. (Compl. ¶¶ 43-50; Opp'n at 12.) Finally, Plaintiff's fourth through sixth claims allege that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff for his umbilical hernia disability in violation of the FEHA by failing to failing to engage in the interactive process to accommodate that [*10]  disability (Claim 6), failing to provide reasonable accommodations for that disability (Claim 5), and ultimately terminating Plaintiff for that disability (Claim 4). (Compl. ¶¶ 51-78.) Plaintiff's remaining claims for failure to prevent discrimination in violation of the FEHA (Claim 7), wrongful termination (Claim 8), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Claim 9) are based on all three of Plaintiff's theories of wrongful conduct. (Opp'n at 22-24; see also Compl. ¶¶ 79-99.)

II. LEGAL STANDARD

a. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits show that there is "no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). In assessing evidence at the summary judgment stage, "the judge does not weigh conflicting evidence with respect to a disputed material fact. Nor does the judge make credibility determinations with respect to statements made in affidavits, answers to interrogatories, admissions, or depositions." T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987). The Court must view the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and the moving party [*11]  bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 251-52, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Once the moving party has met its initial burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to show a genuine issue for trial by establishing that the fact in contention is material (i.e. affecting the outcome of the suit under the governing law) and the dispute is genuine (i.e. the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party). Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 251-52; Owens v. Local No. 169, Ass'n of W. Pulp & Paper Workers, 971 F.2d 347, 355 (9th Cir. 1987).

b. Burden Shifting Framework
Plaintiff's first and third through seventh claims fall under the burden-shifting mechanism originally outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) ("McDonnell Douglas") and adopted by California courts. See McInteer v. Ashley Distribution Servs., Ltd., 40 F. Supp. 3d 1269, 1280 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (age and disability discrimination); Cuevas v. SkyWest Airlines, 17 F. Supp. 3d 956, 963 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff'd 644 Fed. Appx. 791 (9th Cir. 2016) (section 6310 retaliation). For each claim, Plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1284; see also Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 963. Once the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, "the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate non-discriminatory [or non-retaliatory] reason" for the employer's adverse action against the employee. McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1284; see also Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 963. The defendant "must make a sufficient showing of a legitimate reason for discharge," but this burden "is one of production, not persuasion, [*12]  thereby involving no credibility assessment." McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1284 (quotations omitted); see also Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 963. Once the defendant has shown a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for the adverse action, the plaintiff must then offer "'substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory [or nonretaliatory] reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1285 (quoting Wills v. Superior Court, 195 Cal. App. 4th 143, 160, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1 (2011)) (other quotations and citations omitted); see also Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 963.

III. DISCUSSION

a. Section 6310 Retaliation Claim
The Court turns first to Plaintiff's retaliation claim under Section 6310. To establish a prima facie case for violation of Section 6310, Plaintiff must show "(1) that the plaintiff engaged in a 'protected activity'; (2) the defendant subjected the plaintiff to an 'adverse employment action'; and (3) a causal link between the two—that the defendant took action because of the plaintiff's protected activity." Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 964. Once that burden is met, it becomes Defendant's burden to "demonstrate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action." Id. at 965. Finally, if Defendant [*13]  makes this showing, the presumption of retaliation created by Plaintiff's prima facie case drops away and the burden shifts back to Plaintiff to demonstrate that Defendant "acted in retaliation, despite its proffered motivations." Id.
Here, the parties focus primarily on whether Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation. (See Mot. at 8-9; Opp'n at 21-22; Dkt. No. 35, Reply at 3-5.) But the Court need not examine this question because, even if Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence of pretext to show Defendant's termination of Plaintiff was driven by an intent to retaliate for Plaintiff's report of Burton's mistake in de-energizing the wires. Once Defendant articulates a legitimate reason for Plaintiff's firing, as Defendant has done here with evidence from Hanna and Rogers concerning Plaintiff's alleged falsification of the May timesheet, "the question becomes whether the plaintiff has shown, or can show, that the challenged action resulted in fact from [retaliatory] animus rather than other causes." Doubt v. NCR Corp., No. C 09-5917, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109533, 2014 WL 3897590, *8 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2014) (quoting Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 121 Cal. App. 4th 95, 112, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 717 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004)).
Plaintiff argues that he has shown Defendant's proffered reason for his firing was pretextual [*14]  because Burton was not formally disciplined for his failure to safely de-energize the wires and Burton ultimately replaced Plaintiff in his job. (Opp'n at 21-22.) But both of these reasons at most pertain to Plaintiff's theory of age discrimination, which is that Defendant wanted to replace Plaintiff with Burton because Burton was a younger employee. (See Opp'n at 22 ("It is evident that Defendant was disgruntled with [Plaintiff's] complaint about Burton, as it put the plan to have Burton replace Chambers at risk.").) Plaintiff presents no evidence, and the Court finds none in the record, to demonstrate that Defendant's proffered reason for firing Plaintiff was pretext for retaliation against Plaintiff because Plaintiff reported a safety concern. As addressed below, Plaintiff's evidence concerning such pretext may create a triable issue of fact as it concerns his claim for age discrimination, but Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence showing that Defendant had any intention of retaliating against Plaintiff specifically for his report of a safety violation. See, e.g., Cuevas, 17 F. Supp. 3d at 967 (granting summary judgment based on the plaintiff's failure to prove pretext where there was no "firm indication [*15]  that Cuevas was being punished for complaining about safety issues."); Arteaga v. Brink's, Inc., 163 Cal. App. 4th 327, 353, 77 Cal. Rptr. 3d 654 (2008) ("[T]emporal proximity alone is not sufficient to raise a triable issue as to pretext once the employer has offered evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination."); see also Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 360-61, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) ("Moreover, an inference of intentional discrimination cannot be drawn solely from evidence, if any, that the company lied about its reasons. The pertinent statutes do not prohibit lying, they prohibit discrimination. Proof that the employer's proffered reasons are unworthy of credence may 'considerably assist' a circumstantial case of discrimination, because it suggests the employer had cause to hide its true reasons. Still, there must be evidence supporting a rational inference that intentional discrimination, on grounds prohibited by the statute, was the true cause of the employer's actions."). Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's first claim for relief.

b. Disability Claims

i. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
Turning next to Plaintiff's disability claims, as a threshold matter, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust his [*16]  administrative remedies. Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff's April 2015 DFEH complaint lists Plaintiff's attorney rather than Plaintiff as the named complainant and under general case law concerning the filing of state civil complaints, Plaintiff's April 2015 DFEH complaint cannot "relate back." (Mot. at 12-13 (citing Diliberti v. Stage Call Corp., 4 Cal. App. 4th 1468, 1470, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 563 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (discussing application California procedure to substitution of plaintiff in civil case)).) But, as Plaintiff correctly points out, the administrative exhaustion requirement for FEHA claims is not the same the rule concerning allegations in a civil complaint. Rather, the requirement is analogous to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission law and is satisfied "if the allegations of the civil action are within the scope of the [DFEH] charge, any [DFEH] investigation actually completed, or any investigation that might reasonably have been expected to grow out of the charge." Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal. App. 4th 243, 266, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 296 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009). Thus, "what is submitted to the DFEH must not only be construed liberally in favor of plaintiff, it must be construed in light of what might be uncovered by a reasonable investigation" by the DFEH. Id. at 268. Though Plaintiff's April 2015 DFEH erroneously named his attorney [*17]  as the complainant, Defendant has failed to present any argument or authority to suggest that a reasonable DFEH investigation into the April 2015 would not have uncovered that Plaintiff was the correct complainant. Indeed, a simple phone call to Mr. Mathews would have revealed the typo, as would have a comparison of the July 2014 and April 2015 complaints, which both name Hanson Aggregates LLC as the Defendant and contain identical factual allegations. Consequently, the court cannot conclude as a matter of law that Plaintiff's complaint falls outside of "any investigation that might reasonably have been expected to grow out of the charge" brought in the April 2015 DFEH complaint.

ii. Disability Discrimination
Turning next to the merits of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim, however, Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination fails for the same reason as does his Section 6310 claim. To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Plaintiff must show "(1) he suffered from a disability, (2) he could perform the essential duties of his job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (Cal. Ct. App. 2010). Once Defendant [*18]  has raised a legitimate reason for the termination in response, however, as discussed above, Plaintiff "must offer substantial evidence that the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action was untrue or pretextual, or evidence the employer acted with a discriminatory animus, or a combination of the two, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the employer engaged in intentional discrimination.'" McInteer, 40 F. Supp. 3d at 1285.
Even assuming that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination for his umbilical hernia disability, as with his Section 6310 claim, Plaintiff improperly blurs the distinction between his age and disability discrimination claims. (See Opp'n at 21 (arguing that his firing was pretext "for Defendant's unlawful plan to rid the Irwindale plant of older and disabled employees").) Plaintiff's evidence in support of his discrimination claim consists solely of declarations from two other employees, Ralph Lusa and Leonard Reyes, who attest both that they were fired and replaced with younger workers and that they believe that their firing was due in part to their reported disabilities. (See Dkt. No. 30, Pl.'s App'x of Evid. Pt. I ISO Opp'n at 101-07, Lusa Decl. [*19]  ¶ 23; id. at 108-12, Reyes Decl. ¶¶ 10, 19.) But the only evidence in these declarations of pretextual firing relates to Plaintiff's claim for age discrimination. As with Plaintiff's own declaration, neither Mr. Lusa nor Mr. Reyes articulates any facts to show they were fired for their reported disabilities. To the contrary, each of these men appear to suggest that their disabilities were ignored or belittled specifically due to Defendant's bias against older employees, and none of them cite to specific facts showing Defendant's motivation to terminate them based on disability. (See, e.g., Reyes Decl. ¶ 17.) As a result, Plaintiff's disability claim fails because Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to show that his firing was a pretext specifically for Defendant's disability discrimination. See Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 360-61. The Court GRANTS summary judgment in Defendant's favor on Plaintiff's claim for disability discrimination.

iii. Failure To Accommodate and Failure To Engage In The Interactive Process
Summary judgment is not appropriate on Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate and for failure to engage in the interactive process, however. Under California Government Code section 12940(m), employers must make reasonable accommodations [*20]  for employees' "known physical or mental disabilit[ies]." A "reasonable accommodation" under this section means "a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 974, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008); see also Cal. Gov. Code § 12926(p) (providing examples of reasonable accommodations). "When an employee needs time away from the job for treatment or recovery, allowing the employee to take leave or extending leave may be a reasonable accommodation if 'the leave is likely to be effective in allowing the employee to return to work at the end of the leave, with or without further reasonable accommodation, and does not create an undue hardship for the employer.'" DelGiacco v. Cox Commc'ns, Inc., Case No. CV 14-0200-DOC (DFMx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44833, 2015 WL 1535260, **13-14 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 6, 2015) (quoting Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 11068(c)). "However, if 'an employee can work with a reasonable accommodation other than a leave of absence, an employer may not require that the employee take a leave of absence.'" Id.
Additionally, under California Government Code section 12940(n), employers must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee . . . to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation by an employee . . . with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(n). "Each [*21]  party must participate in good faith, undertake reasonable efforts to communicate its concerns, and make available to the other information which is available, or more accessible, to one party," and generally, "[l]iability hinges on the objective circumstances surrounding the parties' breakdown in communication, and responsibility for the breakdown lies with the party who fails to participate in good faith." DelGiacco, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44833, 2015 WL 1535260, at **13-14 (citing Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 (2006)).
Here, Defendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff requested and was given a two-month leave of absence and only afterwards sought modification of that accommodation with light duty, thus showing that Defendant properly gave Plaintiff the accommodation he requested. (Mot. at 20-21 (citing SUF No. 55); Reply at 17-18 (citing SUF Nos. 55-56).) The evidence that Defendant cites in support of this point does not establish this timetable, however. Rather, Plaintiff testifies in the portion of the deposition cited only that he was out on medical leave between January 23, 2014 and March 24, 2014 and that he was dissatisfied with Defendant's handling of the leave because he told Hanna that he would prefer limited or restricted duty rather than full leave. [*22]  (See Chambers Depo. at 208:1-210:22, 211:24-214:14.) Chambers's testimony does not establish that he first requested full medical leave or that Defendant engaged in any good faith discussion with him concerning whether he could go on light or restricted duty rather than continuing on medical leave. Accordingly, triable issues of fact preclude summary judgment on Plaintiff's accommodation and engagement claims. Defendant's Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff's fifth and sixth claims.

c. Age Discrimination
Defendant also is not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's age discrimination claim. FEHA makes it "an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to hire or employ, or to discharge, dismiss, reduce, suspend, or demote, any individual over the age of 40 on the ground of age." Cal. Gov. Code, § 12941, subd. (a). "To prevail on summary judgment [on a FEHA claim], [a defendant is] required to show either that (1) plaintiff could not establish one of the elements of [a] FEHA claim, or (2) there was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate [the] plaintiff's employment."12 Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008), as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug. 28, 2008). If the employer establishes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason [*23]  for the termination, any presumption of discrimination disappears, and the plaintiff "must then have the opportunity to attack the employer's proffered reasons as pretexts for discrimination, or to offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 356.
Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff has failed to plead a prima facie case of discrimination and that Defendant terminated Plaintiff for falsifying his May timesheet, which Plaintiff has failed to show was a pretextual explanation rather than a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reason.

i. Whether Defendant Has Demonstrated That Plaintiff Cannot Establish An Element Of His FEHA Claim.
Having considered the evidence and arguments, Defendant has not demonstrated that Plaintiff cannot establish his age discrimination claim. To prevail, Plaintiff must show that "(1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position he sought or was performing competently in the position he held, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, demotion, or denial of an available job, and (4) some other circumstance suggests discriminatory motive." Guz, 24 Cal. 4th at 355. The [*24]  first and third elements are not at issue as Plaintiff was 58 years old at the time of his firing and as termination is an adverse employment action. Thus, the only elements remaining at issue are the second and fourth elements regarding whether Plaintiff competently performing his job duties and whether the circumstances suggest a discriminatory motive are at issue, respectively.
Here, Defendant's attack on Plaintiff's age discrimination claim consists entirely of statistical information regarding the age of its workforce at the time of Plaintiff's termination. Specifically, Defendant offers that "35-38% of the Irwindale workforce . . . were over 50, and 71-73% were over 40 in 2014-2015." (Mot. at 16 (emphasis omitted).) This evidence alone is insufficient to warrant summary judgment because Defendant's data is so non-specific that it is nonprobative of whether it is more likely or not that Plaintiff was discriminated against because of his age. See Schechner v. KPIX-TV, 686 F.3d 1018, 1025 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that the strength of statistical evidence determines its sufficiency). For example, while Defendant narrows the data to the "Irwindale workforce," Defendant provides no information regarding age distribution by occupation or job [*25]  title. Additionally, it is unclear whether Rogers and Hanna enjoyed the power to terminate all members of the Irwindale workforce captured in Defendant's data. Because only Rogers and Hanna's animus is at issue, any data regarding termination and retention effected by other superiors is irrelevant to Plaintiff's cause of action. Accordingly, Defendant's argument is not persuasive to the extent that it relies on this data.
Defendant advances just two additional arguments in support of its attack on Plaintiff's prima facie case: first, that everyone who participated in the investigation and termination of Plaintiff is either close to Plaintiff's age or at least over 40 years old and, second, that Rogers might have terminated Plaintiff six months prior for refusing to complete timesheets but declined to do so. These arguments fail on their face. There is no legal basis for the proposition that older individuals are less capable or less likely to commit age discrimination than younger ones. Additionally, Rogers's decision to issue a written warning to Plaintiff for failure to complete his timesheets falls far short of the evidence required for summary judgment. Accordingly, Defendant has [*26]  not demonstrated that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the elements of an age discrimination claim.13

ii. Whether Plaintiff Has Raised Triable Issues As To Pretext.
The Court turns next to whether Defendant has advanced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Plaintiff's termination and whether, in turn, Plaintiff has raised a genuine dispute that this explanation is mere pretext. The Court has already accepted that Defendant's stated explanation for Plaintiff's termination is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reason.14 Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of Defendant is warranted if Plaintiff cannot raise a genuine dispute as to whether this explanation is pretextual.
To show that the articulated reason for termination is pretextual, Plaintiff "may succeed . . . either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." Day v. Sears Holdings Corp., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1170 (C.D. Cal. 2013) (quoting Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)). Where a plaintiff proffers circumstantial evidence that the defendant's reason was pretextual, such evidence "must be 'specific' and 'substantial' in order to create a triable issue with respect to whether [*27]  the employer intended to discriminate." Day, 930 F. Supp. 2d at 1171 (quoting cases). The evidence must be "such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination." Id. (quoting Morgan v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 75, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000)).
In support of his position, Plaintiff advances three arguments: (1) that "me too" evidence and Rogers'"new blood" comment15 establish Defendant's practice of discriminating against older employees; (2) that Plaintiff had performed work while on medical leave without requesting compensation for his time; (3) that Defendant's investigation of Plaintiff's alleged timesheet falsification was a sham; and (4) that the authenticity of photographs of the area where Plaintiff was supposed to be weeding is questionable.
The Court first considers Plaintiff's first argument that the "me too" declarations and Rogers's "new blood" comment raise a triable issue of pretextual termination. As a threshold matter, the Court does not consider Rogers's "new blood" comment because it is a stretch to say this comment reflects discriminatory animus: Whether "new blood" refers to younger employees or merely to new employees is ambiguous, and the remark is not demeaning on its face. If the comment "we don't [*28]  necessarily like grey hair" is not sufficient to establish a triable issue, see Nesbit v. Pepsico, Inc., 994 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir.1993) (so holding), then Rogers' fundamentally innocuous comment is not sufficient, cf. Cordova v. State Farm Ins. Cos., 124 F.3d 1145, 1149 (9th Cir.1997) (decisionmaker's comment that another employee was a "dumb Mexican" constituted direct evidence of discriminatory animus). Furthermore, Rogers's comment was "not tied directly to [the plaintiff]'s termination," so it is insufficient as a matter of law to establish discriminatory intent. Id.; see also Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., 113 F.3d 912, 915, 918-19 (9th Cir. 1996) (supervisor's comment that he wanted to get rid of all the "old timers" because they would not "kiss my ass" was ambiguous because it could refer to longtime employees not just those over 40, and was not tied directly to plaintiff's layoff, so "it is weak evidence and not enough to create an inference of age discrimination").
Some of Plaintiff's proffered declarations, however, do raise triable issue of pretext.16 "[E]vidence of an employer's allegedly discriminatory conduct against other employees is relevant and highly admissible to prove the employer's motive and intent in taking an action against a plaintiff." Sussel v. Wynne, Case No. CV 05-00444-ACK (KSCx), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72774, 2006 WL 2860664, *3 (D. Haw. Oct. 4, 2006) (citing Heyne v. Caruso, 69 F.3d 1475, 1479-80 (9th Cir. 1995)). Specifically, "me too" evidence of discrimination is routinely considered in FEHA discrimination actions. [*29]  See, e.g., Johnson v. United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children's Found., 173 Cal. App. 4th 740, 759, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 198 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009); Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 992, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (holding that lower court erred in failing to consider employee declarations even where, "[a]dmittedly, the link between these employees' experiences and [the plaintiff]'s termination [wa]s tenuous, [because] very little evidence of discriminatory intent is necessary to defeat summary judgment"). In support of his Opposition, Plaintiff provides declarations of employees who state that terminations of older employees increased under Rogers's tenure, that they received increased criticism under Rogers, and that they were terminated or felt compelled to resign due to their age. (See Dkt. No. 30, Pl.'s App'x of Evid. Pt. I, Houtz, Lusa, Reyes Decls. at 95-112; Dkt. No. 31, Pl.'s App'x of Evid. Pt. II, Schultz Decl. at 113-118.) Where, as here, Plaintiff's argument is that Defendant engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination, such declarations are sufficient to defeat summary judgment. Accord Trulsson v. Cty. of San Joaquin, Case No. CV 11-02986-KJM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125669, 2013 WL 4737203, **6-7 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2013) (quoting Hawn v. Exec. Jet Mgmt., Inc., 615 F.3d 1151, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010)) (accepting "me too" employee declarations irrespective of whether the declarants were similarly situated to the plaintiff because "[a] plaintiff may show an inference of discrimination in whatever manner is appropriate in the particular circumstances").
Because Plaintiff's first argument of pretext is sufficient to raise a triable issue, it is unnecessary for the Court to reach Plaintiff's additional arguments. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's age discrimination claim.

d. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
The Court finally turns to Plaintiff's claim for the tort of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress ("IIED"). To state a claim for IIED, a plaintiff must allege outrageous conduct that is "so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community." Christensen v. Superior Court, 54 Cal. 3d 868, 903, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 79, 820 P.2d 181 (1991) (quoting Davidson v. City of Westminister, 32 Cal. 3d 197, 209 (1982)). Defendant's first argument is that Plaintiff's claim is "preempted" by California's Worker Compensation laws. California law is clear, however, that claims for IIED based on discrimination are not based on behavior that is a "normal part of the employment environment," and thus such claims are not barred by workers compensation laws. Murray v. Oceanside Unified Sch. Dist., 79 Cal. App. 4th 1338, 1363, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 28 (2000) (quoting Accardi v. Superior Court, 17 Cal. App. 4th 341, 353, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 292 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993)) ("[W]here a plaintiff can allege that she suffered emotional distress because of a pattern of continuing violations that were discriminatory, her cause of action for infliction of emotional distress will not be barred by the [*31]  exclusivity provisions of workers' compensation laws. This is so because the claim is "founded upon actions that are outside the normal part of the employment environment"). Moreover, the cases cited by Defendant are distinguishable because they concern common law claims for IIED based on wrongful termination and not on discrimination. Cf. Buscemi v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 736 F.2d 1348, 1352 (9th Cir. 1984); Shoemaker v. Myers, 52 Cal. 3d 1, 25, 276 Cal. Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054 (Cal. 1990) ("The kinds of conduct at issue (e.g., discipline or criticism) are a normal part of the employment relationship."); Janken v. GM Hughes Elec., 46 Cal. App. 4th 55, 80, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996) ("Managing personnel is not outrageous conduct beyond the bounds of human decency, but rather conduct essential to the welfare and prosperity of society."). And, though Plaintiff has not received medical treatment for distress, a triable issue of fact exists as to whether Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress based on his testimony. (Chambers Decl. at 22.) Accordingly, because certain of Plaintiff's claims survive summary judgment and because of this triable issue of fact, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as it concerns Plaintiff's IIED claim.

e. Punitive Damages
Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff's request for punitive damages. Corporations may be liable for punitive damages for their employees' malicious [*32]  acts or omissions, but only if the acting employee has sufficient discretion to set corporate policy. See, e.g., Cruz v. HomeBase, 83 Cal. App. 4th 160, 167, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 435 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000). California law provides that
An employer shall not be liable for [punitive] damages pursuant to subdivision [§ 3294](a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(b).
While "very little evidence of discriminatory intent is necessary to defeat summary judgment," Nadaf-Rahrov, 166 Cal. App. 4th at 992, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must prove "by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice," Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a). This standard applies at each stage of the litigation, including summary judgment. Adams v. Allstate Ins. Co., 187 F. Supp. 2d 1219 (C.D. Cal. 2002); accord Ducre v. Veolia Transp., Case No. CV 10-02358-MMM (AJWx), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158897, 2011 WL 13046882, *25 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2011).
In support of its Motion, Defendant argues that there [*33]  is no evidence that its conduct as alleged rises to the level required for punitive damages to attach, especially where such conduct violates Defendant's good faith efforts to prohibit discrimination. In response, Plaintiff counters that his own testimony as well as that of former employees establishes Defendant's engagement in an "unlawful scheme [that is] certainly worthy of a punitive damages award" and that Defendant cannot rely on its legally compliant policies for support where, as here, Defendant fails to follow them. While the Court reserves judgment on the merit of Plaintiff's arguments, Defendant's boilerplate allegations fall far short of what is required for summary judgment, where the moving party bears the initial burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact for trial. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 251-52, 256. Because Defendant has not carried its burden, and because the Court must view the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, id., the burden does not shift to Plaintiff to show his entitlement to punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's Motion as to this part.

IV. CONCLUSION
The Court DENIES [*34]  Defendant's Motion as to Plaintiff's claims for failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, age discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and his request for punitive damages. The Court DISMISSES Plaintiff's second cause of action for retaliation under California Government Code § 12940. The Court GRANTS the Motion as to all other claims. The Court also DENIES Defendant's pending Ex Parte Application.
