Opinion



NON-FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case is before the Court Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 47). Because genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on Ms. Hill's ADA failure to accommodate claim, it is RECOMMENDED that the Defendant's motion as to that claim be DENIED. It is further RECOMMENDED, for the reasons discussed below, that Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to Ms. Hill's remaining claims.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff Edith Hill, who is proceeding pro se, was formerly employed by Defendant Clayton County School District as a school bus driver. (See Doc. 3 at 6). On December 28, 2011, she filed a Complaint (Doc. 3) alleging [*2]  Clayton County Public Schools terminated her because of her race and disability in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq ("Title VII"), and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq ("ADA"). (Id. at 2). She then filed a First Amended Complaint (see Doc. 4), adding a claim that Clayton County Public Schools retaliated against her in violation of Title VII and denied her a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. (See Doc. 4 at 2).
On July 6, 2012, Ms. Hill filed a Second Amended Complaint in which she changed the name of defendant from Clayton County Public Schools to Clayton County School District, and asserted a denial of reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA, a disability and race discrimination claim under Title VII, and retaliation claims under the ADA and Title VII. (Doc. 32 at 1). Defendant answered the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 34), and discovery proceeded.
Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, with a supporting brief and exhibits (Doc. 47), and a statement of undisputed material facts (Doc. 47-2). Ms. Hill filed a response to Defendant's motion (Doc. 50), and Defendant filed a reply brief (Doc. 52). Briefing is now complete.

FACTS [*3] 
The facts, for summary judgment purposes only, are derived from Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 47-2) (hereinafter "Def. SMF") and uncontroverted record evidence.
Defendant requests that the Court deem its Statement of Material Facts admitted in full as a result of Ms. Hill's failure to comply with LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2) & (3). (Doc. 52 at 1-2). "[I]n opposing a motion for summary judgment, the non-movant is required to directly refute, state a valid objection to the admissibility of, or point out the insufficient support for or immateriality of each [] fact included in the movant's statement of facts." Linao v. GCR Tire Ctrs., Civil Action No. 2:09-CV-134-RWS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120201, 2010 WL 4683508, at *2 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 12, 2010) (citing LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2), NDGa.). "If the non-movant fails to directly refute a material fact set forth in the movant's Statement of Material Facts with specific citations to evidence, or otherwise fails to state a valid objection to the material fact pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(B)(2), that fact is deemed admitted by the respondent." Id.
Here, Ms. Hill does not directly refute any of Defendant's material facts nor does she support any of her statements in her response brief with specific citations to evidence. (Doc. [*4]  50 at 1). Consequently, "[e]ven though [Ms. Hill] is proceeding pro se, since she has failed to submit a proper response to a statement of undisputed material facts, those facts must be deemed admitted." Baxter v. Johnson & Freedman, LLC, Civil Action No. 1:11-cv-01880-CC-RGV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98801, 2012 WL 2921799, at *2 (N.D. Ga. May 10, 2012), adopted by 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98797, 2012 WL 2921452 (N.D. Ga. July 17, 2012); see also Yates v. GMAC Mortg. LLC, Civil Action No. 1:10-CV-02546-RWS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133785, 2010 WL 5316550, at *9 n.1 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 17, 2010) (deeming the defendant's statement of material facts to be admitted where pro se litigant failed to submit a response to statement of material facts in accordance with Local Rule 56.1); Dinkins v. Leavitt, Civil Action File No. 1:07-CV-486-TWT, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102709, 2008 WL 447503, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 13, 2008) (same).
Despite Ms. Hill's failure to comply with LR 56.1(B)(2)(a)(2) & (3), the undersigned "is not permitted to grant the motion for summary judgment solely as a result of this omission." Haynes v. Cyberonics, Inc., Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-2700-JEC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99738, 2011 WL 3903238, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 6, 2011). "Rather, the Court is still obliged to review the evidence cited by defendant to insure that it forecloses a genuine issue of material fact." Id.; (citing Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1267-1268 (11th Cir. 2008). Furthermore, for the sake of clarity, the undersigned has included relevant evidence set forth by Ms. Hill in her response brief to the extent that those assertions do not contradict the facts listed in Defendant's statement. See id.; (citing Reese, 527 F.3d at 1267-1268 [*5] ).
The undersigned has reviewed the record, including the parties' filings, to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist to be tried. Yet the court need not "scour the record" to make that determination. Tomasini v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. Of Fla., 315 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1260 n.11 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). The facts are construed in the light most favorable to Ms. Hill as the non-movant. See Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 246 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001).
Ms. Hill was hired on February 1, 2006, as a school bus driver for Defendant. (Def. SMF at ¶ 1). In the 2009-2010 academic year, she was assigned to work as a special needs bus driver. (Id. at ¶ 2). Plaintiff's job duties required her to conduct a pre-trip and post-trip inspection of her bus, fill the bus with fuel, and help students exit the bus in an emergency. (Id. at ¶¶ 3, 8).
In June 2009, as required by Georgia law, Ms. Hill received a physical examination to determine whether she was qualified to operate a school bus. (Id. at ¶¶ 10-11; Ex. B to Doc. 47 at 54). The exam indicated that she did not have an illness related to chronic cough or shortness of breath, and it reflected that she had no physical restrictions to being a school bus driver for the 2009-2010 academic year. (Id. at ¶¶ 11, 13).
On August 5, 2009, Ms. Hill drove her assigned bus on a [*6]  practice run. (Id. at ¶ 25). She later stated that it "was about 110 [degrees] inside" the bus that day and that the heat impaired her breathing. (Doc. 4 at 3; Doc. 7-2 at 11). After her practice run, Ms. Hill told her supervisor Lisa Wambles that she would drive her morning route but would not be able to drive the "afternoon route because it would be too hot" and that she wanted to "go to [her] doctor to find out why [her] breathing was impaired." (Doc. 7-2 at 11).
On August 10, 2009, Ms. Hill drove the morning run for her bus route and then left work. (Def. SMF at ¶ 29). The next day, she filed an "Employee Request for Reasonable Accommodation." (Doc. 4 at 3). In her request, Ms. Hill stated that the "heat impair[ed] [her] ability to breath properly" and "affect[ed] her ability to perform [her] job in a safe manner." (Id.). As a result, Ms. Hill requested an air-conditioned bus, explaining that an air-conditioned bus would "help [her] perform [her] job." (Id.). An air-conditioned bus was the only accommodation Ms. Hill requested. (Ex. B to Doc. 47 at 42).
At the time of her request, Defendant employed around "416 Bus Drivers and 105 Bus Monitors" and had in its possession 136 buses with air conditioning. [*7]  (Doc. 7-1 at 35). In 2009, Defendant assigned special needs buses to drivers based on a variety of factors. (Def. SMF ¶ 79). Defendant's policy on assigning special needs buses states as follows:
There are many factors to consider when assigning buses for Special Needs. There is no single procedure to follow. Some considerations are:
1. Program needs
2. Type of bus (lift equipment, large bus, etc.)
3. Students served (able to catch bus at corner or in driveway
4. Driver Seniority in Special Needs
5. Driver physical ability (able to handle wheel chair students requiring safety vest, etc.)
(Doc. 47-4 at 52).
On August 13, 2009, Defendant placed Ms. Hill on leave without pay. (Def. SMF at ¶ 44). After Ms. Hill went on leave, Barbara Heard, Defendant's benefits manager, directed Ms. Hill to fill out a Family Medical Leave form to keep her job and benefits. (Doc. 7-2 at 31; Def. SMF at ¶ 39). On September 17, 2009, Ms. Hill's request for family medical leave was denied, in part because her doctor informed Defendant that she could "perform full duty." (Doc. 7-1 at 19; Doc. 4 at 21).
To determine whether Ms. Hill should receive an accommodation, Defendant requested Healthcare Provider Statements from [*8]  two of her treating physicians, Dr. Willie and Dr. Patel. (Doc. 4 at 13, 16). In her statement, Dr. Willie asserted that Ms. Hill had shortness of breath caused by the physical impairment of lung scarring; that she was significantly limited in the major life activity of working, explaining that "driving/operating an unairconditioned vehicle may trigger [Ms. Hill] to become limited to perform properly"; that she could perform her job only under the right circumstances; and recommended that Ms. Hill be provided an air-conditioned vehicle in order to avoid triggering lung problems. (Id. at 13-14). In his statement, Dr. Patel acknowledged that Ms. Hill had the physical impairment of lung scarring and was significantly limited in the major life activity of working, but he noted that Ms. Hill was not restricted from performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. (Id. at 17-18). Dr. Patel also recommended that Defendant supply Ms. Hill with an air-conditioned bus. (Id. at 18).
On August 28, 2009, Defendant provided a written response to Ms. Hill's request for accommodation, stating as follows:
Your request for an air conditioned school bus was carefully considered by the Transportation Department, however at this time [*9]  the department cannot accommodate your request. The bus that is assigned to your route is not air conditioned and [Clayton County Public School's] Transportation Department does not have an available air conditioned bus that can be provided to you. Therefore it is expected that you report back to work and resume your responsibilities as a Clayton County Public School Bus Driver.
(Id. at 68).
On September 17, 2009, Ms. Hill filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. (Doc. 4 at 7). In her charge, Ms. Hill asserts that she was discriminated against because of her race and disability when she was denied an air—conditioned bus while a white male, with less seniority, was provided with an air-conditioned bus; and that she was denied a reasonable accommodation when Defendant refused to provide her with an air—conditioned bus. (Id.). Ms. Hill never received a right-to-sue notice from the EEOC concerning these charges.
According to Defendant, in October 2009, an unnamed member of the School District staff offered Ms. Hill an air-conditioned bus. (Doc. 47-3 at ¶ 8; Doc. 47-5 at ¶ 12; Doc. 47-8 at ¶ 9). Ms. Hill testified that Wendy Perry, a lead driver for Defendant, called her on October 9, 2009, [*10]  and told her that "when [she] [came] back to work Monday, [Defendant] w[ould] have a driver to ride with [her] because [her] route ha[d] changed." (Doc. 60 at 87). Ms. Hill told Perry that she had not discussed coming back to work with anyone, that she was supposed to take part in mediation and receive documents from the EEOC, and she asked what number in line she was for seniority. (Id.). Ms. Hill did not return to work after discussing her new route with Perry, and she did not testify to speaking to any other employees of Defendant in October. (Doc. 60 at 52).
In February 2010, Defendant conducted an investigation of Ms. Hill's absences. (Ex. A to Doc. 43 at 2). According to the investigative report, Ms. Hill had been "on leave without pay since August 13, 2009" and had "not reported to work nor [had] she called to report her absences." (Id. at 5-6). On March 1, 2010, John Lyles, the Director of Transportation for Defendant, recommended to Dr. Blasingame, Defendant's Director of Human Resources, that the department terminate Ms. Hill because she had been absent since August 13, 2009 "as Leave Without Pay as a 'no call, no show.'" (Id. at 7).
On March 2, 2010, Defendant mailed Ms. Hill an official termination letter. [*11]  (Doc. 4 at 8). The letter informed Ms. Hill that she was being terminated for job abandonment, and noted that she had been contacted on several occasions concerning her position with no response. (Id.). In Ms. Hill's separation notice, filed with the Georgia Department of Labor on March 4, 2010, Defendant states that Ms. Hill was terminated by her superintendent for job abandonment. (Id. at 9).
On May 6, 2010, Ms. Hill filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC. (Doc. 4 at 10). In that charge, Ms. Hill asserts that she was discriminated against because of her race in violation of Title VII, her disability in violation of the ADA, and retaliated against for having engaged in a protected activity in violation of the ADA and Title VII. (Id.). Ms. Hill received a right-to-sue notice concerning these charges on June 7, 2011. (Id. at 11).

I. Summary Judgment Standard
Summary judgment is proper "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by[] . . . citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including [*12]  depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The moving party has an initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); see also Arnold v. Litton Loan Servicing LP, No. 1:08-cv-2623-WSD, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119787, 2009 WL 5200292, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 23, 2009) ("The party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact." (citing Herzog v. Castle Rock Entm't, 193 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999)). If the non-moving party will bear the burden of proving the material issue at trial, then in order to defeat summary judgment, she must respond by going beyond the pleadings, and by her own affidavits, or by the discovery on file, identify facts sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue for trial. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 324. "No genuine issue of material fact exists if a party has failed to 'make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.'" AFL-CIO v. City of Miami, 637 F.3d 1178, 1186-87 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322).
Furthermore, "[a] nonmoving party, opposing a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavits[,] [*13]  cannot meet the burden of coming forth with relevant competent evidence by simply relying on legal conclusions or evidence which would be inadmissible at trial." Avirgan v. Hull, 932 F.2d 1572, 1577 (11th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 952, 113 S. Ct. 405, 121 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1992); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B), (c)(4). The evidence "cannot consist of conclusory allegations or legal conclusions." Avirgan, 932 F.2d at 1577. Unsupported self-serving statements by the party opposing summary judgment are insufficient to avoid summary judgment. See Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 714 (11th Cir. 1984).
For a dispute about a material fact to be "genuine," the evidence must be such that "a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Id. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted). It is not the court's function at the summary judgment stage to determine credibility or decide the truth of the matter. Id. at 249, 255. Rather, "[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the nonmovant's] favor." Id. at 255.

A. Plaintiff's ADA Failure To Accommodate Claim

1. Did Plaintiff Exhaust Her Administrative Remedies?
Before reaching the merits of Defendant's motion, the undersigned must first determine whether Ms. Hill properly exhausted her administrative remedies before [*14]  bringing her failure to accommodate claim. Defendant contends that Ms. Hill's failure to accommodate claim should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because Ms. Hill never received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC before bringing suit on that claim. (Doc. 47-1 at 16). In the Eleventh Circuit, "[i]t is clear ... that receipt of a right-to-sue letter is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit [in ADA actions], but rather, is a statutory precondition which is subject to equitable modification." Forehand v. Florida State Hosp., 89 F.3d 1562, 1569-70 (11th Cir. 1996). "A court may waive the right-to-sue notice requirement when it would be unfair to a plaintiff not to do so." Lee v. Anderson Columbia Co., No. 5:09-cv-12/RS/EMT, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27054, 2009 WL 789680, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Mar. 23, 2009) (citing Fouche v. Jekyll Island—State Park Authority, 713 F.2d 1518, 1526 (11th Cir. 1983). But equitable modification is not appropriate in cases where "a claimant attempts to frustrate investigation or conciliation by the EEOC" or "the defendant [claims] it was prejudiced by the premature filing." Haugabrook v. Cason, Civil Action No. 7:10-CV-60 (HL), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123468, 2010 WL 4823485, at *2 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 22, 2010).
In this case, Ms. Hill has submitted evidence showing that she properly filed a charge with the EEOC and requested a right-to-sue letter. (See Doc. 4 at 7; Doc. 7-1 at 29). Nothing in the record suggests Ms. Hill attempted [*15]  to frustrate the EEOC's investigation or conciliation process, and Defendant does not claim that it was prejudiced by the premature filing. Furthermore, the EEOC investigated all of Ms. Hill's claims in her September charge, including her failure to accommodate claim, and sent her a right-to-sue letter for her May charges only after concluding that investigation. (Doc. 7-1 at 34; Doc. 4 at 11). While it is impossible to tell from the record why Ms. Hill did not receive a right-to-sue letter for her failure to accommodate claim, it would be unfair to Ms. Hill if the court did not waive the notice requirement. Accordingly, Defendant's motion as it pertains to the failure of Ms. Hill to exhaust her administrative remedies is denied.

2. Did Defendant Fail to Accommodate Plaintiff?
Ms. Hill alleges that she was denied a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA when Defendant failed to provide her with an air-conditioned bus. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 2). "[A] failure to make reasonable accommodation claim requires no animus and occurs when a covered entity fails to fulfill its affirmative duty to 'make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise [*16]  qualified applicant or employee with a disability' without demonstrating that 'the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.'" Nadler v. Harvey, No. 06-12692, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007) (unpublished decision) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)). To establish a failure to make reasonable accommodation claim, a plaintiff must show that "(1) she has a disability; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) the employer discriminated against her because of her disability." Keeler v. Florida Dept. of Health, 324 Fed. Appx. 850, 856 (11th Cir. 2009).

a. Is Plaintiff Disabled?
Under the ADA, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 ("ADAAA"), an individual is disabled if she "(A) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [her] major life activities, (B) has a record of such an impairment, or (C) is regarded by [her] employer as having such an impairment." Shannon v. Postmaster General of U.S. Postal Service, 335 Fed. Appx. 21, 24 (11th Cir. 2009). "An impairment qualifies as a disability if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population." Mecca v. Fla. Health Sci. Ctr., No. 8:12-cv-2561-T-30TBM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4006, 2013 WL 136212, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 10, 2013). Under the amended ADA, the term "substantially limits" is to be broadly construed "in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA." 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(1)(i).
Defendant argues [*17]  that Ms. Hill is not a disabled individual under the ADA for two reasons. First, Defendant states that "[Ms. Hill] cannot show that she was disabled because the medical records reveal that her breathing was normal", and it cites to medical examinations conducted in June, July, and August, 2009, which apparently reflect that Ms. Hill's breathing "was on par with the average person in the population." (Doc. 47-1 at 25). Additionally, Defendant claims that Ms. Hill's shortness of breath was not a substantially limiting impairment under the ADA because, according to her physicals, her impairment "was temporary and non-chronic." (Id. at 26). Neither of Defendant's arguments is persuasive.
In the first place, despite Defendant's assertions to the contrary, not all of Ms. Hill's medical examinations indicate that her breathing was normal. For instance, in her August 2009 healthcare provider statement, Dr. Willie concluded that Ms. Hill has shortness of breath due to lung scarring; that her lung scarring significantly limits her in the major life activity of working; and that she is significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes [*18]  as compared to an average person in the general public because of her impairment. (Doc. 4 at 13-14). Similarly, Dr. Patel concluded in his healthcare provider statement that Ms. Hill is significantly limited in the major life activity of working and that she is unable to perform work to the same extent as an average person in the general population. (Id. at 17-18). Furthermore, even though Defendant claims that Ms. Hill's impairment is temporary and non-chronic, this assertion is directly contradicted by Drs. Willie and Patel, who described the nature, severity, and duration of Ms. Hill's impairment as permanent and chronic, respectively. (Id. at 15, 19). Based on the foregoing, and broadly construing the term substantially limited as required by the amendments to the ADA, the undersigned concludes that there is an issue of material fact as to whether Ms. Hill is disabled under the ADA.

b. Is Plaintiff A Qualified Individual?
Defendant asserts that Ms. Hill's failure to accommodate claim fails as a matter of law because she is not a qualified individual under the ADA. (Doc. 47-1). More specifically, Defendant maintains that Ms. Hill cannot establish a prima facie case because she never identified any accommodation [*19]  that would allow her to perform the essential functions of her job i.e., inspecting the bus, filing the bus up with gas, unloading students, stopping at railroad crossings, and opening the doors to the bus. (Id. at 27).
An individual is "qualified" if she can perform the essential functions and job requirements of the position she holds with or without reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(8). An accommodation is reasonable if it "allow[s] the employee to perform the essential functions of [her] job." Shannon v. Postmaster Gen. of United States Postal Serv., 335 Fed. Appx. 21, 25 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished decision). Essential functions "are the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform." Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir. 2007). In determining what functions of a job are essential, "[c]onsideration shall be given to the employer's judgment ... and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job." Id. (quotation omitted).
An accommodation is unreasonable "if it either (1) imposes undue financial and administrative burdens on a grantee or (2) requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.'" Shannon, 335 Fed. Appx. at 25 (quoting Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d 1201, 1220 (11th Cir. 2008)). Furthermore, "a qualified individual [*20]  with a disability is 'not entitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only to a reasonable accommodation.'" Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., 117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Lewis v. Zilog, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 931, 948 (N.D. Ga. 1995)). "A plaintiff bears the burden of identifying [her] accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows [her] to perform the essential functions of the job." Nadler, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20272, 2007 WL 2404705 at *7; see also Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1286 (stating that the plaintiff has "the ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that . . . an accommodation is reasonable.").
Here, Plaintiff plainly identified her requested accommodation — an air-conditioned bus. She also submitted healthcare provider statements from Drs. Willie and Patel who both concluded, after reviewing a job description and physical demands form that detailed the physical requirements for a bus driver, that Ms. Hill could perform the essential functions of her job with an air-conditioned bus. (Doc. 4 at 14, 18). Other than conclusory assertions, Defendant proffers nothing to dispute this evidence. (Doc. 47-1 at 27 ("To be sure, Plaintiff never identified any reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform these essential functions.")). As such, the undersigned finds that Ms. Hill has met her burden of demonstrating that she is a qualified [*21]  individual under the ADA.

c. Did Defendant Discriminate Based On Plaintiff's Disability?
Defendant argues that even if Ms. Hill was "disabled and a qualified individual" she still cannot demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination because "[she] cannot establish a failure to accommodate." (Doc. 47-1 at 28). To support this contention, Defendant makes the following arguments: (1) that an air-conditioned bus was an unreasonable accommodation because it was not required to take a bus away from another employee and give it to Plaintiff; (2) that it provided a reasonable accommodation when it allowed Ms. Hill to be on unpaid leave until an air-conditioned bus became available; and (3) that it acted reasonably when it provided Ms. Hill an air-conditioned bus in October 2009. (Doc. 47-1 at 29). As set forth more fully below, the undersigned finds Defendant's arguments unpersuasive and concludes that it has failed to demonstrate an absence of material fact on this issue.

1. Was An Air-Conditioned Bus Required?
Defendant first argues that it was not required to give Ms. Hill an air-conditioned bus because it did not "have an air-conditioned bus for her that was available in August." (Doc. [*22]  47-1 at 29). More specifically, Defendant contends that it assigned buses based on a host of factors, and that Ms. Hill's request for an air-conditioned bus was unreasonable because providing her with an air-conditioned bus would have required Defendant to take a bus away from another employee. (Id.).
As previously noted, "the ADA imposes upon employers the duty to provide reasonable accommodations for known disabilities unless doing so would result in undue hardship to the employer." Davis v. Florida Power & Light Co., 205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting Morisky v. Broward County, 80 F.3d 445, 447 (11th Cir. 1996). "An employer ... has the burden of persuasion on whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship." Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, Ga., 112 F.3d 1522, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted); see also Holly v. Clairson Industries, L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) ("[A]n employer's failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual itself constitutes discrimination under the ADA, so long as that individual is "otherwise qualified," and unless the employer can show undue hardship.") (emphasis in original). Here, Defendant fails to make any evidentiary showing in support of undue hardship other than to say, in conclusory fashion, that it was not required to take an air-conditioned bus from another employee. Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests that supplying Ms. Hill with an air-conditioned bus would have imposed [*23]  undue financial and administrative burdens on Defendant or required a fundamental alteration in the nature of its bus allocation program, especially considering that Defendant had "no single procedure to follow[]" when distributing air-conditioned buses. (See Doc. 47-4 at 52); Shannon, 335 Fed. Appx. at 25.
Moreover, other courts faced with similar factual circumstances — where an employer asserts that an accommodation is unreasonable because it has already allocated vehicles based on a pre-existing system — have denied summary judgment for employers and found genuine issues of material fact when the employer failed to provide sufficient evidence of undue hardship. See Gribben v. UPS, No. CV-04-2814-PHX-FJM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19599, 2009 WL 648509, at *2-3 (D. Ariz. Mar. 12, 2009) (denying summary judgment where employer refused to supply the plaintiff with an air-conditioned truck contending it "assign[ed] vehicles to its shifter drivers based on business needs and equipment availability" without other evidence of undue hardship); Nuetzman v. Con-Way Transp. Servs., Inc., Civil No. 06-2730 (PAM/JSM), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73329, 2007 WL 2908112, at *6-7 (D. Minn. Oct. 1, 2007) (denying summary judgment and concluding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to undue hardship where the defendant claimed that providing an air-conditioned truck would "upset the seniority-based system that [the defendants'] drivers use [*24]  to select routes" and allocate air-conditioned trucks but failed to provide other evidence of undue hardship); Cf. Custard v. Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., No. Civ.A. H-04-1882, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49896, 2005 WL 1960058, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 16, 2005) (granting summary judgment for an employer who denied an employee a bus equipped with a push-button door where the undisputed evidence established that "such buses were in short supply, intended for use on long trips ... and that allowing [the plaintiff] to use one of these buses on a full-time basis would have imposed an undue hardship on [the defendant]").
Finally, the case on which Defendant exclusively relies, Fussell v. Georgia Ports Authority, 906 F.Supp. 1561 (S.D. Ga. 1994), differs significantly from this one. In Fussell, the court concluded that the plaintiff's requested accommodations were unreasonable because they required the defendant to either create a new position specifically for the plaintiff or reallocate fundamental duties of the plaintiff's job. See id. at 1573. Here, Ms. Hill's requested accommodation would not require Defendant to create a new position or reallocate any of the fundamental duties of a special needs bus driver. Instead, given Defendant's inability to adduce any evidence of undue hardship, it appears her request presumably only required an air-conditioned bus to be reassigned from a driver who did not have a disability. [*25]  As such, the undersigned finds that Fussell does not excuse Defendant's unwillingness to transfer a previously assigned air-conditioned bus to Plaintiff.
Accordingly, because Defendant has failed to submit evidence of undue hardship, the undersigned concludes that Defendant has failed to demonstrate an absence of material fact on this issue.

2. Was Unpaid Leave A Reasonable Accommodation?
Next, Defendant maintains that it provided a reasonable accommodation to Ms. Hill when it allowed her to be on unpaid leave until an air-conditioned bus became available in October. (Doc. 47-1 at 29). The Eleventh Circuit "has recognized that a leave of absence is a reasonable accommodation in some cases." Haines v. Cherokee County, Civil Action File No. 1:08-CV-2916-JOF/AJB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71544, 2010 WL 2821853, at *20 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 16, 2010), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71524, 2010 WL 2821780 (N.D. Ga. July 15, 2010); see also Wood v. Green, 323 F.3d 1309, 1314 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting "a leave of absence might be a reasonable accommodation in some cases," but finding an indefinite leave of absence to be unreasonable). To constitute a reasonable accommodation, however, a leave of absence must allow an individual "to perform his or her job duties in the present or immediate future." Id.
Here, Defendant does not explain why the unpaid leave of absence was reasonable or try to show that Plaintiff [*26]  could have performed her job duties in the present or in the immediate future as a result of the unpaid leave period. Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests that Defendant granted Ms. Hill unpaid leave with the understanding that such leave would end when more air-conditioned buses became available. Genuine issues of material fact remain concerning whether the unpaid leave was a reasonable accommodation.

3. Did Defendant Offer An Air-Conditioned Bus In October, And If So, Was This Reasonable?
Defendant makes an additional argument concerning the delay in making a air-conditioned bus available for Plaintiff. While it is not entirely clear from Defendant's papers, it appears that Defendant claims that the nearly two month delay — the period of time from August 13, 2009 when Ms. Hill requested her accommodation and October 9, 2009 when Defendant offered Ms. Hill an air-conditioned bus — was reasonable because it allowed Ms. Hill to be on unpaid leave until an air-conditioned bus became available in October. (Doc. 47-1 at 29).
In contending that the nearly two-month delay was reasonable, Defendant relies on Terrell v. USAir, 132 F.3d 621 (11th Cir. 1998). In Terrell, an employee with carpal tunnel syndrome claimed her employer violated [*27]  the ADA by delaying receipt of a drop keyboard after it was requested. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the employer and held that a three-month delay in providing an accommodation was reasonable. The court concluded "that th[e] delay was reasonable, considering that Plaintiff had some access to a drop keyboard position during this time and that she was not required to type when she had no access." Id. (emphasis added); see also Selenke v. Medical Imaging of Colorado, 248 F.3d 1249, 1262 (10th Cir. 2001) (stating Terrell held three-month delay in providing the drop keyboard was reasonable where plaintiff "had some access" to the keyboard during delay and "was not required to type when she had no access").
Unlike the employee in Terrell, who had some access to a drop keyboard during the delay, Ms. Hill did not have any access to an air-conditioned bus during a nearly two month delay.1 In fact, as the undersigned concluded above, an issue of material fact exists as to whether Ms. Hill had access to any reasonable accommodations during the delay, as Defendant has not demonstrated that the unpaid leave period was a reasonable accommodation. Cf. Ungerleider v. Fleet Mortg. Group of Fleet Bank, 329 F. Supp. 2d 343, 354-355 (D. Conn. 2004) (delay reasonable where defendant "was working to provide th[e] accommodation and provided [the plaintiff] with [*28]  an interim accommodation); Richio v. Miami-Dade County, 163 F. Supp. 2d 1352, 1366 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (reasonable accommodation provided during delay while securing requested accommodation). Because the undersigned finds this case factually distinguishable from Terrell, and because Defendant provides no other arguments in support of the delay's reasonableness, the undersigned concludes that Defendant has failed to establish an absence of material fact on this issue.
Furthermore, although not critical to the undersigned's decision on this motion, the undersigned finds troubling the lack of record evidence regarding Defendant's purported offer of an air-conditioned bus. Defendant claims that Ms. Hill was called to return to work in October after an air-conditioned bus became available and, in support of this claim, it cites to the affidavits of Rella Smith, Lisa Wambles, and Doug Hendrix. (See Def. SMF at ¶ 43).2 While all three of these individuals claim that Defendant offered Ms. Hill an air-conditioned [*30]  bus in October, they provide no details about how this information was communicated to Ms. Hill or identify the employee of Defendant who made the offer. (See Doc. 47-3 at ¶ 8; Doc. 47-5 at ¶ 12; Doc. 47-8 at ¶ 9). The only record evidence concerning Defendant's purported offer comes from Ms. Hill's deposition, and she never testified that Wendy Perry, the employee of Defendant she spoke to in October, offered her an air-conditioned bus. (See generally Doc. 60). Indeed, Ms. Hill only testified that Perry asked her to come into work the following Monday so that she could learn her new route. (Doc. 60 at 87). This testimony has not been disputed by Perry, who has not been deposed or provided an affidavit in this case. Without more evidence on this point, a genuine issue of material fact remains concerning whether Defendant actually offered Ms. Hill an air-conditioned bus in October.
Accordingly, because genuine issues of material fact remain on whether Defendant reasonably accommodated Ms. Hill, the undersigned [*31]  RECOMMENDS that Defendant's motion for summary judgment as to this claim be DENIED.

B. Plaintiff's Title VII Race Discrimination Claim
Ms. Hill alleges that she was discriminated against because of her race in violation of Title VII. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 2). Ms. Hill does not specify in her Second Amended Complaint what actions of Defendant were discriminatory. (See id.). For purposes of this motion, the undersigned construes Ms. Hill's Second Amended Complaint as asserting that Defendant discriminated against her because of her race by denying her an air-conditioned bus and terminating her. (Doc. 50 at 13, 18).
To establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, "a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for her job; (3) she was subjected to an adverse employment action; and (4) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside her class more favorably." Curtis v. Broward County, 292 Fed. Appx. 882, 883 (11th Cir. 2008) (unpublished decision) (citing Maynard v. Bd. Of Regents of Div. of Univs. Of Fla. Dep't of Educ., 342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003)). The fourth element can also be established by identifying a person outside the plaintiff's class who replaced her. See Morris, 402 F.3d at 1082 ("McDonnell Douglas requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case which includes identifying an individual [*32]  who replaced him or was treated better than he was who was not a member of his protected class . . . ." (citing Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., 883 F.2d 977, 982 (11th Cir. 1989)).
With respect to Ms. Hill's claim that she was discriminated against when she was denied an air-conditioned bus, the undersigned concludes that Ms. Hill has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Ms. Hill has not provided facts or evidence to establish that Defendant's denial of an air-conditioned bus was an adverse employment action for purposes of Title VII, nor has she shown that Defendant treated similarly situated employees outside of her class more favorably. Further, because Ms. Hill was replaced by a black female, she cannot establish the fourth element of her prima facie case by identifying a person outside of her protected class that replaced her. (See Def. SMF at ¶ 77).
For similar reasons, Ms. Hill's claim that she was terminated because of her race fails as a matter of law. Ms. Hill has not produced any evidence of a similarly situated employee for purposes of this claim and, as previously stated, she was not replaced by a person outside of her protected class. As a result, she has failed to establish a [*33]  prima facie case of race discrimination.
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Ms. Hill's claim for race discrimination under Title VII.

C. Ms. Hill's ADA and Title VII Retaliation Claim
Ms. Hill alleges that Defendant terminated her on March 2, 2010, in retaliation for filing a charge with the EEOC on September 17, 2009. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 3; see also Doc. 50 at 28). Defendant argues that Ms. Hill cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation because she has failed to show any nexus between her alleged protected activity and any adverse employment action. (Doc. 52 at 13).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII,3 "the plaintiff must show (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is some causal relation between the two events." Meeks v. Computer Assocs. Int'l, 15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir. 1994). "A plaintiff may satisfy the causation element by showing that the protected activity and the adverse action were not 'completely unrelated.'" Putman v. Sec'y, 510 Fed. Appx. 827, 2013 WL 656807, at *2 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished opinion) (quoting Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir. 2004)). "Close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action may be sufficient to show that the [*34]  two were not wholly unrelated." Id. (citing Bass v. Bd. Of Cnty. Comm'rs, Orange Cnty., Fla., 256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir. 2001). "In the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, if there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action, the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law." Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).
In the present case, the undersigned agrees with Defendant and concludes that Ms. Hill has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA or Title VII. To the extent that Ms. Hill argues causation, she appears to rely exclusively on the fact that she was terminated five months and thirteen days after filing her EEOC charge. (Doc. 50 at 28-29). A five-month gap between a protected activity and an adverse employment action, standing alone, is insufficient to establish a causal connection. See Mathis v. Leggett & Platt, 263 Fed. Appx. 9, 14 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding that there was no causal relationship between protected activity and adverse action where more than five months elapsed between the two events); see also Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir. 2006) ("[I]n the absence of any other evidence of causation, a three and one-half month proximity between a protected activity and an [*35]  adverse employment action is insufficient to create a jury issue on causation.") (citing Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1248 (11th Cir. 2001)). As Ms. Hill has not provided other evidence tending to show causation, she has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.
Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Ms. Hill's claims for retaliation under the ADA and Title VII.

D. Ms. Hill's Title VII Disability Claim
Finally, Ms. Hill alleges that she was discriminated against because of her disability in violation of Title VII. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 2). Title VII does not provide a cause of action for disability discrimination. See Clifton v. Georgia Merit System, 478 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1361 (N.D. Ga. 2007) (dismissing the pro se plaintiff's Title VII claim "[b]ecause disability discrimination is not covered by Title VII"); see also Brandon v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sys., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1354 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (dismissing the pro se plaintiff's Title VII claim at the summary judgment stage because "a disability discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII ...."). Nevertheless, because of Ms. Hill's pro se status, the undersigned will liberally construe her pleadings and consider whether the allegations state a claim for relief under the ADA. See Hill v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 510 Fed. Appx. 810, 2013 WL 646376, at *1 (11th Cir. 2013) (explaining that the Eleventh Circuit liberally construes pro se briefs and pleadings). [*36] 
Ms. Hill does not specify in her Second Amended Complaint what actions of Defendant were discriminatory. (See id.). For purposes of this motion, the undersigned construes Ms. Hill's Second Amended Complaint as asserting that Defendant discriminated against her because of her disability by denying her an air-conditioned bus and terminating her. (Doc. 50 at 13, 18).

1. Analytical Framework
In the absence of evidence of direct discrimination,4 a plaintiff may "establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, [by] demonstrat[ing] that she (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of her disability." Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) and Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 910 (11th Cir. 1996)). If a plaintiff presents a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence, the defendant must then "articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action." Wascura v. City of South Miami, 257 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir. 2001). "[T]he [defendant's] burden is merely one of production; it need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (internal quotations omitted).
If the defendant satisfies its burden by producing evidence of a legitimate rationale for its decision, "the presumption of discrimination is eliminated and 'the plaintiff has the opportunity to come forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.'" Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1243 (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1528 (11th Cir. 1997)). "If the plaintiff fails to proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether each of the defendant's proffered reasons is pretextual, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment." Id.

2. Ms. Hill's Prima Facie Case of Disability Discrimination
For purposes of this motion, the undersigned presumes that Ms. Hill has created a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of the prima facie case. Nevertheless, as set forth more fully below, Ms. Hill has failed to provide evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for denying Ms. Hill [*38]  an accommodation and terminating her were a pretext for unlawful discrimination.

3. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reasons For The Decision
The employer's burden to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decisions is one of production, not persuasion. Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 F.3d 1318, 1331 (11th Cir. 1998). This burden is "exceedingly light." Turnes v. Amsouth Bank, N.A., 36 F.3d 1057, 1060-61 (11th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted). Defendant asserts that Ms. Hill was denied an air-conditioned bus because it did not have any available air-conditioned buses at the time she requested an accommodation. (Doc. 4 at 68). Defendant further asserts that Ms. Hill was terminated after she went on unpaid medical leave on August 13, 2009, without reporting her absences, and refused to return to work. (Doc. 47-1 at 32-33). Defendant has met its "exceedingly light" burden of articulating legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for denying Ms. Hill's accommodation request and terminating her.

4. Pretext
Because Defendant has articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating Ms. Hill, to survive summary judgment, Ms. Hill must "show that the employer's offered reason was not the true reason for its decision, 'either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason [*39]  more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.'" Hill v. Emory University, 346 Fed. Appx. 390, 394 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm'n, 405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005). If the proffered reason is one that might "motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason." Id. (quotations and citations omitted).
To survive summary judgment, "a plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that each of the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons is pretextual." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030, 1037 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). A plaintiff can establish pretext by demonstrating "such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
In the present case, Ms. Hill's claims are due to be dismissed because she has failed to produce sufficient evidence of pretext. She has not provided any facts to suggest that Defendant's proffered non-discriminatory reasons were pretextual, nor has she adduced any evidence of unlawful [*40]  discrimination. See Alvarez v. Royal Atlantic Developers, Inc., 610 F.3d 1253, 1267 (11th Cir. 2010) ("[Ms. Hill's] burden is to show not just that [Defendant's] proffered reasons for firing her were ill-founded but that unlawful discrimination was the true reason."). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED as to Ms. Hill's claims for disability discrimination under the ADA.

CONCLUSION
It is RECOMMENDED that the Defendant's motion as to Ms. Hill's ADA failure to accommodate claim be DENIED. It is further RECOMMENDED that Defendant's motion be GRANTED as to Ms. Hill's remaining claims.
SO REPORTED & RECOMMENDED this 5th day of June, 2013.
