REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
GARY R. BROWN, United States Magistrate Judge:
Plaintiff pro se Alden T. Whitfield ("plaintiff" or "Whitfield") worked for defendant American Storage and Transport, Inc. ("defendant" or "American Storage") as a truck driver --packaging, loading, and transporting furniture and heavy boxes -- for approximately nine months, until a 2004 back injury left him unable to continue. After receiving worker's compensation benefits for seven years, plaintiff requested that defendant establish a position consisting exclusively of running errands and taking inventory of packaging materials -- a position that, defendant claims, did not exist at the time of plaintiff's request. Plaintiff claims that defendant's failure to create a new position to accommodate his injury constituted discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Because the Second Circuit has determined that such claims are not legally viable, and plaintiff  [*2] offers no other basis for his claim of discrimination, it is respectfully recommended defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED in its entirety.

BACKGROUND
The following facts, undisputed except where noted, are drawn from Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts, Mot. for Summ. J. Attach. 1, May 31, 2013, DE [38] (hereinafter "Defendant's 56.1 Statement"), and other evidence of record in this action. See Ayazi v. United Fed'n of Teachers Local 2, 487 F. App'x 680, 681 (2d Cir. 2012) ("when assessing a summary judgment motion, a District Court may consider other materials in the record" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Defendant provides moving and storage services. Id. ¶ 1. Plaintiff worked for defendant as a truck driver from October 2003 to May 2004. Id. ¶ 2. Plaintiff's "main responsibilities" included packing boxes of up to 80 pounds; loading a moving truck with items such as boxes, office furniture, and copy machines; and driving the truck to and from requisite destinations, spending as long as three hours at a time on the road. Id. ¶¶ 6, 7.
Plaintiff apparently suffered a debilitating back injury after falling off a ladder at American Storage's warehouse on May 12,  [*3] 2004. See id. ¶ 2. Plaintiff has not worked for defendant since. Id.
The evidence of record compels the conclusion that plaintiff has, since his injury, been disabled from performing physical labor. Plaintiff filed a claim for worker's compensation benefits in 2004. Affidavit of Christopher Shea Ex. C, DE [38] (hereinafter "Shea Affidavit"). In his 2010 settlement of that claim, plaintiff stipulated that he was "classified as having a permanent partial disability." Id. Ex. D, at 1. Plaintiff described his physical limitations under oath at his deposition: "I might -- could carry, lift up five...books, but I couldn't pick up -- pick up what they call ... in the moving business, a bookcase." Transcript of Deposition of Alden Whitfield 43:13-16, March 26, 2013, filed as Affirmation of Alan B. Pearl Ex. A, DE [38] ("Whitfield Deposition Transcript"). Whitfield has walked with the use of a cane "[o]ff and on from 2004," as prescribed by a physician. Id. 67:12-16. As a consequence, Whitfield concluded that he is permanently prevented from resuming the duties of a truck driver for defendant. See id. 42:10-16 ("[I]t would have been impossible for me to come back -- I'm going to use the term  [*4] full duty performing ... lifting and driving long distance like I were before I got injured."); id. 50:10-14 ("A. ... I miss lifting and carrying things. Q. But you can't do it? A. I can't do it."); id. 88:25-90:5 (confirming that plaintiff's physical limitations may continue indefinitely).
Plaintiff's physician confirmed these physical limitations. Defendant filed a letter provided them by Whitfield, see Shea Aff. ¶ 9; Whitfield Depo. Tr. 88:3-9, in which plaintiff's doctor states that the former is "unable to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time, no driving for prolonged periods of time, and no lifting, squatting, climbing or bending." Shea Aff. Ex. E (hereinafter "Doctor's Note"). On this basis, the letter concludes that plaintiff is both "physically fit to return to work" and "can perform light duties." Id.
After the settlement of his worker's compensation claim, plaintiff requested and was granted a meeting with defendant's President, Christopher Shea ("Shea"), which took place on April 25, 2011. Shea Aff. ¶ 9; Dft.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 13. Whitfield asked that Shea reinstate him to a "light duty position," Dft.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 13; Whitfield Depo. Tr. 77:24-78:2, although  [*5] he deferred to Shea to determine what specific duties the position would entail. Whitfield Depo. Tr. 78:6-12. As Shea tells it, Whitfield also said that "he was willing to settle the matter for $30,000."1 Shea Aff. ¶ 9. Defendant appears to have agreed neither to reinstate plaintiff nor to the creation of a light duty position in the warehouse.
Whitfield filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights ("Division of Human Rights") on August 1, 2011, alleging that defendant, in refusing to place him in a "light duty" position, discriminated against him due to his disability. Shea Aff. Ex. F. The Division of Human Rights determined that there was no probable cause to believe that defendant engaged in the alleged discrimination. Shea Aff. Ex. G, at 1. Shea claims that "[t]he EEOC has yet to issue a 'Right to Sue Letter' in this case." Shea Aff. ¶ 10.

This Action and the Instant Motion
Plaintiff brought  [*6] this suit against defendant on April 3, 2012, see generally Complaint, DE [1], and amended the complaint on May 3, 2012. Am. Compl., May 3, 2012, DE [5]. The complaint sets forth factual allegations that consist with, or deviate in only inconsequential ways from, the aforementioned allegations of defendant's 56.1 statement, including: plaintiff's duties and dates of employment with defendant; the date and circumstances of plaintiff's injury; plaintiff's receipt of worker's compensation benefits and, ultimately, his classification as permanently disabled; and plaintiff's meeting with Shea. See generally Am. Compl. Plaintiff alleges that he "know[s] that the employer has light duty work available" and proposes examples of what such work might entail -- although he cites no basis for alleging either the existence or availability of such a position. Id. at 2. Plaintiff also alleges in the Amended Complaint that "Mr. Shea said that he would reinstate me," id. -- although, curiously, plaintiff attaches a letter from July 19, 2011, in which he states that, "as of today [sic] date; I have not received an answer [regarding reinstatement] from Mr. Shea." Am. Compl. Ex. 2. The Amended Complaint  [*7] concludes, "The defendant has discriminated against me on April 25, 2011. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ... I Alden T. Whitfield, is [sic] requesting 'reasonable' accommodation for my disability." Am. Compl. 2.
At the conclusion of discovery, defendant filed the instant motion for summary judgment. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment 1-2, DE [38] ("Dft.'s Memo."). Defendant argues that plaintiff is not a qualified individual within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, insofar as he is unable to perform the essential functions of his old position with defendant, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Id. at 7-10. Defendant points out that the ADA does not require the employer to create a new position in its workforce as an accommodation. Id. at 10-15.
Plaintiff responds flatly by alleging that defendant violated the ADA by refusing to grant him a reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant Motion for Summary Judgment ¶ 2, DE [39] ("Pl.'s Opp'n"). Whitfield cites to no facts that would support this claim, however.2
On June 4, 2013, the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein referred defendant's motion to the undersigned for Report and Recommendation.

DISCUSSION

Timeliness of Claims
"Title 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) is a charge filing provision that 'specifies with precision' the prerequisites that a plaintiff must satisfy before filing suit." AMTRAK v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 153 L. Ed. 2d 106 (2002) (quoting Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 47, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147, 94 S. Ct. 1011 (1974)).  [*9] "A Plaintiff must timely file an EEOC charge as a prerequisite to a Title VII claim in federal court." Smith v. NYC Health & Hosp. Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85543 (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2013) (citing Francis v. City of N.Y., 235 F.3d 763, 767 (2d Cir. 2000)); see Stebbins v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 382 F.2d 267, 268 (4th Cir. 1967) (plaintiff is never entitled to "bypass the federal agency and apply directly to the courts for relief."). As the Supreme Court explained:
An individual must file a charge within the statutory time period and serve notice upon the person against whom the charge is made. In a State that has an entity with the authority to grant or seek relief with respect to the alleged unlawful practice, an employee who initially files a grievance with that agency must file the charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the employment practice.... A claim is time barred if it is not filed within these time limits.
Morgan, 536 U.S. at 109.
"The Supreme Court... has evinced a policy of treating Title VII time limits not as jurisdictional predicates, but as limitations periods subject to equitable tolling." Johnson v. Al Tech Specialties Steel Corp., 731 F.2d 143, 146 (2d Cir. 1984)  [*10] (citing Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234, 102 S. Ct. 1127 (1982)). "While the [300]-day rule is not a jurisdictional predicate, 'in the absence of a recognized equitable consideration, the court cannot extend the limitations period by even one day.'" Id. (quoting Rice v. New England College, 676 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1982)).
Here, the event to which Whitfield points as the basis for his claim preceded the limitations period. Plaintiff himself alleges, "The defendant has discriminated against me on April 25, 2011." Am. Compl. 2. This date falls 344 days prior to the filing of plaintiff's suit in this Court. Defendant claims, and plaintiff does not dispute, that no EEOC right-to-sue letter has been produced in this action. Accordingly, there is evidence that the period in which to petition the EEOC has run without the completion of that administrative prerequisite.
Although defendant adequately raised the limitations period as an affirmative defense in its answer, see Townsend v. Home for the Homeless, Inc., 28 F. App'x 85, 86 (2d Cir. 2002) (defense waived if not pled), defendant did not argue the defense as grounds for the instant motion. Accordingly,  [*11] while it appears undisputed that plaintiff failed to file within the requisite the limitations period, he arguably has not been afforded an opportunity to be heard on issues such as equitable tolling. See id. (considering whether plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to argue compliance with the limitations period). Given that plaintiff is representing himself pro se, -- as discussed below -- this issue should not provide the basis for summary judgment.
Even if the Court ignores plaintiff's likely procedural missteps, summary judgment should be granted on the merits, as explored below.

Standard of Review on Summary Judgment
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) permits the Court to grant summary judgment only if the pleadings, testimony, and evidence on file "show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The moving party bears the initial burden on such a motion. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "If the summary judgment movant satisfies its initial burden of production, the burden of proof shifts to the nonmovant who must demonstrate that a genuine  [*12] issue of fact exists for trial." Micari v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 43 F. Supp. 2d 275, 278 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250).
In deciding the motion, the Court resolves all ambiguities and draws all inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Ackerman v. Nat'l Fin. Sys., 81 F. Supp. 2d 434 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). Moreover, courts considering motions for summary judgment in discrimination cases "are obliged to exercise particular caution . . . because direct evidence of an employer's discriminatory intent is rare and 'must often be inferred from circumstantial evidence.'" Serby v. N.Y. City Dep't of Ed., No. 09-CV-2727, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36841, 2012 WL 928194, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2012) (quoting Schiano v. Quality Payroll Sys., Inc., 445 F.3d 597, 603 (2d Cir. 2006)) (quotation marks and citation omitted). It is also axiomatic that "pro se papers be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers." Bobal v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst.., 916 F.2d 759, 762 (2d Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Bertin v. United States, 478 F.3d 489, 491 (2d Cir. 2007) ("We liberally construe pleadings and briefs submitted by pro se litigants, reading such submissions  [*13] to raise the strongest arguments they suggest." (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).
Nevertheless, "a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations ... to defeat a motion for summary judgment." Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997); see Scotto v. Almenas, 143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir. 1998) (plaintiff "may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation"); Johnson, 731 F.2d at 147 n.2 ("a mere allegation in [a] pleading [is] insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion" (internal quotation marks omitted)). If the non-moving party's "evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted). Thus, once the movant has met its burden, the nonmovant "must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).

Claim Under the Americans with Disabilities Act
"The ADA prohibits discrimination against a 'qualified individual on the basis of disability' in the 'terms, conditions, and  [*14] privileges of employment.'" Kinneary v. City of New York, 601 F.3d 151, 155 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a)). "Courts in this Circuit have applied the burden-shifting analysis set forth in [McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973),] to cases brought for discrimination under the ADA." Micari, 43 F. Supp. 2d at 279 (citing Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, 143 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 1998)). "First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination." Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000). The burden then shifts to the employer "to produce evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it can involve no credibility assessment."3 Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If this burden is met, "the McDonnell Douglas framework -- with its presumptions and burdens --disappear[s], and the sole remaining issue [i]s discrimination vel non." Id. at 143 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
In order to make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that
(1) the defendant is covered by the ADA; (2) plaintiff suffers from or is regarded as suffering from a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (3) plaintiff was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability or perceived disability.
Kinneary, 601 F.3d at 156 (quoting Capobianco v. City of New York, 422 F.3d 47, 56 (2d. Cir. 2005)). Defendant here does not contest either of the first two elements. This motion turns principally on the third element: qualification to perform the job's essential functions.

Qualification to Perform Essential Job Functions
An employer's adverse action against "a disabled employee . . . who can perform the essential functions of the job but cannot return to work because the employer has denied his request for reasonable accommodation, is  [*17] disability discrimination under the ADA." Kinneary, 601 F.3d at 156 (quoting Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d. Cir. 2000)). The term "essential functions" is generally defined in ADA regulations to mean duties "fundamental" to the position, but not duties that are "marginal." Kinneary, 601 F.3d at 156 (citing Stone v. City of Mount Vernon, 118 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir. 1997); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(1)). "[C]ourt[s] must give considerable deference to an employer's judgment regarding what functions are essential for service in a particular position." Shannon v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 332 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting D'Amico v. City of New York, 132 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir. 1998)). Defendant here claims, and plaintiff does not contest, that "a truck driver['s] ... main responsibilities include[] packing items into boxes which [sic] typically weigh[] up to eighty (80) pounds, loading the moving truck and driving the truck...." Dft.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 6; see Whitfield Depo. Tr. 46:24-25 (apportioning the time plaintiff spent as a truck driver as "80 percent moving and lifting, padding, packing and maybe 20 percent driving").
It is undisputed that plaintiff is  [*18] unqualified to return to his previous position as a truck driver without accommodation. At his deposition, plaintiff conceded, "[I]t would have been impossible for me to come back -- I'm going to use the term full duty performing -- when I say the word 'performing,' lifting and driving long distance like I were before I got injured." 42:10-14. Plaintiff's Doctor's Note confirms the same. Plaintiff concedes that his physical limitations are "permanent." Whitfield Depo. Tr. 42:15-16.
Defendant claims, without rebuttal, that plaintiff never requested an accommodation that would permit him to return to duty as a truck driver.4 Dft.'s Memo. 9. Rather than seeking reinstatement to his position as a truck driver, plaintiff testified that he asked to be hired in a new, "light duty" position, as discussed below. Whitfield Depo. Tr. 98:13-17 ("Q. What accommodation did you ask Mr. Shea for? A. Working around the warehouse, checking the truck to make sure equipment is on it.").
Moreover, plaintiff's physical condition appears to rule out any reasonable accommodation that could permit him to complete the functions of his old position. Plaintiff testified throughout his deposition that the rigors of defendant's truck driver position far exceed his current physical state. See Whitfield Depo. Tr. 43:13-22 ("[A]t most I might -- could carry, lift up five volumes of books .... Maybe one, to, three, five volumes...but I have to be very careful."); id. at 44:8-9 ("Now I'm like a little prune, wind blows me down the block. When I worked for this company, I was like Superman."). Defendant also points out that "Whitfield testified that he often [has] to walk with the assistance of a cane to help him with balance," Dft.'s 56.1 Statement ¶ 18, and that he "takes prescribed medication which, when combined with all of his other medications, impair[s] his ability to drive." Id. ¶ 19.
In sum, plaintiff unquestionably cannot perform the duties of a truck drive for defendant. Plaintiff points to no reasonable accommodation that could assist him in doing so, and his testimony under oath demonstrates that no  [*20] such accommodation exists.

Hypothetical 'Light Duty' Position
Plaintiff's argument that he suffered discrimination seems to stem from his allegation that he "know[s] the employer has light duty work available," Am. Compl. 2, but a position consisting exclusively of such work was not offered to him. The work to which plaintiff claims he should have been reassigned includes "transporting packing materials, transporting blankets, light errands..., inventory, ..., dispatching, and preparing trucks." Id.
Defendant claims, without substantial rebuttal, that such a position does not exist. Shea states that "American Storage did not employ in 2011 any warehouse employees as either a helper or a truck driver in a light duty position." Shea Aff. ¶ 13. Plaintiff does not provide evidence to the contrary, responding only by citing to the legal standard for disability discrimination.5 Opp'n ¶ 2 (defendant "violated the American [sic] with Disabilities Act by failing to accommodate my request for 'Reasonable' accommodation for my disability").
Even if the Court were to credit the Amended Complaint's allegation that defendant's business requires certain tasks that are not physically demanding, this hardly creates a material issue of fact as to whether defendant employs personnel to perform exclusively such tasks. Rather, plaintiff's claim that he learned the skills necessary to complete the warehouse's myriad 'light duty' tasks during his nine-month stint as a truck driver suggests, if anything, that defendant can rely on its fleet of drivers to perform these chores, without carving out a separate job. Accordingly, no evidence of record suggests that defendant has the 'light duty' position plaintiff seeks.
Defendant is not required to create a new position to accommodate plaintiff's physical limitations. "The ADA lists reassignment to an existing, vacant position as a possible reasonable accommodation, but the ADA does not require creating a new position for a disabled employee." Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181, 186 (2d Cir. 2006) (citations omitted); see  [*22] Davidson v. Lagrange Fire Dist., No. 12-CV-2825, 523 Fed. Appx. 838, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 9223 (2d Cir. May 7, 2013) ("our case law makes clear that defendants were not required to create a new position to accommodate [plaintiff]"). Defendant states, and plaintiff does not argue otherwise, that plaintiff's reinstatement in light of his physical limitations would have required the creation of a light-duty position in the warehouse that does not exist. Failure to create such a position does not violate the ADA.
In sum, defendant has shown as a matter of law that plaintiff was unqualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the duties of the position for which he was originally hired. Defendant claims that no vacancy existed that would accommodate plaintiff's physical limitations, and plaintiff can point to no evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie showing of discrimination, and summary judgment for defendant should be granted.

CONCLUSION
For all of the reasons set forth above, I hereby recommend that defendant's motion for summary judgment be GRANTED in all respects, and this action be dismissed with prejudice.
