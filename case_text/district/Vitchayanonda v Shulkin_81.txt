ORDER RE: CROSS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Having reviewed and considered all the briefing filed with respect to plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 37, "Plaintiff's Motion") and defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. 38, "Def. Motion"), the court finds that oral argument is not necessary to resolve the Motions, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Willis v. Pac. Mar. Ass'n, 244 F.3d 675, 684 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2001), and hereby concludes as follows.

INTRODUCTION
On February 23, 2017, Lisa Vitchayanonda ("Vitchayanonda" or "plaintiff") filed a complaint, asserting claims of discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ("RA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 701, et seq., against David Shulkin, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA" or "defendant"), seeking damages, fees, costs, prejudgment interest, and equitable relief. (See Dkt. 1, Complaint at [*2]  ¶¶ 6-7 & Prayer for Relief). Defendant moves for summary judgment on plaintiff's claims of disability discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. (See Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 1). Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment to establish liability on defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. (See Dkt. 37-2, Joint Brief Re Plaintiff's Motion ("Pl. Motion Joint Br.") at ¶ A).

STATEMENT OF FACTS1
Plaintiff has been employed by the VA Medical Center located in Loma Linda, California since June 7, 1998. (See Dkt. 1, Complaint at ¶ 6). Beginning in 2011, Dr. Lynetta Skoretz ("Skoretz") was plaintiff's direct supervisor. (See Dkt. 37-1, Statement of Uncontroverted Facts by Plaintiff ("PSUF") at P3). Dr. Phillip Roos ("Roos") was the Chief of Medical Services, with all section chiefs reporting to him. (see id. at P4).
Plaintiff worked for the General Internal Medicine ("GIM") department, a very busy unit in which staff regularly worked more than 40 hours per week and complained about their workload. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P13 & P51; Dkt. 37-6, Deposition of Lynetta Skoretz ("Skoretz Depo.") at ECF 372-73, 388-89, 391-92). Plaintiff routinely [*3]  worked 14-hour days, six or seven days a week to keep up with the workload, which put her under a lot of stress.2 (See Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at ECF 414-15 & 433-34; Dkt. 37-10, March 2, 2013, E-mail from Plaintiff to Roos; id., Written Confirmation of Request for Accommodation on April 17, 2013 ("Acc'n Request") at ECF 540). Between late 2012 and early 2013, plaintiff had multiple conversations with Skoretz regarding accommodations for her stress, including a reduced schedule or transfer to a different unit. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P8 & P30).
On March 2, 2013, plaintiff emailed Roos, requesting a reduction to a 15-hour week, because the extensive workload in the GIM department was exacerbating her stress and causing physical deterioration. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P32 & P33; Dkt. 37-10, March 2, 2013, E-mail from Plaintiff to Roos, at ECF 533-34). On March 25, 2013, plaintiff met with Skoretz and asked if she could go part-time. (See Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 717). Although Skoretz had previously said that she would be willing to reduce plaintiff's schedule to 20 hours per week, during this meeting she told plaintiff she would not be able to reduce her work hours, and plaintiff offered her resignation. [*4]  (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P8; Dkt. 37-5, Deposition of Philip Roos ("Roos Depo.") at ECF 343; Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at 101-02; Dkt. 37-10, March 25, 2013, Resignation Letter; Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D5).
On April 4, 2013, on the recommendation of Sally Roldan ("Roldan"), Chief of Staff Administration, plaintiff met with Dr. Colburn ("Colburn"), the director of the Rheumatology department, to discuss a potential position in that department. (See Dkt. 38-20, VA Complaint, Attachment at ECF 1105; id., Plaintiff Notes from Meeting with Colburn at ECF 1110-11). Based on her belief that there might be an opening to which she could transfer, plaintiff withdrew her resignation. (See Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 716; Dkt. 38-20, VA Complaint, Attachment at ECF 1105). However, on April 9, 2013, Roos informed plaintiff that there was no position outside of GIM for her. (See Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 717).
On April 10, 2013, plaintiff saw a doctor, who evaluated her and noted that "due to stress, [plaintiff] will not be able to take care of high number of patients," (Dkt. 37-10, Acc'n Request at ECF 54), and recommended medical leave because plaintiff "need[ed] to have some time off and meet with a psychologist [*5]  for stress management." (See Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D10). On the doctor's recommendation, plaintiff took a leave of absence. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P16).
On April 17, 2013, plaintiff submitted an official request for an accommodation to the VA. (See Dkt. 37-10, Acc'n Request at ECF 539-42; Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at ECF 439-42; Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 718; Dkt. 38-20, VA Complaint, Attachment at ECF 1105).
On May 10, 2013, plaintiff's psychiatrist issued a "Return to Work Order," restricting plaintiff to working no more than 20 hours per week. (See Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D12). On the same day, the VA evaluated plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation and found that she has a stress/anxiety disability that substantially limits a major life activity, and that an accommodation — a 20-hour per week work schedule in her current position or reassignment to a full-time position in another department — would enable her to perform the essential functions of her job. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P21 & P27; Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562-68). The VA's disability determination stated that plaintiff's accommodation would be provided to her by May 13, 2013. (See Dkt. 38-18, Acc'n Approval at ECF 566). VA Human Resources [*6]  notified Skoretz that it had assigned plaintiff to a 20-hour work week as an accommodation. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P37). Subsequently, however, Skoretz assigned plaintiff to work more than 20 hours per week, (see id. at P43), which exacerbated plaintiff's stress. (see id. at P55). As time went on, plaintiff tried to get a part-time position in the GIM, or a full-time position in a less stressful unit. (see id. at P44).
In addition, the VA was aware that plaintiff was seeking a transfer to a full-time position in a different department. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P58). Plaintiff's desire to transfer to a full-time position in another department was consistent with the VA's determination as to which reasonable accommodations were appropriate for plaintiff's impairment. (See Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562-68). During this time period, positions became available in other units, (see id. at P76), including a position in Gastroenterology in June 2013, (see Dkt. 38-20, VA Complaint, Attachment at ECF 1105), and a position in Rheumatology in 2014.3 (See Dkt. 37-9, Facility Resource Management Request at ECF 487-88; Dkt. 37-9, Open Recruitment Request in Rheumatology Since October 11, 2012 at ECF 489; Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 705 (indicating there [*7]  was a vacancy in Rheumatology four different times)). Plaintiff applied for several of these positions. (See Dkt. 38-3, Pl. Depo. at ECF 700-03). During the hiring process for a position in the Rheumatology department, Roos made disparaging marks about plaintiff's professional qualifications to Colburn, the hiring director for the position. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P76 & P83; Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 269-74; Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D8). Ultimately, plaintiff was not transferred to Rheumatology or any other unit. (See Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at ECF 418-19).
On June 28, 2013, plaintiff contacted an EEO counselor. (See Dkt. 38-20, Grievance Procedure Notice at ECF 1097-1101) (documentation by EEO counselor citing June 28, 2013 as "Date of Initial Contact" by Vitchayanonda). Subsequently, plaintiff filed an EEO complaint and the instant suit followed.

LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). Judgment must be entered "if, under [*8]  the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict." Id. The moving party has the initial burden of identifying relevant portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a fact or facts necessary for one or more essential elements of each cause of action upon which the moving party seeks judgment. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden of production, "the nonmoving party has no obligation to produce anything." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000).
If the moving party has sustained its burden, the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to identify specific facts, drawn from materials in the file, that demonstrate that there is a dispute as to material facts on the elements that the moving party has contested. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553; Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. at 2514 (A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.").4 A factual dispute is material only if it affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth. See SEC v. Seaboard Corp., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982). Summary judgment must be granted for the moving party if the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an [*9]  element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; see Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512 (parties bear the same substantive burden of proof as would apply at a trial on the merits).
In determining whether a triable issue of material fact exists, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1206, 112 S. Ct. 2995, 120 L. Ed. 2d 872 (1992). However, summary judgment cannot be avoided by relying solely on "conclusory allegations [in] an affidavit." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3188, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990); see also Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (more than a "metaphysical doubt" is required to establish a genuine issue of material fact). "The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position" is insufficient to survive summary judgment; "there must be evidence on which the [fact finder] could reasonably find for the plaintiff." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.

DISCUSSION.
I. ADMINISTRATIVE EXHAUSTION.
"In order to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a federal employee must exhaust available administrative remedies." Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir. 2003); see 29 U.S.C. §§ 701, et seq. The employee must initiate contact with an EEOC counselor "within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action." [*10]  29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a); see Branch v. McDonald, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163153, 2015 WL 7874763, *3 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (plaintiff's claims are limited to those occurring within 45 days of her contact with an EEO counselor). Where the employee fails to comply with the applicable deadline, the 45-day EEOC contact requirement is treated like a statute of limitations requiring dismissal. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct 1127, 1132, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982); Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1105 (9th Cir. 2002) (failure to do so is "fatal to a federal employee's discrimination claim").
A claim "accrues upon awareness of the actual injury, i.e., the adverse employment action, and not when the plaintiff suspects a legal wrong." Lukovsky v. City & Cty. of S.F., 535 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1183, 129 S. Ct. 1997, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1086 (2009). "Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act." Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113, 122, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2072, 0153 L. Ed. 2d 106, (2002) ("Morgan"). However, "continuing violations" may be based on acts occurring outside of the 45-day time period, so long as at least one act contributing to the claim occurred within the 45-day period. see id. at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 2075; Porter v. Cal. Dept. of Corrs., 419 F.3d 885, 894 (9th Cir. 2005); Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013).
Here, defendant argues that the court lacks jurisdiction because plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. (See Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 16). According to defendant, plaintiff first sought EEO counseling regarding her claim on November 6, 2014, thereby rendering any incidents that occurred before September 22, 2014, time barred. (see id.). [*11]  Defendant also argues that, "[e]ven assuming Plaintiff sought EEO counseling on June 28, 2013 and filed an EEO complaint on July 7, 2013 . . . as [she claims], any claims occurring more than 45 days prior to seeking EEO counseling, that is[,] prior to May 14, 2013, are time barred" and the continuing violation theory does not apply to extend the window. (See Dkt. 41, Def. Supp. Br. at 2). Defendant's arguments are unavailing.
While the Complaint of Employment Discrimination, attached to the Complaint as Exhibit B, states that plaintiff first contacted the VA's ORM on November 6, 2014, (see Dkt. 1-1, Complaint of Employment Discrimination at ECF 9), the relevant inquiry is not when plaintiff first contacted ORM, but when she first contacted an EEO counselor. See 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a); Kraus v. Presidio Tr. Facilities Div./Residential Mgmt. Branch, 572 F.3d 1039, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2009) (deferring to EEOC's "long and consistent[] adhere[nce] to an interpretation of 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105 that a complainant may satisfy the criterion . . . by exhibiting an intent to begin the EEO process") (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, it is undisputed that plaintiff contacted the EEO counselor on June 28, 2013. (See Dkt. 38-20, Grievance Procedure Notice at ECF 1097-1101) (documentation by EEO counselor citing June 28, 2013 as "Date [*12]  of Initial Contact" by Vitchayanonda).
Under the continuing violation theory, a plaintiff may recover for "a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice" even if some of those acts do not fall within the relevant filing period. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 116-17, 122 S.Ct. at 2074 (internal quotation marks omitted). "To assess whether [the continuing violation theory applies], we . . . look to the statute. It provides that a charge must be filed within 180 or 300 days 'after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.'" Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1)). According to the Supreme Court's interpretation, that means that if acts on days 1-400 contribute to a hostile work environment and plaintiff files a complaint on day 401, or if acts on days 1-100 and day 401 contribute to a hostile work environment without any acts occurring on days 101-400, the act on day 401 can "pull the other acts in for the purposes of liability . . . so long as each act is part of the whole." Morgan, 536 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 2075.
Here, plaintiff has provided evidence that, in retaliation for her initial EEOC claim, the VA created a hostile work environment by blocking her transfer to a different unit, forcing her to attend unnecessary trainings without provide her comp [*13]  time, and refusing to address complaints about plaintiff with plaintiff. (See, e.g., Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 269-70, 271-74, 277-78, 280; Dkt. 38-4, Pl. Decl. at ¶ 18; Dkt. 38-7 - 38-8, Deposition of Alisa Saenz ("Saenz Depo.") at ECF 849-50). Arguably, each of those acts could "cumulative[ly]" affect the conditions of employment so as to create a hostile work environment. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115, 122 S.Ct. at 2069. In other words, the acts underlying plaintiff's claims are not "discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act[s] [that] occurred on the day that [they] happened," Id. at 110 (internal quotation marks omitted), but rather "repeated conduct" that "occur[ed] over a series of days or perhaps years[.]" Id. at 115; see Harris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993) ("When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As such, the continuing violation theory applies, and "[i]t does not matter, for purposes of the statute, that some of the component acts of the hostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period. Provided [*14]  that an act contributing to the claim occur[ed] within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability." Morgan, 536 U.S. at 117, 122 S.Ct. at 2074.
Because plaintiff initiated contact with an EEO counselor on June 28, 2013, and an act contributing to the claim—i.e., the failure to transfer plaintiff to an open position on June 19, 2013, (see, e.g., Dkt. 38-20, Grievance Procedure Notice at ECF 1099-1100) — occurred within the filing period, plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies under the RA.
II. DISCRIMINATION.
Section 504 of the RA protects "qualified individual[s] with a disability" from being "subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance" "solely by reason of her or his disability[.]" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The RA establishes the federal government as a "model employer" of disabled persons, see 29 C.F.R. §1614.203(c), and imposes upon the federal government an affirmative obligation to accommodate individuals with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 791(b). The duty on federal employers under the RA "goes beyond mere nondiscrimination; the regulations promulgated under [the Act] emphasize the affirmative obligation to accommodate[.]" Buckingham v. United States, 998 F. 2nd 735, 739 (9th Cir. 1993); Zukle v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 166 F.3d 1041, 1046 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that, [*15]  under the RA, public entities have the affirmative duty to "make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when . . . necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability[.]") (citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)); 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i),(ii). To state a discrimination claim under the RA, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a person with a disability, (2) who is otherwise qualified for employment, and (3) suffered discrimination because of her disability. See Allen v. Pac Bell, 348 F. 3d 1113, 1114 (9th Cir. 2003); Mustafa v. Clark Cty. Sch. Dist., 157 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 1998). The RA incorporates the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), including its definition of disability. See 29 U.S.C. § 791(f).
Defendant asserts that plaintiff has failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination because she cannot establish that she is disabled or that the VA failed to accommodate her disability.5 (See Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 18-19 & 22). Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment to establish defendant's liability for failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. (See Dkt. 37, Pl. Motion at ¶ A). Because there is no dispute that defendant receives federal financial assistance or that plaintiff was otherwise qualified for employment, (see, generally, Dkt. 37-2, [*16]  Pl. Motion Joint Br.; Dkt. 38, Def. Motion), the court addresses only prongs (1) and (3).
A. Whether Plaintiff Was Disabled.
Under the ADA and the RA, an individual has a disability if she has "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities[,]" "a record of such impairment[,]" or is "regarded as having such an impairment[.]" See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(g). Major life activities include "caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, . . . and working." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i)(1)(i).
Defendant contends that plaintiff "has not produced substantial evidence showing that she was limited in her ability to work" or any other major life activity, (Dkt. 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 5-6), and that "Plaintiff's alleged stress is not a 'disability' under the ADA" because "Plaintiff's doctors placed her on a 30-day leave for her acute stress" so "Plaintiff cannot present evidence showing that she suffered a long-term or permanent impairment due to work-related stress." (Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 19) (citing 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)) ("[T]emporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with little or no long term or permanent impact, are usually not disabilities."). [*17]  The court is not persuaded.
As an initial matter, given that the VA has already reviewed plaintiff's medical documentation and determined that she qualifies as disabled within the meaning of the ADA and RA, (see Dkt. 37-10, May 10, 2013 Written Confirmation of Request for Accommodation ("Acc'n Request Conf.") at ECF 543 (noting plaintiff was "diagnosed with stress and unable to care for high number of patients"); Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562 § C), the court is somewhat perplexed as to why the VA is challenging plaintiff's protected status under the RA and ADA. In any event, plaintiff has put forth more than sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact that her impairment substantially limits a major life activity. Cf. Coons v. Sec'y of U.S. Dept. Treasury, 383 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir. 2004) ("[F]or summary judgment to be appropriate, there must be no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether [plaintiff] has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment."). For instance, plaintiff submitted doctors' reports showing that she was diagnosed with stress-related disorders in 2013.6 (See Dkt. 37-10, Certification of Health Care Provider [*18]  for Employee's Serious Health Condition at ECF 540 ("[D]ue to stress, she will not be able to take care of high number of patients."); see also Dkt. 37-11, Return to Work Order at ECF 543 ("The patient can return to work on 5.13.13 [i]n current position . . . [w]ith restrictions of: 20 [h]rs/wk.")). In addition, she submitted evidence that this impairment substantially limited her major life activities, including her ability to work. (See, e.g., Dkt. 38-4, Pl. Decl. at ¶ 12) ("The stress and depression that resulted from the extreme work pace in GIM profoundly affected my ability to perform work for extended periods of time."); (Dkt. 38-20, Evaluation from IPMG Moreno Valley Clinic ("2014 Medical Evaluation") at ECF 1108) ("Anxious, Depressed, . . . Difficulty working long hr[,] . . . Feeling exhausted, dreadful, worried, will make mistake and having mental breakdown"); (Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562 § C) (noting that plaintiff had a "physical or mental impairment" or "Stress/Anxiety treated with medications" and that impairment limited life activities including hearing, caring for herself, interacting with others, and digestive functions). She also submitted evidence that [*19]  she contemporaneously reported her impairment to management of the VA, (see Dkt. 37-10, March 2, 2013, E-mail from Plaintiff to Roos at ¶ 4 ("My physical and mental health is deteriorated (PUD, oral Lichen planus, severe hand eczema, IBS . . . . ")), and, as noted above, she submitted the VA's determination that plaintiff qualified as disabled. (See Dkt. 37-10, Acc'n Request Conf. at ECF 543 (noting plaintiff was "diagnosed with stress and unable to care for high number of patients"); Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562 § C).
Finally, the evidence defendant offers in support of its argument that plaintiff's stress does not qualify as a disability does not, in fact, support that argument. That the VA's 2013 accommodation was temporary does not necessarily mean that the impairment the accommodation was intended to address was temporary. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that plaintiff's condition in 2013 was not temporary. For example, a doctor's evaluation of plaintiff in April 2013 indicated that plaintiff's condition was expected, even after her time off, to have "episodic flare-ups periodically preventing [her] from performing [her] job functions" and that she would need [*20]  treatment visits at least twice a year due to the condition, (Dkt. 37-10, Accommodation Request at ECF 539-42), and plaintiff submitted a 2014 medical evaluation indicating that she was suffering from a "chronic" disorder. (See Dkt. 38-20, 2014 Medical Evaluation at ECF 1109) (noting that plaintiff suffered "[m]ajor depressive affective disorder. Single episode, unspecified degree. Chronic.")). Such evidence creates triable "issues of fact whether . . . [plaintiff] suffered from a temporary, nonchronic [condition], or, alternatively, a longer-term, more chronic condition," and whether she remained disabled after May 2013.7 See Mustafa, 157 F.3d at 1174.
B. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation.
"Once an employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation, that employer has a mandatory obligation under the [RA] to engage in an interactive process with the employee to identify and implement appropriate reasonable accommodations." Humphrey v. Memorial Hospitals Association, 239 F.3d 1128, 1137 (9th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1011, 122 S. Ct. 1592, 152 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2002). An appropriate reasonable accommodation must be effective, in enabling the employee to perform the duties of the position. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.9. An employer's duty to engage in good-faith exploration of possible accommodations lies "at the heart of the accommodation process[,]" [*21]  Snapp v. United Transp. Union, 889 F.3d 1088, 1095 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 817, 202 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2019), and "is a continuing duty that is not exhausted by one effort." McAlindin v. Cty. of San Diego, 192 F.3d 1226, 1237 (9th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1243, 120 S. Ct. 2689, 147 L. Ed. 2d 961 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir.1996) ("A party that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith. A party that fails to communicate, by way of initiation or response, may also be acting in bad faith."). "[E]mployers, who fail to engage in the interactive process in good faith, face liability for the remedies imposed by the statute if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible." Snapp, 889 F.3d at 1095. An employer need not make an accommodation that it can demonstrate would impose an "undue hardship on the operation of the business[.]" 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b). The employer carries the burden of proving undue hardship. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).
Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment to establish liability for defendant's failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. (See Dkt. 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 1). Defendant responds that plaintiff "cannot show that the VA failed to accommodate her alleged disability" because "Plaintiff was given the reasonable accommodation that she requested consistent with her doctor's restrictions. She requested an accommodation [*22]  of either a 20-hour work week or a transfer to another department and the VA approved the 20-hour work week." (Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 22; see Dkt 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 10-11).
While it is undisputed that the VA initially granted plaintiff her requested accommodation of a 20-hour work week, once that accommodation "turn[ed] out to be ineffective[,]" the VA had an obligation, after "[c]onsider[ing] the preference of the individual to be accommodated[,]" 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.9, to seek "an alternative reasonable accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship[.]" EEOC Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2002 WL 31994335, *24 (2002) ("EEOC Guidance"). Here, not only did it become readily apparent that the initial accommodation was ineffective because Skoretz imposed additional hours on plaintiff beyond the 20-hour per week cap, but plaintiff expressly "ask[ed] for a different accommodation[,]" Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1138, i.e., transfer to a different, less stressful unit. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P40; P44, P55; Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at ECF 418 (stating that she had requested transfers to vascular, two GI positions, and two nursing positions) & 447-48 (stating that additional, uncompensated hours beyond 20 hours [*23]  per week added stress); Dkt. 37-9, Written Confirmation of Request for Accommodation at ECF 468 ("Accommodation requested: . . . Revised — Move to full time position in Rheumatology or Gastroenterology at same pay grade due to hearing disability and stress relating to patient workload, time restrictions and difficulty in dialoguing"); Dkt. 37-11, E-mail from Plaintiff on May 27, 2013, at ECF 571)).
Defendant contends that plaintiff's requested transfer was not a reasonable accommodation it was required to consider because "Plaintiff wanted to leave GIM to get away from Dr. Skoretz[,]" (see Dkt. 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 13), and transfer away from a supervisor is not a reasonable accommodation under the RA. (see id. at 13 n. 2 (citing Dart v. Cty. of Lebanon, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132981, 2014 WL 4792135, *10 (M.D. Penn. 2014); Roberts v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc., 690 F.Appx. 535 (9th Cir. 2017)). The only evidence in support of defendant's contention, however, is a statement from Roldan, (see Dkt. 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 15 & 31 n. 4), that "[she] thought at the time [the requested transfer] was from the actual internal medicine leadership." (See Dkt. 37-2, Pl. Motion Joint Br. at 13) (citing Dkt. 37-11, Roldan Depo. at ECF 618). However, that statement was later qualified by Roldan during the same deposition when she stated that, to the extent [*24]  plaintiff sought transfer away from GIM, it was only because Skoretz refused to honor the accommodation plaintiff was initially provided. (See, e.g., Dkt. 37-11, Roldan Depo. at ECF 619 ("Q: Did [plaintiff] ever indicate to you that the workload at general internal medicine was too much for her? A: The answer is yes. Q: Did she indicate to you that even the half-time assignment in general internal medicine as it actually played out was too much for her? A: Yes.")).
Moreover, the RA specifically anticipates a transfer as a type of accommodation that should be routinely considered and granted. See McAlindin, 192 F.3d at 1237 ("The ADA specifically states that 'reasonable accommodation may include . . . job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, [and] reassignment to a vacant position.'") (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B)). Such an accommodation is required even if the transfer is not available to others, or if the employer's policy explicitly prohibits transfers, see id. at 5454, "unless the employer can show it that it would be an undue hardship."8 EEOC Guidance, 2002 WL 31994335, at *5452. Indeed, "the EEOC leaves no doubt that reassignment involves more than a mere opportunity for disabled employees to compete: 'Reassignment means that the employee gets the vacant [*25]  position if s/he is qualified for it.'" Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1118 (quoting EEOC Guidance, 2002 WL 31994335, at *23).
Here, the VA's "failure to explore with [plaintiff] the possibility of other accommodations, once it was aware that the initial arrangement was not effective, constitutes a violation of its duty regarding the mandatory interactive process." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139. "[L]iability is appropriate if a reasonable accommodation without undue hardship to the employer would otherwise have been possible. As [the court has] already discussed, a [transfer to a different unit] was a reasonable accommodation for [plaintiff's] disability . . . [and the VA] was under a continuing duty to offer a reasonable accommodation. Accordingly, [the court] hold[s] as a matter of law (. . . assuming that [plaintiff] is a qualified person with a disability) that [the VA] violated the [RA's] reasonable accommodation requirement." Humphrey, 239 F.3d at 1139 (internal citation and footnote omitted); see Barnett, 228 F.3d at 1117 ("Given U.S. Air's failure to engage in the interactive process, liability would be appropriate if a reasonable accommodation would otherwise have been possible."). [*26] 
III. RETALIATION.
"[T]he legal elements and the production of proof for a retaliation claim under the Rehabilitation Act is the same as that used under the ADA, namely, that in the absence of direct evidence of retaliation, a plaintiff may rely on the burden-shifting framework used for proving discrimination claims under Title VII as articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817[, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668] (1973)." Brooks v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 1 F.Supp.3d 1029, 1035-36 (C.D. Cal. 2014). Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation. See 411 U.S. at 802-04, 93 S.Ct. at 1824-25; see also Coons, 383 F.3d at 887. Then the burden shifts to the defendant to set forth a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the actions taken. see id. If the defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant's proffered reason is a pretext for retaliation. See id. To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show: "(1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two." Coons, 383 F.3d at 887 (citing Brown v. City of Tucson, 336 F.3d 1181, 1187 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, there is no dispute that plaintiff engaged in a protected activity or that plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action. (See, generally, Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 25-26; Dkt. 37-1, Pl. Motion, Joint Br.; [*27]  Dkt. 41, Def. Supp.). Defendant moves for summary judgment on the basis that plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of raising a triable issue of fact that there is a causal link between the two. (See Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 25-26). The court is not persuaded.
To establish the causation element of a prima facie case for retaliation, a plaintiff must present "evidence adequate to create an inference that an employment decision was based on an illegal discriminatory criterion." O'Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 312, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 1310, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1996) (citation, internal punctuation, and emphasis omitted). "In other words, [plaintiff] must establish a link between [her] request for a reasonable accommodation and [her non-selection for desired transfer positions]." Coons, 383 F.3d at 887. Causation "may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as the employer's knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in protected activities and the proximity in time between the protected action and the allegedly retaliatory employment decision." Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987).
Here, potential adverse employment actions include the VA's failure to transfer plaintiff to open full-time positions in other units, such as a position in the Gastroenterology department in June 2013 and a position in the Rheumatology department in [*28]  August and November 2014, and Roos's negative review of her work to Colburn, the hiring director of Rheumatology. (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P83; Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 269-74; Dkt. 37-10, May 8, 2013, E-mail from Wieck at ECF 546 ("There is a full time Gastroenterology position which she has expressed interest and has applied to."); Dkt. 37-10, Application to Transfer from May 8, 2013 ("Transfer Application") at ECF 549; Dkt. 37-11, Recruitment Checklist [for 2014 Rheumatology Position] at ECF 582; Dkt. 37-11, Rheumatology Interview Notes at ECF 584-85; Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D8). Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the failure to transfer plaintiff to the Gastroenterology position occurred just two months after she requested a reasonable accommodation in April 2013 and received approval for it in May 2013.9 (See Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P21; Dkt. 37-10, Accommodation Request at ECF 539-42; Dkt. 37-10, Acc'n Request Conf. at ECF 543 (noting plaintiff was "diagnosed with stress and unable to care for high number of patients"); Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF 562 §C; Dkt. 38-3, Acc'n Request at ECF 754-55; Dkt. 37-11, Transfer Application at ECF 549; Dkt. 37-11, Acc'n Approval at ECF [*29]  562-68; Dkt. 37-10, May 9, 2013, E-mail from Wieck at ECF546 (acknowledging transfer application)). Such temporal proximity to a protected activity is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to causation. See Brown, 336 F.3d at 1187 (affirming district court's finding of prima facie case of retaliation where defendant disputed causality and plaintiff showed temporal proximity).
Moreover, temporal proximity is but one factor the court may consider to find circumstantial evidence of causation. See Yartzoff, 809 F.2d at 1376. Here, there is additional circumstantial evidence — other than temporal proximity — that plaintiff's protected activity was the "but-for cause" of the VA's refusal to transfer her to another unit. Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 362, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013). Specifically, it is undisputed that Roos, who knew that the VA had already determined that plaintiff qualified as disabled and had received a disability-related accommodation, (see Dkt. 37-1, PSUF at P80; Dkt. 37-5, Roos Depo. at ECF 329; Dkt. 37-10, May 8, 2013, E-mail from Wieck ("Her [plaintiff's] supervisor and Service Chief state she has a 'time management problem'."), made disparaging marks about plaintiff's professional qualifications to Colburn, the hiring director for an available position.10 (See Dkt. 37-1, [*30]  PSUF at P76, P83, P92, P93; Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 269-74; Dkt. 38-1, DSUF at D8). In addition, Colburn confirmed that after hearing those remarks, he likely would not have allowed plaintiff to transfer to his unit, regardless of her qualifications. (See Dkt. 31-1, PSUF at P96-P98; Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 280 ("Q: Regardless of whatever qualifications you were aware that Lisa [Vitchayanonda] had, am I correct that you would not have hired her? A: I think that's probably correct, yeah. Q: And that's based on what Dr. Roos told, you; correct? A: Yes."). These remarks, in and of themselves, are sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Brooks, 229 F.3d at 928 (stating that "dissemination of a negative employment reference" or "issuance of an undeserved negative performance review" can be adverse employment actions); see also Hashimoto v. Dalton, 118 F.3d 671, 676 (9th Cir.1997) (negative reference); Yartzoff, 809 F.2d at 1376 (negative performance reviews). Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to whether she would have been permitted to transfer to a full-time position in another unit if not for her engagement in a protected activity.
In short, the court finds plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of retaliation, and defendant's motion for summary judgment on that claim [*31]  is denied.
IV. HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
"Several . . . circuits have recognized hostile work environment as an actionable ADA claim[.]" Wynes v. Kaiser Permanente Hosps., 936 F.Supp. 2d 1171, 1185 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Shaver v. Indep. Stave Co., 350 F.3d 716, 719-20 (8th Cir. 2003); Fox v. Gen. Motors Corp., 247 F.3d 169, 175 (4th Cir. 2001); Flowers v. S. Reg'l Physician Servs., Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 233 (5th Cir. 2001)); see also Meirhofer v. Smith's Food & Drug Ctrs. Inc., 415 F.Appx. 806, 807 (9th Cir. 2011) (unpublished decision in which the Ninth Circuit "assum[ed], arguendo, that hostile work environment claims are cognizable under the ADA"). "Assuming . . . that the Ninth Circuit would recognize a hostile work environment claim under the [RA], Plaintiff would have to demonstrate that (1) she is a qualified individual with disability; (2) she suffered from unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability or a request for accommodation; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment and to create an abusive working environment; and (5) Defendants knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action." Wynes, 936 F.Supp. at 1185 (citing Walton v. Mental Health Ass'n, 168 F.3d 661, 667 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Title VII hostile work environment standard to ADA claim); see Soledad v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 304 F.3d 500, 506 n. 8 (5th Cir. 2002) (given slight differences in wording of ADA and RA, "we believe a proper hostile work environment claim based on the Rehabilitation Act would necessarily change the third element to read, 'that the harassment complained of was based solely on her [*32]  disability or disabilities'") (emphasis omitted).
Defendants contend that "[e]ven assuming arguendo that this court would recognize a hostile work environment claim under the Rehabilitation Act," (Dkt. 38, Def. Motion at 27), "Plaintiff has failed to establish that the alleged conduct by her supervisors was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment[.]" (Id. at 28). In other words, defendants dispute that plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact as to the fourth element. The court is unpersuaded.
Defendants — having determined that plaintiff was disabled and requested a reasonable accommodation in the form of a transfer — repeatedly blocked her requests to transfer to open positions; eliminated an open position after learning that plaintiff was interested in that position; forced her to go through competitive hiring processes unnecessarily, and repeatedly refused to transfer her; undermined her attempts to transfer by making disparaging marks about her professional qualifications to Colburn, the hiring director for an available position; forced her to attend and pay for communications classes without providing her comp time, despite her supervisor acknowledging [*33]  that the complaint on which the need to attend the class was based was erroneous; and, within days of her being granted the 20-hour a week accommodation, imposed additional hours such that she was working the same 105% schedule as all of the other NPs in the GIM, causing her additional stress. (See, e.g., Dkt. 37-4, Colburn Depo. at ECF 269-74, 277-78, 280; Dkt. 37-5, Roos Depo. at ECF 326-27 & 333; 37-6, Skoretz Depo. at ECF 386-87, 398-400, 404-05; Dkt. 37-7, Pl. Depo. at 100-02 & 171-72; Dkt. 37-9, Facility Resource Management Request at ECF 487-88; id., Recruitment Request at ECF 489; NP Rheumatology at ECF 489; Dkt. 37-10, April 9, 2013, Email Exchange at ECF 538; Dkt. 37-11, May 27, 2013, Email from Plaintiff to Mod 4 Staff at ECF 571; id., May 27, 2013, E-mail from Plaintiff at ECF 571; id., March 31, 2015, Email from Plaintiff at ECF 572; id., July 20, 2015, Email from Plaintiff at ECF 574; Dkt. 38-4, Pl. Decl. at ¶¶ 12-23). Given the totality of the circumstances, the severe and repeated nature of the conduct, and that it unreasonably interfered with plaintiff's right to a reasonable accommodation as well as defendants' failure to engage, in good faith, in the interactive [*34]  process, a reasonable jury could find that the conduct "rise[s] to the level of severe and pervasive harassment that would be actionable under Title VII or, potentially, the [RA.]" Wynes, 936 F.Supp.2d at 1186 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Clark Cty Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 270-71, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1510, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) (court must consider "all the circumstances, including the frequency of discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it was physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance") (internal quotation marks omitted); Flowers, 247 F.3d at 236-37 (jury finding that disability-based harassment of HIV-positive employee was sufficiently severe to support hostile work environment claim under ADA was supported by evidence that, although disability discrimination did not play role in plaintiff's termination, her supervisors stopped socializing with her almost immediately after learning of her condition, forced her to take numerous random drug tests, gave her negative performance appraisals for first time, and lured her into adversarial meetings on false pretenses). Accordingly, summary judgment is denied as to this claim.
This Order is not intended for publication. Nor is it intended to be included in or submitted [*35]  to any online service such as Westlaw or Lexis.

CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED THAT:
1. Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Document No. 37) is granted as to failure to engage in the interactive process and failure to provide reasonable accommodation. Plaintiff's Motion is denied in all other respects.
2. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Document No. 38) is denied.
Dated this 29th day of March, 2019.
