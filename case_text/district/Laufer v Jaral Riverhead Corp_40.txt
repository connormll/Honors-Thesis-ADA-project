Opinion



MEMORANDUM & ORDER
DIANE GUJARATI, United States District Judge:
Plaintiff Deborah Laufer brings this action against Defendant Jaral Riverhead Corp. based on an allegedly deficient online reservation system ("ORS") for Defendant's Holiday Inn Express. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's ORS violates Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq., and the New York State Human Rights Law ("NYSHRL"), N.Y. Exec. Law § 296(2)(a). See First Amended Complaint ("FAC") ¶¶ 8-30, ECF No. 13. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief along with an award of attorneys' fees, costs, and litigation expenses under the ADA and damages under the NYSHRL. See id. ¶ 30 & Prayer for Relief.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint (the "Motion"). See Motion, ECF No. 37; Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion, ECF [*2]  No. 38; Defendant's Letter Response in Opposition ("Def.'s Opp'n"), ECF No. 39; and Plaintiff's Letter Reply in Support of the Motion, ECF No. 40. In connection with her Motion, Plaintiff has filed a Proposed Second Amended Complaint. Proposed Second Amended Complaint ("PSAC"), ECF No. 37-4.1
Because the PSAC does not adequately allege Plaintiff's standing to bring this action, the Court denies Plaintiff's Motion as futile. However, the Court grants Plaintiff leave to file a new amended complaint to address the standing deficiency in the PSAC as described more fully below.2
Any new amended complaint must be filed by August 10, 2021.

BACKGROUND

I. Relevant Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act
In accordance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, "[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation." 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). The ADA defines "discrimination" under Title III to include:
a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such [*3]  modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities, unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.
42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).
The ADA authorized the United States Attorney General to issue implementing regulations under Title III. See 42 U.S.C. § 12186(b). As relevant here, the Attorney General issued 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e) ("Section 36.302(e)"), which pertains to "[r]eservations made by places of lodging," and states that a "public accommodation that owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of lodging shall, with respect to reservations made by any means, including . . . through a third party," take certain acts, such as "[i]dentify[ing] and describ[ing] accessible features in the hotels and guest rooms offered through its reservations service in enough detail to reasonably permit individuals with disabilities to assess independently whether a given hotel or guest room meets his or her accessibility needs." 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e)(1)(ii); see also 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e)(1)(i), (iii)-(v) (listing additional compliance requirements).

II. Factual Background

A. Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff [*4]  filed her original Complaint on June 17, 2020, see ECF No. 1, and her FAC on September 22, 2020, see ECF No. 13. In Plaintiff's FAC, she alleges that she qualifies as an individual with disabilities under the ADA. FAC ¶ 1. Plaintiff alleges that, inter alia, she is "unable to engage in the major life activity of walking more than a few steps without assistive devices," is "bound to ambulate in a wheelchair or with a cane or other support," has limited use of her hands, and is vision impaired. Id. Plaintiff further alleges that she requires facilities she visits to have certain accessibility features. See id. (listing, for example, "handicap parking spaces located close[s]t to the entrances of a facility" and "sufficiently lowered" amenities). Plaintiff also alleges that she is "an advocate of the rights of similarly situated disabled persons and is a 'tester' for the purpose of asserting her civils rights and monitoring, ensuring, and determining whether places of public accommodation and their websites are in compliance with the ADA." Id. ¶ 2.
Plaintiff alleges, as a general matter, that she has a "system of rechecking the online reservations systems of each and every hotel she has [*5]  sued,"3 which system includes "maintain[ing] a list of every hotel she has sued, and record[ing] the dates she visits their reservations systems." Id. ¶ 6. Plaintiff alleges that "once the complaint is filed, she . . . marks a date for the near future to revisit the hotel's [ORS]." Id. She further alleges that she revisits a hotel's ORS when the date arrives by which a hotel, "whether by settlement agreement or court order," is "required to become compliant." Id. Accordingly, Plaintiff alleges that she "revisits the websites for every hotel she sues at least two times after the complaint is filed." Id.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant "owns and/or operates" The Holiday Inn Express & Suites Long Island-East End in Riverhead, New York, which qualifies as a "a place of public accommodation" under Title III of the ADA, the regulations implementing the ADA, and the NYSHRL. Id. ¶¶ 3, 27. Plaintiff further alleges that "Defendant, either itself or by and through a third party, implemented, operates, controls and or maintains an online reservations system" for the hotel, the purpose of which is "so that members of the public may reserve guest accommodations and review information pertaining [*6]  to the goods, services, features, facilities, benefits, advantages, and accommodations of the [hotel]." Id. ¶ 12.
Plaintiff alleges that she visited "the websites for Defendant's hotel multiple times prior to filing" the instant action, including on March 15, 2020. Id. ¶ 6. She additionally alleges that she "visited [Defendant's] ORS for the purpose of reviewing and assessing the accessible features at [Defendant's hotel]," and "ascertain[ing] whether it meets the requirements of 28 C.F.R. Section 36.302(e) and her accessibility needs." Id. ¶ 13. Plaintiff alleges that she was unable to do so, however, because Defendant's ORS did not comply with the requirements set forth in Section 36.302(e). Id. Plaintiff alleges more specifically that she visited particular third-party travel websites (i.e., expedia.com, hotels.com, booking.com, orbitz.com, and priceline.com) and found that they failed to, inter alia, "provide sufficient information about the designated accessible rooms and features at [Defendant's] hotel so that [she could] independently ascertain whether or not they are accessible." See id. ¶ 13.A; see also id. ¶ 13.B-F (noting, for example, that certain third-party travel websites did not "identify accessible rooms," or [*7]  "allow for booking of accessible rooms," and "provided insufficient information as to whether the rooms or features at the hotel are accessible").
Plaintiff alleges that, "[i]n the near future," she "intends to revisit Defendant's ORS in order to test it for compliance with 28 C.F.R. Section 36.302(e) and/or to utilize the system to reserve a guest room and otherwise avail herself of the goods, services, features, facilities, benefits, advantages, and accommodations of the [hotel]." Id. ¶ 14. Plaintiff also alleges that "it would be a futile gesture to revisit" Defendant's ORS "as long as th[e] violations exist unless she is willing to suffer additional discrimination." Id. ¶ 15.
Plaintiff additionally alleges that she "has family in New York and travels to the State to visit them frequently," "plans to return to the State and to travel to all the regions of the State as soon as the Covid crisis is over and will return again in the subsequent future consistent with her frequent visits to the area," and "would like to visit and otherwise explore" certain sites and locations in the vicinity of Defendant's hotel (e.g., the Tanger Outlet Mall, the Long Island Aquarium, and various East End wineries). Id. ¶ 7. Plaintiff [*8]  alleges that she "needs Defendant's hotel reservations system to be compliant [with the ADA] so that she can compare hotels and ascertain whether or not their features and rooms are accessible to her." Id.
As a consequence of "violations present at Defendant's ORS," Plaintiff alleges that, inter alia, her right to travel free of discrimination is being infringed upon, id. P16, she is being deprived of the information required to make meaningful choices for travel, id., she has suffered, and continues to suffer, frustration and humiliation, id., she is being deprived of "the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges and/or accommodations available to the general public," id., she "has suffered and will continue to suffer direct and indirect injury as a result of . . . Defendant's discrimination until . . . Defendant is compelled to modify its ORS," id. ¶ 17, and that "Plaintiff and all others similarly situated will continue to suffer such discrimination, injury and damage without the immediate relief provided by the ADA," id. ¶ 20; see also id. ¶¶ 18-19, 21, 29 (alleging that "[a]s a result of Defendant's violation of the NYSHRL, Plaintiff suffered frustration, [*9]  humiliation, embarrassment, segregation, exclusion, loss of the equality of opportunity, and has otherwise been damaged").

B. Plaintiff's Proposed Second Amended Complaint
Plaintiff's PSAC largely repeats the allegations contained in her FAC. However, Plaintiff has added several new allegations, including that Plaintiff, "[s]ince 2019, . . . plans to return to the State," PSAC ¶ 7; that she "originally intended to visit [New York] State in the summer of 2020, but now awaits the passing of the Covid travel restrictions," id.; that "Plaintiff has been to the area of Defendant's hotel in the past," id.; that "Defendant's ORS includes websites maintained for the purpose of reserving rooms for its hotel through [third-party travel websites]," id. ¶ 12; that "Defendant directedly or indirectly has contracts with [third-party travel websites] and accepts reservations and transactions made through them," id.; that "Defendant is required to provide [the third parties] with the information they require to comply with [Section 36.302(e)]," id.; that "Defendant failed to provide the third party ORS providers with the information they require to comply with [Section 36.302(e)]," id. ¶ 13; and that "Plaintiff intends [*10]  to revisit Defendant's ORS in order to test it for compliance with 28 C.F.R. Section 36.302(e) and/or to compare its accessible features with those of other hotels for the purpose of arranging her travels and, if this hotel is preferred over others, to utilize the system to reserve a guest room and otherwise avail herself of the goods, services, features, facilities, benefits, advantages, and accommodations of the [p]roperty," id. ¶ 14.

III. Procedural Background
On June 17, 2020, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in this action. ECF No. 1. On September 22, 2020, she filed her FAC. ECF No. 13. On January 8, 2021, Defendant filed a letter requesting a pre-motion conference in anticipation of filing a motion to dismiss the FAC, ECF No. 23, and on January 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed her letter in opposition, ECF No. 25. On February 3, 2021, the Court held a pre-motion conference during which the Court set a briefing schedule on Defendant's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 27.

DISCUSSION

I. Applicable Law

A. Motions to Amend
Motions to amend are generally governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), which provides, inter alia, that "[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). In keeping with Rule 15(a), decisions in this District have explained that, "[u]nless there is a showing of bad faith, undue delay, futility or undue prejudice [*12]  to the non-moving parties, the district court should grant leave to amend." Adlife Mktg. & Commc'ns Co. v. Best Yet Mkt., Inc., No. 17-CV-02978, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163058, 2018 WL 4568801, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2018) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962)); see also McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 200 (2d Cir. 2007) ("A district court has discretion to deny leave for good reason, including futility, bad faith, undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party."). The decision whether to grant leave to amend "rests within the sound discretion of the district court." Adlife Mktg. & Commc'ns Co., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163058, 2018 WL 4568801, at *1 (citing Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Aniero Concrete Co., 404 F.3d 566, 603-04 (2d Cir. 2005)).
A proposed amendment may be unduly prejudicial if new claims would: "(i) require the opponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; (ii) significantly delay the resolution of the dispute or (iii) prevent the plaintiff from bringing a timely action in another jurisdiction." Id. at *3 (quoting Ross Prod. Div. Abbot Labs. Inc. v. Saper, No. 06-CV-03264, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31647, 2007 WL 1288125, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2007)). "Mere delay [posed by a proposed amendment], . . . absent a showing of bad faith or undue prejudice, does not provide a basis for a district court to deny the right to amend." Block v. First Blood Assocs., 988 F.2d 344, 350 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting State Tchrs. Ret. Bd. v. Fluor Corp., 654 F.2d 843, 856 (2d Cir. 1981)). "Nor can complaints of 'the time, effort and money . . . expended in litigating [the] matter,' without more, constitute prejudice sufficient to warrant denial of leave to amend." Pasternack v. Shrader, 863 F.3d 162, 174 (2d Cir. 2017) (alterations in original) (quoting Block, 988 F.2d at 351).
In assessing a movant's delay in seeking to amend, courts must consider "not only the amount [*13]  of time that passed before the movant sought to amend, but also the reasons for that delay and its practical impact on the other side's legitimate interests, including both that party's ability to respond to new claims or defenses and any other prejudice flowing from a delay in the final adjudication of the case." Jean-Baptiste v. United States, No. 10-CV-04094, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107705, 2012 WL 3137458, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2012) (quoting Sly Magazine, LLC v. Weider Publ'ns LLC, 241 F.R.D. 527, 532 (S.D.N.Y. 2007)). "The concepts of delay and undue prejudice are interrelated - the longer the period of unexplained delay, the less will be required of the non moving party in terms of a showing of prejudice." Davidowitz v. Patridge, No. 08-CV-06962, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42322, 2010 WL 1779279, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 23, 2010) (citing Evans v. Syracuse City Sch. Dist., 704 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1983)).
As to futility, "[a]mendment is futile when the proposed amended complaint could not withstand a motion to dismiss, such as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) or for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6)." Griffith-Fenton v. Coldwell Banker Mortg., No. 13-CV-07449, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165624, 2014 WL 6642715, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, 2014); see also, e.g., IBEW Local Union No. 58 Pension Tr. Fund & Annuity Fund v. Royal Bank of Scot. Grp., PLC, 783 F.3d 383, 389 (2d Cir. 2015). The party opposing amendment bears the burden of establishing that amendment would be prejudicial or futile. Jipeng Du v. Wan Sang Chow, No. 18-CV-01692, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134615, 2019 WL 3767536, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2019) (citing Eberle v. Town of Southampton, 985 F. Supp. 2d 344, 347 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)).

B. Standing
Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the resolution of cases and controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. Accordingly, a plaintiff must establish standing to bring suit.
To establish standing, "a plaintiff must show (i) that he suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual [*14]  or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief." TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203, 210 L. Ed. 2d 568 (2021) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992)); see also, e.g., Dhinsa v. Krueger, 917 F.3d 70, 77 (2d Cir. 2019) ("'The irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements': the individual initiating the suit 'must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.'" (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016))). An injury is concrete if it is "real, and not abstract," Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quotation marks omitted), and it is particularized if it "affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way," id. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1).
Relevant here, "the only available remedy under Title III of the ADA is injunctive relief." Vale v. Northwell Health, No. 17-CV-07111, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30593, 2018 WL 1115345, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2018) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1)); see also Powell v. Nat'l Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 364 F.3d 79, 86 (2d Cir. 2004) ("Monetary relief . . . is not available to private individuals under Title III of the ADA."). And, "[i]n the ADA context, [the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has] previously found standing (and therefore an injury in fact) where (1) the plaintiff alleged past injury under the ADA; (2) it was reasonable to infer that the discriminatory treatment would continue; and (3) it was [*15]  reasonable to infer, based on the past frequency of plaintiff's visits and the proximity of defendants' [establishments] to plaintiff's home, that plaintiff intended to return to the subject location." Kreisler v. Second Ave. Diner Corp., 731 F.3d 184, 187-88 (2d Cir. 2013).

II. Granting Plaintiff Leave to File the PSAC Would Be Futile Because the PSAC Fails to Adequately Allege Injury in Fact and, Therefore, Standing
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that considerations of bad faith, undue delay, and undue prejudice do not weigh in favor of denying Plaintiff's Motion. This case is in its relative infancy, discovery was stayed shortly after the parties' pre-motion conference was held, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss briefing was stayed prior to Defendant filing its reply, Defendant can likely reuse in any future motion to dismiss much of the material that it has already prepared, and nothing in the filings before the Court suggests that Plaintiff's Motion was made in bad faith.4
Further, the Court does not find that Plaintiff's late filing should preclude consideration of her Motion, as Defendant suggests. See Def.'s Opp'n at 1 (arguing that Plaintiff's Motion should be denied as untimely because Plaintiff filed the Motion five days after the [*16]  initial filing deadline and one day after the Court ordered Plaintiff to file the Motion "forthwith"). Although the Court does not condone Plaintiff's lateness in filing, the Court, in its discretion, considers Plaintiff's belatedly-filed motion on its merits in light of the relatively short filing delay, the fact that a redline of the PSAC had been filed more than two weeks earlier, ECF No. 35, and the lack of prejudice to Defendant. See, e.g., Fla. Day Cruises, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 03-CV-00071, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15818, 2003 WL 22100691, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2003). The Court does, however, warn Plaintiff that future failures to comply with the Court's directives may lead to the rejection of Plaintiff's filings and/or other potential sanctions.
Notwithstanding the lack of bad faith, undue delay, and undue prejudice, however, amendment - in the form of the PSAC - is not warranted because such amendment cannot withstand a motion made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. More specifically, the PSAC does not sufficiently allege injury in fact. Filing of the PSAC would, therefore, be futile.
Injury-in-fact deficiencies may be raised and addressed by a court sua sponte. See Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco, 433 F.3d 181, 198 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, Defendant does not raise this issue,5 but the Court nevertheless finds that Plaintiff has failed in the PSAC to sufficiently allege injury in fact.
Courts in this Circuit (and others) are divided as to the requirements for adequately alleging injury in fact in cases such as this one. Compare, e.g., Laufer v. Laxmi & Sons, LLC, No. 19-CV-01501, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216752, 2020 WL 6940734 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2020), Harty v. W. Point Realty, Inc., 477 F. Supp. 3d 163 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), appeal docketed, No. 20-2672 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2020), and Laufer v. Mann Hosp., L.L.C., 996 F.3d 269 (5th Cir. 2021), with Laufer v. Ganesha Hosp., LLC, No. 20-CV-00943 (D. Ct. Mar. 25, 2021), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 252197, ECF No. 56, appeal docketed, No. 21-995 (2d Cir. Apr. 20, 2021), and Laufer v. Lily Pond LLC C Series, No. 20-CV-00617, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 244506, 2020 WL 7768011 (W.D. Wisc. Dec. 30, 2020). In another case within this Circuit involving Plaintiff, for example, the court held that Plaintiff had not sufficiently alleged a "past concrete, particularized injury in fact" where she had not alleged that "her visits to [d]efendant's ORS prior to filing her Complaint were motivated (in whole or in part) by her intent to travel to New York," and had not alleged that "she originally went to the ORS with the intent to book a room, or at least to obtain information that would allow her to decide whether to book a room." Laxmi & Sons, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216752, 2020 WL 6940734, at *20; see also id. at *18 ("[A] plaintiff challenging a website's ADA violations must demonstrate that she had a purpose for using the website that the complained-of ADA violations frustrated, such that any injury is concrete and particularized to the plaintiff."). Conversely, in yet another case involving Plaintiff, the court held that [*18]  Plaintiff "need not allege that her visits to [an ORS] are for the purpose of planning a trip." Ganesha Hosp., No. 20-CV-00943, ECF No. 56, at 21.
With cases raising the injury-in-fact issue in this context currently on appeal before the Second Circuit, the divergence within this Circuit may very well be resolved in the not-too-distant future. See W. Point Realty, 477 F. Supp. 3d 163, appeal docketed, No. 20-2672 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2020); Ganesha Hosp., No. 20-CV-00943, appeal docketed, No. 21-995 (2d Cir. Apr. 20, 2021). In the interim, the Court is persuaded by the well-reasoned opinions in Laxmi & Sons, West Point Realty, and Mann Hospitality that visiting a website in a tester capacity is insufficient for standing purposes, and that something more, such as an attempt or intent to book a room or to otherwise make use of the website's information toward that end, must be plausibly alleged. See Mann Hosp., 996 F.3d at 272-73; Laxmi & Sons, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216752, 2020 WL 6940734, at *20; W. Point Realty, 477 F. Supp. 3d at 168; see also Feltzin v. Stone Equities, LLC, No. 16-CV-06457, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22870, 2018 WL 1115135, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2018) ("While it is unclear whether the Second Circuit has fully embraced 'tester' status . . . as a basis for Article III standing, it is clear that an ADA 'tester' must still satisfy the Article III standing prerequisites."), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30540, 2018 WL 1114682 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2018).
Because Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, Plaintiff [*19]  must adequately allege both "past injury" and "a likelihood of future harm," Harty v. Simon Prop. Grp., L.P., 428 F. App'x 69, 71 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983)). Here, Plaintiff has not alleged that she previously - i.e., before commencing this action on June 17, 2020 - visited Defendant's ORS in connection with any attempt to book a hotel room or even to obtain information that would allow her to decide whether to do so. Plaintiff alleges that she "visited the ORS for Defendant's hotel multiple times prior to filing the instant lawsuit," PSAC ¶ 6; and that, "[o]n multiple occasions prior to the commencement of this lawsuit, Plaintiff visited the ORS for the purpose of reviewing and assessing the accessible features at the [p]roperty and ascertain[ing] whether it meets the requirements of 28 C.F.R. Section 36.302(e) and her accessibility needs," id. ¶ 13. Plaintiff separately alleges that, "[s]ince 2019, she plans to return to [New York] State," id. ¶ 7, that "[s]he originally intended to visit the State in the summer of 2020, but now awaits the passing of the Covid travel restrictions," id.; that she intends to travel to "all" of New York State's regions "as soon as the Covid crisis is over," id.; that she has been to the area of Defendant's hotel in the past and would like to visit [*20]  certain sites and attractions near to it, id.; and that she "needs Defendant's hotel ORS to be compliant so that she can compare hotels and ascertain whether or not their features and rooms are accessible to her," id. Although Plaintiff's allegations suggest that future ORS visits will entail Plaintiff availing herself of the hotel's information or services in some respect other than for testing, Plaintiff has not - notwithstanding the inclusion of facts suggesting a desire to travel to New York State since 2019 - alleged sufficient facts linking her past visits to Defendant's ORS to her travel plans.
For example, the PSAC lacks allegations, such as those included in at least some of Plaintiff's other cases, that tie her ORS visits to her travels - e.g., that "prior to the filing of this action, Plaintiff has searched the online reservations systems of hotels throughout the entire state not only to test them for compliance with the regulation set forth at 28 C.F.R. Section 36.[302](e), but also to ascertain what hotels are accessible to her when she finalizes her travel arrangements" and that "[t]he failure of this defendant's . . . hotel[] to provide the information required deprived Plaintiff of the information [*21]  she required in planning her travels before this lawsuit (and any other New York law suit) was filed." Laufer v. Laxmi & Sons, LLC, No. 19-CV-01501, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95534, 2021 WL 1970264, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2021).
Nevertheless, because it might be possible for Plaintiff to cure her pleading deficiency through further (new) amendment, Plaintiff is granted leave to do so.
The Court notes, however, that even if the allegations in a new amended complaint sufficiently plead injury in fact, another issue remains. In light of Plaintiff's many (virtually identical) lawsuits, see Dove Hess Holdings, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 246614, 2020 WL 7974268, at *18 (collecting cases), and the Laxmi & Sons court's evidentiary finding that Plaintiff has barely (if at all) begun planning her New York State-wide trip, see 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117554, 2021 WL 2525153, at *6-9 ("It defies credibility that . . . [Plaintiff] cannot answer the most basic questions regarding how much time she is setting aside for the trip, which specific locations she intends to travel to, how much the trip will cost, how she will fund it, how the inevitably lengthy trip comports with her daughter's professional, educational and child-care obligations, or anything else about the trip aside from her vague desire to travel 'all over' New York State and the rest of the country."), there is reason to doubt the credibility of Plaintiff's allegations regarding her travel intentions [*22]  and, by extension, her use of Defendant's ORS to that end, see Laxmi & Sons, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117554, 2021 WL 2525153, at *9 ("[T]he Court does not credit Plaintiff's allegations that she visited Defendants' ORSs, or intends to do so in the future, for any purpose other than to determine compliance with 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(e).").
In situations such as this, the Second Circuit has instructed district courts that such "doubt[s] should be resolved by the court before proceeding further," including by "conduct[ing] relevant discovery and fact finding." Simon Prop. Grp., 428 F. App'x at 72. Thus, should Plaintiff choose both to file a new amended complaint addressing the above-noted standing deficiency and to include substantially similar allegations as those in the PSAC regarding her plans and use of Defendant's ORS, the credibility of those allegations will thereafter be addressed in an appropriate manner.6

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's motion for leave to file the PSAC, ECF No. 37, but GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file a different amended complaint consistent with this Order.
Any such amendment must be filed by August 10, 2021.
SO ORDERED.
