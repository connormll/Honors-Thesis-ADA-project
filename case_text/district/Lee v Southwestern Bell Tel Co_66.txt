Opinion



ORDER
Before the Court is Defendant Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. #66). The Court, being duly advised of the premises, grants said motion.

BACKGROUND
In 2008, Plaintiff Melissa Jane Lee began working for Defendant Southwestern Bell as a Temporary Service Representative ("TSR") in Springfield, Missouri. As a TSR, Lee worked in the call center and primarily sold and served AT&T products and services. Lee was a member of the Communications Workers of America Union, working under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and knew that attendance was an essential function of her role as a TSR.
In January 2009, Southwestern Bell issued a performance improvement plan ("PIP") to Lee, to expire on April 6, 2009, because her performance scores fell below expectations for two consecutive months. Under Southwestern Bell policy, [*2]  a PIP was not a step of discipline, but the subsequent step, a Performance Notice ("PN") was considered a disciplinary step. At some point, Lee was informed that a PN would be issued on April 6, 2009, for continued performance that did not meet expectations.
On April 6, 2009, Lee left work due to illness. Before she left, Attendance Manager Janene Chaffin gave Lee paperwork so that Lee could seek leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). Leave requests at Southwestern Bell were processed through the Integrated Disability Service Center ("IDSC"), a third-party administrator operated by Sedgwick Claims Management Services.
Lee's stated disabilities include post-traumatic stress disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, anxiety, conversion disorder, and a learning disability. Lee sought short-term disability benefits and FMLA leave in connection with leaving work on April 6, 2009. Lee submitted these requests through IDSC. On May 4, 2009, Lee's claim for short-term disability benefits was denied, and Lee told Chaffin she intended to appeal the denial decision.
By July 2009, Lee had undergone magnetic resonance imaging of her brain and cervical spine, electromyography, [*3]  labs, and x-rays, all of which were unremarkable. On August 5, 2009, a healthcare provider submitted information to IDSC, stating, "Ms. Lee feels that her symptoms are such that she is unable to function and is therefore unable to work. On August 11, 2009, Lee submitted a statement to IDSC stating, "[a]t this time I'm incapable of meeting the duties and responsibilities of my present occupational work as a service representative."
Lee's short-term disability appeal was denied on December 10, 2009. The next day, upon notification of the denial, Chaffin called Lee and directed her to return to work on December 14, 2009. Chaffin told Lee that her failure to return to work on December 14, 2009 could result in termination for insubordination. During this December 11, 2009 phone call, Lee asked Chaffin to reconsider the short-term disability denial. Thereafter, Chaffin sent Lee a letter confirming their conversation, and indicating that Lee should contact IDSC if she had any questions. Lee did not contact IDSC after December 11, 2009.
Lee did not return to work on December 14, 2009, and Chaffin informed her that her employment would be terminated for insubordination. Lee understood that her [*4]  employment with Southwestern Bell was terminated as of December 14, 2009. Thereafter, Chaffin prepared a Separation Proposal that summarized the circumstances leading to Lee's termination, for approval by Southwestern Bell's human resources and legal departments. On December 26, 2009, Lee noted on an EEOC questionnaire that her disability had prevented her from working since April 6, 2009.
While approval of the Separation Proposal was pending, Southwestern Bell discharged eleven TSRs who had failed to meet performance and/or attendance standards. Lee was one of the TSRs discharged, even though the Separation Proposal drafted by Chaffin had not yet been formally approved. Southwestern Bell processed Lee's employment termination on January 27, 2010.
After Lee's termination, she applied, and was approved for, social security disability insurance benefits. The Social Security Administration noted that Lee became disabled on April 6, 2009. Lee applied for long-terms disability benefits in June 2010.

LEGAL STANDARD
A motion for summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Rafos v. Outboard Marine Corp., 1 F.3d 707, 708 (8th Cir. 1993) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). [*5]  In reviewing a summary judgment motion, the Court must scrutinize the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, according to the nonmoving party the benefit of every factual inference and resolving any doubts as to the existence of any material fact against the moving party. See Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970). The moving party bears the burden of presenting sufficient evidence demonstrating there is no genuine issue of material fact for trial and it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323. "A fact is 'material' if it might affect the outcome of the case and a factual dispute is 'genuine' if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party." Die-Cutting Diversified, Inc. v. United Nat'l Ins. Co., 353 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1054-55 (E.D. Mo. 2004) (citation omitted).
"Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon the allegations contained in the pleadings, "but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "Mere allegations, unsupported [*6]  by specific facts or evidence beyond the nonmoving party's own conclusions, are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment." Thomas v. Corwin, 483 F.3d 516, 527 (8th Cir. 2007).

DISCUSSION
Southwestern Bell asserts that there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of Lee's claims against it. Lee alleges discrimination, failure to accommodate, and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq. ("ADA"). Though the Court liberally construes Lee's pro se filings, Lee's pro se status does not excuse non-compliance with substantive and procedural law. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976); Brown v. Frey, 806 F.2d 801, 804 (8th Cir. 1986).

A. Southwestern bell is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Issue of ada Discrimination.
Southwestern Bell argues there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to each of the following elements: (1) Lee had a disability as defined by the ADA; (2) Lee was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) Lee suffered an adverse employment action due to her disability. Samuels v. Kan. City Mo. Sch. Dist., 437 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2006).
For purposes of the summary judgment motion, Southwestern Bell does not dispute that Lee has a disability under the ADA. Further, there [*7]  is no genuine issue of material fact that Lee suffered an adverse employment action since her employment at Southwestern Bell was terminated. Thus, the Court's discussion focuses on whether Lee was qualified to perform the essential functions of her job as a TSR, and whether Lee's discharge was due to her disability.
"In cases where the employee claims that [s]he is able to perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation, the employee must only make facial showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible." Brannon v. Luco Mop Co., 521 F.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir. 2008) (quotations omitted). If the employee makes this facial showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible, "the burden of production shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the employee." Benson v. NW Airlines, Inc., 62 F.3d 1108, 1112 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing Mason v. Frank, 32 F.3d 315, 318-19 (8th Cir. 1994)). "If the employer shows that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job even with reasonable accommodation, the employee must rebut that showing with evidence of his individual capabilities. At that point, the employee's burden merges with his ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that he has suffered unlawful discrimination." Id. (citing Mason, 32 F.3d at 319; Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981)).
Whether an employee is a qualified individual within the meaning [*8]  of the ADA presents a two-part inquiry: (1) whether the individual "possesses the requisite skills, education, certification or experience necessary for the job"; and (2) whether the individual "can, despite impairments, perform the essential functions of the job either with or without a reasonable accommodation." Walz v. Ameriprise Fin., Inc., 779 F.3d 842, 845 (8th Cir. 2015) (citing Browing v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 178 F.3d 1043, 1047-48 (8th Cir. 1999)). Southwestern Bell indicates that, at least for purposes of the summary judgment motion, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Lee had the necessary "skills, education, certification or experience necessary for the job"; thus, whether Lee could perform the essential functions of a TSR despite her impairments is dispositive of whether she was a qualified individual under the ADA.
A job's essential functions are "the fundamental job duties of the employment position." Walz, 779 F.3d at 845. Under the uncontroverted facts, Lee recognized that regular attendance was an essential function of her job as a TSR. Additionally, Lee left work on April 6, 2015 and did not return on December 14, 2015 as directed, nor did she otherwise report to work before her formal discharge in January 2016.
The question remains, however, whether Lee could have performed the essential functions of a TSR [*9]  with reasonable accommodation, such as working pursuant to a reduced schedule and/or a leave of absence. A reasonable accommodation may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modifications of examinations, training materials or policies, the provision of qualified readers or interpreters, and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities." 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9)(B). Lee need only make a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation was possible before the burden shifts to Southwestern Bell to show an inability to accommodate Lee. Fjellestad v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 188 F.3d 944, 951 (8th Cir. 1999) (citing Benson, 62 F.3d at 1112).
"To determine whether an accommodation for the employee is necessary, and if so, what that accommodation might be, it is necessary for the employer and employee to engage in an interactive process." Peyton v. Fred's Stores of Ark, Inc., 561 F.3d 900, 902 (8th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). To show that an employer failed to engage in the required interactive process, the employee should assert evidence relevant to the following factors: (1) the employer's knowledge of the disability; (2) the employee's requests for accommodations or assistance; (3) whether the employer made a good faith [*10]  effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) whether the employer's lack of good faith was a barrier to a reasonable accommodation. Id. (citing Fjellestad, 188 F.3d at 952).
Under the uncontroverted facts, Lee sought short-term disability in connection with her leave of absence which began on April 6, 2009. All disability and accommodations requests were processed through IDSC, a third-party processor, as opposed to Southwestern Bell processing their own internal disability and accommodations requests. With all reasonable inferences drawn in Lee's favor, Southwestern Bell knew about Lee's health condition in May 2009, after IDSC notified Chaffin that Lee's request for short-term disability had been denied. Further, under the uncontroverted facts, when Lee left work on April 6, 2009, Chaffin gave her FMLA paperwork and directed her to the IDSC. A reasonable inference from these facts is that when Lee left work on that date, she told Chaffin that she had ongoing health problems, which Lee argues should be construed as a request for accommodation.
"In general, it is the responsibility of the individual with the disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed." Mole v. Buckhorn Rubber Prods., Inc., 165 F.3d 1212, 1217 (8th Cir. 1999). Lee argues that [*11]  she sought accommodation from Southwestern Bell in the form of a reduced schedule in May 2009 and an additional leave of absence in December 2009, but she failed to use the magic words "reasonable accommodation." In the Court's view, Lee's ADA discrimination claim falls short not because she did not use the magic words, but rather because there is no record evidence, beyond Lee's self-serving statements, that she asked Southwestern Bell to work with her so that she could continue her job as a TSR while she was unwell. Lee was the only person in a position to "identify the need for accommodations specific to her job and workplace" in light of what health issues she was experiencing. Id. at 1218. A sufficient request for accommodation includes identification and discussion about what specific accommodations might be made to allow the individual to continue to perform the essential functions of his or her job. Id. The record does not support that Lee ever made such a request.
Even if, under the uncontroverted facts, Lee could be said to have made a facial showing that she could have performed the essential functions of a TSR with reasonable accommodation, "a request for an indefinite leave of absence [*12]  (regardless of which party had the obligation to request it) is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA." Peyton, 561 F.3d at 903. Additionally, under the uncontroverted facts, there is no evidence to suggest that Southwestern Bell acted in bad faith with regard to Lee's health issues. To the contrary, the record supports that Southwestern Bell encouraged Lee to apply for disability benefits and directed her to IDSC. Finally, especially in light of record evidence suggesting that during the relevant time period Lee represented that she was unable to perform her essential job functions in applications for disability benefits, the Court cannot conclude that Lee could perform the work of a TSR, reasonable accommodation request notwithstanding.
Though this conclusion with respect to the second element of an ADA discrimination claim is dispositive, the Court also considers the third element, whether Lee suffered an adverse employment action that was attributable to her disability. In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination showing a specific causal link between Lee's termination and her disability, Lee's ADA disability claim can survive summary judgment only if she can demonstrate pretext. Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1044 (8th Cir. 2011). A plaintiff [*13]  may establish pretext by demonstrating "both that the employer's articulated reason for the adverse employment action was false and that discrimination was the real reason . . . . Specifically, the plaintiff must do more than simply create a factual dispute as to the issue of pretext; he must offer sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to infer discrimination." McNary v. Schreiber Foods, Inc., 535 F.3d 765, 769 (8th Cir. 2008).
Under the uncontroverted material facts supported by record evidence, Chaffin informed Lee that if she did not return to work on December 14, 2009, Lee's employment would be terminated for insubordination. Lee did not report to work after April 6, 2009, and was on leave while she sought approval of disability benefits through IDSC. When her request for benefits was finally denied, Lee was directed to return to work and did not. Though, with all reasonable factual inferences drawn in Lee's favor, the leave of absence from April 6, 2009 through December 11, 2009, may have been attributable to Lee's health issues, the record does not support that the "articulated reason for the adverse employment action was false and that discrimination was the real reason." Id. To the contrary, the record supports that Lee was directed [*14]  to return to work on December 14, 2009, and failed to do so. Additionally, there is no indication in the record regarding who made the decision to terminate Lee or that anyone at Southwestern Bell ever made any comments to Lee about her health issues or disabilities in general. Consequently, the Court concludes that Southwestern Bell is entitled to summary judgment on Lee's claim of ADA discrimination both on the bases of wrongful termination and failure to accommodate.

B. Southwestern bell is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Issue of ada Retaliation.
Southwestern Bell argues there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to each of the following elements: (1) Lee engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) adverse action was taken against her; and (3) there exists a causal connection between the adverse action and the protected activity. Amir v. St. Louis Univ., 184 F.3d 1017, 1025 (8th Cir. 1999). There is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the second element, since Lee's employment with Southwestern Bell was formally terminated in January 2010.
Lee argues that her prima facie ADA retaliation claim stems from contact with the EEOC and requesting a reasonable accommodation. [*15]  With respect to Lee's contact with the EEOC, the uncontroverted facts establish that Lee contacted the EEOC after her conversation with Chaffin wherein she was informed that her employment would be terminated as of December 14, 2009. "[A]lleged retaliation which precedes protected conduct cannot logically be used to show causation because a prior event cannot be caused by a later event. Stewart v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 196, 481 F.3d 1034, 1044 (8th Cir. 2007). Even if Southwestern Bell formally terminated Lee in January 2010 after she had contacted the EEOC, even with all reasonable inferences drawn in Lee's favor, she knew that her employment was terminated as of December 14, 2009. Consequently, the adverse employment action occurred before Lee's contact with the EEOC, such that this contact cannot support a retaliation claim. Southwestern Bell is entitled to summary judgment to the extent that Lee seeks to establish retaliation relative to her EEOC contact.
With respect to Lee's theory that she was retaliated against for requesting a reasonable accommodation, the Court has concluded that the record does not establish that Lee sought reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of a TSR. Notwithstanding, the Court addresses [*16]  this retaliation theory for discussion's sake, from the perspective that Lee asked for leaves of absences in May 2009, and before December 14, 2009.
With respect to Lee's assertion that she requested a leave of absence in early December 2009 and was notified of her termination on December 14, 2009, temporal proximity, without more, is insufficient. In this case, Southwestern Bell notified Lee that her failure to report to work on December 14, 2009 would result in termination for insubordination and when Lee did not report to work, her employment was terminated. Without other evidentiary bases from which to infer discriminatory motive, temporal proximity alone does not create a genuine issue for trial "where the employer's proffered reason for action is virtually contemporaneous with the protected activity." Hill v. Walker, 737 F.3d 1209, 1219 (8th Cir. 2013) (citing Sprenger v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, 253 F.3d 1106, 1114 (8th Cir. 2001)).
With respect to Lee's assertion that she requested a leave of absence in May 2009, even if the record supported that Lee made this request, and even if this asserted request could be considered a request for reasonable accommodation, Southwestern Bell has demonstrated, by record evidence, a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Lee's employment, and there is [*17]  no evidentiary basis for the conclusion that this reason was pretextual. See Barber v. C1 Truck Driver Training, LLC, 656 F.3d 782, 796 (8th Cir. 2011). Therefore, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and Southwestern Bell is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Lee's claim for ADA retaliation. Accordingly, it is hereby
ORDERED Defendant Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. #66) is GRANTED.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
