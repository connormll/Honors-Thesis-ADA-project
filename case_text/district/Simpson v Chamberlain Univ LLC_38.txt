MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Rachael I. Simpson ("Simpson") brings this action against Chamberlain University LLC ("Chamberlain") and Adtalem Global Education Inc. ("Adtalem"), jointly referred to as "defendants," alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. [Doc.1].1 Defendants move for summary judgment on Simpson's claims, [Doc. 35], which Simpson opposes, [Doc. 76]. Defendants have filed a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 80], and for the reasons that follow, it is RECOMMENDED that defendants' motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], be GRANTED.

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

A. Preliminary Procedural Issues
"In this District, the process for separating disputed from undisputed material facts is governed [*2]  by Local Rule 56.1(B)." Brandon v. Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Sys., 393 F. Supp. 2d 1341, 1347 (N.D. Ga. 2005), adopted at 1346.2 In compliance with Local Rule 56.1(B)(1), defendants, as movants, filed a statement of undisputed material facts, [Doc. 36], to which Simpson has responded, [Doc. 78]. Simpson also submitted her own statement of additional material facts, [Doc. 77], to which defendants have responded, [Doc. 81].3 The Court accepts as undisputed those facts which the parties admit or have failed to properly dispute or deny,4 see [Doc. 78, admitting or failing to properly deny or dispute ¶¶ 1-11, 14-17, 19-69, 71-145, 147-85, 187-252, 254-55, 257-85, 287-310, 312-17, and parts of ¶¶ 13, 18, 70, 146, 253, 256, 286, and 311 of defendants' statement, Doc. 36; Doc. 81, admitting or failing to properly deny or dispute ¶¶ 3-5, 8-11, 13-17, 20-24, 29, 33-35, 37, 39-41, 44-49, 53, 55-56, 59, 61-62, 66, 68-69, 72, 74, 77-78, 81-83, 85-88, 92, 94, 96, 99-102, 113, and parts of ¶¶ 1-2, 6-7, 12, 18-19, 25-28, 30-32, 36, 38, 42, 50-52, 54, 58, 60, 63-65, 67, 70-71, 73, 75-76, 79-80, 84, 91, 93, 95, 98, 104, and 106-09 of Simpson's statement, Doc. 77]. However, the Court has disregarded those facts that are not material, are supported by a citation to a pleading rather than to evidence, or are stated as issues or [*3]  legal conclusions, see LR 56.1(B)(1)-(2), NDGa., and as required on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the following pertinent facts of this case in the light most favorable to Simpson as the non-moving party, Jacomb v. BBVA Compass Bank, 791 F. App'x 120, 121 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970) (citation omitted); Knight v. Baptist Hosp. of Miami, Inc., 330 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (citation omitted).5

B. Statement of Facts

1. Defendants' Relationship
Chamberlain is a for-profit educational institution that operates the Chamberlain School of Nursing, and Adtalem is Chamberlain's parent company. [Doc. 39 (Love Dep.) at 17-18 pp. 16-17; Doc. 42 (Little Dep.) at 14 p. 13; Doc. 60 (Winter Dep.) at 20-21 pp. 19-20]. Adtalem's Coaching Resource Center ("CRC"), which is based in Chicago, Illinois, generally handles Chamberlain's Human Resources functions,6 and Deb Maher ("Maher"), an employee of Adtalem, helped build the CRC in 2014 and became the leader of CRC in 2016. [Doc. 38 at 14 p. 13, 16-17 pp. 15-16, 21 p. 20]. Chamberlain employs three Human Resources consultants that work with CRC as liaisons to the Atlanta campus and interact directly with the employees, and Adam Winter ("Winter") was the Chamberlain consultant who served as the liaison between [*4]  CRC and Chamberlain's leadership at all times relevant in this case. [Id. at 19-21 pp. 18-20, 47-48 pp. 46-47].
When employee issues or concerns arise, Chamberlain leadership personnel reach out to CRC for guidance concerning the personnel matters, as well as regarding employees who indicate that they are sick or may need to take medical leave or need accommodations, and all medical leave and ADA accommodation requests and decisions are handled remotely by CRC in Chicago, with CRC contacting the employee directly to handle any leave or medical disability issues following notification of the issue by Chamberlain personnel. [Id. at 17 p. 16; Doc. 39 at 23-24 pp. 22-23; Doc. 41 (Alexander Dep.) at 49-50 pp. 48-49; Doc. 42 at 49-50 pp. 48-49]. Similarly, all hiring decisions about Chamberlain faculty must ultimately be approved by CRC as the final authority, and CRC alone has authority to terminate Chamberlain employees and is the final decisionmaker for all termination decisions,7 though Chamberlain personnel, including campus President Dr. Shawn Little ("Little"), Dean of Academic Affairs Dr. Gayla Love ("Love"), and Associate Deans of Faculty Drs. Haleh Eskandari ("Eskandari") and Lisa [*5]  Alexander ("Alexander"), may be asked to provide input. [Doc. 38 at 45 p. 44; Doc. 39 at 55-56 pp. 54-55, 147-48 pp. 146-47; Doc. 41 at 114-16 pp. 113-15; Doc. 42 at 77-78 pp. 76-77, 102 p. 101]. CRC uses the SalesForce program for tracking and documentation of all matters referred to CRC. [Doc. 38 at 25-28 pp. 24-27; Doc. 36-11 at 41-45].

2. Simpson's Employment History
In July 2017, Simpson moved from Virginia to Atlanta, and she accepted a job with Herzing University ("Herzing"), a competitor of Chamberlain in the Atlanta nursing education market, on July 24, 2017, and began working at Herzing as a full-time faculty member in an Associate Professor of Nursing position in August 2017. [Doc. 37 (Pl.'s Dep.) at 10 p. 10, 15-16 pp. 15-16, 19-20 pp. 19-20, 39 p. 39; Doc. 36-12 at 2].8 When Simpson began her employment at Herzing, she understood that its nursing program was "in very poor standing with the Board of Nursing," but she was unaware that it was the "lowest ranked college in the state of Georgia and in most of the nation" or that it had issues with its very low NCLEX9 pass rate. [Doc. 37 at 17 p. 17, 20-21 pp. 20-21; Doc. 39 at 116 p. 115; Doc. 36-11 at 20; Doc. 40 (Eskandari Dep.) [*6]  at 93 p. 92]. Herzing was also on probation with the Board of Nursing while Simpson was employed there and was "under heavy scrutiny by the Board of Nursing and the accrediting bodies because of the problems that [they were having] with their program." [Doc. 37 at 20 p. 20; Doc. 40 at 96 p. 95]. Simpson was employed by Herzing from August 7, 2017, through October 30, 2017. [Doc. 36-12 at 2, 4].
While Simpson was still employed as a full-time professor at Herzing, she applied for a leadership position in Chamberlain's Center for Academic Success ("CAS") on September 10, 2017. [Doc. 37 at 28 p. 28, 33-34 pp. 33-34; Doc. 36-12 at 6-9; Doc. 43 (Howell Dep.) at 13 p. 12, 17 p. 16].10 As part of her employment application with Chamberlain, Simpson submitted a resume in which she listed her educational background, work experience, and other background information. [Doc. 36-12 at 11-16]. Simpson, however, did not include Herzing under the "Experience" section on her resume submitted to Chamberlain, nor did she reference Herzing anywhere else on her resume, even though she was employed full-time at Herzing when she applied for employment at Chamberlain. [Id. (emphasis omitted)]; see also [Doc. [*7]  37 at 40 p. 40]. Instead, the most recent employment listed on her resume was from 2015, when she was employed by J. Sergeant Reynolds Community College in Richmond, Virginia, and Herzing was the only employment she omitted from her resume for the period extending from May 1998 through September 2017. [Doc. 36-12 at 12-15]; see also [Doc. 37 at 40 p. 40, 62 p. 62].
In addition, as part of the interview process for employment with Chamberlain, Duane Laramore ("Laramore"), a Talent Acquisition Consultant with Adtalem, who had conducted an initial telephone screening interview of Simpson, instructed Simpson on September 27, 2017, to complete two forms, including a Personal Data Form, and to "be sure to fill out both forms completely and include all levels of education, any licensing and/or certifications along with seven [] years of employment history." [Doc. 36-12 at 6, 8-9]; see also [Doc. 37 at 33-34 pp. 33-34, 63-64 pp. 63-64; Doc. 43 at 16 p. 15]. Simpson completed the Personal Data Form and electronically signed it on September 28, 2017. [Doc. 37 at 64 p. 64; Doc. 38 at 64 p. 63; Doc. 36-12 at 8, 18-27]. In the section entitled, "Professional Experience" on the form, it instructed [*8]  Simpson to "List work history, starting with the most recent, for all positions held in the past seven years. No more than 10 years history recommended. Please note accuracy of dates and addresses is essential." [Doc. 36-12 at 21 (emphasis and all caps omitted)]; see also [Doc. 37 at 69 p. 69; Doc. 38 at 64 p. 63]. Simpson omitted her employment at Herzing when she completed the Personal Data Form, despite the fact she was still a full-time employee there at the time and that the form required her to certify that "all information entered on this personal data intake form and on any other forms or resumes completed by [her] in connection with [her] request to be considered for employment or a contract with Adtalem . . . or its affiliates to be true and correct" and that "any false statements or omissions of information [would] be reason for discharge if [she was] employed and for contract termination if [she was] under contract," which she electronically signed by checking a box. [Doc. 36- 12 at 18-27]; see also [Doc. 37 at 64 p. 64, 67 p. 67, 70-71 pp. 70-71, 73 p. 73].11
Simpson was not hired for the CAS leadership position at Chamberlain, but she was offered an opportunity to apply [*9]  for a faculty position at Chamberlain, which she accepted. [Doc. 38 at 73-74 pp. 72-73; Doc. 39 at 27 p. 26; Doc. 40 at 22 p. 21; Doc. 36-11 at 48; Doc. 36-12 at 7]. She did not submit any new forms in applying for the faculty position, but wanted Chamberlain to consider her resume she had submitted for the CAS position in evaluating her for the faculty position. [Doc. 37 at 180-84 pp. 180-84]. Therefore, the same resume and Personal Data Form Simpson submitted for the CAS position were considered in evaluating her for the faculty position. [Doc. 38 at 77-78 pp. 76-77; Doc. 40 at 24 p. 23].
On October 18, 2017, Simpson had an on-campus interview at Chamberlain with Love, Eskandari, and Dr. Walter Howell, Jr. ("Howell"), another Associate Dean of Faculty. [Doc. 37 at 28-29 pp. 28-29; Doc. 39 at 29 p. 28; Doc. 40 at 22 p. 21, 47 p. 46; Doc. 43 at 2 p. 1, 9-10 pp. 8-9; Doc. 36-12 at 6; Doc. 69-1 at 9]. During this interview, they asked Simpson what she had been doing since she moved to Georgia in July 2017, and Love specifically asked her about the gap in her employment since the last job listed on her resume ended in 2015. [Doc. 37 at 30 p. 30; Doc. 39 at 33-34 pp. 32-33, 117-18 pp. 116-17; [*10]  Doc. 40 at 29-30 pp. 28-29]. Love and Eskandari testified that Simpson responded that she and her family had just moved from Virginia to Georgia and that she was getting her household in order and getting her children settled before seeking employment. [Doc. 39 at 33-36 pp. 32-35, 117-18 pp. 116-17; Doc. 40 at 30 p. 29].
There is a disputed issue of fact as to whether Simpson also mentioned working at Herzing during this interview. [Doc. 37 at 29-30 pp. 29-30, 186 p. 186; Doc. 39 at 36-37 pp. 35-36, 151 p. 150; Doc. 40 at 30-32 pp. 29-31, 96-97 pp. 95-96, 141-42 pp. 140-41, 148-49 pp. 147-48, 156-58 pp. 155-57; Doc. 36-11 at 96]. Simpson testified that when asked if she had worked anywhere else since moving to Georgia, she mentioned "helping out at Herzing," but she admits that she did not disclose during the interview that she was employed full-time as an Associate Professor at Herzing. [Doc. 37 at 30-31 pp. 30-31, 186 p. 186]; see also [Doc. 42 at 95 p. 94; Doc. 69-3 at 20-21]. Simpson was not asked any questions about working at Herzing during her interview, including any questions about why it was not listed on her resume. [Doc. 37 at 30-31 pp. 30-31].
Following her on-campus interview, [*11]  Simpson was offered a full-time Associate Professor position with Chamberlain, with an effective date of November 6, 2017.12 [Id. at 75 p. 75, 93-94 pp. 93-94; Doc. 39 at 54-55 pp. 53-54; Doc. 36-12 at 47-48; Doc. 40 at 21-22 pp. 20-21]. Simpson accepted the offer by signing the offer letter, which advised her that she would be reporting to Eskandari, and she voluntarily resigned from Herzing. [Doc. 37 at 95-96 pp. 95- 96; Doc. 36-12 at 4, 47-48; Doc. 69-3 at 18-19].13

3. Simpson's Employment with Chamberlain
In her Associate Professor position, Simpson was directly supervised by Eskandari, who in turn reported to Love.14 [Doc. 37 at 99 p. 99; Doc. 39 at 15 p. 14, 56 p. 55; Doc. 40 at 10 p. 9, 12-13 pp. 11-12, 37 p. 36; Doc. 41 at 29 p. 28; Doc. 42 at 33 p. 32]. Simpson's job performance was good, and she was nominated by the students for a "Daisy Award," which was "an award that recognize[d] nursing excellence."15 [Doc. 39 at 56 p. 55, 61-62 pp. 60-61 (all caps omitted); Doc. 40 at 36 p. 35, 100 p. 99; Doc. 41 at 40 p. 39; Doc. 42 at 39 p. 38]. Simpson was also selected for a leadership role and was asked to chair the faculty development committee. [Doc. 39 at 69-70 pp. 68-69; [*12]  Doc. 41 at 46-47 pp. 45-46; Doc. 42 at 40-41 pp. 39-40, 109 p. 108].
In early 2018, Simpson began to experience health issues that caused her to periodically miss work. [Doc. 40 at 37-39 pp. 36-38]. During this time, Eskandari communicated with Simpson to inquire how she was feeling, to see what she needed, and to make sure that if she was going to be out for more than three days to provide a medical excuse and clearance to return to work. [Id. at 39 p. 38, 45 p. 44].16 On one occasion when Simpson was out for three days, Eskandari emailed CRC to inquire about what she needed to do for Simpson if she stayed out longer than three days, and CRC sent Eskandari information about leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") in response, which she conveyed to Simpson.17 [Id. at 40-43 pp. 39-42; Doc. 36-11 at 52, 55-63]. While Simpson was having medical issues in early 2018, Eskandari allowed Simpson to work from home as needed and authorized her to leave early on several occasions. [Doc. 40 at 45-46 pp. 44-45]. In March 2018, Simpson was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus, also known as mononucleosis, and she started suffering from additional medical complications, causing her to miss work. [Doc. 37 at 115-16 pp. [*13]  115-16; Doc. 40 at 55-56 pp. 54-55; Doc. 36-11 at 65; Doc. 36-12 at 113-19]. That same month, Simpson informed Eskandari that she was not feeling well, and she advised Simpson to contact CRC since it handled medical leave and ADA accommodation issues for Chamberlain. [Doc. 37 at 117 p. 117].
On March 22, 2018, Jocelyn Green ("Green"), one of Adtalem's Human Resources Colleague Relations Specialists, sent Simpson a letter, advising her about the interactive process for requesting an ADA accommodation and providing her with a Request for an Accommodation Form, as well as other paperwork, to be completed and returned by April 6, 2018, if she wanted to request an accommodation. [Doc. 36-12 at 86-95]; see also [Doc. 37 at 116-17 pp. 116-17]. Simpson, however, did not request any accommodation at this time, and on April 10, 2018, Green sent her a follow-up letter, indicating that CRC had not received any paperwork regarding her accommodation request. [Doc. 37 at 117-19 pp. 117 19; Doc. 36-12 at 97-99]. In response, Simpson emailed Green later that day and indicated that she "believe[d] that [she was] over the worst of this disease process and [felt her] strength beginning to return, so at [*14]  this time [she did not] think [she would] need to pursue any further accommodation assistance." [Doc. 36-12 at 101 02; Doc. 61-1 at 74]; see also [Doc. 37 at 120 p. 120]. However, Simpson's condition worsened, resulting in her visiting the emergency room a few days later. [Doc. 37 at 121-22 pp. 121-22].
On April 12, 2018, Simpson texted Eskandari from the emergency room, and on the following day, Eskandari emailed her "to check in with [her] to see how [she was] doing" and "to follow up with [her] regarding the FMLA and see where [she was] in that process, as [she had not] received anything from [Human Resources]," and she then told Simpson to "[p]lease rest and take good care of [her]self" and to "let [her] know if there [was] anything [she could] do [] for [her]." [Doc. 36-12 at 104; Doc. 37 at 122-23 pp. 122-23; Doc. 40 at 76 p. 75]. On April 16, 2018, Eskandari reached out to CRC on Simpson's behalf "to make sure she had all the right information, to make sure that if there was anything that she needed to follow up on with [Human Resources] as far as days, taking days off, anything that she needed, that she had the right information." [Doc. 40 at 72 p. 71]; see also [Doc. 36-11 [*15]  at 67-68].
On April 18, 2018, Simpson texted Eskandari to inform her that she had to return to the emergency room that morning due to a number of medical issues related to her mononucleosis, to which Eskandari responded that she was "so sorry to hear that," to "take care of [her]self," that she hoped she was "resting and not working," to "make sure to put [her] time in Replicon for the rest of the week," that they were "taking care of [her] courses, so no worries there," and to keep her posted on how she was doing. [Doc. 36-12 at 106-08]; see also [Doc. 37 at 125-26 pp. 125-26]. Simpson replied that she "couldn't work right now if [she] tried," and Eskandari texted, "No problem []. Feel better." [Doc. 36-12 at 108].18
On April 19, 2018, Simpson emailed Green and explained that after she thought she "was over the worst of [her illness], [her] body freaked out and [she was] now having issues with [her] spleen because of the [m]ono[nucleosis]" and wanted to know if they could "start [the] process again so that [she could] have some kind of coverage while [she was] out." [Doc. 61-1 at 78]. Green responded to Simpson that day that she had "opened a leave of absence with Liberty Mutual [*16]  on [her] behalf" and that she would "be sending over the documentation for a request for accommodation" to be completed. [Doc. 61-2 at 2].
On May 4, 2018, Eskandari texted Simpson to reach out and see how she was doing, at which time Simpson provided an update on her condition. [Doc. 37 at 132-33 pp. 132-33; Doc. 36-12 at 113-15]. Eskandari informed her that the faculty had been asking about her and inquired whether there was anything they could do for her, and Simpson responded that making dinner each night was difficult due to her pain and her husband's work schedule, to which Eskandari replied that she would "share [that] with the faculty, and [she was] sure [they could] help out." [Doc. 36-12 at 114-15]. On May 7, 2018, Green followed up with Simpson after CRC had not yet received her paperwork for an accommodation under the ADA, [Doc. 61-2 at 5], and on May 22, 2018, she sent another follow-up letter after having a May 15, 2018, phone conversation with Simpson, advising her that CRC still had not received her updated paperwork, [id. at 7].
On May 29, 2018, CRC received updated documentation regarding Simpson's medical issues, including that she and her physician were requesting [*17]  that Simpson remain on leave for an additional eight-week period. [Doc. 36-11 at 75]; see also [Doc. 40 at 77-78 pp. 76-77]. On the following day, Eskandari again checked in with Simpson to see how she was doing after she had not heard from her in a while, and on this same day, Green contacted Eskandari to discuss Simpson's needs and the eight-week extended leave she was requesting. [Doc. 36-11 at 72, 75; Doc. 36-12 at 116-19]. Eskandari indicated that she was "comfortable with approving time," [Doc. 36-11 at 72], and Green sent Simpson a letter that day, stating, in relevant part:
This letter is in follow up to the letter sent to you dated May 22, 2018 regarding your possible needs for a reasonable accommodation under the [ADA].
On May 29, 2018, through the interactive process, in your current role as an Associate Professor-UGD, you and your physician requested that you remain on leave for an additional eight [] weeks beginning May 29, 2018.
We have reviewed your request and have approved a leave of absence for eight [] weeks as a reasonable accommodation. Based on the documentation submitted, we are expecting you to return to work on July 24, 2018. If you are unable to return to work [*18]  as of this date, it is our expectation that you reach out to [] Green to determine if you are still in need of an accommodation.
We also may check with you to see whether the granted accommodation continues to be reasonable (for both you and the institution) under the circumstances. Should it no longer be reasonable, then we will reengage in an interactive discussion to determine whether an alternate accommodation, if any, exists. Any additional accommodation will require an additional request and review.
[Doc. 36-12 at 121-22; Doc. 61-2 at 10]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 90-91; Doc. 37 at 134 35 pp. 134-35; Doc. 40 at 79 p. 78].
The Associate Deans of Faculty handled scheduling and staffing to ensure all of Simpson's classes, labs, and clinicals were covered, and the other faculty member who was co-teaching the same course with Simpson took over the course. [Doc. 39 at 86 p. 85; Doc. 40 at 47-48 pp. 46-47]. Eskandari and Alexander did not have any concerns about filling Simpson's class assignments, and neither Love nor Little recalled any issues with her leave or covering her classes. [Doc. 39 at 75 p. 74, 88 p. 87; Doc. 40 at 51-52 pp. 50-51; Doc. 41 at 43 p. 42, 59 p. 58; Doc. 42 at 45-46 [*19]  pp. 44-45]. Eskandari testified that the faculty members who helped cover Simpson's work at the end of the February to April 2018 term were "happy to help." [Doc. 40 at 62-63 pp. 61-62].19

4. Chamberlain's Discovery of Simpson's Employment with Herzing
In June 2018, while Simpson was out on approved medical leave, Chamberlain discovered that Simpson had worked for Herzing prior to her employment with Chamberlain but had not disclosed that employment on her resume or other documentation included in her faculty file. [Doc. 39 at 92-99 pp. 91-98, 101 p. 100, 103-04 pp. 102-03, 127 p. 126; Doc. 40 at 80-83 pp. 79-82, 87-89 pp. 86-88; Doc. 44 at 14-15 pp. 13-14, 17-18 pp. 16-17, 20 p. 19, 24 p. 23; Doc. 36-11 at 22, 36-37]. The record is a bit unclear as to how Chamberlain first learned of Simpson's prior employment with Herzing. Love testified that she first learned of Simpson's employment with Herzing about a week prior to June 15, 2018, when she was "bragging about [Chamberlain's] staff" at a local 5k race to a colleague in the nursing education industry who had worked at Herzing and mentioned that Chamberlain had "recently hired someone who . . . [she] was very excited about" and named [*20]  Simpson at which time the unidentified colleague said, "Oh, I think she worked at Herzing." [Doc. 39 at 92-101 pp. 91-100]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 22; Doc. 69-1 at 6]. Eskandari, on the other hand, recalled that around the same time, Taimeica Bell-Trimble ("Bell-Trimble"), the Academic Executive Assistant for the deans and the campus president, approached her and asked if she knew that Simpson had previously worked at Herzing as she learned from her cousin who worked at Herzing that Simpson had been employed there,20 but as she was conducting her routine quarterly review of the faculty files, she noticed that Simpson's employment at Herzing was not listed on any of the documentation included within her faculty file. [Doc. 39 at 26 p. 25; Doc. 40 at 80-83 pp. 79-82; Doc. 44 at 8 p. 7, 14-15 pp. 13-14, 17-18 pp. 16-17]. Therefore, Bell-Trimble had a discussion with Eskandari about Simpson's prior employment at Herzing and the missing information,21 and she also had a separate conversation with Love,22 but neither Eskandari nor Love were aware of Simpson's prior employment with Herzing or recalled Simpson mentioning it during her interview.23 [Doc. 40 at 80-82 pp. 79-81, 87-89 pp. 86-88; Doc. [*21]  44 at 17 p. 16, 20 p. 19].
On June 15, 2018, Love sent an email to Winter, Chamberlain's Human Resources consultant serving as the liaison to CRC, seeking guidance and stating, in relevant part:
I have a colleague concern that I need to talk with you about. I am getting ready for another call right now but I would like to speak with you today if possible. Just a heads up[-]the colleague did not disclose in her interview or on her resume[] that she worked at one of the local colleges. There were issues there and since she has been with us she has been out more than here since the beginning. She is currently on FMLA/LOA at least until August. I need your thoughts.
[Doc. 36-11 at 20; Doc. 64-2 at 31]; see also [Doc. 36 at 3 ¶ 8 (citation omitted); Doc. 39 at 77-78 pp. 76-77, 103 p. 102, 106 p. 105; Doc. 78 ¶ 8].24 After he spoke with Love, Winter contacted the CRC that same day and relayed the information to Maher, explaining in pertinent part:
There is a faculty member that was hired this past November in Atlanta. She had a significant gap of time on her resume that showed no employment. [] Love, the [Dean of Academic Affairs], specifically asked about that gap of time and the candidate [*22]  basically said she had moved, spen[t] time with family, etc, but did not disclose having worked with another college. [Love] didn't question it any further and figured she had just wanted to spend time with kids and such. []
[I]n the small world of nursing, [Love] heard from someone outside of Chamberlain that this faculty member had in fact worked at another college, but it did not go so well. She and the administration there did not see eye to eye on things and there were some problems. Apparently she thought she was "above" doing certain basic things that the teaching job required. Since she has been at Chamberlain, most of her time has been away on a LOA, but when she has interacted with peers, there have been issues. So [Love] reached out to me and asked if there was any recourse based on the new info[rmation] that was brought forth by a 3rd party. I reached out to [Green] to get more info[rmation] about the situation and told her what I had heard, which led her to ask you about it.
That is about all I know about the situation. I know she is currently on a LOA through July, but this Atlanta team is wondering, "What then?" Do they address the concerns, or is there something they [*23]  can do before she returns? Or should they stay the course and wait out the LOA.
[Doc. 36-11 at 22]; see also [Doc. 38 at 21 p. 20; Doc. 39 at 118-19 pp. 117-18].
Because Simpson's failure to accurately disclose her employment history violated several policies, including the Code of Conduct and the Chamberlain College of Nursing Faculty Handbook, as well as the instructions and certifications on the forms she had completed and submitted online, Maher believed that the matter was "an incredibly straight-forward termination,"25 and she communicated with Winter at some time prior to 11:23 a.m. on June 19, 2018, that Simpson's employment with Herzing should be confirmed and to ask Simpson her side of the story, but that if there were "no surprises and she did omit it," she was to be "terminate[d] for falsification of application." [Doc. 38 at 23-24 pp. 22-23, 29-30 pp. 28-29, 32 p. 31, 49 p. 48, 85-86 pp. 84-85, 91-92 pp. 90-91; Doc. 36-11 at 44].26

5. Simpson's Request to Return to Work Early with an Accommodation & her Subsequent Termination
Although Simpson's ADA-approved leave was not scheduled to end until July 24, 2018, she sent a text to Eskandari on June [*24]  21, 2018, indicating she wanted to return to work at the start of the school term on July 9, 2018, but that she would "most likely still need a day a week to work from home which it would be best if it [could] be Wednesday so [she would not] have more than two days in a row." [Doc. 36-12 at 124-26]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 32-34; Doc. 37 at 135 p. 135, 139-43 pp. 139-43, 175 p. 175; Doc. 40 at 108-09 pp. 107-08]. In response, Eskandari wrote:
I am glad that nothing major is wrong. My understanding from [Human Resources] is that your medical leave is set until the end of July per your [doctor's] recommendation. Please reach out to [Human Resources] to see what you need to do to change that. Thank you for keeping me informed.
[Doc. 36-12 at 125]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 33-34; Doc. 37 at 141-42 pp. 141-42, 175-78 pp. 175-78; Doc. 40 at 109 p. 108]. Simpson replied that she would reach out to Human Resources, but that she "just wanted to be sure that you guys [were] willing to work with easing me back into things until my full strength returns," to which Eskandari wrote, "Obviously, you will need a medical release with any restrictions needed, so [Human Resources] will let us know of what [*25]  needs to be done going forward." [Doc. 36-12 at 125-26]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 32-34].
On June 28, 2018, Love emailed Winter to follow-up regarding Simpson's previous employment, writing:
I followed up on [] Simpson's previous employment. [She] was employed full time by Herzing [] here in Atlanta from 8/8/17 through 10/30/17. Their records indicate she resigned and is eligible for rehire. She did not disclose this on her application or during the interview with [Eskandari] and me. We both asked her about her break in employment that showed on her resume[] and she stated she was not currently and had not worked since she moved to Atlanta from Virginia. I have talked with [Little] and I do want to move forward with termination. Please advise.
Another lesson learned for me in this hiring process was the red flag from the assessment. It clearly said "not recommended" ....ugh!
[Doc. 36-11 at 24, 36, 40]; see also [Doc. 39 at 103-04 pp. 102-03, 123-27 pp. 122-26]. Later that day, Winter responded to Love's email, stating:
How did you end up with this information? Did you get it from [Talent Acquisition] and do they have a background check they could send me? Or, did you call the school and [*26]  get the info? If you have any written proof, could you send it to me? I spoke with [Maher] and she would like something in writing if we have it. I know I told you that you could call the school as well and that is fine. I may just want to reach out to [Talent Acquisition] to see what came up in the background check as well... just so we have actual written proof before we let her go.
[Doc. 36-11 at 36, 39]; see also [Doc. 39 at 127 p. 126; Doc. 45 at 7 ¶ 15, 16-18]. Love replied that she had "called the school and spoke with their [Human Resources] department." [Doc. 36-11 at 39]; see also [Doc. 39 at 128 p. 127].
On the same day, Winter forwarded Love's email to Maher, showing that she had verbally confirmed Simpson's prior employment with Herzing, and informed her that he had also retrieved Simpson's background check, but that it did not show her Herzing employment. [Doc. 45 at 7 ¶¶ 14-15]; see also [id. at 16-18]. Maher responded to Winter later that day and copied Jennifer Reynolds ("Reynolds"), an employee in Adtalem's Talent Acquisition department, on the email, explaining that the "original verification on the background check would not show that [] Simpson was employed at Herzing [*27]  [] if she failed to list Herzing as one of her employers on her Personal Data Form," and she then requested that Reynolds obtain "formal employment verification" of Simpson's Herzing employment and that Winter should then terminate Simpson after the verification was obtained. [Id. at 7-8 ¶ 16]; see also [id. at 16-17]. Reynolds replied about an hour later explaining that if Herzing was not listed on Simpson's resume or Personal Data Form, the background check vendor they used at that time would not be authorized to obtain a formal verification from that employer, and Maher responded that Reynolds could "call and confirm it for [her], in addition to what [Love was] telling [them.]" [Id. at 16-17]; see also [id. at 8 ¶¶ 17-18].27
On June 29, 2018, Simpson reached out to Green at CRC and submitted paperwork from her doctor and a request for an accommodation. [Doc. 37 at 143 p. 143; Doc. 36-12 at 128].28 On July 3, 2018, Green mailed Simpson a letter, stating, in relevant part:
On June 29, 2018, through the interactive process, in your current role as an Associate Professor-UGD, you and your physician requested that you be able to work remotely, up to two [] days per week, for [*28]  three [] months.
We have reviewed your request and have approved you to be able to work remotely for one [] day per week beginning July 9, 2018. We also may check with you to see whether the granted accommodation continues to be reasonable (for both you and the institution) under the circumstances. Should it no longer be reasonable, then we will reengage in an interactive discussion to determine whether an alternate accommodation, if any, exists. Any additional accommodation will require an additional request and review.
[Doc. 36-12 at 128; Doc. 61-1 at 20]; see also [Doc. 37 at 143-45 pp. 143-45; Doc. 59 (Green Dep.) at 54-55 pp. 53-54].29
By the time Simpson had requested and was approved to return early from her medical leave of absence, the teaching assignments for the July 2018 term had already been finalized as the new eight-week term was scheduled to begin on July 9, 2018.30 [Doc. 39 at 89 p. 88; Doc. 40 at 110 p. 109; Doc. 41 at 66 p. 65, 71 p. 70; Doc. 42 at 80 p. 79, 87 p. 86]. Simpson sent Eskandari a text message on July 5, 2018, asking if she had any time that day or the following to discuss "plans for [her] coming back to work on Monday," and Eskandari responded the [*29]  next day that because she was not sure if she was "going to be able to come back earlier than [the] end of July," she did not "have a plan so to speak" but that they would meet on Monday and "figure it out." [Doc. 36-12 at 130-31]; see also [Doc. 37 at 146-47 pp. 146-47, 178 p. 178].
On the morning of July 9, 2018, Simpson returned to work, and Eskandari met with her briefly to let her know that she and Alexander wanted to meet with her later to discuss her schedule for the July 2018 school term. [Doc. 37 at 131-32 pp. 131-32, 145 p. 145; Doc. 40 at 123-24 pp. 122-23; Doc. 41 at 78 p. 77].31 During their meeting later that morning, which took place in Alexander's office, Alexander and Eskandari informed Simpson that she would not be teaching a course that term since the faculty assignments had been completed prior to her return, which Simpson accepted without objection, and instead, she would be helping with the simulation center and clinicals, as well as other coverage where needed.32 [Doc. 37 at 149-51 pp. 149-51; Doc. 40 at 124-25 pp. 123-24; Doc. 41 at 81 p. 80]. In particular, Alexander told Simpson that her role in the simulation center would require her to be physically present on [*30]  campus five days per week, from 6:45-7:00 a.m. to 2:30-3:00p.m. [Doc. 37 at 149-51 pp. 149-51, 153 p. 153; Doc. 41 at 82-83 pp. 81-82, 88 p. 87, 95 p. 94; Doc. 56-1 at 13]. Simpson responded that she would have to check with her husband as the earlier start time was problematic with her childcare duties and then she also raised the issue of her approved ADA accommodation of working remotely one day per week. [Doc. 37 at 151-54 pp. 151-54; Doc. 40 at 129 p. 128; Doc. 41 at 83-84 pp. 82-83, 90 p. 89]. Simpson testified that at this point, Alexander "became very upset, said what do you mean you have an accommodation, what accommodation" and "walked out of the room in an angry fashion." [Doc. 37 at 152 p. 152, 154-55 pp. 154-55]. Alexander and Eskandari dispute Simpson's account of Alexander's behavior during this meeting, [Doc. 40 at 129-30 pp. 128-29; Doc. 41 at 90-93 pp. 89-92; Doc. 56-1 at 13], but in any event, Simpson admits that at the end of the meeting, Eskandari confirmed that her ADA accommodation of working remotely one day per week had been approved and that it was "no big deal," [Doc. 37 at 152-53 pp. 152-53].
Later that day, Winter emailed Maher to inform her that [*31]  Simpson had returned to work and to ask whether they should "proceed with termination" or whether they were "still waiting on [Reynolds] to do an employment check[.]" [Doc. 45 at 16]; see also [id. at 9 ¶ 20]. Maher immediately reached out to Reynolds to inquire if she ever verified Simpson's Herzing employment, to which Reynolds responded, "shoot no." [Id. at 21]; see also [id. at 8 ¶ 19, 9 ¶¶ 21-22]. Maher asked if it could be done that day, and a few hours later, Reynolds informed Maher that she was able to verify Simpson's prior employment with Herzing, including the dates, her position, and status. [Id. at 21-22, 25]; see also [id. at 9-10 ¶ 23; Doc. 38 at 43 p. 42]. Maher then emailed Winter that Simpson's "employment at Herzing ha[d] been verified" and she instructed him that either he or one of Simpson's managers should "tell her that this came to [their] attention and [they] did an employment verification and [they were] separating her for falsifying her employment application."33 [Doc. 45 at 15]; see also [id. at 10 ¶ 24]. Later that afternoon, Winter communicated with Eskandari and advised her that Simpson's prior employment with Herzing had been verified and that Simpson [*32]  should be terminated the following day. [Doc. 40 at 112-13 pp. 111-12, 134-35 pp. 133-34; Doc. 41 at 100 p. 99, 109 p. 108; Doc. 36-11 at 17-18]. Eskandari then reached out to Little and Alexander to advise them that CRC had authorized Simpson's termination for the following day. [Doc. 36-11 at 17-18; Doc. 40 at 137 p. 136; Doc. 41 at 109-11 pp. 108-10].34
On the morning of July 10, 2018, Eskandari called Simpson to her office where she and Little were waiting, and following her arrival, Little informed her that her employment was being terminated because she had omitted Herzing from her resume. [Doc. 37 at 158-59 pp. 158-59; Doc. 40 at 138-40 pp. 137-39; Doc. 42 at 11 p. 10, 88-89 pp. 87-88, 104 p. 103; Doc. 60 at 60-62 pp. 59-61; Doc. 69-2 at 7]. Simpson responded that she mentioned "helping out at Herzing" during her interview and that she did not list it on her resume because she believed that she did not need to include a job on her resume if she was employed there for less than six months. [Doc. 37 at 40-43 pp. 40-43, 49-50 pp. 49-50, 56-57 pp. 56-57, Doc. 40 at 141 p. 140, 159 p. 159; Doc. 42 at 91 p. 90, 94-95 pp. 93-94; Doc. 56-1 at 14; Doc. 58-1 at 1-6; Doc. 69-3 at 19-20].35 [*33]  Little and Eskandari advised Simpson that CRC had made the termination decision and they then provided her with Human Resources' contact information and told her "that she could reach out to them and provide them any information that she needed to provide if she felt like it was not an appropriate termination," and she was then escorted from the building. [Doc. 37 at 160-61 pp. 160-61, 189 p. 189; Doc. 42 at 100-01 pp. 99-100].36
Simpson filed a charge of discrimination against defendants in October 2018, alleging disability discrimination and retaliation, [Doc. 1-1 at 2-5], and a notice of right to sue letter was issued upon her request on March 8, 2019, [Doc. 1- 2 at 2-6]. Simpson filed this action against defendants on March 20, 2019, asserting violations of the ADA, [Doc. 1], and defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], which Simpson opposes, [Doc. 76]. Defendants have filed a reply in support of their motion, [Doc. 80], and the pending motion, [Doc. 35], is now ripe for ruling.37

II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court views all evidence in the light most favorable to and draws all reasonable inferences in the favor [*34]  of the non-moving party. Gray v. City of Jacksonville, 492 F. App'x 1, 3 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted). "Summary judgment shall be granted if the movant[s] show[] that there is 'no genuine issue as to any material fact', such that the movant[s] [are] entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Jerome v. Barcelo Crestline, Inc., 507 F. App'x 861, 863 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)); see also Mathews v. Wells Fargo, 758 F. App'x 842, 843 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Holmes v. Ga. ex rel. Strickland, 503 F. App'x 870, 872 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted); Young v. FedEx Express, 432 F. App'x 915, 916 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted).
The parties moving for summary judgment bear the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material facts, upon which the non-moving party must then submit specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986); Premier Assocs., Inc. v. EXL Polymers, Inc., No. 1:08-cv-3490-WSD, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71982, 2010 WL 2838497, at *8 (N.D. Ga. July 19, 2010), aff'd in part, 507 F. App'x 831 (11th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (citations omitted). "[A] party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon mere allegation[s] or denials of [her] pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."

App'x 895, 897 (11th Cir. 2011) (per [*35]  curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "Although [the Court] view[s] all the evidence and draw[s] all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, [i]f the non-moving party fail[s] to make a showing on an essential element of [her] case with respect to which [s]he ha[s] the burden of proof, then the entry of judgment as a matter of law is appropriate." Lowe v. Exel, Inc., 758 F. App'x 863, 865 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (fourth, fifth, and eighth alterations in original) (citations and internal marks omitted).
"Speculation or conjecture cannot create a genuine issue of material fact." Shuler, 441 F. App'x at 715 (citation omitted); see also Howard v. Or. Television, Inc., 276 F. App'x 940, 941 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); Goodman v. Ga. Sw., 147 F. App'x 888, 891 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted) ("[A]ll reasonable inferences arising from the undisputed facts should be made in favor of the nonmovant, but an inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable."). "Moreover, the non-moving party cannot create a genuine issue through evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'not significantly probative.'" Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., 446 F. App'x 179, 181 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted); see also Hall v. Dekalb Cty. Gov't, 503 F. App'x 781, 786 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted) ("[M]ere conclusions, unsupported factual allegations, and [*36]  statements that are based on belief, as opposed to personal knowledge, are insufficient to overcome a summary judgment motion."). Indeed, "[t]o overcome a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must present more than a scintilla of evidence supporting [her] position-rather, there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party." Siddiqui v. NetJets Aviation, Inc., 773 F. App'x 562, 563 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also James v. City of Montgomery, 823 F.

LEXIS 71982, 2010 WL 2838497, at *9 (first alteration in original) (citation and internal marks omitted); see also Ellison v. St. Joseph's/Candler Health Sys., Inc., 775 F. App'x 634, 643 (11th Cir. 2019) (unpublished) (citation omitted).

III. DISCUSSION
Simpson alleges claims of discrimination and retaliation in violation of [*37]  the ADA. [Doc. 1]. In particular, Simpson claims that defendants terminated her employment because of her disability and in retaliation for engaging in statutorily protected activity as evinced by "their frustration over her medical problems, her need for an extensive period of medical leave, and her continued need for an accommodation upon returning to work." [Doc. 76 at 19]. Defendants argue that Simpson "cannot establish a material dispute of fact . . . for either her discrimination or retaliation claims" because "the undisputed evidence demonstrates that [she] was not denied a reasonable accommodation for her disability;[38 ] and [she] did not suffer any adverse employment action either because of her disability, or because she requested and received an ADA accommodation." [Doc. 35-1 at 21-22 (footnote omitted)]. Defendants also argue that even if Simpson could establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation under the ADA, they had a legitimate, non-discriminatory and non- retaliatory reason for the employment action at issue. [Id. at 26-30]. Simpson opposes defendants' motion, see [Doc. 76], arguing that "[t]he record contains conflicting and disputed evidence regarding [*38]  [d]efendants' motivation for terminating [her] employment," [id. at 2], as well as "direct evidence of overt hostility by [d]efendants' leadership team toward [her] need for an accommodation," [id.], and the reason proffered for her termination "is the subject of direct factual disputes and is riddled with factual inconsistencies, even among [d]efendants' own witnesses," [id.]. The Court will address the parties' arguments.

A. Direct Evidence
Simpson asserts that the "record contains direct evidence of overt hostility by [d]efendants' leadership team toward [her] need for an accommodation under the [ADA]—just one day prior to her termination—and concern regarding her need for medical leave due to her disability." [Doc. 76 at 2 (emphasis omitted)]. "This argument is conclusory and [Simpson] leaves it undeveloped," Squires v. Astrue, No. 8:07-CV-180-T-EAJ, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8404, 2008 WL 341345, at *2 n.3 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 5, 2008), as it appears only in the introductory [*41]  paragraph of her response to defendants' motion and without any citation to evidence or case law to support her assertion, [Doc. 76 at 2]. The Court need "not address issues that are legally and factually undeveloped, as it is incumbent on [Simpson] (through [her] designated attorney) to establish [her] arguments with specificity, not in a conclusory manner." Squires, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8404, 2008 WL 341345, at *2 n.3; see also McGowan v. AME Fin. Corp., Civil Action No. 1:08-CV-896-BBM-LTW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138263, 2009 WL 10666307, at *18 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 18, 2009), adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150718, 2010 WL 11507154, at *1 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 5, 2010) (citations omitted) ("This Court is not under an obligation to develop Defendants' summary judgment argument for them and declines to undertake one."); Ogletree v. City of Auburn, 619 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1165 n.9 (M.D. Ala. 2009) ("Because Plaintiffs' argument is undeveloped, it will not be considered."). Nevertheless, the Court will briefly address Simpson's assertion, as the Court finds that she has not presented any direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation. See Jefferson v. Sewon Am., Inc., 891 F.3d 911, 923 (11th Cir. 2018).
The Eleventh Circuit narrowly defines "direct evidence," see Shedrick v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Miami-Dade Coll., 941 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1367 (S.D. Fla. 2013), as evidence that "'if believed, proves the existence of a fact without inference or presumption,'" Holland v. Gee, 677 F.3d 1047, 1055 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1086). "Evidence that only suggests discrimination [or retaliation], or that is subject to more than one interpretation, does not constitute direct evidence." Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., 120 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted). "'[O]nly the most blatant remarks, whose intent could [*42]  be nothing other than to discriminate [or retaliate]' satisfy this definition." Mathis v. Wachovia Bank, 255 F. App'x 425, 429 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "[D]irect evidence relates to actions or statements of an employer reflecting a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee." Cappetta v. N. Fulton Eye Ctr., CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:15-CV-3412-LMM-JSA, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 214906, 2017 WL 5197207, at *7 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2017), adopted by 2017 U.S. Dist.

"For a statement to constitute direct evidence, it must be made by a person involved in the challenged decision," and "the statement[] must directly relate in time and subject to the adverse employment action at issue." Obester, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144161, 2010 WL 8292401, at *38 (citations and internal marks omitted).
The evidence on which Simpson relies does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation. Simpson points to Love's June 15, 2018, email to Winter seeking guidance from Human Resources after she discovered that Simpson was employed by Herzing and had omitted her employment from her resume and other documentation, in which Love also referenced that since Simpson had been employed with Chamberlain, she had "been out [*43]  more than here" and was "currently on FMLA/LOA at least until August," [Doc. 36-11 at 20; Doc. 64-2 at 31], in an effort to show that "Chamberlain's leadership was frustrated and concerned by [her] need for medical leave," [Doc. 76 at 20 (footnote and citations omitted)]. Simpson also relies on Alexander's "open hostility toward [her] need for an accommodation" just one day prior to her termination as direct evidence of discrimination and retaliation in this case. [Id. (footnote omitted)].
The Court has considered the evidence on which Simpson relies, but "remarks by non-decisionmakers or remarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of discrimination." Standard, 161 F.3d at 1330 (citation omitted); see also Hyde v. K.B. Home, Inc., 355 F. App'x 266, 272 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). The evidence does not show that either Love or Anderson was a decisionmaker regarding the termination of Simpson's employment with Chamberlain, see Hyde, 355 F. App'x at 272 (citation omitted) ("Statements made by a non-decision maker are not probative of discriminatory intent as direct evidence."), and the statements cited by Simpson require inferences to be drawn to reach the conclusion that they are probative of discrimination as she asserts, see [*44]  Mwawasi v. Sam's Club E., Inc., CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:07-CV-1717-CC/AJB, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128370, 2008 WL 11333413, at *6 (N.D. Ga. Dec. 18, 2008), adopted by 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138054, 2009 WL 10671147, at *1 (N.D. Ga.

Dist., No. 5:04CV124 (DF), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37878, 2005 WL 3560659, at *5 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 28, 2005) (finding certain statements offered by plaintiff were not direct evidence because it could not be "established without inference or presumption that the sentiments embodied in the statements actually motivated or influenced the decisionmaker responsible for recommending [plaintiff] for [the position]"); Dalmau v. Vicao Aerea Rio-Grandense, S.A., 337 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1306 (S.D. Fla. 2004).
While Chamberlain leadership may provide input into the employment decisions made by CRC, the undisputed admissible evidence in this case shows that when Love discovered that Simpson's employment at Herzing was omitted from her resume and documentation, she contacted Winter in Human Resources about what should be done. [Doc. 36-11 at 20; Doc. 38 at 45 p. 44; Doc. 39 at 55-56 pp. 54-55, 77-78 pp. 76-77, 103 p. 102, 106 p. 105, 147-48 pp. 146-47; Doc. 40 at 90-91 pp. 89-90, 101-02 pp. 100-01; Doc. 41 at 114-16 pp. 113-15; Doc. 42 at 78 p. 77; Doc. 64-2 at 31]. Winter then relayed the information from Love to Maher at CRC, explaining the omission of Simpson's employment with Herzing from her resume, while also mentioning that [*45]  she had issues at Herzing and had been away on a leave of absence most of her time at Chamberlain, but she also had experienced some issues with peers at Chamberlain when she was present. [Doc. 36-11 at 22; Doc. 38 at 21 p. 20; Doc. 39 at 118-19 pp. 117-18]. Maher subsequently informed Winter on June 19, 2018, that Simpson's employment with Herzing should be confirmed, and if there were no surprises and she omitted it from her resume, she was to be terminated for falsification of application in accordance with policy. [Doc. 36-11 at 20, 22, 44; Doc. 38 at 21-24 pp. 20-23, 29-30 pp. 28-29, 32 p. 31, 49 p. 48, 85-86 pp. 84-85, 91-92 pp. 90-91; Doc. 39 at 77-78 pp. 76-77, 103 p. 102, 106 p. 105, 118 p. 117; Doc. 45 at 10-11 ¶ 26; Doc. 64-2 at 31]. Love followed up with Winter on June 28, 2018, to inform him that she had confirmed that Simpson was employed by Herzing from August 8, 2017, through October 30, 2017, and that this information was unknown to her and not disclosed on Simpson's application or resume. [Doc. 36-11 at 24, 36, 40; Doc. 39 at 103-04 pp. 102-03, 123-26 pp. 122-25]. Love stated that she wanted to move forward with termination but asked Winter to "[p]lease advise," and [*46]  he then relayed that information to Maher, who requested that Reynolds obtain formal employment verification and instructed Winter to terminate Simpson once her employment at Herzing was verified. [Doc. 36-11 at 24, 36, 39-40; Doc. 39 at 103-04 pp. 102-03, 123-24 pp. 122-23, 127-28 pp. 126-27; Doc. 45 at 7-8 ¶¶ 14-18]. Following an update that CRC was working on obtaining formal verification of Simpson's employment at Herzing, Love acknowledged that she would just have to wait and "see what they do" and that Simpson would probably be back at work before CRC made a formal decision. [Doc. 36-11 at 94; Doc. 40 at 113 p. 112, 117 p. 116]. By the time that verification of Simpson's employment at Herzing was obtained, Love was out on a leave of absence herself, and she was not involved in the July 9 and July 10, 2018, events that culminated in Maher's authorization for Winter or Simpson's manager to terminate her employment. [Doc. 36-11 at 94; Doc. 39 at 80 p. 79, 82-83 pp. 81-82, 130 p. 129, 139-44 pp. 138-43; Doc. 40 at 117 p. 116, 138-40 pp. 137-39; Doc. 45 at 9-10 ¶¶ 20-24].39
Alexander had no input in Maher's decision to terminate Simpson's employment, and when asked about her role, Maher [*47]  indicated that she was not even aware of Alexander.40 [Doc. 38 at 89 p. 88]. In fact, Maher testified that no one influenced her decision that Simpson should be terminated and that she was the sole decisionmaker as to whether Simpson should be terminated. [Id. at 22-23 pp. 21-22, 27 p. 26, 46-47 pp. 45-46, 51-52 pp. 50-51, 80 p. 79, 89 p. 88]. Thus, the evidence Simpson cites does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination or retaliation. See Chambers v. Walt Disney World Co., 132 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1367 (M.D. Fla. 2001) (finding statements were not direct evidence where the individuals were not involved in the termination decision and the statements did not correlate to plaintiff's termination).41 Accordingly, the Court will evaluate Simpson's ADA discrimination and retaliation claims based on circumstantial evidence.

B. Simpson's ADA Discrimination Claim
Simpson asserts that the defendants discriminated against her based on her disability when they terminated her employment. [Doc. 1 ¶ 38]. Defendants move for summary judgment as to Simpson's ADA disability discrimination claim, arguing that Simpson cannot establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge based on her disability and that, even if she [*48]  could do so, they have offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for their action, which Simpson has failed to show is pretext for unlawful disability discrimination. [Doc. 35-1 at 21-30].

1. Prima Facie Case
In order to succeed on her claim under the ADA, Simpson must show that: "(1) [s]he is disabled; (2) [s]he was a qualified individual at the relevant time, meaning [s]he could perform the essential functions of the job in question with or without reasonable accommodations; and (3) [s]he was discriminated against [or suffered an adverse employment action] because of [her] disability."42 Puckett v. Bd. of Trs. of First Baptist Church of Gainesville, Inc., 17 F. Supp. 3d 1339, 1342 (N.D. Ga. 2014) (internal marks omitted) (quoting Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001)); see also Powrzanas v. Jones Util. & Contracting Co., 834 Fed. Appx. 500, 2020 WL 6375108, at *3 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citations omitted). Defendants do not dispute that Simpson was disabled and that she was a qualified individual at the relevant time, thereby satisfying the first and second elements of her prima facie case of disability discrimination. [Doc. 35-1 at 21-22]. However, defendants contend that Simpson "cannot establish a material dispute of fact over the third required element" and that she was terminated due to her own conduct and not as a result of her disability. [Id.].
"The prima facie case, however, need not be discussed where, as here, the issues are intertwined with the question of pretext, and for the reasons stated hereinafter, the Court finds that [Simpson] has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext."

Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted) ("[W]hen considering a motion for summary judgment in an employment discrimination case, a district court need not consider whether a plaintiff has actually satisfied the elements of a prima facie case if the defendant has offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions.").

2. Legitimate, Non-Discriminatory Reason & Pretext
Accepting that Simpson could establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, defendants are still entitled to summary judgment because she has failed to show that the reason proffered by defendants concerning the challenged employment action was pretextual. Defendants argue that Simpson's disability discrimination claim fails because the decision to terminate her employment was based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. [Doc. 35-1 at 26-28]. In particular, defendants assert that Simpson was terminated because she omitted her employment at Herzing from her resume and other documentation, in violation of the policies and procedures set forth in the Chamberlain College of Nursing Faculty Handbook, and despite being advised to include her seven-year employment history, [*51]  beginning with the most recent, and certifying that the same was true and correct, and that she understood that any false statements or omissions would be reason for discharge, which defendants did not discover until June 2018 while she was out on leave. [Id. at 27]; see also [Doc. 36-11 at 22, 36-37; Doc. 36-12 at 6, 8-9, 11-16, 18-27, 29-45, 49, 54, 81-84; Doc. 37 at 113 p. 113; Doc. 39 at 92-99 pp. 91-98, 101 p. 100, 103-04 pp. 102-03, 127 p. 126; Doc. 40 at 80-83 pp. 79-82, 87-89 pp. 86-88; Doc. 44 at 14-15 pp. 13-14, 17-18 pp. 16-17, 20 p. 19, 24 p. 23]. Because this reason constitutes a "'clear and reasonably specific'" non-discriminatory explanation for defendants' decision to terminate Simpson, defendants have discharged their burden of production, see Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763, 770 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted); see also Walker v. Neighborhood Ctrs., Inc., CASE NO. 4:15-CV-2890, 2017 U.S. Dist.

Mar. 8, 2017) (citations omitted) (finding plaintiff's failure to disclose her previous employment on her resume and job application was a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for dismissal in an ADA case), and the burden shifts back to Simpson to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason provided by defendants is a pretext for a prohibited, discriminatory motive, see Edmond v.

To demonstrate pretext, Simpson's evidence must reveal "'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies or contradictions in [the defendants'] proffered legitimate reason[] for [their] action[] that a reasonable factfinder could find [it] unworthy of credence.'" Maples v. UHS of Ga., Inc., 716 F. Supp. 2d 1266, 1274 (N.D. Ga. 2010) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)); see also Vaughn v. FedEx Freight, Inc., 824 F. App'x 797, 803 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). Simpson may prove pretext by "either proving that intentional discrimination motivated the [defendants] or producing sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to disbelieve the legitimate reason proffered by the [defendants], which permits, but does not compel, the trier of fact to find illegal discrimination." Wilson, 376 F.3d at 1088 (citations omitted); see also Gillman v. OkaLoosa Cty. Fla., 58 F. Supp. 3d 1305, 1311 (N.D. Fla. 2014) (citation omitted). Simpson may thus create an issue of fact at the pretext stage by (1) presenting evidence that defendants' proffered reason is not worthy of belief, or (2) presenting evidence that discrimination was, in fact, defendants' real reason. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 146-47, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407 (1993).
"Pretext means more than a mistake on the part of the employer; pretext means a lie, specifically a phony reason for some action." Tolley v. United Parcel Serv., No. Civ.A.1:05CV606TWT, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10877, 2006 WL 486523, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2006) (citation and internal marks omitted). [*53]  "Thus, the inquiry is limited to whether [the defendants] offered an honest, non[-]discriminatory explanation for [the adverse action], regardless of whether the decision might have been mistaken." Id. (citations omitted). "Ultimately, [Simpson] must meet [the defendants'] stated reason 'head on and rebut it, and [she] cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of the reason.'" Young, 432 F. App'x at 917 (citation omitted). Simpson "cannot establish pretext by simply demonstrating facts that suggest [discriminatory] animus, but must specifically respond to . . . [the defendants'] explanation[] and rebut [it]." Burgos-Stefanelli v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 410 F. App'x 243, 247 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "If [Simpson] fails to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether [the defendants'] articulated reason[] for the adverse employment action [is] pretextual, then [the defendants are] entitled to summary judgment on the [discrimination] claim." Johnson v. Advertiser Co., 778 F. Supp. 2d 1270, 1277 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Combs, 106 F.3d at 1528). Finally, despite this burden-shifting framework, the "ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the [defendants] intentionally discriminated against [Simpson] remains at all times with [Simpson]." Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253 (citations omitted).
In an effort to prove pretext, Simpson, [*54]  who admits that she did not include Herzing on her resume or in the other documents she completed as part of her application and faculty file, argues that defendants manufactured an excuse to terminate her while she was out on medical leave as evinced by the fact that she disclosed that she was "helping out at Herzing" during her on-campus interview and defendants' stories about how they first learned of her employment at Herzing in June of 2018 are inconsistent. [Doc. 76 at 21, 24 (citations omitted)]; see also [Doc. 37 at 30-31 pp. 30-31, 186 p. 186; Doc. 39 at 92-101 pp. 91-100; Doc. 40 at 80 83 pp. 79-82, 87-91 pp. 86-90, 101-02 pp. 100-01; Doc. 44 at 14-15 pp. 13-14, 17-18 pp. 16-17, 20 p. 19; Doc. 56-1 at 14-16]. However, Simpson's arguments are unavailing.
First, it is undisputed that Simpson never disclosed that she was employed as a full-time associate professor at Herzing, but accepting as true that she mentioned "helping out at Herzing" during her interview, the fact that she did so made no material difference to Maher who testified that it was insignificant to her whether Simpson mentioned Herzing during her interview because her employment at Herzing had not been disclosed [*55]  on her resume and other documentation that Maher had reviewed, and this was a misrepresentation upon which Simpson was advanced in the hiring process. [Doc. 38 at 36-41 pp. 35-40, 50-53 pp. 49-52, 55 p. 54, 60 p. 59, 76-77 pp. 75-76].43 Indeed, Maher testified that there had been several cases in the past five years where CRC had discovered that either a job applicant or employee had misrepresented or omitted material information from their resume or other job application documents and that in all of those cases, the applicant's job offer was rescinded or the employee's employment was terminated by CRC. [Doc. 45 at 10-11 ¶¶ 26-27]; see also [id. at 33-35].
Moreover, while the record is unclear about the circumstances surrounding how it was first discovered by Chamberlain that Simpson had been employed by Herzing, it is undisputed that it was decided that Love would handle the matter and seek guidance from CRC concerning the issue of the omitted information, which was exactly what she did. [Doc. 39 at 77-78 pp. 76-77, 103 p. 102; Doc. 40 at 90-91 pp. 89-90, 101-02 pp. 100-01; Doc. 36-11 at 20, 22]. Once the matter was brought to Maher's attention at CRC, she independently [*56]  verified that Simpson had been employed by Herzing, but that this employment was omitted from Simpson's resume and other documentation on file, and it is undisputed that Maher testified that she alone made the decision to terminate Simpson once the official verification of her employment at Herzing was obtained and that no one at Chamberlain asked her to terminate Simpson, but she instructed them to do so. [Doc. 38 at 36-37 pp. 35-36, 46 p. 45, 49-50 pp. 48-49, 53 p. 52; Doc. 45 at 8 ¶ 19, 9-10 ¶¶ 21-24].44 Therefore, "the inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence that [Simpson] identifies do not relate to the decision to terminate her employment," but rather, "they primarily concern . . . when [and how Chamberlain] officials learned of [Simpson's prior employment at Herzing]"; "[h]owever, none of [defendants'] witnesses provided contradictory or shifting reasons for [Simpson's] termination," and "[t]o show pretext, [Simpson] must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reason[] for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find [it] unworthy of credence." Williams v. Hous. Auth. of Savannah, Inc., 834 Fed. Appx. 482, 2020 WL 6335946, at *6 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) [*57]  (citation and internal marks omitted). Thus, "even resolving these factual disputes in [Simpson's] favor, the evidence does not suggest pretext in [defendants'] proffered reason for [her] termination." Id. Simpson "has not pointed to any evidence to show that [Maher's] . . . beliefs regarding the allegations against [Simpson] were not honestly held." Oliver v. TECO Energy, Inc., No. 8:12-cv-2117-T-33TBM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180372, 2013 WL 6836421, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 26, 2013) (citations omitted); see also Feise v. N. Broward Hosp. Dist., 683 F. App'x 746, 753 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished).
Simpson also asserts that "the issue of temporal proximity alone — termination within one day after [she] returned from medical leave and one day after a member of Chamberlain's leadership team directly expressed overt hostility toward [her] need for a continued accommodation — is more than enough to get past summary judgment." [Doc. 76 at 22 (citation omitted)]. However, while "temporal proximity can sometimes be sufficient to establish a causal link, temporal proximity alone is insufficient evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment." Archard v. Potter, Civil Action No. 08-0746-CG-N, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46827, 2010 WL 1926747, at *10 (S.D. Ala. May 12, 2010) (citations omitted); see also Matias v. Sears Home Improvement Prods., Inc., 391 F. App'x 782, 787 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted) (citing Hurlbert v. St. Mary's Health Care Sys., Inc., 439 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir. 2006)). Thus, "[s]ummary judgment is proper where the defendant[s] offer[ a] legitimate reason[] and the employee only offers temporal [*58]  proximity." Archard, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46827, 2010 WL 1926747, at *10 (citing Wascura, 257 F.3d at 1247). While Simpson relies on the "close temporal proximity," [Doc. 76 at 22-23], "this fact is not dispositive of pretext" and "does not undercut [defendants'] stated reason[] for the termination," Corning v. LodgeNet Interactive Corp., 896 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1154 (M.D. Fla. 2012) (citation omitted). Moreover, "the mere fact that [Simpson] was on 'protected leave' when [the] . . . misconduct [was discovered] does not mean that terminating [her] for the misconduct [was] discrimination," and Simpson "points to no evidence [that defendants would have terminated her] simply because [she] was on 'protected leave' or because of [her] disability had [she] not purportedly engaged in that misconduct." Henry v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. 1:18-cv-005907-MLB-LTW, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145133, 2020 WL 4550936, at *18 (N.D. Ga. May 20, 2020), adopted by 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 208571, 2020 WL 6482986, at *10 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 1, 2020) (emphasis and citations omitted).45
In sum, Simpson has produced insufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that defendants' reason for terminating her was pretext for disability discrimination. See Dantzler v. Ga. Ports Auth., CV417-062, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 219030, 2018 WL 7291377, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Nov. 29, 2018), adopted by 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4897, 2019 WL 157729, at *2 (S.D. Ga. Jan. 10, 2019) (finding plaintiff did not show that defendant's asserted reason for her termination was a pretext for discrimination because of her disability). "The Court will not second-guess [defendants'] assessment[] and ultimate decision; [the Court is] not interested in whether the conclusion is a correct one, but [*59]  whether it is an honest one." Scott, 38 F. Supp. 3d at 1364 (second and third alterations in original) (citation and internal marks omitted). Simpson has therefore failed to show that the decision to terminate her employment was pretextual. See Gaddis v. Russell Corp., 242 F. Supp. 2d 1123, 1148-49 (M.D. Ala. 2003), aff'd, 88 F. App'x 385 (11th Cir. 2003) (unpublished) (citation omitted). "In light of the fact that [Simpson] has failed to rebut [defendants'] legitimate non[-]discriminatory reason[] for [terminating her employment], the Court finds that [Simpson] has not demonstrated that [defendants'] reason[] w[as] pretextual," and "[s]ummary judgment is, therefore, appropriate as to [Simpson's] [discrimination claim]." McNorton v. Ga. Dep't of Transp., 619 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1380-81 (N.D. Ga. 2007); see also Snowden v. City of Daphne, 283 F. App'x 693, 696 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (unpublished). Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Simpson's disability discrimination claim under the ADA be GRANTED.

C. Simpson's ADA Retaliation Claim
Simpson asserts that she "engaged in statutorily protected activity by . . . requesting a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities" and that defendants "terminat[ed] her employment[] because she engaged in statutorily protected activity under the [ADA]." [Doc. 1 ¶¶ 47-48]. Defendants also move for summary judgment on this claim, arguing that Simpson has failed to establish [*60]  a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA and cannot show that their proffered reason is pretext for unlawful retaliation. [Doc. 35-1 at 21-30].
"To state a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, [Simpson] must show that (1) [s]he engaged in statutorily protected conduct; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action." Upton v. Day & Zimmerman NPS, Civil Action Number 2:15-cv-02131-AKK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7758, 2018 WL 465979, at *6 (N.D. Ala. Jan. 18, 2018) (citing Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 231 F.3d 791, 798 (11th Cir. 2000)); see also McConico v. City of Tampa, 823 F. App'x 763, 768 (11th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citation omitted). And, "disability retaliation claims require a plaintiff to meet the heightened 'but-for' causation standard." Leone v. All. Foods, Inc., No. 8:14-cv-800-T-27TBM, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107224, 2015 WL 4879406, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 14, 2015) (citations omitted) (citing Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 360, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013)).
Defendants do not dispute the first and second elements, but instead argue that Simpson cannot establish causality because she has failed to show that Maher "was aware of [her] protected activity when she made the termination decision [since she] decided to terminate [her] employment before the protected expression at issue took place." [Doc. 35-1 at 25 (emphasis omitted)]. In particular, defendants point out that Maher made the decision that Simpson should be terminated on June 19, 2018, pending verification of her employment from Herzing, at which [*61]  time Simpson was still out on approved leave through July 24, 2018, and Simpson did not initiate discussions to return to work early with accommodations from that approved leave until June 21, 2018, and it was therefore "impossible for [] Maher to have had knowledge of protected activity that [Simpson] had not engaged in when [] Maher decided to terminate her employment[.]" [Id. at 25-26 (emphasis and citations omitted)]. Thus, defendants contend that Simpson "cannot show the causal connection necessary to establish her prima facie case." [Id. at 26 (footnote and citation omitted)]. The Court agrees.
The evidence shows that the allegedly retaliatory act about which Simpson complains, i.e., the decision to terminate her employment, was made before she engaged in any discussions about returning to work early with an accommodation of working remotely up to two days per week. [Doc. 38 at 22-24 pp. 21-23, 29-30 pp. 28-29, 32 p. 31, 49 p. 48, 85-86 pp. 84-85, 91-92 pp. 90-91; Doc. 36-11 at 32-34, 44; Doc. 36-12 at 124-26; Doc. 45 at 4-5 ¶ 10, 6-7 ¶ 13]. "It is only logical that a plaintiff's protected activity must take place before the alleged retaliatory actions; otherwise, the plaintiff [*62]  cannot demonstrate a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation." Perkins v. Lynch, 169 F. Supp. 3d 1246, 1252 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (citation omitted); see also Cheatham v. DeKalb Cty., 682 F. App'x 881, 887 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (unpublished) (finding plaintiff failed to establish the third element of a prima facie case of retaliation-causal link--because the "alleged adverse employment actions . . . all occurred before [the] statutorily-protected activities were undertaken"); Rollins v. Ala. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 814 F. Supp. 2d 1250, 1313 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (citing Schechter v. Ga. State Univ., 341 F. App'x 560, 563 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished)) (finding "no causal connection where adverse employment action occurred before protected activity").
Simpson argues that there is "conflicting record evidence as to whether the decision to terminate [her] employment . . . was made before [she] [] requested the accommodation of working remotely on certain days," pointing to an exhibit showing that CRC did not clear Chamberlain to terminate Simpson until July 9, 2018, after Maher received the employment verification. [Doc. 76 at 25 (second alteration in original) (emphasis, citations, and internal marks omitted)]. However, this argument fails because, contrary to Simpson's assertion, the undisputed evidence shows that the decision to terminate Simpson was made by Maher prior to her engaging in protected activity, [*63]  and the mere fact that the decision to terminate her was not carried out until after she engaged in protected activity is simply not probative of retaliatory intent in this case. See Clark Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 272, 121 S. Ct. 1508, 149 L. Ed. 2d 509 (2001) ("Employers need not suspend previously planned [adverse employment actions] upon discovering [protected activity], and their proceeding along lines previously contemplated, though not yet definitively determined, is no evidence whatever of causality."); McMullen v. Tuskegee Univ., 184 F. Supp. 3d 1316, 1321-22 (M.D. Ala. 2016) (citation and internal marks omitted) (explaining that "[w]hen an employer makes a tentative decision before protected activity occurs, the fact that an employer proceeds with such a decision is not evidence of causation" and finding that "even if the decision to terminate [plaintiff] was not finalized at the time [she] filed her complaint, a belief that following through with that decision was retaliation [was] not . . . objectively reasonable" and that summary judgment was therefore due to be granted on her retaliation claim); Morales v. Ga. Dep't of Human Res., Civil Action No. 7:08-CV-156 (HL), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118154, 2010 WL 4639279, at *13 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 8, 2010), aff'd, 446 F. App'x at 179 (finding memorandum of concern and written reprimand not done in retaliation for plaintiff's filing of an EEOC charge because those actions were contemplated prior to plaintiff filing the charge); Burleson v. Colbert Cty.-N. Ala. Healthcare Auth., 221 F. Supp. 2d 1265, 1278 (N.D. Ala. 2002) (concluding that [*64]  plaintiff failed to show pretext for retaliation where decision to terminate him was made prior to protected activity).
Even assuming Simpson had established a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, for the reasons discussed with regard to Simpson's disability discrimination claim, the Court agrees with defendants that Simpson's retaliation claim fails because she has not shown that their proffered legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for her termination is a pretext for retaliation. Defendants assert that they terminated Simpson because they discovered that she had been employed at Herzing, but that she omitted this employment from her resume and other documentation completed prior to and during her employment. [Doc. 35-1 at 27]. As previously discussed, this reason constitutes a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Simpson's termination, thereby satisfying defendants' "exceedingly light" burden and shifting the onus to Simpson to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendants' reason is pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct. See Vessels, 408 F.3d at 770 (citation omitted); Gray, 492 F. App'x at 5 (citations omitted). To establish pretext, Simpson "must present concrete evidence in the form of specific facts [*65]  which show [defendants'] proffered reason is mere pretext." Smith v. Harvey, 421 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (S.D. Ala. 2006) (citation and internal marks omitted). Again, Simpson must meet defendants' reason "head on and rebut it." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000) (footnote and citation omitted).
The only argument Simpson makes to show that defendants retaliated against her because of her protected activity is that the decision to terminate her employment occurred one day after she returned from medical leave and after Alexander "expressed overt hostility toward [her] need for a continued accommodation[.]"46 [Doc. 76 at 22]. As previously explained, "[a]lthough temporal proximity can sometimes be sufficient to establish a causal link, temporal proximity alone is insufficient evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment." Archard, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46827, 2010 WL 1926747, at *10 (citations omitted). And, while Simpson argues that she has provided additional evidence along with temporal proximity, including that defendants offered inconsistent stories regarding how they first discovered her work at Herzing, that they were already aware of her employment at Herzing from her on-campus job interview, and the fact that they did not conduct an investigation by asking her for her side of the story, [Doc. 76 at 23-24], the Court has already [*66]  addressed these arguments and found them to be unpersuasive.
Because Simpson attempts to show pretext with respect to her retaliation claim in the same manner she did with respect to her disability discrimination claim, "[f]or the same reasons that this Court rejected her attempts to establish pretext for th[at] claim[], the Court finds that she has failed to introduce any evidence from which a jury could infer pretext for her retaliation claim." Philson v. Hosp. Auth. of Houston Cty., Civil Action No. 5:08-CV-155 (HL), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69810, 2009 WL 2477255, at *15 (M.D. Ga. Aug. 10, 2009); see also Anderson v. Dunbar Armored, Inc., 678 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1315-16 (N.D. Ga. 2009), adopted at 1290. In sum, Simpson has failed to "produce[] any evidence, outside of [her] own conclusory say-so, that would support an inference of [retaliation] from the circumstances," and the Eleventh Circuit has "repeatedly and emphatically held [that] employers may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law." Flowers v. Troup Cty., Ga., Sch. Dist., 803 F.3d 1327, 1337-38 (11th Cir. 2015) (citation and internal marks omitted). "Because [Simpson] has the burden of persuasion . . ., it is [her] responsibility to advance sufficient evidence of [retaliation] to create a triable factual dispute," id. at 1338, but she has failed to do so. Accordingly, it is RECOMMENDED that defendants' motion for summary judgment on Simpson's retaliation claim under the ADA be GRANTED.47

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that defendants' motion for summary judgment, [Doc. 35], be GRANTED in its entirety.
The Clerk is DIRECTED to terminate this referral.
IT IS SO RECOMMENDED and DIRECTED this 30th day of November, 2020.
