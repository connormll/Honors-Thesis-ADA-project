CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL

Proceedings (In Chambers): ORDER RE: DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [33]
Before the Court is Defendant United Parcel Service, Inc.'s ("UPS") Motion for Summary Judgment (the "Motion"), filed on May 10, 2021. (Docket No. 33). Plaintiff Richard Smith filed an opposition on May 17, 2021. (Docket No. 34). UPS filed a reply on May 24, 2021. (Docket No. 35).
The Court has read and considered the papers filed in connection with the Motion and held a telephonic hearing on June 7, 2021, pursuant to the General Order 21-07 arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the reasons stated below, the Court rules as follows:
• The Motion is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's claim for failure to engage in the interactive process. Defendant provides undisputed evidence that Defendant sent Plaintiff numerous [*2]  letters seeking medical certification for the purpose of providing a reasonable accommodation.
• The Motion is GRANTED with respect to Plaintiff's punitive damages claim. Plaintiff has failed to identify any managing agent of UPS that ratified Plaintiff's termination.
• The Motion is DENIED as to all of Smith's remaining claims. Plaintiff has established that genuine disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment on each of his remaining claims.

I. BACKGROUND
The following facts are based on the evidence, as viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) (acknowledging that on a motion for summary judgment, "[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [the non-movant's] favor."). The Court notes any relevant putative disputes below.

A. Position Details
Smith began work for UPS on December 8, 2003, as a Part-Time Preload Sorter. (Defendant's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("DSUF") ¶ 14 (Docket No. 33-3)). At the time of Smith's termination from employment on October 21, 2017, Smith the position of Part-Time Preload Sorter. (Id. ¶ 16). Smith does not dispute that his prior position was Part-Time Preload Sorter [*3]  but clarifies that, at the time of his termination, Smith was on medical leave. (Plaintiff's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts ("PSUF") ¶ 16 (Docket No. 34-1)). The Preload Sorter position is classified by the U.S. Department of Labor ("DOL") as requiring "very heavy" physical demand. (Id. ¶ 20).

B. Injury and Treatment
On April 11, 2014, Smith injured his right arm at work when he struck his right elbow on a work cart. (DSUF ¶ 26); (PSUF ¶ 26). Smith sought treatment and was given significant medical restrictions. (DSUF ¶ 27). Immediately after the injury, UPS accommodated Smith by assigning him to Temporary Alternative Work ("TAW") at the same rate of pay. (Id. ¶ 28). On May 1, 2014, Smith filed a claim for workers' compensation related to his arm injury, and on June 20, 2014, was placed on temporary total disability. (Id. ¶ 29).
Smith received extensive treatment, including surgery on his elbow in April 2015. (Id. ¶ 30). Smith did not return to work during the pendency of his workers' compensation claim. (Id. ¶ 31).
In July 2016, Smith's medical provider concluded that, due to Smith's right elbow pain, Smith was "unable to return to his pre-injury occupational duties" and restricted [*4]  Smith from lifting over thirty pounds using his right arm. (Id. ¶¶ 32-33). Smith was also restricted at that time from "repetitive pushing or pulling, forceful gripping, grasping, forcing using the right upper extremity." (Id. ¶ 34).
On August 12, 2016, Smith's medical provider indicated that Smith was restricted from lifting over twenty-five pounds due to his elbow injury. (Id. ¶ 35).

C. Correspondence Regarding Accommodations
On August 25, 2016, UPS sent Smith a letter advising him that UPS "received notification that you have some activity restrictions that may prevent you from performing the essential functions of your position at UPS." (Id. ¶ 36). The letter further provided as follows:
In evaluating your options at this time, please keep in mind that UPS offers job-related accommodations for persons who are disabled within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). If you believe that you have an ADA-covered disability and are interested in requesting an ADA accommodation at this time, which may include an accommodation in your current position or a reassignment to another position, please contact me at 1-855-UPS-HRSC (1-855-877-4772) to obtain the necessary paperwork.
(Id. ¶ 37). Smith testified that [*5]  he never saw this letter. (PSUF ¶ 36).
In September 2016, Smith contacted UPS and requested an accommodation. (DSUF ¶ 39). Smith never submitted medical documentation to support that request. (Id. ¶ 40).
On October 4, 2016, UPS sent Smith a letter (the "October 16, 2016 Letter") confirming that "on 09/30/2016, we received notification that you requested a job-related accommodation because of a medical condition." (Id. ¶ 41). The Letter explained:
In order to assess your request adequately, we need additional medical information regarding your reported condition and the way in which it impacts your ability to work at UPS. Accordingly, enclosed is a Request for Medical Information form to be completed by your physician and an Authorization for Release of Health Information form to be signed by you.
(Id. ¶ 42). UPS asked for specific information regarding restrictions on the Request for Medical Information form. (Id. ¶ 43). The October 4, 2016 Letter provided an address to which Smith and/or his medical provider should send the requested documentation. (Id. ¶ 44). The Letter further stated:
Because we cannot continue our assessment of your request until we have received the completed medical [*6]  forms, it is to your benefit to return this information as quickly as possible, preferably within the next two weeks. If you fail to return the forms within four weeks of the date of this letter without authorization from me, UPS will consider you to have withdrawn your request. If you believe that you are completely unable to perform in your current position due to medical reasons now or at any time during our evaluation, please contact the HRSC for information concerning your eligibility for medical leave and benefits.
(Id.). Smith testified that he never saw the October 16, 2016 Letter. (PSUF ¶ 45).
After receiving no medical documentation from Smith, on October 18, 2016, UPS sent a follow-up letter to Smith (the "October 18, 2016 Letter"). In that letter, UPS again explained that UPS had not "received any communication from you or your physician. As you are aware, we cannot continue our assessment of your request until we receive the completed medical forms." (Id. ¶ 46). The October 18, 2016 Letter further provided:
If you are having difficulty securing the requested medical information or need other assistance with this process, please call me at 1-855-UPS-HRSC (1-855-877-4772). [*7]  Otherwise, if we do not receive your completed forms by November 1, 2016, UPS will consider you to have withdrawn your request and discontinue processing the request at that time.
(Id. ¶ 47). Smith testified that he never saw the October 18, 2016 Letter. (PSUF ¶ 47). Nonetheless, Smith called UPS on October 25, 2016, to inform UPS that he was working with a doctor to fill out the ADA forms by the November 1, 2016 deadline. (Id. ¶ 38).
After receiving no documentation or other communication from Smith or his physician, on November 1, 2016, UPS sent another letter to Smith (the "November 1, 2016 Letter"). (DSUF ¶ 48). In that letter, UPS advised Smith as follows:
On October 18, 2016, we notified you that your failure to submit medical information concerning your request for a job-related accommodation would be viewed as your withdrawal of the request and would result in the termination of our evaluation. Since that time, UPS has received no communication from you or your physician. Accordingly, this is to confirm that we consider your request withdrawn and are discontinuing processing your request at this time. If you have questions relating to how you request has been handled, why we are [*8]  discontinuing processing your request or your employment status at this time, please contact me at 1-855-UPS-HRSC (1-855-877-4772).
(Id.). Smith never responded, and UPS received no documentation regarding Smith's ability to return to work with or without accommodation. (Id. ¶ 49). Smith's accommodation request was closed as of November 1, 2016. (DSUF ¶ 50).
Smith testified that he never saw the November 1, 2016 Letter. (PSUF ¶ 49). Smith also maintains that UPS already had access to his medical records as a result of Smith signing a medical release waiver. (Id.).

D. Medical Restrictions
The specific chronology with respect to Smith's documented medical restrictions is as follows:
• In July 2016, Smith's medical provider indicated that Smith was restricted from lifting over thirty pounds with his right arm. (Id. ¶ 33). Smith was also restricted at that time from "repetitive pushing or pulling, forceful gripping, grasping, forcing using the right upper extremity." (Id. ¶ 34).
• On August 12, 2016, Smith's medical provider through workers' compensation indicated that Smith was restricted from lifting over twenty-five pounds because of his elbow injury. (Id. ¶ 35).
• Smith testified that, as [*9]  of October 2016, Smith was still under lifting restrictions by his physician. (Id. ¶ 52).
• In June 2017, Smith's medical provider indicated that Smith reported continuing to experience elbow pain while engaging in "any heavy lifting or excessive flexion or extension of the elbow." (Id. ¶ 53). As of June 2017, Smith was still restricted from lifting over fifteen pounds. (Id. ¶ 54).
• Smith maintains that in June 2017, he told Dr. Nakata that he had "full power" and Smith does not remember Dr. Nakata placing any restrictions on him. (PSUF ¶ 54).
• On August 11, 2017, Smith's medical provider again restricted him from lifting over fifteen pounds and from engaging in repetitive elbow extension activities. (DSUF ¶ 55).
• In a medical report dated February 7, 2018, Smith's medical provider stated that Smith was still restricted from "repetitive heavy pushing and repetitive heavy pulling using his right elbow," as well as "repetitive heavy lifting." (Id. ¶ 56).

E. Termination
UPS terminated Smith's employment on October 21, 2017, more than three years after his injury on April 11, 2014. (Id. ¶ 58). At that time of Smith's termination, the Preload Manager at UPS was Elvino George. (Id.). Because [*10]  Smith was on leave for so many years, George had never spoken to Smith or seen him at work. (Id. ¶ 59). George had never received any updates regarding Smith's status and did not know who Smith was. (Id. ¶ 60).
UPS asserts that Smith's termination from employment on October 21, 2017, was accidental — part of a periodic payroll review where employees are terminated when they have not appeared on payroll for a significant period of time. (Id. ¶ 61).
UPS maintains that the reason for this procedure is to allow additional slots for hiring of employees into that group. (Id. ¶ 62). George was not aware that Smith was on medical leave when he included Smith in the October 2017 periodic review. (Id. ¶ 63). Other individuals who were not on medical leave, and had never been on medical leave, were also terminated during the October 2017 payroll review process. (Id. ¶ 64).
Smith's workers' compensation claim settled in or around October 2018. (Id. ¶ 65). Around the same time, Smith visited the UPS Human Resources Department ("HR") and learned for the first time that his employment with UPS had been terminated. (Id. ¶ 66). After that visit to HR in or around October 2018, Smith did not contact UPS [*11]  again. (Id. ¶ 67).
Smith contacted his union representatives about the possibility of returning to work at UPS. (Id. ¶ 68). Smith's union was unable to pursue the matter due to the length of time that had passed between Smith's termination and his contact with the union. (Id. ¶ 69).

F. Litigation and Rehiring Process
On September 11, 2019, Smith commenced this action against UPS in Los Angeles County Superior Court. (Complaint (Docket No. 1-2)). Smith alleges the following eight claims: (1) disability discrimination; (2) retaliation; (3) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation; (4) retaliation, (5) failure to provide reasonable accommodations; (6) failure to engage in the good faith interactive process; (7) declaratory judgment; and (8) wrongful termination. (Id.). UPS removed the action on November 14, 2019, invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction. (Notice of Removal (Docket No. 1)).
The parties disagree with respect to when UPS was put on notice that Plaintiff had no medical restriction.
Smith asserts that UPS was put on notice that Smith had no medical restrictions by (1) the Complaint, which alleged that Smith was "released back to work with no restrictions" and (2) Smith's [*12]  April 30, 2020 Interrogatory Responses, in which Smith stated that he has "been capable of working without restrictions since October 2018." (PSUF ¶ 71).
UPS asserts that it was first put on notice of Smith's lack of restrictions during Smith's deposition on July 21, 2020. (DSUF ¶ 71).
In the fall of 2020, after Smith provided a certification that he could work without restrictions, UPS rehired Smith, initially assigning him to a full-time position as a "Twilight Sorter" and later reassigning him to a Loader/Unloader position at the Metro facility. (DSUF ¶ 72). UPS also reinstated Smith's seniority. (Id. ¶ 73).
Smith currently remains a full-time union employee. (Id. ¶ 75).

II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Smith raises hearsay, lack of foundation/authentication, relevance, and argumentative objections to the evidence cited in the Motion. (Evidentiary Objections (Docket No. 34-3)).
While these objections may be cognizable at trial, on a motion for summary judgment, the Court is concerned only with the admissibility of the relevant facts at trial, and not the form of these facts as presented in the Motions. Sandoval v. Cty. of San Diego, 985 F.3d 657, 666 (9th Cir. 2021) ("[A]t the summary judgment stage, we do not focus on the admissibility of the evidence's [*13]  form. We instead focus on the admissibility of its contents." (citations omitted)). Where "the contents of a document can be presented in a form that would be admissible at trial — for example, through live testimony by the author of the document — the mere fact that the document itself might be excludable hearsay provides no basis for refusing to consider it on summary judgment." Id. (citations omitted); see also Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the plaintiff's diary could be considered on summary judgment because she could testify consistent with its contents at trial); Hughes v. United States, 953 F.2d 531, 543 (9th Cir.1992) (IRS litigation adviser's affidavit may be considered on summary judgment despite hearsay and best evidence rule objections; the facts underlying the affidavit are of the type that would be admissible as evidence even though the affidavit itself might not be admissible).
Accordingly, Smith's objections are OVERRULED.

III. LEGAL STANDARD
In deciding a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, the Court applies Anderson, Celotex, and their Ninth Circuit progeny. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). "The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) [*14] .
The Ninth Circuit has defined the shifting burden of proof governing motions for summary judgment where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial:
The moving party initially bears the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Where the non-moving party bears the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only prove that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case. Where the moving party meets that burden, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to designate specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues for trial. This burden is not a light one. The non-moving party must show more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence. The non-moving party must do more than show there is some "metaphysical doubt" as to the material facts at issue. In fact, the non-moving party must come forth with evidence from which a jury could reasonably render a verdict in the non-moving party's favor.
Coomes v. Edmonds Sch. Dist. No. 15, 816 F.3d 1255, 1259 n.2 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010)). "A motion for summary judgment may not be defeated, however, by evidence that is 'merely colorable' or 'is not significantly probative.'" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. California Fair Employment and Housing Act [*15]  Claims
UPS moves for summary judgment on all of Smith's California Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA") claims (Claims One, Two, Three, Five, and Six) on the basis that Smith cannot establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination, failure to accommodate and engage in the interactive process, or retaliation. (Motion at 2).

1. Disability discrimination
FEHA prohibits discrimination based on disability. Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(a). The three-stage burden shifting test in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973), applies to discrimination claims under FEHA. Means v. City & County of San Francisco, 749 F. Supp. 2d 998, 1004 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (applying McDonnell Douglas to FEHA claims); Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000) (same). Therefore, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Means, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 1004. If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden shifts to the defendant to assert a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. Id. Where the defendant carries its burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant's stated reasons are merely a pretext for discrimination. Id. at 1005.
To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination, Smith must show that he: (1) suffered from a disability; (2) was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without accommodation; and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because [*16]  of his disability. King v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 426, 432, 60 Cal. Rptr. 3d 359 (2007).
UPS argues that Smith cannot satisfy the second or third prongs. (Reply at 4).
With respect to the second prong, UPS argues that Smith cannot show he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his former job at UPS because he was under medical restrictions at the time of his termination, and that UPS did not receive confirmation that he was cleared to work with no restrictions until after this suit was filed. (Id. at 4-5).
Under California law, a "qualified individual" is defined as "an applicant or employee who has the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 2, § 11065(o); Green v. State of California, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 261, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007).
The record shows that Smith went to HR several times in 2015 and 2016, asking to be put back to work. (PSUF ¶ 89). Smith specifically requested a light duty position in the mail room but was told that his restrictions could not be accommodated. (Id.). During that timeframe, it appears that Smith was restricted from lifting more than twenty-five pounds. (DUSF ¶¶ 34-35).
UPS's HR manager, José Banuelos, [*17]  testified that "small sort" positions, where the employee sorts packages weighing five pounds or less, and clerical positions, where employees perform address corrections on packages, are always available to those meeting the physical requirements. (PSUF ¶¶ 90-91).
Because Smith has presented evidence that (1) he was able to perform the essential functions of a light duty position and (2) that light duty positions are always available at UPS, the Court determines that Smith has created a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he was qualified to perform some available job at UPS with or without accommodations. See Nadaf-Rahrov v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 166 Cal. App. 4th 952, 969, 83 Cal. Rptr. 3d 190 (2008) (finding that the plaintiff had created a triable issue of fact with respect to the second prong by producing some evidence that the plaintiff was able to "perform the essential functions of an available vacant position at [the company] with or without accommodation") (emphasis added); Lambert v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., CV 13-8316-DDP (MANx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56998, 2015 WL 1967044, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2015) ("Because this is Amtrak's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff need not prove conclusively that she could [perform the essential duties of her job with reasonable accommodations]. Rather, it is up to the employer to show that she could not." (citing Avila v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1247, 82 Cal.Rptr.3d 440 (2008))).
With respect to the third [*18]  prong, UPS argues that Smith has not presented any evidence of discriminatory intent. (Motion at 11). The Court disagrees.
A claim for discrimination under the FEHA turns on whether the employer treated some people less favorably than others because of their protected status. Kelley v. Conco Companies, 196 Cal. App. 4th 191, 203, 126 Cal. Rptr. 3d 651 (2011). The threshold issue is "whether there is direct evidence that the motive for the employer's conduct was related to the employee's physical or mental condition." Glynn v. Superior Court, 42 Cal. App. 5th 47, 53, 254 Cal. Rptr. 3d 772 (2019) (quoting Wallace v. County of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 123, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016)).
Smith was terminated in October 2017 while on medical leave without receiving any notice from UPS as to why he was terminated. (DSUF ¶ 61). UPS maintains that Smith's termination was not related to Smith's disability because the termination was an honest mistake: UPS accidentally terminated Smith as part of a period payroll review where employees are terminated when they have not appeared on payroll for a significant period of time. (DSUF ¶ 58-63).
The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning. It is undisputed that Smith was off the payroll for a significant period of time because of Smith's disability. Therefore, UPS's termination of Smith, mistaken or not, is directly related to Smith's disability. When a purported mistake is directly related [*19]  to a disability, it is considered direct evidence of disability discrimination. Glynn, 42 Cal. App. 5th at 54 (a company's mistaken belief the employee was unable to work, even made in good faith, constituted direct evidence of disability discrimination defeating summary adjudication) (citing Wallace, 245 Cal. App. 4th at 115).
Because a jury could reasonably infer from these facts that Smith's termination was due to Smith's disability, the Court determines that Smith has presented a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether UPS had discriminatory intent. See id. And viewing this evidence in the light favorable to Smith, the Court is satisfied that Smith has established a prima facie case for disability discrimination. See King, 152 Cal. App. 4th at 432.
Having established that Smith has made a prima facie case for disability discrimination, the burden shifts to UPS to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Smith's termination. Means, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 1004.
UPS has provided conflicting explanations for why Smith was terminated. UPS originally stated, in response to interrogatories, that "[o]n October 20, 2017, Smith was administratively terminated based on his failure to return from leave." (PSUF ¶ 61). Now, UPS maintains that "Smith's termination from employment on October 21, 2017 [*20]  was accidental — part of a periodic payroll review, where employees are terminated when they have not appeared on payroll for a significant period of time." (DSUF ¶ 61).
Either of these explanations constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Smith's termination.
Because UPS has articulated a legitimate business reason for terminating Smith, the burden shifts to Smith to "offer evidence that the employer's stated reason is either false or pretextual, or evidence that the employer acted with discriminatory animus, or evidence of each which would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude the employer intentionally discriminated." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 314, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010) (citations omitted).
"In demonstrating that an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason is false or pretextual, an employee cannot simply show that the employer's decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent." Id. (citation and internal alterations omitted). "Rather, the employee must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered [*21]  legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact finder could rationally find them 'unworthy of credence,' and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons." Id. (citation and internal alterations omitted).
As discussed above, UPS has provided two different explanations for why Smith was terminated: Either Smith was terminated for failure to return from leave or he was accidentally terminated as a result of "periodic payroll review." (PSUF ¶ 61): (DSUF ¶ 61).
At the hearing, UPS argued that these explanations are not evidence of pretext because they are consistent with each other. UPS maintains that being administratively terminated for failure to return from leave is the functionally the the same as being accidentally terminated for being absent from the payroll for an extended period of time because both explanations are premised on Smith's absence from work.
At the hearing, Smith pointed out that UPS's interrogatory response indicated that Smith was terminated for his failure to comply with his obligation to provide UPS with medical documentation — not just his failure to return from leave:
Plaintiff was sent correspondence on October [*22]  4, 2016 advising him of his obligations to provide UPS with documentation from his medical providers setting forth Plaintiff's medical condition and ability to return to work with or without accommodation. Plaintiff did not comply with this obligation. Human Resources Center Occupational Health Supervisor sent Plaintiff additional correspondence dated October 18, 2016 and November 1, 2016 reiterating the need for Plaintiff to submit medical information to support his request for accommodation, but Plaintiff never responded nor did he provide the required information. On October 20, 2017, Plaintiff was administratively terminated based on his failure to return from leave.
(PSUF ¶ 61).
The Court agrees with Plaintiff; the record indicates that Plaintiff was terminated, at least in part, for his failure to comply with his obligation to provide medical records. This explanation is not consistent with UPS's assertion that Smith was accidentally terminated as a result of periodic payroll review. (PSUF ¶ 61): (DSUF ¶ 61).
Viewed in the light favorable to Smith, the "shifting" nature of these explanations creates a genuine dispute of material fact with respect to the issue of pretext. E.E.O.C. v. Timeless Investments, Inc., 734 F. Supp. 2d 1035, 1063 (E.D. Cal. 2010) ("Shifting [*23]  reasons" are "fundamentally different justifications for an employer's action that can give rise to a genuine issue of fact with respect to pretext since they suggest the possibility that neither of the official reasons was the true reason.") (citation and internal alternations omitted).
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Smith's disability discrimination claim.

2. Failure to accommodate
To establish a prima facie claim for failure to accommodate, Smith must prove: (1) he suffers from a disability covered by the FEHA; (2) he can perform the essential functions of the position to which reassignment is sought, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) UPS failed to reasonably accommodate his disability. See Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 256, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000).
UPS challenges the latter two prongs, arguing that the undisputed evidence shows that (1) Smith was unable to perform the essential functions of Smith's original position, and (2) UPS accommodated Smith's disability by providing medical leave. (Motion at 18-19).
It is well established that an employer has an affirmative duty to transfer or reassign a disabled employee to a vacant position at or below his existing position for which he was qualified if he could [*24]  not be accommodated in his former position. Spitzer v. The Good Guys, Inc., 80 Cal. App. 4th 1376, 1388-1389, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236 (2000) ("Courts have made it clear that an employer has a duty to reassign a disabled employee if an already funded, vacant position at the same level exists.") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
As discussed above, Smith has submitted evidence that he was able to perform the essential functions of some job at UPS (light duty Sorter) as early as 2016, and that UPS always had such jobs available. (DUSF ¶¶ 34-35); (PSUF ¶¶ 90-91). This evidence creates a triable issue of fact with respect to the second prong: whether Smith was qualified to perform the essential functions of a vacant position.
Smith also introduced evidence that he was terminated while on medical leave with no notice from UPS. (PSUF ¶ 16). Viewed in the light most favorable to Smith, this evidence, combined with the evidence that UPS always had light duty positions available, creates a triable issue of fact with respect to whether UPS appropriately accommodated Smith.
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Smith's failure to accommodate claim.

3. Failure to engage in the interactive process
FEHA requires employers to "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive [*25]  process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for reasonable accommodation." Huck v. Kone Inc., No. C 10-01845 RS, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144438, 2011 WL 6294466, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2011) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). In a FEHA claim for failure to engage in the interactive process, "courts must determine what caused the breakdown in the interactive process and ascertain who is responsible for the collapse." Id. (citing Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105, 1114-15 (9th Cir. 2000)).
Although Smith has presented a triable issue of fact with respect to whether a reasonable accommodation was available, the undisputed evidence shows that UPS engaged in the interactive process by sending Smith multiple letters seeking medical information that would allow UPS to find a reasonable accommodation. (DSUF ¶¶ 36-50).
At the hearing, Smith asserted that the duty to engage in the interactive process is never-ending and that UPS failed to engage in the interactive process when Smith showed up at work looking for his old job but was told that he had been terminated. The Court disagrees. It is undisputed that Smith's failure to respond to the letters caused the breakdown in the interactive process. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim fails as a matter of law. See Huck, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144438, 2011 WL 6294466, at *12 (""Employers will [*26]  only be liable if they bear responsibility for the breakdown.").
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with respect to Smith's failure to engage in the interactive process claim.

4. Retaliation claims (FEHA and CFRA)
A FEHA retaliation claim requires that (1) the plaintiff establish a prima facie case of retaliation, (2) the defendant articulate a legitimate nonretaliatory explanation for its acts, and (3) the plaintiff show that the defendant's proffered explanation is merely a pretext for the illegal termination. Flait v. N. Am. Watch Corp., 3 Cal. App. 4th 467, 476, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 522 (1992).
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under FEHA, Smith must show (1) he engaged in a protected activity, (2) he was subjected to an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal link between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action. Id.
Similarly, to establish a CFRA retaliation claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant was an employer covered by CFRA; (2) the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take CFRA leave; (3) the plaintiff exercised his right to take leave for a qualifying CFRA purpose; and (4) the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action, such as termination, fine, or suspension, because of her exercise of [*27]  her right to CFRA leave." Dudley v. Dep't of Transp., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001).
UPS argues that Smith cannot establish (1) that he was engaged in a protected activity; (2) a causal connection between his disability and his termination; or (3) that UPS's non-retaliatory reason for terminating Smith was a pretext. (Motion at 22).
Smith satisfies the protected activity prong because he requested an accommodation based on a disability. See Cal. Gov. Code § 12940(m)(2) (it is an unlawful employment practice "[f]or an employer or other entity covered by this part to, in addition to the employee protections provided pursuant to subdivision (h), retaliate or otherwise discriminate against a person for requesting accommodation under this subdivision, regardless of whether the request was granted"). The record shows that Smith went to HR several times in 2015 and 2016, asking to be put back to work. (PSUF ¶ 89). Smith specifically requested a light duty position in the mail room but was told that his restrictions could not be accommodated. (Id.).
Smith satisfies the causation prong because, as discussed above, Smith's termination was directly related to his disability: Smith's disability caused him to be off the payroll for an extended period of time, which resulted in his termination. (DSUF [*28]  ¶¶ 58-63).
Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to Smith, the Court determines that Smith has created a triable issue of fact with respect to pretext because UPS has presented shifting rationales for Smith's termination. (PSUF ¶ 61). See Timeless Investments, Inc., 734 F. Supp. 2d at 1063 ("Shifting reasons" are "fundamentally different justifications for an employer's action [that can] give rise to a genuine issue of fact with respect to pretext since they suggest the possibility that neither of the official reasons was the true reason.") (citation omitted).
Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED with respect to Smith's retaliation claims.

B. Derivative Claims: Wrongful Termination, Failure to Prevent Discrimination, and Declaratory Relief
UPS argues that Smith's wrongful termination, failure to prevent discrimination, and declaratory relief claims fail as a matter of law because they are derivative of Smith's discrimination and retaliation claims, which cannot survive summary judgment. (Motion at 22-23).
As discussed above, the Court determines that Smith's discrimination and retaliation claims do survive summary judgment because Smith has presented genuine disputes of material fact with respect to both claims.
Accordingly, the Motion [*29]  is DENIED with respect to Smith's wrongful termination, failure to prevent discrimination, and declaratory relief claims.

C. Punitive Damages
To recover punitive damages, Smith must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that an officer, director, or managing agent of UPS acted with oppression, fraud, or malice, or ratified such conduct. Cal. Civ. Code § 3294(a)-(b).
"Managing agent" refers "only those corporate employees who exercise substantial independent authority and judgment in their corporate decision making so that their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy." White v. Ultramar, Inc., 21 Cal. 4th 563, 566-567, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 19, 981 P.2d 944 (1999).
Smith argues that UPS is liable for punitive damages because UPS ratified the conduct of its lower level supervisors. (Id.). However, Smith fails to identify any alleged bad actors who are UPS managing agents. In fact, Smith concedes that "[t]here is no evidence proffered that Smith has identified anyone in particular as a 'bad actor.'" (PSUF ¶ 76).
At the hearing, Smith argued that (1) Banuelos was a managing agent and (2) UPS's decision to defend this action is per se ratification of Smith's termination.
With respect to the first point, the Court is not convinced that Banuelos, an HR manager, satisfies the definition of "managing agent" [*30]  laid out above. With respect to the second point, the Court notes that Smith relies principally on Metropolitan Business, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., CV 05-8306-CAS (CWx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72220, 2009 WL 2424223, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2009), for the proposition that a corporate defendant's "failure to take corrective action and defense of [a] suit amounts to ratification of its agents' conduct." Id. Metropolitan Business is easily distinguishable from this action on the basis that Metropolitan Business involved an insurance coverage dispute, not a wrongful termination. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72220, 2009 WL 2424223, at *1. Even if the Court were to adopt the rule articulated in Metropolitan Business, the rule would not apply here because it is undisputed that UPS has taken the corrective action of rehiring Smith to a full-time position. (DSUF ¶¶ 72-73).
Because Smith has failed to identify any managing agent that ratified the conduct at issue, Smith's punitive damages claim fails as a matter of law. See Cal. Civ. Code § 3294; White, 21 Cal. 4th at 577 (explaining that supervisory status, even with authority to hire and fire, is insufficient to qualify as a "managing agent").
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED with respect to the punitive damages claim.

V. CONCLUSION
The Motion is GRANTED with respect to Smith's failure to engage in the interactive process and punitive damages claims. The Motion is DENIED as to all of Smith's remaining claims.
Unfortunately, the existing [*31]  trial date does not appear realistic, based on the criminal cases that must be tried. The parties should confer and then submit a stipulated schedule with a trial date in late 2021 or early 2022. The Court suggests that the parties should seriously consider selecting a magistrate judge for all purposes.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
