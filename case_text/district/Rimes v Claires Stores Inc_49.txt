Opinion



ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [ECF No. 53]
Before the Court is Claire's Stores, Inc.'s ("Defendant") motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56 ("Motion"). (ECF No. 53-1 ("Mot.")). Having considered the parties' submissions, the relevant law, the record in this case, and the hearing on the Motion, the Court GRANTS the Motion.

I. BACKGROUND

A. Factual Background1
Defendant provides reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of its employees, including leaves of absence. (ECF [*2]  No. 53-2 ¶ 13 ("JAF")). To request leave, an employee must submit a doctor's certification and notify his/her supervisor and Defendant's "Total Rewards" department. (Id. ¶ 14). After an employee requests an accommodation, Defendant's Total Rewards department reviews the request and reaches out for further clarification if necessary. (Id. ¶ 15). Qualifying employees are entitled to 12 weeks of statutory medical leave, then additional reasonable leave as needed. (Id. ¶ 16).
Julia Rimes ("Plaintiff") was promoted to the position of Associate Director, Brand Communications by Defendant on August 23, 2020. See (id. ¶ 2). In this role, Plaintiff's job responsibilities focused on influencer marketing, public relations, and events strategies. (Id. ¶ 34). In April of 2021, Plaintiff requested a leave of absence from Defendant. (Id. ¶ 17). To do so, Plaintiff met with Kristin Hodnett, Defendant's Manager of Total Rewards, (ECF No. 53-3 at 39 ¶ 1), who explained that Plaintiff's health care provider must submit a Department of Labor Certification form ("DOL Form") to Hodnett. (ECF No. 53-4 at 145). Thereafter, Plaintiff's healthcare provider, Dr. Michelle Neely, submitted a completed DOL Form [*3]  to support Plaintiff's request. (JAF ¶ 18). Plaintiff requested and received medical leave from April 5, 2021, to May 4, 2021. See (Id. ¶ 29).
Plaintiff explains that she requested leave because she was suffering from depression, anxiety, and being "burnt out" as a result of her increased workload. See (id. ¶ 23); (ECF No. 53-3 at 106). However, Plaintiff does not dispute the fact that she never discussed her medical condition with any of Defendant's employees. See (JAF ¶ 23). Plaintiff also does not dispute that "[t]he only way [Defendant] would have information regarding why Plaintiff initially sought leave would be through Plaintiff's submitted [DOL Form], which did not disclose Plaintiff's specific disability, symptoms, or diagnosis." (Id. ¶ 22). The DOL Form only states that Plaintiff was being referred to for "psychotherapy." (Id. ¶ 19).
At the conclusion of her leave period, on May 4, 2021, Plaintiff did not return to work. Instead, Plaintiff requested four consecutive extensions to her ongoing leave on four different occasions: (1) May 4, 2021-June 2, 2021, see (ECF No. 53-3 at 231-32, 236-37); (2) June 3, 2021-July 4, 2021, see (id. at 233-35); (3) July 6, 2021-September 5, [*4]  2021, see (id. at 238-40); and (4) September 6, 2021-October 3, 2021, see (id. at 241-43). By June 25, 2021, Hodnett informed Plaintiff that she had exhausted her statutory leave. (JAF ¶ 27). For every request, Plaintiff sent Hodnett a doctor's note that neither disclosed her disability nor updated Defendant's on the severity of her condition. See (ECF No. 53-3 at 231, 233-45). Defendant honored Plaintiff's extension requests on every occasion and, during the majority of her leave, paid her salary. See (JAF ¶¶ 29, 31). In all, Plaintiff received more than eight months of continuous leave, with only 12 weeks consisting of the protected statutory leave. See (id. ¶ 29). It is undisputed that, while on leave, Plaintiff was unable to perform her job duties as Associate Director, Brand Communications. (Id. ¶ 32). Further, Plaintiff does not dispute that no employee of Defendant's ever made a negative comment to her regarding Plaintiff's leave extension requests. See (id. ¶ 33). Finally, it is undisputed that Plaintiff never requested any other workplace accommodations or restrictions other than her medical leave. See (id. ¶ 24).
Over the course of Plaintiff's medical leave, Defendant was [*5]  in the process of rethinking and updating its business operations. See (id. ¶ 36). In March of 2021, Defendant hired Kristin Patrick as Chief Marketing Officer. (Id. ¶ 37). Patrick began restructuring the marketing department with a focus on data and analytics to overhaul and establish Defendant's marketing strategy. (Id.). In furtherance of this initiative, Patrick outsourced, ceased, or limited Plaintiff's job duties. See (id. ¶ 38). While Plaintiff was on leave, marketing campaigns and public relations actions were put on hold for "re-branding" until Patrick gave the "go ahead." (Id. ¶ 39).
On October 4, 2021, Plaintiff emailed Hodnett to request a fifth extension of her medical leave from October 4, 2021, to January 3, 2021. (ECF No. 53-3 at 244-45). This email did not discuss Plaintiff's medical condition. (Id.). Attached to this email was another doctor's note which stated: "The aforementioned patient has been under my care since July 2020. Due to persistent medical conditions, please excuse Ms. Rimes from work for the following dates: [October 4, 2021, to January 3, 2021]." (Id. at 245).
Hodnett responsively emailed Michelle Johnson, Defendant's Executive Director, Global Total [*6]  Rewards, (ECF No. 53-3 at 16 ¶ 1), the following: "[Plaintiff] has been out on medical LOA since 4/5/2021. She is in [California], but no longer qualifies for additional time off. We received another extension to 1/3/2022. Would she remain on LOA or will we separate and move to COBRA?"2 (ECF No. 53-4 at 338). Michelle Johnson replied:
We need to connect with her manager to discuss replacing her as she has exceeded the leave of absence period under Claire's policy (6 months leave for associates employed 1-5 years). Since she is out for at least another 3 months, we should replace the position then terminate employment.
We need to make sure that she has received notification that her position is no longer protected and will be replaced.
(Id. at 337). Hodnett forwarded this email exchange to Diane Strybel, who is employed by CBI Distribution Corp. as its Director, HRBP Corporation Functions — a subsidiary of Defendant. (ECF No. 53-3 at 23 ¶ 1). Hodnett's forwarded email states:
Can you please let me know if I should work directly with Kristin Patrick on the below? I know it is no longer Amy as she left the company. [Plaintiff] will not be coming back until 1/3/2022 and now her position should [*7]  be replaced. If her position no longer exists, please let us know?
(ECF No. 53-4 at 337). Strybel then sent Patrick the following email:
Julia has been out on medical LOA since April 5, 2021. While she is in California, she no longer qualifies for additional time off and has exceeded the leave of absence period under Claire's policy. [Total Rewards] received another extension of her leave to January 3, 2022.
I wanted to connect with you to discuss your plans for that role. Julia will not be coming back until next year and you can now replace her role. We just need to let Benefits know the plan as they will need to ensure Julia receives notification that her position is no longer protected and she will be replaced.
(Id. at 301). Patrick responded: "I want to replace her and that role." (Id.).
On December 9, 2021, Hodnett emailed Plaintiff to let Plaintiff know that she was being terminated. See (ECF No. 53-4 at 185). This email stated: "Good morning Julia, I hope you are doing well. [Defendant] is in the process of position replacement and therefore we must terminate. I'm sure you will have some questions in regards to COBRA therefore, please let [*8]  me know when you are available to discuss." (Id.). Attached to the email was a termination letter, which stated:
Dear Julia:
I hope this letter finds you well. You have been absent from work since April 5, 2021. At this time, you have exhausted all your accrued sick and vacation leave and the unpaid leave of absence granted you. Additionally, you are ineligible for any additional leave of absence as required by state and federal laws or under any company policy. As there is no leave available for a continued absence and you are unable to return to work at this time, we must terminate your employment effective December 10, 2021.
(ECF No. 53-4 at 186). Plaintiff responded: "I do not agree with the statements alleged in the attached letter . . . I am on approved leave until January 3, 2022. This termination is unlawful, discriminatory and was done in retaliation for taking an approved medical leave of absence." (Id.).

B. Procedural History
On February 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Claire's Boutiques, Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior Court. (ECF No. 1-5 ("Compl.")). The complaint asserts the following causes of action against both defendants: (1) Discrimination [*9]  on the Basis of Disability and Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation in Violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act ("FEHA"), (id. ¶¶ 36-47); (2) Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of FEHA, (id. ¶¶ 48-55); (3) Interference and Retaliation in Violation of the California Family Rights Act ("CFRA"), (id. ¶¶ 56-65); (4) Invasion of Privacy against both defendants, (id. ¶¶ 66-72); (5) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy, (id. ¶¶ 73-77); and (6) Unequal Pay in Violation of the California Equal Pay Act, (id. 78-84).
On March 4, 2022, Defendant removed the case to this Court. (ECF No. 1). On October 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Joint Stipulation to Dismiss Claire's Boutiques, Inc. from this action and to dismiss its Unequal Pay claim. (ECF No. 46). On October 11, 2022, the Court granted the stipulation via order. (ECF No. 48).
On October 21, 2022, Defendant filed the instant Motion. (Mot.). In accordance with this Court standing order for Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff's arguments in opposition to the Motion are found in the joint brief filed by the parties for the Motion. See (id.). On October 28, 2022, Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff's [*10]  opposition. (ECF No. 60 ("Reply")).

II. LEGAL STANDARD
Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The purpose of summary judgment is to "pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial." Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted). The "mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" if the substantive law identifies the fact as critical such that the resolution of the fact under governing law might affect the outcome of the case, and a dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id. at 258 (Brennan, J., dissenting); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).
"[T]o carry its burden of production, the moving party must produce either evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim or defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential [*11]  element to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial." Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing High Tech Gays v. Defense Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1990)). If the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the burden of production then shifts to the opposing party, who "must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256. A genuine issue requires evidence, not speculation or guesswork. Guidroz-Brault v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co., 254 F.3d 825, 829 (9th Cir. 2001). The opposing party may not simply rely upon the allegations or denials in its pleadings. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 321 n.3, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Nor can it rely on testimony that is conclusory, speculative, or "uncorroborated and self-serving" to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment. Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002) (citations and internal quotations omitted); Thornhill Pub. Co. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979). Instead, the opposing party, by citing to documents, depositions, declarations, admissions, interrogatory answers, or other material, must identify specific material facts that are genuinely in dispute that are the basis of its challenged claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., 475 U.S. at 586 n.11 (citation omitted). The opposing party does not need to conclusively establish that a disputed material fact would be decided in its favor. It is sufficient for the opposing party to show that "the claimed factual dispute" requires a jury "to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial." [*12]  T.W. Elec. Serv. Inc., 809 F.2d at 630 (internal quotations omitted).
In resolving a summary judgment motion, the court does not weigh the evidence, determine the truth, or make credibility determinations. See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255 ("Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences form the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict."). Instead, the court views the facts and draws reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the opposing party. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378, 127 S. Ct. 1769, 167 L. Ed. 2d 686 (2007) (citations omitted); Addisu v. Fred Meyer, Inc., 198 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir. 2000). Because reasonable inferences cannot be pulled out of thin air, it is the opposing party's obligation to produce a factual basis from which such inferences may be drawn. See Richards v. Nielsen Freight Lines, 602 F. Supp. 1224, 1244-45 (E.D. Cal. 1985), aff'd, 810 F.2d 898, 902 (9th Cir. 1987). Further, there must be more than a mere scintilla of contradictory evidence to survive summary judgment. Addisu, 198 F.3d at 1134 (citation omitted). Only admissible evidence may be considered in ruling on a motion for summary judgment. See Orr v. Bank of America, 285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). In determining admissibility for summary judgment purposes, it is the contents of the evidence rather than its form that must be considered. Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). If the contents of the evidence could be presented in an admissible [*13]  form at trial, those contents may be considered on summary judgment, even if the evidence itself is hearsay. Id.

III. DISCUSSION

A. Disability Discrimination Under FEHA
California's FEHA prohibits an employer from terminating an employee based on that employee's mental disability. Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a). Discriminatory intent is a necessary element for this cause of action. Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc., 5 Cal. App. 5th 570, 590, 210 Cal. Rptr. 3d 59 (2016) (citation omitted). "A plaintiff may prove his or her discrimination case by direct or circumstantial evidence or both." Id. at 591 (citing Morgan v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 88 Cal. App. 4th 52, 67, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 652 (2000)). With regarding to evidence of discrimination, "[d]irect evidence is evidence that proves a fact without inference or presumption." Zamora v. Sec. Indus. Specialist, Inc., 71 Cal. App. 5th 1, 35 (2021) (citation omitted). "Direct evidence includes comments that demonstrate discriminatory animus and a causal relationship between those comments and the adverse employment action." Id. (citing DeJung v. Superior Ct., 169 Cal. App. 4th 533, 550, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 99 (2008)).
"Because direct evidence of intentional discrimination is rare and most discrimination claims must usually be proved circumstantially, in FEHA employment cases California has adopted the three-stage burden shifting test established by the United States Supreme Court in" McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Soria, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 591. Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. Guz v. Bechtel Nat'l, Inc., 24 Cal. 4th 317, 354, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). For disability discrimination, [*14]  this requires a showing that the plaintiff: "(1) suffered from a disability, or was regarded as suffering from a disability; (2) could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations, and (3) was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability or perceived disability." Sandell v. Taylor-Listug, Inc., 188 Cal. App. 4th 297, 310, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 453 (2010) (citing Jensen v. Wells Fargo Bank, 85 Cal. App. 4th 245, 254, 102 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55 (2000)). "[A] plaintiff must show . . . actions taken by the employer from which one can infer, if such actions remain unexplained, that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a prohibited discriminatory action.'" Id. (internal quotations and brackets omitted). If a prima facie case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination "by producing evidence that its action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. If the employer discharges this burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears. The plaintiff must then show that the employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason was actually a pretext for discrimination, and the plaintiff may offer any other evidence of discriminatory motive. The ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of discrimination remains with the plaintiff." Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal. 4th 203, 214-215, 152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 392, 294 P.3d 49 (2013) (citation [*15]  omitted).
The order of these showings is modified when the McDonnell Douglas test is applied, like here, in the context of a motion for summary judgment. Kelly v. Stamps.com Inc., 135 Cal. App. 4th 1088, 1097, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240 (2005). "An employer moving for summary judgment on a FEHA cause of action may satisfy its initial burden of proving a cause of action has no merit by showing either that one or more elements of the prima facie case 'is lacking, or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate nondiscriminatory factors.'" Soria, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 591 (quoting Cucuzza v. City of Santa Clara, 104 Cal. App. 4th 1031, 1038, 128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 660 (2002)). "Once the employer sets forth a nondiscriminatory reason for the decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce substantial responsive evidence that the employer's showing was untrue or pretextual." Id. (citations and internal quotations omitted). "'[A]n employer is entitled to summary judgment if, considering the employer's innocent explanation for its actions, the evidence as a whole is insufficient to permit a rational inference that the employer's actual motive was discriminatory." Id. (citations and internal quotations omitted).
1. There is No Direct Evidence of Disability Discrimination
Plaintiff initially argues that summary judgment should be denied as to her disability discrimination claim under FEHA because she [*16]  has presented direct evidence of Defendant's discriminatory intent. (Mot. at 32-33). In particular, Plaintiff references the following evidence in the record: (1) Plaintiff's termination letter, and (2) internal emails between several of Defendant's employees. (Id. at 33). The Court disagrees.
"The three-stage [McDonnell Douglas] framework and the many principles adopted to guide its application do not apply in discrimination cases where . . . the plaintiff presents direct evidence of the employer's motivation for the adverse employment action." Wallace v. Cnty. of Stanislaus, 245 Cal. App. 4th 109, 123, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 462 (2016). Although direct evidence of intentional discrimination is "rare," "disability discrimination cases often involve direct evidence of the role of the employee's actual or perceived disability in the employer's decision to implement an adverse employment action." Id. Thus, "courts and practitioners should not automatically apply principles related to McDonnell Douglas test to disability discrimination cases. Rather, they should examine the threshold issue and determine whether there is direct evidence that the motive for the employer's conduct was related to the employee's physical or mental condition." Id.
Here, the Court finds that, collectively, Plaintiff's proffered materials [*17]  are not direct evidence showing discriminatory animus by Defendant. The parties involved in the communications proffered by Plaintiff only raised concerns regarding Plaintiff's ongoing leave, which had extended months beyond the statutory leave, Defendant's company policy, and Defendant's elimination of Plaintiff's position due to its restructuring. Neither the termination letter nor the email exchange discusses Plaintiff's mental disability. In fact, as Plaintiff acknowledges, she never discussed her medical condition with any of Defendant's employees, see (JAF ¶ 23), and "[t]he only way [Defendant] would have information regarding why Plaintiff initially sought leave would be through Plaintiff's submitted [DOL Form], which did not disclose Plaintiff's specific disability, symptoms, or diagnosis." (Id. ¶ 22). Although on summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in the nonmoving party's favor, T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809 F.2d at 630-31, to constitute direct evidence, Plaintiff's proffered evidence would need to show discriminatory comments being made about Plaintiff's disability without the need for the Court to infer or presume animus. See [*18]  Zamora, 71 Cal. App. 5th at 35. Therefore, the Court find that Plaintiff has not offered direct evidence of disability discrimination. The Court thus analyzes whether Plaintiff has presented a prima facie case under the three-step McDonnell Douglas framework.
2. Plaintiff Has Not Established a Prima Facie Case
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot satisfy the second prong of her prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, which requires Plaintiff to show that she "could perform the essential duties of the job with or without reasonable accommodations," see Sandell, 188 Cal. App. 4th at 310, because "there was no accommodation that would have allowed Plaintiff to do her job . . . ." (Mot. at 27-28). The Court agrees.
Generally speaking, FEHA does not prohibit an employer from discharging an employee with a mental disability "if the employee, because of a . . . mental disability, is unable to perform the employee's essential duties even with reasonable accommodation . . . ." Cal. Gov't Code § 12940(a)(2). The term "essential duties" refers to the essential functions of the position, Shamir v. SCCA Store Holdings, Inc., CV 13-6672 ABC (ASx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206317, 2014 WL 12597151, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June 9, 2014) (citing Cal. Gov't Code § 12926(f)), which is defined as "the fundamental job duties of the employment position the individual with a disability holds or desires." Id. § 12926(f). To raise a genuine issue of material fact on this second prong, Plaintiff is obligated [*19]  to present evidence showing that she was able to perform the essential duties of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation, at the time of her termination. Green v. State, 42 Cal. 4th 254, 262, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 390, 165 P.3d 118 (2007) ("[I]n order to establish that a defendant employer has discriminated on the basis of disability in violation of the FEHA, the plaintiff employee bears the burden of proving he or she was able to do the job, with or without reasonable accommodation." (emphasis added)); see also King v. C&K Mkt.., Inc., Case No. 2:16-cv-00559-TLN-CMK, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25352, 2018 WL 934551, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2018) (citation omitted); Canupp v. Children's Receiving Home, 181 F. Supp. 3d 767, 779-80 (E.D. Cal. 2016); Louie v. Newtek Bus. Serv. Corp., Case No. 8:21-cv-00782-JLS-KES, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184391, 2022 WL 4596694, at *5 (C.D. Cal. July 29, 2022) ("Plaintiff gave no indication when she would return to work or if she would return at all."); Yates v. Health Servs. Advisory Grp., 2:16-cv-04032-CAS(PLAx), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118178, 2017 WL 3197228, at *6-*7 (C.D. Cal. July 24, 2017) (granting summary judgment against plaintiff because plaintiff "provide[d] no evidence beyond her own speculation that her medical condition had improved sufficiently to allow her to return to work."); see also Xiao Ping Zhu v. Tawa Supermarket, Inc., 2013 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5959, 2013 WL 4508361, at *5 (Aug. 22, 2013) (unpublished) (granting summary judgment because plaintiff could "not prove that she could have performed the essential duties of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation, at the time [Defendant] told her she could not return to work."); Arthur v. Disneyland Resort, 2020 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2387, 2020 WL 1873203, at *4 (Apr. 15, 2020) (unpublished) (same).
Here, to establish the second prong of her prima facie case, Plaintiff argues that her leave was a reasonable accommodation that rendered her a qualified individual. [*20]  (Mot. at 33). Plaintiff also argues that "Defendant had no reason to believe that [Plaintiff] would not be able to return to her position following her leave." (Id.). In support, Plaintiff argues that "she frequently provided updates and documentation concerning her return-to-work dates." (Mot. at 34). However, Plaintiff does not dispute that, while "on leave in 2021, she could not perform her job duties as Associate Director, Brand Communications." (JAF ¶ 32). Further, to the extent that Plaintiff gave Defendant any status update regarding her ongoing medical condition, it was several doctor's notes sent to Ms. Hodnett via email, see (ECF No. 53-3 at 231, 232-45), and none of these notes discussed Plaintiff's medical condition. Additionally, the eight-month duration of Plaintiff's leave (which exceeded both the 12 weeks available by California statute and Defendant's leave policy), her repeated requests for further leave, and her failure to provide detailed updates on her expected return date demonstrate that Plaintiff was medically incapable of performing her essential duties with or without a reasonable accommodation at the time of her termination.
Plaintiff argued in her brief and [*21]  during the hearing on the Motion that Defendant had an obligation to speak with Plaintiff's doctor to become more informed about Plaintiff's medical condition. (Mot. at 34). This is not true as a matter of law. In the context of CFRA leave (the relevant leave in this case), an employer may only contact a health care provider to authenticate a medical certification, not to check on the status of the employee's health condition. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2 § 11091(b)(2). Plaintiff does not cite any case law suggesting otherwise. See (Mot. at 34).
Finally, citing to her own declaration and deposition testimony, Plaintiff asserts that she "was planning on returning to work and her disability did in fact end on January 3, 2022." (Mot. at 34 (citing JAF ¶ 65)). However, none of these materials demonstrates that Plaintiff's condition had improved by January 3, 2022, or that Defendant knew of Plaintiff's mental disability in the first place. See (ECF No. 53-4 at 115, 167-169, 174, 177, 187). To the contrary, from the Court's review of these materials, they consist of Plaintiff continuing to request extensions of her leave to Hodnett without providing any details about the nature or severity of her ongoing mental disability. See [*22]  (id.).
For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not raised a prima facie case for disability discrimination under FEHA. The Court grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's disability discrimination cause of action.

B. Failure to Engage and Failure to Accommodate
1. Failure to Engage in Interactive Process
FEHA also mandates that an employer must "engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations, if any, in response to a request for a reasonable accommodation by an employee or applicant with a known physical or mental disability or known medical condition." Cal Gov't Code § 12940(n). "The interactive process imposes burdens on both employer and employee." Scotch v. Art Inst. of Cal., 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013, 1014, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 338 (2009). "The employee must initiate the process unless the disability and resulting limitations are obvious." Id. "Where the disability, resulting limitations, and necessary reasonable accommodations, are not open, obvious, and apparent to the employer . . . the initial burden rests primarily upon the employee to specifically identify the disability and resulting limitations, and to suggest the reasonable accommodations." Id. (quoting Taylor v. Principal Fin. Grp., Inc., 93 F.3d 155, 165 (5th Cir. 1996)) (internal quotations omitted). "Although [*23]  it is the employee's burden to initiate the process, no magic words are necessary, and the obligation arises once the employer becomes aware of the need to consider an accommodation." Id. (quoting Gelfo v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 140 Cal. App. 4th 34, 62, 43 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874 n.22 (2006) (internal quotations omitted). "Once initiated, the employer has a continuous obligation to engage in the interactive process in good faith." Swanson v. Morongo Unif. Sch. Dist., 232 Cal. App. 4th 954, 971, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 553 (2014). The interactive process "requires communication and good-faith exploration of possible accommodations between employers and individual employees with the goal of identifying an accommodation that allows the employee to perform the job effectively." Yeager v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 944 F. Supp. 2d 913, 919 (E.D. Cal. 2013) (citation and internal quotations omitted).
Here, the specifics of Plaintiff's alleged disability were not obvious to Defendant. Plaintiff does not dispute: (1) that she never discussed mental disability with anyone associated with Defendant; (2) that the only way Defendant would have known of the specifics regarding Plaintiff's disability would be via Plaintiff's DOL Form, which did not disclose Plaintiff's disability, symptoms, or diagnosis; and (3) that, over the entire course of her leave, Plaintiff never requested any other workplace accommodations or restrictions other than her medical leave. (JAF [*24]  ¶¶ 19-24); (ECF No. 53-4 at 159-60). Thus, Defendant had no obligation to explore potential accommodations for anxiety and depression; rather, Defendants only had an obligation to respond, in good faith, to Plaintiff's request for medical leave.
The evidence demonstrates that Defendant did respond in good faith. When Plaintiff initially sought medical leave in April of 2021, Hodnett covered the necessary steps to request this leave with Plaintiff. See (id. ¶ 25); (ECF No. 53-3 at 262). Further, Plaintiff and Ms. Hodnett had several discussions about Plaintiff's subsequent leave requests, where Ms. Hodnett informed Plaintiff how to extend her leave. (JAF ¶ 25). Finally, Ms. Hodnett informed Plaintiff when her statutory leave had expired on June 25, 2021. (Id. ¶ 27). Plaintiff's multiple requests for leave were never rejected. Plaintiff was granted eight months of continuous medical leave in 2021, from April 2021 to December 2021, despite this leave exceeding the statutory leave policy and Defendant's own leave policy. See (id. ¶ 29). For these reasons, the Court sees "no reason why this employer should be subjected to liability for failing to engage in the interactive process where the [*25]  employee was reasonably accommodated" with every accommodation requested. Hanson v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 74 Cal. App. 4th 215, 229, 87 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487 (1999).
Nonetheless, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to sufficiently engage in the interactive process because "Ms. Hodnett often sent delayed responses to Ms. Rimes or completely failed to respond to Ms. Rimes." See (Mot. at 40). Again, it is undisputed that Plaintiff only requested medical leave as a reasonable accommodation for her mental disability, (JAF ¶ 24), and it is also undisputed that Defendant granted Plaintiff's request on every occasion. See (id. ¶ 29). Plaintiff cites no case law demonstrating that delayed responses, alone, merit a cause of action for failure to engage in interactive process where the plaintiff is given every accommodation requested. Plaintiff also argues that "Ms. Hodnett did not discuss with Plaintiff any further possible accommodations, or discuss the possibility of additional accommodations with others, including CMO Patrick and Ms. Strybel." See (Mot. at 40-41). However, for reasons already discussed, Defendant had no obligation to do so because Defendant had no notice of Plaintiff's anxiety or depression. Rather, Defendant only knew that Plaintiff was requesting medical [*26]  leave as a reasonable accommodation. For these reasons, the Court grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's failure to engage in interactive process cause of action under FEHA.
2. Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodations
It is also an unlawful employment practice "to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known . . . mental disability of an applicant or employee" unless the employer demonstrates doing so would impose an undue hardship. Cal. Gov't Code 12940(m). To assert a claim for failure to accommodate, Plaintiff must prove: (1) she has a disability; (2) she is qualified to perform the essential job functions of her position (i.e., she could perform her essential duties with a reasonable accommodation); and (3) Defendant failed to reasonably accommodate Plaintiff's known disabilities. See Wilson v. Cnty. of Orange, 169 Cal. App. 4th 1185, 1192-93, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 439 (2009). "A 'reasonable accommodation' means a modification or adjustment to the workplace that enables the employee to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired." Brown v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 60 Cal. App. 5th 1092, 1107, 275 Cal. Rptr. 3d 322 (2021) (citation omitted). "Once notified of a disability, the employer's burden is to take positive steps to accommodate the employee's limitations. The employee also retains a duty to cooperate with the employer's effort by explaining his or [*27]  her disability and qualifications. "Reasonable accommodation thus envisions an exchange between employer and employee where each seeks and shares information to achieve the best match between the employee's capabilities and available positions." Id. at 1108 (citation omitted). Importantly, the employer is only obligated to accommodate known disabilities. See Avila v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1237, 1252, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440 (2008) (citation omitted).
Plaintiff cannot succeed on this claim because, for reasons already discussed above, Plaintiff was not qualified for the job. Moreover, the only accommodation Plaintiff sought was leave from work — and Defendant consistently granted these leave requests. (JAF ¶¶ 24-29). Plaintiff argues that she request another accommodation but was denied, "specifically . . . a reasonable accommodation in the form of job-protected leave" from Hodnett. (Mot. at 41-42). The Court disagrees. Plaintiff never requested job-protected leave; rather, Plaintiff merely asked Ms. Hodnett to research the availability of job-protected leave. See (ECF No. 53-4 at 182 ("In regards to my job security, there are other laws in California that I thought required Claire's to provide me with a leave of absence and job reinstatement rights as a reasonable [*28]  accommodation. Can you look into that?")). For this reason, the Court finds that Defendant never denied Plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation. The Court grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's failure to provide reasonable accommodation.

C. CFRA Interference
The CFRA is a portion of FEHA that is "is intended to give employees an opportunity to take leave from work for certain personal or family medical reasons without jeopardizing job security." Bareno v. San Diego Community College Dist., 7 Cal. App. 5th 546, 558, 212 Cal. Rptr. 3d 682 (2017) (quoting Nelson v. United Techs., 74 Cal. App. 4th 597, 606, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239 (1999)). "The CFRA entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave during a 12-month period for certain personal or family medical conditions, including care for their children, parents, or spouses or to recover from their own serious health condition." Neisendorf v. Levi Strauss & Co., 143 Cal. App. 4th 509, 49 Cal. Rptr. 3d 216 (2006) (citations omitted). "CFRA's regulations provide that, for an employee to be entitled to a medical leave for her own serious health condition, the condition must cause her to be unable to work at all or unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her position." Id. at 516-17 (citation omitted). "An employee who takes CFRA leave is guaranteed that taking leave will not result in a loss of job security or in other adverse employment actions." Id. [*29]  (citation omitted). "Violations of the CFRA generally fall into two types of claims: (1) 'interference' claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave, and (2) 'retaliation' claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to CFRA leave." Rogers v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 198 Cal.App.4th 480, 487-488, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 350 (2011) (citations omitted).
"A CFRA interference claim '"consists of the following elements: (1) the employee's entitlement to CFRA leave rights; and (2) the employer's interference with or denial of those rights." Soria, 5 Cal. App. 5th at 601 (quoting Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 248 Cal. App. 4th 216, 250, 206 Cal. Rptr. 3d 841 (2016)). "[T]o request CFRA leave an employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs CFRA leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not expressly assert rights under CFRA . . .; however, the employee must state the reason the leave is needed, such as, for example, the expected birth of a child or for medical treatment . . . . The employer should inquire further of the employee if necessary to determine whether the employee is requesting CFRA leave and to obtain necessary information concerning the leave (i.e., [*30]  commencement date, expected duration, and other permissible information)." Id. at 602 (internal quotations omitted). "[I]n the context of leave for an employee's own serious health condition, the mere notice that an employee seeks to use sick time is insufficient to place the employer on notice that the employee seeks CFRA-qualifying leave. Leave for an employee's health condition requires a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her position." Stevens v. Dep't of Corrs., 107 Cal.App.4th 285, 292 (2003).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant never notified her of her rights under the CFRA. (Mot. at 42-43). However, regardless of whether or not Defendant's sufficiently notified Plaintiff of her rights under the CFRA, it is undisputed that Plaintiff requested leave and Defendant honored that request. In particular, Plaintiff does not dispute that she was given eight months of continuous leave by Defendant, which is well in excess of the 12 weeks of leave mandated under the CFRA. See (JAF ¶ 29). An employer does not interfere with a Plaintiff's CFRA rights when it terminates an employee who is unable to return to work at the conclusion of the 12-week period of statutory leave. Neisendorf, 143 Cal. App. 4th at 518 (no interference with CFRA rights [*31]  when employer terminated employee who could not return for 14 weeks and then required accommodations to perform job); see also Rogers, 198 Cal. App. 4th at 488-90 (interference claim failed as a matter of law when employee did not return to work at the conclusion of 12-week leave). For reasons already discussed, Plaintiff has not presented evidence demonstrating that she was able to return to work at the conclusion of her 12-week statutory leave, let alone after eight months. Therefore, Defendant cannot show CFRA inference. The Court grants summary judgment as to this cause of action.

D. CFRA Retaliation
It is also unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual for exercising his or her right to leave under CFRA. See Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2(l). To establish a prima facie CFRA retaliation claim, the plaintiff must show: (1) defendant was a CFRA covered employer, (2) plaintiff was eligible for CFRA leave, (3) plaintiff exercised her right to make a qualifying leave, and (4) plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because she exercised her right to take CFRA leave. Dudley v. Dep't of Trans., 90 Cal. App. 4th 255, 261, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 739 (2001). The parties only dispute the fourth requirement: whether plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action because she exercised her right to take CFRA leave. The Court finds [*32]  that Plaintiff has not established this requirement.
To meet this requirement, Plaintiff points to the previously discussed internal emails to assert that they "reveal the decision to terminate Ms. Rimes was solely motivated by her leave of absence." (Mot. at 45). The Court disagrees. The aforementioned emails were written in October of 2021, six months after Plaintiff initially requested leave and approximately four months after the CFRA 12-week leave period had concluded. The temporal distance between Plaintiff's CFRA request and her ultimate termination fails to demonstrate a retaliatory motive. See, e.g., Swan v. Bank of Am., 360 Fed. Appx. 903, 906 (9th Cir. 2009) (Defendant "terminated [the plaintiff] four months after her return from [FMLA] leave, which is too remote in time to support a finding of causation premised solely on temporal proximity."); Kadiyan v. Medtronic, Case No. CV 10-05921 MMM (MANx), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163991, 2011 WL 13142145, at *24 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2011), aff'd sub nom 510 Fed. Appx. 649 (9th Cir. 2013) ("The fact that plaintiff was allegedly terminated eight months after beginning intermittent CFRA leave, and five months after beginning full-time CFRA leave, without more, . . . is not sufficient to raise triable issues of fact regarding retaliation for the exercise of rights under the CFRA."); Moore v. Cent. Gaming Mgmt., B249978, 2014 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 3959, 2014 WL 2511742, at *10 (June 4, 2014) (unpublished) (that eight months passed between plaintiff's request for CFRA [*33]  leave and decision to terminate her precluded finding that causal connection existed between the two events); Clark v. Amtrust N. Am., Case No. 16-cv-05561-MEJ, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23624, 2018 WL 839148, at *20 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2018) ("Plaintiff was terminated in September 2015, approximately eight months after she returned from leave. This is insufficient to create a temporal nexus between Plaintiff's leave and her termination." (citations omitted)); cf. McClain v. Cenveo Corp., 2:12-cv-00765-GEB-GGH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132264, 2013 WL 5230269, at *3, *5-*6 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 16, 2013) (finding a causal link where plaintiff was terminated less than two months after requesting CFRA leave).
Further, the parties to these emails did not discuss terminating Plaintiff because of her statutory leave; rather, they discussed terminating Plaintiff because Plaintiff's leave exceeded the Defendant's own leave policy. See (ECF No. 53-4 at 301 ("Julia has been out on medical LOA since April 5, 2021. While she is in California, she no longer qualifies for additional time off and has exceeded the leave of absence period under Claire's policy."), 337 ("We need to connect with her manager to discuss replacing her as she has exceeded the leave of absence period under Claire's policy (6 months leave for associates employed 1 - 5 years)"). Moreover, Plaintiff does not dispute that no employee of Defendant's ever made a negative comment to her regarding [*34]  these leave extension requests. See (id. ¶ 33). For these reasons, the Court grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's CFRA retaliation claim.

E. Plaintiff's Invasion of Privacy Claim
In order to prevail on a cause of action for invasion of the right to privacy under California law, Plaintiff must establish the following elements: "(1) a legally protected privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy." Hill v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Assn., 7 Cal. 4th 1, 39-40, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 834, 865 P.2d 633 (1994); All of Us or None-Riverside Chapter v. Hamrick, 64 Cal. App. 5th 751, 798, 279 Cal. Rptr. 3d 422 (2021). "Whether plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances and whether defendant's conduct constitutes a serious invasion of privacy are mixed questions of law and fact. If the undisputed material facts show no reasonable expectation of privacy or an insubstantial impact on privacy interests, the questions of invasion may be adjudicated as a matter of law." Hill, 7 Cal. 4th at 40. In Mathews v. Becerra, 8 Cal. 5th 756, 257 Cal. Rptr. 3d 2, 455 P.3d 277 (2019), the California Supreme Court reaffirmed that, in order to constitute an actionable invasion of privacy, the invasion "must be sufficiently serious in . . . nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right." Matthews, 8 Cal. 5th at 779. Thus, "the [*35]  extent and gravity of the invasion is [sic] an indispensable consideration in assessing an alleged invasion of privacy." Id. (internal quotations omitted).
Plaintiff argues that Defendant violated her right to privacy when it asked Plaintiff to fill out the DOL Form in order to request medical leave. See (Compl. ¶¶ 66-72); (Mot. at 48-50). However, Defendant's actions were not highly offensive to a reasonable person because the DOL Form does not require Plaintiff's health care provider to disclose Plaintiff's symptoms or diagnosis. (JAF ¶ 20). Further, Plaintiff's health care provider did not identify Plaintiff's medical diagnosis or describe Plaintiff's symptoms when completing the DOL Form. The only medical information provided in Plaintiff's DOL Form is a single mention of Plaintiff's referral to a health care provider for "psychotherapy" treatment. (Id. ¶ 19). This is insufficient to demonstrate an invasion of privacy for purposes of this cause of action. See, e.g., L.A. Gay & Lesbian Ctr. v. Superior Ct., 194 Cal. App. 4th 288, 308, 125 Cal. Rptr. 3d 169 (2011) (finding the disclosure "to a wide array of third persons in connection with the litigation" of plaintiffs' medical records (which might reveal sexually transmitted diseases) to be sufficiently serious). Moreover, it [*36]  is undisputed that there was no intrusion via inadvertent disclosure because Defendant maintained the confidentiality of Plaintiff's DOL Form via a secure drive and limited access to the Total Rewards team for leave purposes only. (JAF ¶ 46). Because the Court concludes that the undisputed material facts show an insubstantial impact on privacy interests, it grants summary judgment as to Plaintiff's invasion of privacy cause of action.

F. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
"[W]hile an at-will employee may be terminated for no reason, or for an arbitrary or irrational reason, there can be no right to terminate for an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy." Casella v. SouthWest Dealer Services, Inc., 157 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1138-39, 69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 445 (2007) (quoting Gantt v. Sentry Ins., 1 Cal. 4th 1083, 1094, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 874, 824 P.2d 680 (1992)). To establish a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the plaintiff must show: (1) an employer-employee relationship; (2) a termination or other adverse employment action; (3) the termination violated a public policy; and (4) the termination caused the plaintiff's damages. Holmes v. General Dynamics Corp., 17 Cal. App. 4th 1418, 1426, n.8, 22 Cal. Rptr. 2d 172 (1993). However, "the public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of the law." Casella, 157 Cal. App. 4th at 1139 (quoting Gantt v. Sentry Ins., 1 Cal. 4th at 1095); see also Stevenson v. Superior Ct., 16 Cal. 4th 880, 889, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 888, 941 P.2d 1157 (1997) ("In the context of a tort claim for [*37]  wrongful discharge, tethering public policy to specific constitutional or statutory provisions serves not only to avoid judicial interference with the legislative domain, but also to ensure that employers have adequate notice of the conduct that will subject them to tort liability to the employees they discharge . . . ."), overruled on other grounds by Green v. Ralee Eng'g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66, 78 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046 (1998).
Plaintiff bases her cause of action for wrongful termination on her CFRA-related claims. See (Mot. at 50-51). However, for reasons already discussed, Plaintiff has not shown a genuine dispute of material fact as to these claims to preclude summary judgment. Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment against Plaintiff's wrongful termination claim.

G. Punitive Damages
The Court has already granted summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's causes of action. For this reason, there is no need to analyze whether punitive damages are appropriate.

IV. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion is GRANTED in its entirety.
IT IS SO ORDERED
