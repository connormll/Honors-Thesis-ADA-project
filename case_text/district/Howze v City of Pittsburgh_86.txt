REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Cynthia Reed Eddy, United States Magistrate Judge.

I. RECOMMENDATION
Presently pending before the court is Defendant City of Pittsburgh's motion for partial dismissal of Plaintiff Anastacia Howze's First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). [ECF No. 25]. For the reasons that follow, it is respectfully recommended that the City's motion be granted in part and denied in part.

II. REPORT

A. Background
Plaintiff initiated the present employment discrimination action against her former employer, the City of Pittsburgh (the "City") on August 25, 2016 alleging that the City discriminated against her based upon her sex and/or gender, race [*2]  and disability. Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on April 20, 2017, which is the operative complaint for purposes of this motion. Because the City's motion to dismiss is largely based upon issues concerning Plaintiff's exhaustion of administrative remedies, only those facts necessary for the disposition of the present motion to dismiss will be discussed.

Plaintiff's September 29, 2014 PHRC Charge1
On September 29, 2014, Plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ("PHRC"), which was dual filed with the Equal Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). 9/29/2014 PHRC Charge [ECF No. 28-6] 1-4. In the September 29, 2014 Charge, Plaintiff alleges that she was not promoted because of her race and sex. Id.

Plaintiff's April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge2
On April 9, 2015, Plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, which was dual filed with the PHRC. 4/9/2015 EEOC Charge [ECF No. 28-4] at 1-3. In the April 9, 2015 Charge, Plaintiff alleges that she filed a 2013 Office of Municipal Investigations ("OMI") complaint that Caucasian coworkers were harassing her in the workplace. Id. Plaintiff alleges that after she made the OMI complaint, she was retaliated against [*3]  by receiving a written reprimand for leaving work early, whereas a Caucasian colleague who had falsified the same information was not disciplined. Id. Plaintiff also alleges that she was paid less than similarly situated employees and that less qualified Caucasian employees were promoted over her a "number" of times. Id. The EEOC issued a right to sue letter on February 2, 2016 and the PHRC issued a right to sue letter on August 16, 2016.3See EEOC Right to Sue Letter for 4/9/2015 Charge [ECF No. 28-5].

Plaintiff's August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge4
On August 31, 2015, Plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, which was dual filed with the PHRC. See 8/31/2015 EEOC Charge [ECF No. 28-1] at 1-3. In this charge, Plaintiff alleges that her job duties were reclassified into a new position, she was not promoted, work was taken away from her and she was harassed by her boss for "not doing any work." Id. She alleges that this was based upon her race and disability and in retaliation for filing the previous charges of discrimination. Id. Plaintiff also alleges that her supervisor, Sam Ashbaugh was "out to get" her. Id. The EEOC issued a right to sue letter on June 6, 2016. See EEOC Right [*4]  to Sue Letter for 8/31/2015 Charge [ECF No. 28-2]. The PHRC has not yet issued a right to sue letter.

Plaintiff's April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge5
After the present action was initiated, Plaintiff was terminated by the City on March 31, 2017. Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶ 38. On April 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, which was dual filed with the PHRC. See 4/7/2017 EEOC Charge [ECF No. 28-3] at 1-4. In this charge, Plaintiff filed a race, disability and retaliation charge alleging that the City failed to accommodate her disability and that she was terminated discriminatorily and in retaliation for filing prior charges and the instant lawsuit. She further alleges that she was warned that her use of vacation time for her disability leave was "against policy" and was threatened with termination, although the City could not point to any policy that she purportedly neglected. As of this filing, no right to sue letters have been issued as to this charge.

Plaintiff's Amended Complaint
Plaintiff asserts multiple claims of discrimination in her Amended Complaint.6 First, Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to a disability-based hostile work environment under the Americans [*5]  with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq. and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act ("PHRA"), 43 P.S. § 955, et seq. in retaliation for making complaints and charges of discrimination by being "manipulated and lied to about work policies and procedures." Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶¶43, 53. Next, Plaintiff alleges that she was demoted and/or failed to be promoted in violation of the ADA and the PHRA because of her disability and race in retaliation for her prior complaints. Id. at ¶¶ 44-45; 54-55; 63-66. Next, Plaintiff alleges that she was paid less than her male counterparts because of her sex and/or gender in violation of the PHRA. Id. at ¶ 70. Plaintiff also alleges that she was denied a reasonable accommodation upon her return from worker's compensation leave and that the City abused the interactive process in violation of the ADA and PHRA. Id. at ¶¶ 77-79; 84-86.

B. Standard of Review
A failure to exhaust in Title VII cases is reviewed under a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard. See Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d 73, 87 (3d Cir. 1999) (explaining failure to exhaust administrative remedies is "in the nature of statutes of limitation" and is not jurisdictional). The characterization either of lack of exhaustion or of untimeliness as a jurisdictional bar is particularly inapt in Title VII cases, where the courts are permitted to equitably toll filing requirements in certain circumstances. Robinson v. Dalton, 107 F.3d 1018, 1021 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 482, 106 S. Ct. 2022, 90 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1986)).
The applicable inquiry under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is well-settled. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, a complaint must contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6) provides that a complaint may be dismissed for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A complaint that merely alleges entitlement [*7]  to relief, without alleging facts that show entitlement, must be dismissed. See Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2009). This "'does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,' but instead 'simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of' the necessary elements." Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). Nevertheless, the court need not accept as true "unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences," Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., 232 F.3d 173, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2000), or the plaintiff's "bald assertions" or "legal conclusions." Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997).
Although a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must provide more than labels and conclusions. Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A "formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Id. (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)). "Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level" and "sufficient to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Facial plausibility exists "when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).
The plausibility standard is not akin to a "probability requirement," but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant [*8]  has acted unlawfully. . . . Where a complaint pleads facts that are "merely consistent with" a defendant's liability, it "stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 'entitlement to relief.'"
Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556) (internal citations omitted).
When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court's role is limited to determining whether a plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence in support of his claims. See Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974). The court does not consider whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail. Id. A defendant bears the burden of establishing that a plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim. Gould Elecs. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169, 178 (3d Cir. 2000).
Courts generally consider the allegations of the complaint, attached exhibits, and matters of public record in deciding motions to dismiss. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). Factual allegations within documents described or identified in the complaint also may be considered if the plaintiff's claims are based upon those documents. Id. (citations omitted). In addition, a district court may consider indisputably authentic documents without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir. 2004); Lum v. Bank of America, 361 F.3d 217, 222 (3d Cir. 2004) (in resolving a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court generally can consider "the allegations in the complaint, exhibits attached to the [*9]  complaint, matters of public record, and documents that form the basis of a claim"). It is proper for the court to consider charges of discrimination filed with administrative agencies "either as undisputed documents referenced in the complaint, or as information which is a matter of public record, without converting [a motion to dismiss] into one of summary judgment." Rogan v. Giant Eagle, Inc., 113 F. Supp. 2d 777, 782 (W.D. Pa. 2000), aff'd, 276 F.3d 579 (3d Cir. 2001). The City attached numerous exhibits to its motion to dismiss which are comprised of Plaintiff's charges of discrimination that Plaintiff filed with administrative agencies against the City. These exhibits are not disputed by Plaintiff and are matters of public record and therefore are properly considered here without converting the present motion into one for summary judgment.

C. Discussion
The City seeks partial dismissal of Plaintiff's complaint and argues that (1) Plaintiff's inclusion of warnings and threats of disciplinary action in her Amended Complaint are not "materially adverse" to state a claim for retaliation, nor do warnings and threats constitute adverse employment action; (2) Plaintiff's PHRA claims stemming from Plaintiff's August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge have not been exhausted; (3) Plaintiff's ADA [*10]  and PHRA claims stemming from Plaintiff's April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge have not been exhausted; (4) Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her ADA and PHRA hostile work environment claims insofar as she alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based upon her disability or any other protected characteristic by being manipulated and lied to about work policies and procedures; (5) Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her PHRA sex and/or gender discrimination claim because no charge contains any references to pay disparity because of sex and/or gender; and (6) Plaintiff's federal discrimination and retaliation claims stemming from Plaintiff's April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge are untimely.
The City's arguments will be addressed seriatim.

1. "Materially Adverse" Employment Actions
The City argues that mere warnings and threats of disciplinary action without a change in the terms and conditions of plaintiff's employment are not "materially adverse" for purposes of a retaliation claim so as to constitute an adverse employment action, and seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's discrimination and retaliation claims "to the extent that they are based on verbal or written warnings or threats of disciplinary [*11]  action[.]" Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 7. Plaintiff responds that she alleges two materially adverse actions: (1) she was subject to a hostile work environment based on harassment immediately following her numerous reports of previously suspected discrimination when policies were disparately applied to her and (2) that her job duties and work locations were materially altered immediately following her numerous reports of previously suspected discrimination. Pl.'s Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 1. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the threats and warnings Plaintiff received did result in a material change to the terms and conditions of her employment. Id. at 2-4. The City replies it "is not claiming that all of Plaintiff's claims are based on threats and warnings, but to the extent that Plaintiff relies on them in support of her discrimination and retaliation claims, they must fail" because they are not an adverse employment action and are not materially adverse. Def.'s Reply [ECF No. 31] at 1. Additionally, the City replies that Plaintiff was not terminated, but that her position was eliminated. Id. at 2.
A disciplinary warning or threat of disciplinary action does not constitute adverse employment actions [*12]  unless it "effect[s] a material change in the terms or conditions of . . . employment." Mieczkowski v. York City Sch. Dist., 414 Fed. Appx. 441, 447 (3d Cir. 2011) (unpublished) (quoting Weston v. Pennsylvania, 251 F.3d 420 (3d Cir.2001)).
The City's argument should be rejected, because as pointed out by Plaintiff, she has adequately alleged that the threats and warnings she complains of were accompanied by material changes in the terms and conditions of her employment, i.e., her reassignment to a new position, the failure to promote her on multiple occasions, and her eventual termination. Therefore, greater factual development is required to determine to what extent those warnings or threats of disciplinary action resulted in disciplinary action. At this juncture, Plaintiff has adequately stated that she has suffered material adverse employment actions and her claims are not based upon threats and warnings alone. It is therefore respectfully recommended that the City's motion to dismiss be denied with respect to this argument.

2. Failure to Exhaust

a. August 31, 2015 Charge
The City states that Plaintiff never received a right-to-sue letter concerning Plaintiff's PHRA claims based on Plaintiff's August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge and, thus, argues that this Charge has not yet been exhausted. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] [*13]  at 7. Plaintiff responds that after a year of inaction, a plaintiff may bring an action regardless of having received the letter. Pl.'s Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 4. The City replies that there is no indication that Plaintiff exercised due diligence in pursuing the right-to-sue letter and its absence is due merely to the PHRC's oversight. Def.'s Reply [ECF No. 31] at 2.
A plaintiff seeking to bring a PHRA claim must exhaust all administrative remedies prior to bringing a claim. McIntosh v. White Horse Village, Inc., 176 F. Supp. 3d 480, 482 (E.D. Pa. 2016). "When administrative remedies are exhausted, the administrative agency, . . . must notify the complainant of this fact." Duncan v. Mitra QSR, 136 A.3d 1029, 2016 WL 128626, at *2 (Pa. Super. 2016) (unpublished). The administrative body forfeits its exclusive jurisdiction after one year, and after one year, plaintiff may bring her claim regardless of whether she has obtained a right-to-sue letter. 43 Pa. Const. Stat. § 962(c)(1); Jones v. Amerihealth Caritas, 95 F. Supp. 3d 807, 812 (E.D. Pa. 2015).
Plaintiff filed her Charge of Discrimination on August 31, 2015 and could initiate the present lawsuit by August 31, 2016 if she did not receive a right to sue letter prior to that time. [ECF Nos. 26, 28-1]. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint was filed on April 20, 2017 which included claims set forth in the August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge. [ECF No. 22]. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim was exhausted [*14]  when she filed her Amended Complaint, because under the statutory provisions, the PHRA forfeited its exclusive jurisdiction by failing to send Plaintiff a right to sue letter within one year. Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that Defendant's motion to dismiss be denied with respect to this argument.

b. April 7, 2017 Charge
The City argues that Plaintiff has not yet exhausted her administrative remedies as to her most recent April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge that was dual-filed with the PHRC in which she claimed that the City failed to accommodate her disability and terminated her discriminatorily for filing her earlier claims, because no right-to-sue letters have been issued by either administrative agency. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 8. The City also argues that because this is the first charge to reference an alleged termination, to the extent that any of the claims are based upon her termination, they must also be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Id. Plaintiff responds that a failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not preclude a court's subject matter jurisdiction and the April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge is within the scope of the previous three charges. [*15]  Pl.'s Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 6-7. Plaintiff argues that although the investigation of the April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge is still underway, the investigation may be completed before the commencement of the trial and the investigation of any of the prior three charges would have yielded the findings of discrimination alleged in the April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge. Id. at 7. The City replies it is impossible that the reasonable scope of the previous administrative investigations could have included the allegations contained in the April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge because the allegations set forth in that Charge occurred after the conclusion of any administrative investigation on her prior charges. Def.'s Reply [ECF No. 31] at 3.
The City is correct that Plaintiff's claim that the City failed to accommodate her disability and terminated her discriminatorily for filing earlier charges is premised upon conduct that occurred after her last exhausted Charge. The investigation for Plaintiff's prior charges was complete on June 6, 2016 when Plaintiff received Plaintiff received a Right to Sue letter. See EEOC Right to Sue Letter for Pl.'s August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge [ECF No. 28-2]. Plaintiff's claim that the City failed to accommodate [*16]  her disability and/or discriminatorily terminated her is premised upon conduct that occurred beginning in July of 2016. Thus, it is not reasonable that conduct that did not yet occur would fall within the scope of the prior administrative investigations. Prewitt v. Walgreens Co., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137027, 2012 WL 4364660, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 25, 2012) (unpublished); Riley v. Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89391, 2009 WL 3166279, at *3 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2009) (unpublished). Plaintiff does not contest that her claim is still pending. The time for the issuance of the right-to-sue letter has not yet expired and will not until April 7, 2018.
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not exhausted her administrative remedies for this claim, and it is respectfully recommended that Plaintiff's claims related to her April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge, i.e., her claim of retaliation based on her disability pursuant to the ADA, insofar as she relies on the April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge to support that claim, see Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶¶ 39-48 (referred to as "Count I" which incorporates her August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge), her claim of disability discrimination for failure to accommodate pursuant to the ADA, see Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶¶ 74-80 (referred to as "Count VIII"); and her claim of disability discrimination for failure to accommodate pursuant to the PHRA, see Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶¶ 81-87 [*17]  (referred to as "Count IX") be dismissed without prejudice for Plaintiff to seek leave to reinstate these claims following the completion of the administrative process, or April 7, 2018, whichever date is sooner.

c. Reasonable scope
The City next argues that Plaintiff's claims for hostile work environment and sex and/or gender discrimination were not exhausted because these issues were not specifically included in any of Plaintiff's administrative charges.
"A plaintiff 'must exhaust all required administrative remedies before bringing a claim for judicial relief.'" Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 163 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Robinson v. Dalton, 107 F.3d 1018, 1020 (3d Cir. 1997)). "'[T]he parameters of the civil action in the district court are defined by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination, including new acts which occurred during the pendency of proceedings before the [EEOC].'" Id. (quoting Ostapowicz v. Johnson Bronze Co., 541 F.2d 394, 398-99 (3d Cir. 1976)) (alterations in original). "A plaintiff's claim must thus fall 'fairly within the scope of the prior EEOC complaint, or the investigation arising therefrom.'" Id. (quoting Antol v. Perry, 82 F.3d 1291, 1295 (3d Cir. 1996)). A plaintiff is not necessarily required to file a new administrative complaint each time an act the plaintiff believes to be discriminatory occurs. Vay v. Huston, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174045, 2016 WL 7324596, at *9 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 16, 2016) (unpublished). [*18]  When determining whether a claim is administratively exhausted, the question is whether it can "reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination." Griggs v. SEPTA, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95245, 2015 WL 4476772, at *3 (E.D. Pa. July 22, 2015) (unpublished).

i. ADA/PHRA Hostile Work Environment Claim
The City asserts that nowhere in any of her four charges does Plaintiff allege that she has been subjected to a hostile work environment based on disability or any other protected class characteristic by being "manipulated and lied to about work policies and procedures" as she claims in the complaint. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 10. As a result, the City argues that it did not have proper notice of this claim and none of the administrative agencies could reasonably have been expected to investigate this claim. Id. Additionally, the City asserts that although Plaintiff mentioned harassment for "not doing work" in Plaintiff's August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge, Plaintiff did not make any reference to being manipulated and lied to regarding work policies and procedures in this Charge. Id. Plaintiff responds that the City's argument is better suited for a motion for summary judgment; Plaintiff made claims regarding her disability in two of her charges claiming that the City failed [*19]  to accommodate her disability, she was harassed by her boss, she was assigned new duties because of her race and disability, and referred to several retaliation incidents such that a reasonable investigation would lead to a finding that the above claims constituted a hostile work environment based on her disability. Pl. Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 7-9. The City did not file a reply to Plaintiff's response as to this issue.
In the instant matter, the City's focus is on whether being "manipulated and lied to about work policies and procedures" as set forth in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is within the reasonable scope of the EEOC's investigations. Plaintiff's August 31, 2015 EEOC Charge suggests that Supervisor Ashbaugh was "out to get" Plaintiff. A reasonable investigation into that allegation could yield evidence as to whether Plaintiff was "manipulated and lied to about work policies and procedures." Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that the City's motion to dismiss be denied with respect to this argument.

ii. PHRA Sex and/or Gender Discrimination Claim.
The City argues that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her sex and/or gender discrimination claim pursuant to the PHRA, see Am. [*20]  Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶¶ 68-73 (referred to as "Count VII"), because that cause of action refers solely to pay disparity and the corresponding September 29, 2014 PHRC Charge upon which the cause of action stems from does not reference pay disparity due to sex and/or gender. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 10. The City further argues that the reasonable scope of the PHRC's investigation could not have included investigation of sex and/or gender based pay disparity because Plaintiff's charge only stated that she was not promoted due to sex and gender. Id. at 10-11. Plaintiff responds that a reasonable investigation into Plaintiff's September 29, 2014 PHRC Charge, which alleges that Plaintiff was not promoted based on her gender and/or sex would have yielded facts revealing that pay disparities between male and female employees existed. Pl.'s Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 9. The City replies that when a complainant claims that she was not promoted, there would be no reason for an investigation to be launched into the broader topic of pay disparity between male and female employees. Def.'s Reply [ECF No. 31] at 3. The City argues that a reasonable investigation would be limited to all of the qualifications [*21]  necessary for a specific position as compared to the qualifications of the applicants to see whether the person who received the promotion was better-qualified for the position or if there was some reason to believe that the complainant did not receive the promotion due to her sex. Id. at 3-4.
In reviewing Plaintiff's September 29, 2014 PHRC Charge, it is not reasonable to expect that the EEOC's investigation would encompass an investigation into the salary disparities that Plaintiff alleges in her Amended Complaint. This PHRC Charge relates only to Plaintiff's failure to be promoted and does not reference that she was "paid $25,000 less per year than similarly situated male counterparts" as she alleges in her Amended Complaint. Confusingly, however, Plaintiff did in fact complain about pay disparity in her April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge. But because the plain reading of Plaintiff's complaint indicates that Count VII stems solely from her September 29, 2014 PHRC Charge and makes no reference to her April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge, and she did not argue in her response that a fair reading of the entire complaint shows that she exhausted her pay disparity claim, this argument will not be addressed. It is [*22]  therefore respectfully recommended that Count VII of Plaintiff's complaint be dismissed without prejudice for Plaintiff to seek leave to amend include references to the properly exhausted Charge.

5. Federal Retaliation Claims pertaining to ¶¶ 6-10 of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint.
The City asserts that all of Plaintiff's federal discrimination or retaliation claims premised upon Plaintiff's April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge are untimely. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 11. The City seeks dismissal of any federal claims related to (1) a 2013 Office of Municipal Investigations ("OMI") complaint that Plaintiff's co-workers were harassing her, Am. Compl. [ECF No. 22] at ¶ 6; (2) a written reprimand for leaving work early which occurred "shortly" after her OMI complaint, whereas a Caucasian colleague who had falsified information was not disciplined, Id. at ¶¶ 7-8; (3) pay disparity based upon sex and/or gender, Id. at ¶ 9; and (4) a failure to promote to "a number of positions" based upon Plaintiff's sex and/or gender. Id. at ¶ 10. The EEOC issued a right to sue letter on February 2, 2016, giving Plaintiff until May 2, 2016 to bring any federal claims based upon her April 9, 2015 Charge, which she failed [*23]  to do. Def.'s Br. [ECF No. 26] at 11. In response, Plaintiff implies that she is not asserting any federal discrimination claims with respect to her April 9, 2015 EEOC Charge. Pl.'s Op. Br. [ECF No. 30] at 9-10.
The City's grounds for dismissal seemingly seeks dismissal of claims that are not included in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. To be clear, Plaintiff asserts two federal claims: (1) retaliation under the ADA and (2) a failure to accommodate claim under the ADA. A plain reading of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint indicates that Plaintiff does not assert any federal claims with regard to her allegations that she was subjected to discrimination based upon her race, sex and/or gender; her sex and/or gender discrimination and race discrimination claims are brought pursuant to the PHRA. Rather, all of Plaintiff's federal claims are made pursuant to the ADA and are based upon allegations that she was discriminated against because of her disability. Accordingly, the City's argument that any federal claims arising out of discrimination based upon Plaintiff's race, gender and/or sex should be dismissed as not ripe, and it is respectfully recommended that the City's motion to dismiss be denied [*24]  in this respect.7

D. Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully recommended that defendant's motion for partial dismissal [ECF No. 25] be granted in part and denied in part.
Specifically, it is respectfully recommended that
(1) the City's motion to dismiss be granted as to Plaintiff's claims at Count I, Count VIII and Count IX relating to her April 7, 2017 EEOC Charge and that these claims be dismissed without prejudice for Plaintiff to seek leave to reinstate these claims following the completion of the administrative process;
(2) the City's motion to dismiss be granted as to Plaintiff's claim of pay disparity at Count VII of her Amended Complaint, and this claim be dismissed without prejudice for Plaintiff to seek leave to amend to include references to the properly exhausted Charge; and
(3) the City's motion be denied in all other respects.
Therefore, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B)-(C), Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, and the Local Rules for Magistrates, the parties have until December 11, 2017 to file objections to this report and recommendation. Unless Ordered otherwise by the District Judge, responses to objections are due December 18, 2017. See LCvR 72.C. Failure to file timely objections may constitute a waiver of any appellate [*25]  rights. Brightwell v. Lehman, 637 F.3d 187, 193 n.7 (3d Cir. 2011).
